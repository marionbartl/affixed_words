A confidential memo questioning Senator Barack Obama ’s potential approach to Middle East policy was circulated earlier this month among staffers at a major American Jewish organization .
In one section , the memo said that Obama ’s approach to Iran ’s nuclear program “ raises questions , ” while another portion suggested that Obama expected more from Israel than the Palestinians in resolving the conflict between the two .
The memo , a copy of which was given to the Forward , was written by Debra Feuer , a counsel for the American Jewish Committee , and also contained a discussion of the Republican winner in the Iowa caucuses , Mike Huckabee .
After receiving questions from the Forward about the memo , top officials at the American Jewish Committee sent a letter to the Obama campaign on Sunday stating that “ no element ” of the letter “ should be considered a position of the American Jewish Committee ” and expressing “ regret ” that it became public .
The memo comes to light less than three weeks before February 5 , when the vast majority of the country ’s Jewish Democrats will vote in primary elections , including ones in New York , New Jersey and California .
As that date approaches , Obama has found himself at the center of a public debate about his personal associations , background and commitment to Israel .
Earlier this week , the Chicago lawmaker responded to revived concerns about links between Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and his pastor in Chicago , even as a number of Jewish senators and major Jewish organizations — including the American Jewish Committee — publicly denounced an email campaign spreading false accusations that he is secretly a Muslim .
The editorial page of the staunchly conservative New York Sun newspaper recently defended the senator ’s commitment to Israel .
However , the memo circulated at the American Jewish Committee betrays a quiet unease about Obama ’s potential Middle East strategy that still lingers in some pockets of the Jewish community .
Feuer , the AJCommittee ’s counsel for special projects , includes a number of statements Obama has made in support of Israel and against a nuclear Iran , but she questions Obama ’s approach to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict and emphasis on diplomatic engagement .
Obama “ appears to believe the Israelis bear the burden of taking the risky steps for peace , and that the violence Israel has received in return does not shift that burden , ” Feuer writes .
She added that Obama ’s approach to the Palestinian government “ contrasts with the three conditions that the international community has laid down for the resumption of aid , ” including acting to stop terrorism and accepting the right of Israel to exist .
The memo also expresses concern about Obama ’s potential approach to dealing with Iran , in the wake of a new National Intelligence Estimate , released in November 2007 , which judged that the country had halted its alleged nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
“ The Senator ’s interpretation of the NIE raises questions , ” wrote Feuer , without elaborating further .
She went on to list a half - dozen statements the Illinois lawmaker has made in support of renewed diplomacy with Iran , and note that “ he also calls for negotiating with other rogue states , notably Syria . ”
Under a section titled “ Of Further Note , ” Feuer takes note of Obama ’s presence at a fundraiser headlined by the late Edward Said in 1998 , and public suggestions by Ali Abunimah , a Chicago - based Palestinian activist , that Obama was more openly critical of the America ’s approach to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict before his first run for Senate .
The memo also includes several pages of statements by Huckabee on Middle East issues , but without editorial comment , except to note the Huckabee “ inexplicably ” said he had not seen the NIE when first asked about it by reporters on December 4 .
Under a section titled “ Of Further Note ” about Huckabee , Feuer states his campaign is “ overtly Christian ” and details a half - dozen comments and commercials referencing his faith .
In a statement issued in response to questions from the Forward , the AJCommittee said that the memo “ was an internal document prepared by a staffer of AJC ’s Washington office the day after the Iowa caucuses . ”
“ We regret the fact it has been circulated , as it was for AJC purposes only , ” the statement said .
“ Its only intention , however expressed by the writer , was to try and help the agency better understand the winners ’ positions on certain public policy issues concerning the agency . ”
In the letter sent to the Obama campaign on Sunday , the president and executive director of the AJCommittee wrote that they “ regret any inaccuracies that the memorandum , prepared from open sources on a tight deadline immediately after the caucuses – and never intended for publication – might have contained . ”
“ We would welcome further information from your campaign that would allow us to correct any errors you and your campaign might have discovered in this staff document , ” the letter from Richard Sideman and David Harris said .
The Obama campaign did not respond to a request for comment .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Home prices continued their plunge during the last three months of 2007 , setting a real estate trade group 's record for the biggest - ever quarterly drop .
The national median price drop of 5.8 % , to $ 206,200 from $ 219,300 , was the steepest ever recorded by the National Association of Realtors ( NAR ) , which has been compiling the report since 1979 .
NAR officials blamed the liquidity squeeze that began last summer for much of the drop .
Home buyers had trouble obtaining mortgage financing , especially for more expensive properties .
" The continuing crunch in the jumbo loan market that began in August has disproportionately reduced the number of transactions in higher price ranges , " said Lawrence Yun , NAR 's chief economist , in a statement .
Fewer expensive homes were sold , bringing down median prices .
" California , south Florida , D.C. , many of the high - cost markets are reflecting that , " said Walter Molony , a spokesman for NAR .
Each of the four U.S. regions recorded losses compared with the fourth quarter of 2006 .
The West took the worst hit , at 8.7 % .
Prices dropped 4.8 % in the Northeast , 5.4 % in the South and 3.2 % in the Midwest .
In Lansing , Mich. , square in the Midwest Rust Belt , prices plunged 18.8 % to $ 109,600 .
In Sacramento , Calif. , prices fell 18.5 % to $ 197,600 , and in both Jackson , Miss and Riverside , Calif . prices dropped 16.8 % .
Seventy - three of the nation 's 151 real estate markets recorded price gains .
Cumberland , Md. , led the winners with an increase of 19 % to $ 116,600 .
The least expensive single - family - home market in the nation got even cheaper , as prices in Youngstown , Ohio , dropped 9.3 % to $ 72,600 .
The most expensive market , San Jose , Calif. , got dearer , with prices up 11.2 % to $ 845,300 .
Condo prices fared better .
The fourth - quarter median condo price of $ 221,100 was little changed from the $ 221,200 a year earlier .
But some areas , mostly Sun Belt cities , took significant price hits .
Cape Coral , Fla. , condo prices were down 26 % compared with the last three months of 2006 to $ 202,300 , and Tucson , Ariz . , prices dropped 19.8 % to $ 128,000 .
Atlanta prices fell 12 % to $ 141,100 , and Las Vegas was off 10.3 % to $ 178,500 .
Bismarck , N.D. , condo prices recorded the largest gain at 20.8 % to $ 125,000 , with New Orleans second at a 17.8 % gain to $ 173,300 .
Last year , fourth - quarter home prices were 2.7 % lower from the year before .
" The healthiest housing markets today generally are moderately priced and are experiencing job growth and often population growth , which in turn is supporting strong price growth , " said NAR 's Yun .
" Most of the weakest markets have either experienced both job and population losses , or they are experiencing corrections following a prolonged period of rapid price growth . "
Many markets have also been affected by soaring foreclosure rates .
Large numbers of houses for sale , many repossessed from borrowers , sit empty , depressing prices in cities from coast to coast - but most notably in economically distressed Midwest industrial towns and some once - booming Sun Belt cities .
NAR numbers are arrived at by examining the prices of all homes sold during the period .
The median price is the one in which half of all homes sold for more and half for less .
Using median prices rather than mean - or average - prices reduces the impact of the sale of very expensive homes , which would raise mean prices disproportionately .
The NAR take on price trends , usually an optimistic one , was that recent steps taken in Washington would lead to improved conditions later this year .
" Higher limits for FHA loans , which go into effect March 14 , will be a big help to first - time buyers in high - cost markets , " said NAR President Richard Gaylord .
" Higher limits for conventional loans purchased by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae will take a bit longer , " he said .
" When they become available , high - income , creditworthy borrowers in high - cost areas will have access to affordable and safer financing , and that will help unleash pent - up demand . "
But other industry insiders are predicting harder times ahead .
A Merrill Lynch report in January forecast peak - to - trough price declines of 15 % in 2008 and another 10 % in 2009 before markets begin to recover .

Somalia is again polio- free
10 000 health workers stop polio virus through immunization
25 March 2008 | Geneva - Somalia is again polio - free , the Global Polio Eradication Initiative ( GPEI ) announced today , calling it a ' historic achievement ' in public health .
Somalia has not reported a case since 25 March 2007 , a major landmark in the intensified eradication effort launched last year to wipe out the disease in the remaining few strongholds .
Against a backdrop of widespread conflict , large population movements and a dearth of functioning government infrastructure , transmission of poliovirus in the country has been successfully stopped .
This landmark victory is a result of the efforts of more than 10 000 Somali volunteers and health workers who repeatedly vaccinated more than 1.8 million children under the age of five by visiting every household in every settlement multiple times , across a country ranked one of the most dangerous places on earth .
The use of innovative approaches tailored to conflict areas was pivotal in stopping polio in the country .
These included increased community involvement and the effective use of monovalent vaccines to immunize children in insecure areas with several doses within a short period of time .
" This truly historic achievement shows that polio can be eradicated everywhere , even in the most challenging and difficult settings , " said Dr Hussein A Gezairy , Regional Director for the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean .
Polio , which can cause lifelong paralysis , has been stopped nearly everywhere in the world following a 20 - year concerted international effort .
Only four polio - endemic countries remain – Afghanistan , India , Nigeria and Pakistan – and the eradication of polio globally now depends primarily on stopping the disease in these countries .
Poliovirus travels easily and , in the world of modern travel , can cover long distances .
Until transmission of the virus has been interrupted in the four remaining endemic countries , the risk to the rest of the world remains high .
Somalia , which had already eradicated the disease in 2002 , became re-infected in 2005 by poliovirus originating in Nigeria .
This repeated success in Somalia indicates the disease can be stopped even in areas with no functioning central government .
“ Somalia beat polio in the midst of more widespread conflict and poverty than that affecting Afghanistan and Pakistan , ” according to Dr Maritel Costales , Senior Health Advisor , UNICEF New York .
He cites insecurity and large population movements in those countries as challenges to reaching all children with vaccine .
“ But Somalia shows that when communities are engaged , children everywhere can be reached . ”
Afghanistan and Pakistan could be the first of the remaining endemic countries to stop polio ; between them they account for 5 % of all cases of polio in 2007 .
Consistent financial commitment continues to be crucial to completing polio eradication .
The global effort currently faces a shortage of US $ 525 million for 2008 - 2009 , funding urgently needed to fight the disease in the remaining endemic areas and protect children in high - risk polio - free areas .
Rotary International , the top private sector contributor and volunteer arm of the GPEI , has contributed US $ 9.2 million for polio eradication in Somalia , and US $ 700 million worldwide since 1985 .
“ Somalia clearly shows that the tailored tools and tactics of the intensified eradication effort are working , ” commented Mohamed Benmejdoub , Chair of Rotary 's Eastern Mediterranean PolioPlus Committee .
“ A polio - free world is a feasible public health goal and a global public good .
I urge governments across the world – and in particular the G8 countries – to rapidly make available the necessary resources .
Together , we can ensure that no child need ever again suffer the terrible pain of lifelong polio - paralysis . ”
The GPEI is spearheaded by national governments , WHO , Rotary International , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and UNICEF .
Since 1988 , the incidence of polio has been reduced by more than 99 % .
At the time , more than 350 000 children were paralysed every year , in more than 125 endemic countries .
Today , four countries remain which have never stopped endemic transmission of polio : Afghanistan , India , Nigeria and Pakistan .
In 2007 , 1308 cases have been reported worldwide ( data as on 18 March 2008 ) .
One of the 10 000 Somali volunteers and health workers is Ali Mao Moallim , who – more than 30 years ago on 26 October 1977 – became the last person on earth to contract smallpox .
Over the past few years , working with WHO , he has travelled extensively throughout Somalia to immunize children against polio and foster community engagement during immunization campaigns .
" Somalia was the last country with smallpox .
I wanted to help ensure that we would not be the last place with polio too , " he said .
Somalia 's last case of indigenous polio was in 2002 .
On 12 July 2005 , the country was re-infected by poliovirus originating in Nigeria , resulting in an outbreak of 228 cases in total .
Systematic and widescale outbreak response activities , including intensive community engagement , successfully stopped the epidemic , and the last case was reported on 25 March 2007 in Mudug Province , in central Somalia .

Nouvelles photos pour le magazine GQ déjà disponible en Grande - Bretagne ( édition d'avril 2008 )
Le magazine britannique GQ publie des photos dénudées de Carla Sarközy , quelques jours avant la visite du couple présidentiel à la reine Elizabeth .
Parmi ceux - ci , le cliché de Carla Bruni , posant nue avec des cuissardes , déjà vu dans le magazine espagnol DT , en février 2008 .
A la veille de la visite officielle de Nicolas Sarközy et de Carla Bruni à la reine Elizabeth d'Angleterre , du 26 au 28 mars , l'édition britannique du magazine masculin GQ ( Gentlemen 's Quaterly ) publie trois photos suggestives de la Première dame de France dans son édition d'avril .
Disponible dès aujourd ' hui au Royaumme - Uni , ce magazine permet aux Britanniques de retrouver Carla Bruni , alanguie sur des coussins de cuir , parée de sa seule beauté , si ce n'est ces fameuses cuissardes qui ont défrayé la chronique , lors de la parution du dit cliché dans l'édition de février dernier du magazine espagnol DT .
Sur deux autres clichés , ( également pris avant que Carla Bruni n'épouse Nicolas Sarközy et n'accède au rang de " Première dame de France " ? ) , le mannequin pose le buste nu , un bras recouvrant pudiquement ses courbes .
Sur l'autre photo , une veste Chanel et de longs colliers rhabillent le haut de sa silhouette , tandis que le bas se dévoile , de manière suggestive .
Contactée par LCI.fr , la rédaction de l'édition britannique du magazine GQ confirme que les clichés ont été pris l'année dernière et sont signés par Inez Van Lamsweerde et Vinoodh Matadin , couple de photographes néerlandais ayant prêté son talent aux plus grandes marques internationales .
( LCI. fr - 7 mars 08 )
Carla Bruni-Sarközy avait défrayé la chronique à la fin du mois de janvier quand des photos d’elle , nue , avaient été publiées par le magazine
espagnol DT .
Si la jeune femme s’était défendue en affirmant que les photos avaient été réalisées avant l’officialisation de sa relation avec le Président de la République française Nicolas Sarközy , il n’en va pas de même pour les nouveaux clichés qui font scandale .
C’est dans l’édition anglo - américaine du magazine GQ que seront publiés les photos en question au mois d’avril .
Sur l’une d’elles , on y voit Carla Bruni topless , cachant ses seins avec une main .
Sur une autre photo , la première dame de France pose de manière très sexy .
Et le magazine de légender : « La preuve , s’il fallait le prouver , que le pouvoir est l'aphrodisiaque ultime : " Regardez Carla Bruni -Sarkozy , la phénoménale amoureuse du président français .
Fais de même , Laura Bush ! " .
D’autres médias américains sont cependant choqués par ces photos .
Ainsi le site de news du showbiz , Egotastic écrit à ce sujet : « Pouvez - vous imaginer comment cela aurait été si Hillary Clinton avait posé nue alors qu’elle était la première dame des États - Unis ?
Ou , pire encore , si elle posait nue maintenant ?
D'un autre côté , il ne vaut mieux pas essayer de s’imaginer Hillary Clinton nue !
Évidemment Carla Bruni est super ‘ hot ’ et en ce qui me concerne elle peut à tout moment se montrer nue , mais l'épouse du Président de la France n’est - elle pas supposée faire preuve de retenue sur ce genre de pratiques ? »

Two students attending Eagan and Apple Valley high schools were expelled last week after buying souvenir swords during a spring break choir trip in the United Kingdom .
A chaperone found the duct - taped boxes that held the swords after the students left the store .
The swords were confiscated on the trip and never made it to Minnesota .
The students flew home several days early , and the district disciplined the students when they returned .
“ The severity of the punishment did n’t fit the crime here , ” said Brad Briggs , 45 , an Eagan resident and father of one of the expelled teens .
“ There was no intent of violence . ”
Briggs spoke at a Rosemount - Apple Valley - Eagan School Board meeting after his son , a 16 - year - old sophomore at Eagan High School , was kicked out of classes for the remainder of the school year after buying a $ 60 set of three samurai swords in York , England .
The district stuck to its student safety policy and doled out an expulsion that allows Briggs ’ son to return to school in the fall .
The other student , a senior , was expelled from the School of Environmental Studies in Apple Valley for the remainder of the school year .
At first , she was not going to be allowed to participate in graduation ceremonies .
However , after negotiations , school officials agreed to let her graduate with her class .
She had bought an 18 - inch sword that was a “ Lord of the Rings ” replica for Father ’s Day , said her father , Dennis Fischbach .
School districts have grown increasingly vigilant in enforcing student safety policies in the wake of high - profile cases of violence in schools , educators and school officials said .
But others — from parents to lawmakers — wonder if the rules go too far at times , with the policies creating unintended consequences .
Briggs said school board members made it clear that student safety is a priority when they approved the expulsion .
He just wishes his son — a choir member , Sunday school teacher and Boy Scout leader — could finish the school year with his classmates .
“ What got him in trouble was being lost in the moment and buying a cool souvenir for his room , ” said Briggs , at the April 14 board meeting as he tried to control his tears .
Briggs and Fischbach agreed to interviews with the Pioneer Press on the condition their children ’s names be withheld from this story .
The district said it could not discuss the names of the students or details of the expulsions because of privacy laws .
“ We never expected to be expelled , ” Briggs ’ son said .
“ We ’re not the sort of students that people would expect to do something like this . ”
“ It was n’t like he was buying an M - 16 , ” the father said .
The Briggs family is thankful their son was not expelled for the maximum full school year and can return to the district .
The students , who are completing their classes with the help of an assigned teacher , said although they disagreed with the decision , they understood why the school handed out the expulsions .
Superintendent John Currie said the district uses its best judgment on a case - by - case basis .
“ We make the best decision we can to protect the safety of everybody involved , ” he said .
Charlie Kyte , executive director of the Minnesota Association of School Administrators , went through a similar situation when he was superintendent in Northfield , Minn .
“ Schools are in a real Catch - 22 , ” he said .
A popular student once brought a toy gun to the high school , and Kyte had to expel him .
“ Had I let him off the hook , the signal would ’ve gone to students that we did n’t care about the policy , ” Kyte said .
A fourth - grader from an Asian immigrant family once brought a big knife , without his parents knowing , for a show - and - tell activity at school because the knife was important in the family , Kyte said .
The student was suspended , he said .
Safety policies vary from district to district , as well as state to state .
Some choose a zero - tolerance rule , while others have a “ no - tolerance ” policy that gives school officials more discretion in discipline .
For the Eagan district , the state ’s fourth - largest , having a consistent policy is likely more important because of the large student population , Kyte said .
But the problem with zero tolerance is too many students who simply make a mistake and do not intend to harm anyone get punished , said attorney Amy Goetz , who founded the St. Paul - based School Law Center .
She said Minnesota law is vague and lacks a consistent standard , which can lead to students being punished excessively .
“ Most parents do n’t know how easy it is for their children to be ousted from schools , ” Goetz said .
Mike Roseen , chairman of the Rosemount - Apple Valley - Eagan School Board , said district officials take expulsions seriously .
“ The process is fair , and the process is equitable , ” Roseen said .
“ And if someone gets caught up in something where they made a mistake , I ’m sorry about that .
There ’s a policy we ’re going to go by . ”

Guys , you may think you know what you want in a wife -- Is she hot ?
Is she smart ?
Is she funny ?
I can tell you from 18 years of marriage , this is what you really want in a wife :
To this day you can even hear some adults repeating these " amazing " historical tales that , years ago , somebody just pulled out of their ass :
High school was hard enough , what with all the video games and boobies to distract us from our homework .
What makes it even harder is having to unlearn all of the stuff they taught us in elementary school that turned out to be utter bullshit .
5 Columbus Discovered the Earth is Round
The story we heard :
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
In 1492 , an Italian ponce by the name of Christopher Columbus won his long - standing feud with the monarchy and the Catholic church to get funding for a voyage to East Asia .
They were afraid that he would fail spectacularly , because everybody knew that the Earth was a flat disc , and the direction Columbus was sailing in would cause him to fall off the edge and into the mouth of the giant turtle that supported it .
Columbus , as we were told , did fail to reach his destination , but not because the world was flat -- it was because he crashed into the future greatest nation on Earth , baby !
Thus , Columbus proved the world was round , discovered America , and a national holiday was born .

The truth :
In the 1400s , the flat - earth theory was taken about as seriously as the Time Cube theory is today , if not less so .
The shape of the world has been pretty much settled since the orb theory was first proposed by the ancient Greek philosopher Pythagoras , around 2,000 years before the existence of Spain .
In fact , the navigational techniques of Columbus ' time were actually based on the fact that the Earth was a sphere .
Trying to navigate the globe as if it was a flat plane would have fucked up the trip even more than it was .

Artists ' representation
The Spanish government 's reluctance to pay for Columbus ' expeditions did n't have anything to do with their misconceptions about the shape of the world .
Ironically , it was because Columbus himself severely underestimated the size of the Earth and everybody knew it .
The distance he planned to travel would n't have taken him anywhere near Asia .
Nevertheless , he eventually scraped together enough funds to embark on his ridiculous adventure , and the clusterfuck that was the Columbus voyage has been celebrated annually in the Americas and in Spain ever since .
So where did the myth come from ?
It began with author and historical charlatan Washington Irving , who wrote a novel about Columbus in 1838 .
The novel was fiction , but some elements managed to creep into our history textbooks anyway , probably by some editors who wanted to spice it up a bit .
Who 's going to read a history book that 's just filled with a bunch of boring shit anyway ?
For those of us who have been writing critically about John McCain over the years , keeping tabs on the 2008 presidential campaign through the media is a bit like getting your war news via Saddam Hussein ’s old information minister :
The street names may be right , but the big picture looks funny .
“ No other modern politician has received as much favorable press as John McCain has in the past decade , ” write ( plainly irritated ) David Brock and Paul Waldman in “ Free Ride : John McCain and the Media . ”
“ The rules are simply different for McCain . ”
Boy , are they .
Though he flip - flops and prevaricates like any politician , McCain all but has the phrase “ straight talker ” tattooed on his skull - plate .
A lifetime Beltway insider and third - generation naval officer with an heiress wife and an heiress mother is still referred to , without irony , as a “ Man of the People . ”
And though his heavily interventionist governing philosophy , both at home and abroad , is spelled out in his five easy - to - find books , he continues to receive mash notes from newspapers like the Des Moines Register for being a man who , because “ he knows war , ” would be “ reluctant to start one . ”
Such funhouse - mirror distortions are more than just giggle - worthy .
Partly because of his reliably sympathetic portrayal in the media , McCain – who was advocating pre-emptive war against “ rogue states ” four years before it ever occurred to George W. Bush – nonetheless won by ratios of two to one among GOP primary voters who described themselves as “ anti-war . ”
So if nothing else , “ Free Ride ” comes as a necessary corrective .
Lefty partisan co-authors Brock and Waldman work for Media Matters for America , a “ progressive ” nonprofit “ dedicated to comprehensively monitoring , analyzing and correcting conservative misinformation in the U.S. media . ”
Therein lies the book ’s strength and weakness .
There ’s nothing like a bit of the old political bile – especially when it pays !
– to focus the mind and support staff on cataloguing the sins of the other team while bashing the media for failing to notice .
Thus the authors upbraid Beltway journalists for failing to recognize that “ McCain has an act , and not having an act is his act . ”
When the candidate bashed President Bush ’s Iraq policy in 2007 , ageless Washington Post columnist David Broder pronounced that “ candor , even belatedly , becomes him . ”
When his campaign stumbled over immigration that spring , Newsweek was there to solemnly proclaim that “ it may be because he is not , at heart , a politician .
He is a warrior . ”
How did a Republican end up charming the liberal press ?
Brock and Waldman rightly point out three reasons : McCain ’s heroic war record , his “ anti-politician ” support for campaign finance reform and the copious amounts of access he has consciously given national reporters for the past two decades .
“ The McCain - Feingold bill in particular , ” they write , “ became a vessel into which the press could pour all of its disgust with the practice of politics . ”
But media criticism works best when new interpretive light is shined on the subject being mis-covered .
And it ’s here that the authors ’ partisan agenda and ideology get the worst of them .
They argue , improbably , that McCain has always been a “ staunch ” and “ reliable conservative , ” in the tradition of Barry Goldwater .
In fact , McCain ’s famous regulatory zeal on the Senate Commerce Committee – meddling into the affairs of amateur athletes , Hollywood marketers and tobacco companies – has been the opposite of Goldwater ’s principled libertarianism , and indeed the younger maverick never did understand why the man he replaced in the Senate failed to fully embrace him .
And what about McCain ’s furious tack to the left from 1999 to 2003 , when he opposed Bush tax cuts on class warfare grounds , co-sponsored a patients ’ bill of rights , and voted to federalize airport security , all while trumpeting the career of trust - buster Teddy Roosevelt and flirting openly with defecting to the Democrats ?
“ A few well - chosen breaks , ” they claim .
Well OK then .
Lacking any ability or willingness to analyze McCain ’s peculiar strain of National Greatness Conservatism , Brock and Waldman fill the pages by exaggerating the extent to which McCain is handled with kid gloves ( The New York Times in particular has been disproving that notion almost every day ) ; complaining about journalists referencing his Vietnam imprisonment , and relying on such crude measuring sticks as the voting scorecards of activist groups .
The results correct some myths , but erect new ones in their place .

A Russian man believed to be one of the world 's leading illegal arms dealers was arrested in Thailand today on suspicion of supplying weapons to a Colombian rebel group .
Viktor Bout , who has been accused by both the UN and Amnesty International of flouting arms embargos , was arrested at a five - star hotel in central Bangkok after a Thai court issued an arrest warrant , said Lieutenant General Pongpat Chayapan , of Thailand 's police .
According to Thai officials , the warrant was based on an earlier one issued by the US drug enforcement administration .
A US embassy spokesman congratulated Thailand on the arrest but gave no further details .
Bout made no comment as he was paraded before the media at the Bangkok police headquarters .
Officers had been pursuing him for months .
The 41 - year - old former Russian KGB officer allegedly sold armaments to anyone with the cash to pay , including forces in the Taliban and various warring sides in more than a dozen African countries .
Russia will seek Bout 's extradition , according to one official in Moscow quoted by the RIA Novosti news agency .
Bout is already subject to an international arrest warrant originating from Belgium .
According to UN reports ,
Bout 's arms smuggling network included more than 50 aircraft around the world .
His activities were chronicled in a book , Merchant of Death , published last year by two US investigative journalists .
Bout was also the reported inspiration for a 2005 film , Lord of War , in which Nicholas Cage played a cynical arms dealer .
The book about Bout claimed that planes from the arms dealer 's fleet made several airdrops of weapons to Farc guerrillas between December 1998 and April 1999 .
Colonel Petcharat Sengchai , another Thai police officer , told reporters Bout had been wanted on charges of " procuring weapons and explosives for Colombian rebels " , namely the Revolutionary Armed Forced of Colombia , or Farc .
This week Farc has been at the centre of Latin America 's most serious international crisis for years , with Ecuador and Venezuela breaking diplomatic ties with Colombia and deploying troops to border regions .
The crisis began on Saturday when a Colombian air raid killed more than 20 Farc rebels , including a senior leader , at a base just inside Ecuadorean territory .
Colombia , which has battled the Marxist group for more than 40 years , hit back at criticism from its neighbours by claiming computer files seized from the Farc base showed Ecuador and Venezuela colluded closely with the group .
Although Bout has been investigated by police in several countries , he has never been prosecuted for arms dealing .
A 2005 report by Amnesty International alleged Bout was " the most prominent foreign businessman " involved in trafficking arms to UN - embargoed destinations from Bulgaria , Slovakia , Ukraine , Kyrgyzstan and other countries .
The same year , the US treasury department named 30 companies and four people it said were connected to Bout 's operations , placing them under sanction .
In October 2006 , President George Bush issued an executive order freezing assets belonging to Bout and several associates , and barring Americans from doing business with them .
According to a US treasury department statement on Bout 's activities , he built up his arms empire after the collapse of the Soviet Union , acquiring a fleet of surplus or obsolete planes .
" Today , Bout has the capacity to transport tanks , helicopters and weapons by the tonnes to virtually any point in the world , " the statement said .
" The arms he has sold or brokered has helped fuel conflicts and support UN sanctioned regimes in Afghanistan , Angola , the Democratic Republic of Congo , Liberia , Rwanda , Sierra Leone and Sudan . "
The US government claims he made a $ 50 m ( £ 25 m ) profit supplying military equipment to the Taliban in Afghanistan before the regime was overthrown .
The Federal Reserve ’s unusual decision to provide emergency assistance to Bear Stearns underscores a long - building concern that one failure could spread across the financial system .
Wall Street firms like Bear Stearns conduct business with many individuals , corporations , financial companies , pension funds and hedge funds .
They also do billions of dollars of business with each other every day , borrowing and lending securities at a dizzying pace and fueling the wheels of capitalism .
The sudden collapse of a major player could not only shake client confidence in the entire system , but also make it difficult for sound institutions to conduct business as usual .
Hedge funds that rely on Bear to finance their trading and hold their securities would be stranded ; investors who wrote financial contracts with Bear would be at risk ; markets that depended on Bear to buy and sell securities would screech to a halt , if they were not already halted .
“ In a trading firm , trust is everything , ” said Richard Sylla , a financial historian at New York University .
“ The person at the other end of the phone or the trading screen has to believe that you will make good on any deal that you make . ”

Initial reports made it sound as though April 1 was the day the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) has so eagerly awaited : airport screeners caught a real , live , honest - to - goodness terrorist !
At Orlando International !
With " materials … that could have been used for an explosive device " in his bag !
Those " materials " were n’t the TSA ’s usual trophies , either , of excess baby food or veterans ’ commemorative lighters .
No , here were " two galvanized pipes , end caps , two small containers carrying BBs , batteries , two containers with an unknown liquid , and bomb making literature . "
Finally , vindication !
The $ 40 billion the TSA has sucked from taxpayers ’ pockets since 2001 as well as seven years of warrantless searches and frustrated passengers were suddenly justified .
Even better , screeners detected the bomber thanks to one of the TSA ’s most anti-Constitutional and controversial programs : Behavior Detection , a.k.a. , SPOT [ Screening Passengers by Observation Techniques ] .
Now SPOT , too , was validated !
Alas , later reports chipped away at the victory .
Turns out " terrorist " Kevin Brown had packed the " materials " in his checked bag , not his carry - on .
Air Jamaica , Kevin ’s carrier , hastened to assure customers that " the items could not have caused an explosion and the aircraft and its passengers were never at risk . "
Talk about taking the wind out of the TSA ’s sails .
Further deflating those jibs was Kevin himself .
He " first told authorities he wanted to detonate the materials on a tree stump in Jamaica … "
That ’s harmless enough , so naturally the story changed : Kevin " later said he was going to show friends in his home country how to build explosives … "
How many alternative interrogation techniques did the new and improved confession require ?
Far from a terrorist , Kevin is one of those sad , injured folks on which our neoconservative rulers in general and the TSA in particular prey .
A US Army veteran who was never the same after his deployment to Iraq , Kevin ’s " been in and out of hospitals " with " a history of mental illness . "
His mother ’s murder in 2005 did n’t help .
The lawyer representing the family in the murder case considers Kevin " a bit unstable .
I think the mother ’s death would have been on his mind . ”
It ’s easy to see why : Kevin was a baby when his father died , so his mother raised him and his brother on her own .
" [ She ] was the breadwinner for the family , " the attorney added .
" She was always there for them . ”
I suppose Kevin should count his blessings that he ’s merely in jail instead of murdered himself : the TSA does n’t usually deal gently with depressed , distraught people .
But Kevin ’s tragedies do n’t shame the TSA from its crude crowing .
You would think screeners had bagged Osama himself with the latest technology instead of hocus - pocus they call SPOT .
SPOT sends screeners into concourses to spy on passengers .
Those whose comportment does n’t meet the TSA ’s top - secret definition of " normal " are pulled aside and interrogated .
Yep , this is as abusive and arbitrary as it sounds , though the TSA pretends that it ’s science .
SPOT combines the police - state tactics Israel uses in its airports with " microexpressions , " looks we supposedly flash " in about 1/30th of a second " to reveal our innermost thoughts .
Paul Ekman , a professor at the University of California at San Francisco , claims to have discovered microexpressions decades ago when he and a buddy sat around making faces at one another , photographing themselves , and then studying the pictures .
If you think that sounds like a couple of grad students who ’ve swilled their fair share of beer , you ’ve got more sense than the TSA .
Meanwhile , even researchers at the TSA ’s parent bureaucracy , the Department of Homeland Security , admit SPOT is " unproven and potentially ineffectual . "
The manager of its " Project Hostile Intent , " Larry Willis , says , “ We ’re trying to establish whether there is something to detect . ”
Ekman himself pretty much established that there is n’t when SPOTters under his guidance at Boston ’s Logan International saved us from another 9/11 : " The man in the cheap brown jacket stood slumped in line , staring at the ground .
His hands were fidgety , reaching repeatedly into his inside jacket pocket , or patting it from the outside . "
Ekman sagely suggested that " repeated patting of the chest … might mean that a bomb is strapped too tightly under a person ’s jacket , " while terrorists often manifest " slumped posture . "
Sure enough , when Ekman and his acolytes accosted the man , he promptly confessed : " He was on the way to the funeral of his brother , who had died unexpectedly .
That was the reason for the bowed head .
The frequent chest - patting was to reassure himself that he had his boarding pass . "
Neither Ekman nor the TSA see anything wrong with a country in which government agents harass grieving people .
SPOTters have been spying on passengers since January 2006 .
As of September 2007 , they ’d fingered 43,000 of the approximately 1.3 billion people who had taken to the skies in that period .
They called the cops on 3,100 of those 43,000 victims , with 278 people arrested for guns , drugs , fake ID , or immigration problems — not terrorism .
SPOT ’s rate of " success , " if we ’re judging that by number of arrests , is .0000002 % .
And that sinks even further , to 0 % , if we ’re picky enough to demand that the arrest be for terrorism .
SPOT clearly fails at finding terrorists in favor of simply detaining folks .
Fortunately for passengers , it is n’t even good at that : " It does n’t seem like a lot of arrests , given how easy it is to arrest someone , ” says Barry Steinhardt of the ACLU .
Meanwhile , critics contend that " any random sweep of 43,000 passengers might have turned up as many criminals [ sic ] . "
“ There ’s always a reason why you ’re exhibiting that behavior that catches our attention , ” opines one of the TSA ’s SPOTters .
“ Maybe it ’s just because you ’re having problems at home . ”
Actually , it ’s because we ’re having problems with a totalitarian government .
The Best of Becky Akers
After Combustion : Detonation !
The race heats up to replace the jet turbine with a more efficient source of Mach - breaking airpower : the pulse - detonation engine .
Here ’s some naughty code .
from itertools import takewhile def take_some ( pred , xs ) : while True : for x in takewhile ( pred , xs ) : yield x
This code abuses the “ iterator building block ” foundations of Python ’s itertools module .
Once you ’ve chopped a stream ’s head off using takewhile you ca n’t resume processing its tail …
Or can you ?
A casual inspection of this function suggests it does little more than heat up the machine : we return elements , x , from a stream , xs , for which pred( x ) holds , then we spin at the first element for which the predicate does not hold .
When we actually run the code , things turn out rather differently :
>>> from itertools import count , islice >>> def is_even ( x ) : ... return x % 2 == 0 ... >>> xs = take_some ( is_even , count ( ) ) >>> xs.next () 0 >>> xs.next ( ) 2 >>> xs.next ( ) 4 >>> list ( islice ( xs , 10 ) ) [ 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 18 , 20 , 22 , 24 ]
Dropwhile , ifilter , izip
Nothing overheats .
In fact take_some behaves suspiciously like ifilter .
Let ’s explore that hypothesis by zipping together an ifilter stream and a take_some stream and seeing if they diverge .
>>> from itertools import dropwhile , ifilter , izip >>> xs = take_some ( is_even , count ( ) ) >>> ys = ifilter ( is_even , count ( ) ) >>> diverge = dropwhile ( lambda xy : xy [ 0 ] == xy [ 1 ] , izip ( xs , ys ) ) >>> diverge.next ( ) C-c C-cTraceback ( most recent call last ) : ... KeyboardInterrupt >>>
Here itertools .
dropwhile iterates through the zipped stream yielding items as soon as it detects a difference in the first and second element of a pair .
This time , as you can see , we do start spinning , and we have to interrupt execution to regain control .
Small print
Our casual interpretation of take_some was wrong .
The actual documentation for itertools .
takewhile reads :
takewhile ( predicate , iterable )
Make an iterator that returns elements from the iterable as long as the predicate is true .
Equivalent to : def takewhile ( predicate , iterable ) : for x in iterable : if predicate ( x ) : yield x else : break
There you have it !
Once a stream returned by takewhile has run its course , the original iterable is poised to yield the element immediately after the first element for which the predicate fails .
That is , we drop the first element for which the predicate fails .
So repeatedly applying takewhile to a stream drops the elements for which the predicate does n’t hold , which is to say it generates the elements for which the predicate holds , which is of course ifilter .
Bug fixes
Yes , kind of .
I could point out a couple of bugs in take_some .
First , it does n’t work for lists .
Give it a list and each application of takewhile resumes iteration from the beginning of the list , meaning take_some either repeats the first element of the list forever , or it spins without yielding anything :
>>> ys = take_some ( is_even , [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] ) >>> ys.next ( ) ... KeyboardInterrupt >>> ys = take_some ( is_even , [ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ] ) >>> ys.next () 0 >>> ys.next () 0 >>> set ( islice (ys , 1000000 ) ) set ( [ 0 ] )
We can fix that defect easily by applying iter to the input iterable , but that exposes the second bug , that take_some only works for infinite streams .
Once we bang into the end of an iterable , we stay there , stuck in the while loop .
To fix both defects we might end up with something like :
from itertools import takewhile , tee def take_some ( pred , xs ) : while True : xs , ys = tee ( xs ) try : ys.next ( ) except StopIteration : return for x in takewhile ( pred , xs ) : yield x
The real bug fix
Actually , the real bug , which I admitted to at the outset , is in our thinking .
This code abuses the iterator - building - blocks paradigm at the heart of the itertools module .
Takewhile converts one stream into another stream ; the original stream has gone and if we wanted it we should have teed it first .
The Unix shell embeds this concept at the core of the language to great effect .
Once again our building block is the stream but our connector , the pipeline operator , | , does n’t allow this kind of abuse ; all you can do is put a stream to its left and another to its right .
The syntax wo n’t allow you to get the head and tail of the same stream in a single pipeline .
Here ’s an awkless variant of the recent shell history meme which shows a shell pipeline in action .
$ history | tr -s ' ' | cut -f 3 -d ' ' | sort | uniq -c | sort - rn 172 cd 147 svn 73 bin/ mheg 57 make 54 ls 40 emacs 37 pwd ...
Here ’s a slightly more interesting variant which only shows commands appearing after a pipeline operator .
( It ’s not bombproof , but it ’ll do for now . )
$ history | grep - Eo '\| * \w+ ' | tr -d '| ' | sort | uniq -c | sort - rn 10 head 8 cut 7 grep 6 tr 5 xargs 4 sort 3 wc 3 uniq 3 less ...

“ Generator Tricks for Systems Programmers ” , a presentation made by David M. Beazley at PyCon’08 .
I was n’t there , but for once the slides ( PDF ) standalone well , and despite the title it ’s neither tricksy nor just for systems programmers .
Experienced Python programmers might choose to skip over the first few slides ; by the end of the presentation , the material gets much more advanced [ 1 ] .
“ Shell - like data processing ” by Maxim Krikun in the online Python Cookbook , which overloads the bitwise or operator , | , to implement a Pythonic pipeline , an idea you can find extended in “ Assembly Line Syntax ” by Patrick Roberts and revised by Michael Foord , this time using the right shift operator as a connector .

In his presentation David Beazley shows some elegant and idiomatic Python code to sum the total number of bytes transferred in an Apache httpd server log ( the final field on each line of the log file shown above ) .
You ’ll notice how clean and declarative it is .
Each generator expression builds upon the one on the preceding line .
The source of the stream , wwwlog , is a file object which , in the iterable context shown here , yields lines on demand .
Nothing really happens until the final reduction , sum , at which point data flows smoothly through .
Stream elements — lines , words , ints — are processed one at a time , and nothing accumulates except the final total .
wwwlog = open ( " access-log " ) bytecolumn = ( line.rsplit ( None , 1 ) [ 1 ] for line in wwwlog ) bytes = ( int ( x ) for x in bytecolumn if x != '-') print " Total " , sum ( bytes )
Here ’s an alternative using the Python pipeline approach mentioned in the previous section .
Note that in my server access logs it ’s the 9th field ( whitespace separated , counting from zero ) which gives the number of bytes transferred , and for variety I ’m pattern matching this field to a string of digits .
wwwlog = open ( " access -log " ) bytes = wwwlog | cut ( 9 ) | grep ( r' \d + ' ) | xlate ( int ) print " Total " , sum ( bytes )
Cut , grep and xlate are simple classes which implement the numeric __ror__ method .
import itertools import re class xlate ( object ) : " Translate the input stream by applying a function to each item " .
def __init__ ( self , fn ) : self .fn = fn def __ror__ ( self , stream ) : return itertools.imap( self.fn , stream ) class cut( xlate ) : " Cuts a whitespace separated column from a stream of lines . " def __init__ ( self , column ) : super( cut , self ) .__init__(lambda s : s.split( ) [ column ] ) class grep ( object ) : " Grep lines which match an re from a stream of lines . " def __init__ ( self , pattern ) : self.match = re.compile ( pattern ).match def __ror__( self , stream ) : return itertools.ifilter(self.match , stream )

Adobe made comments today that they will be delivering a Flash client for the iPhone .
According to Adobe 's Chief Executive Shantanu Narayen , Adobe has downloaded the iPhone SDK and is planning on building a Flash Player for the iPhone and distributing it via Apple 's iTunes App store .
" We believe Flash is synonymous with the Internet experience , and we are committed to bringing Flash to the iPhone , " Narayen said .
" We have evaluated ( the software developer tools ) and we think we can develop an iPhone Flash player ourselves . "
The news comes a few weeks after Apple 's Steve Jobs stated his reasons why Flash is not available for the iPhone .
Jobs claimed that Flash Lite for mobile was not full featured enough , while the full version of Flash would not run well on the iPhone .
Other reports have claimed the core issue preventing the release of Flash for iPhone is a licensing negotiation between Adobe and Apple over the iPhone 's PDF renderer .
It 's not clear how exactly Adobe would bring Flash to the iPhone , as there are several restrictions in the iPhone SDK that could prevent its release .
HARARE , Zimbabwe ( CNN ) -- Zimbabwean government forces began cracking down on the main opposition party Thursday , raising fears of a political crisis , according to witnesses and an opposition spokesman .
The forces raided at least two hotels in the capital , including one that houses foreign journalists , a witness said .
Four journalists were taken away about 8:30 p.m. ( 2:30 p.m. ET ) , he said .
He said other journalists staying at the hotel were out on assignment , and he thought police might check their credentials when they returned .
The Zimbabwean government has denied CNN and other international news organizations permission to enter the country to report on the elections .
New York Times Executive Editor Bill Keller confirmed that Barry Bearak , a Pulitzer Prize - winning correspondent based in Johannesburg , South Africa , was taken into custody .
" He was apparently one of a number of Americans and other foreign nationals rounded up today , " Keller said .
" An American consular official who visited him at the central police station reported that he was being held for ' violation of the journalism laws .
" We are making every effort to assure that he is well treated , and to secure his prompt release , " Keller said .
The identities of the other journalists seized in the raid were not immediately known .
State Department spokesman Tom Casey said the United States is calling for the immediate release of Americans seized by Zimbabwe authorities .
" We are concerned about the taking into custody of several American citizens , " Casey said .
" There is no reason for that .
We want to see them released as soon as possible . "
State Department officials said they were bound by privacy constraints and could n't say how many American reporters were taken .
Adrienne Arsenault , an accredited journalist with Canadian Broadcasting Corporation , told CBC News that she was " surrounded and arrested " by Zimbabwe police .
She said she was questioned and released within an hour .
" But the message was clear , " said Arsenault , who was not one of the four taken into custody .
" We are not wanted here , especially now . "
Canada 's Minister of Foreign Affairs , Maxime Bernier , called on Zimbabwe 's government to allow journalists to freely cover the election .
" Canada is a strong proponent of the right to freedom of expression , including free media , " Bernier said in a statement .
" This applies equally to Zimbabwean and international media present in the country . "
Tendai Biti , secretary - general for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change , said his party 's offices -- in another Harare hotel -- were also raided by Zimbabwean forces .
Some of the rooms were ransacked , The Associated Press reported .
" There 's a definite crackdown , " Biti said .
No one was detained in that raid , he added .
The action targeted " certain people ... including myself , " Biti told the AP .
" It is quite clear he has unleashed a war , " he said , referring to Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe .
The crackdown came hours after the government announced another delay in releasing some of last weekend 's election results , raising fears that Mugabe is trying to come up with a plan to remain in power .
Many are predicting a runoff election .
Watch why a runoff is likely »
In spite of this , on Wednesday the MDC declared Tsvangirai the outright winner , saying he took 50.3 percent of the almost 2.4 million votes .
The state - run newspaper The Herald reported Wednesday that Mugabe and Tsvangirai will compete in a presidential runoff because neither candidate garnered more than 50 percent of the vote .
Watch the claims and counterclaims »
But even some in Mugabe 's own party believe that he should step down .
A Zanu -PF member , who did not want to be named for security reasons , reported a deep schism in the party Thursday , .
" The top guys have been given a rude awakening , " the lawmaker said , adding that the party 's brass is " shell - shocked " by the results and had not expected the apparent defeat .
The lawmaker , who lost his seat to an opposition challenger , said a presidential runoff " will be a suicide mission " and should be a " last resort " for the ruling party .
" Mugabe is finished , " he added .
But Zimbabwean Deputy Information Minister Bright Matonga said he did not expect Mugabe to step down .
" I do n't see that at all , " he said .
" And why should he ?
We have to go all the way .
That is what the law says . "
According to The Herald , the elections for parliament 's lower house came down to a " photo finish , " with MDC taking 99 seats and Zanu - PF 97 .
Eleven posts in the 210 - seat body went to an independent and members of a smaller opposition party .
Three seats will have to be decided in a later election because the opposition candidates have died , the paper reported .
The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission said Thursday that it has postponed releasing results from elections for the Senate , parliament 's upper house .
The government blames the delays in announcing results on logistics , noting that four elections were held simultaneously .
Matonga has said the law gives the government until Friday to release the results .
A look at the candidates »
Mugabe , who was prime minister before taking the presidential post in 1987 , has been in power since Zimbabwe 's independence from Britain 28 years ago .
The election represents the toughest challenge to power he has ever faced .
See photos from the country 's elections »
A year after the last presidential election , which the MDC alleges was stolen , the government charged Tsvangirai with treason .
He was acquitted .
The MDC accused Mugabe of trying to eliminate him as a challenger .
Zimbabwe faced international sanctions after the 2002 election , including travel restrictions on Zimbabwean officials .
A hero of the country 's civil war against the white Rhodesian government , Mugabe became the country 's first black leader in 1980 .
Nearly three decades later , he has consolidated his rule over all aspects of Zimbabwean life .
Once revered for providing some of the best education and health care in Africa , Zimbabwe now has one of the lowest life expectancies in the world .
Schooling is a luxury .
It was once known as the breadbasket of southern Africa , but now it is difficult to get basic food supplies .
Inflation has skyrocketed to more than 100,000 percent , while food production and agricultural exports have dropped drastically .

All About Zimbabwe • Robert Mugabe • Morgan Tsvangirai
Passengers travelling between EU countries or taking domestic flights would have to hand over a mass of personal information , including their mobile phone numbers and credit card details , as part of a new package of security measures being demanded by the British government .
The data would be stored for 13 years and used to " profile " suspects .
Brussels officials are already considering controversial anti-terror plans that would collect up to 19 pieces of information on every air passenger entering or leaving the EU .
Under a controversial agreement reached last summer with the US department of homeland security , the EU already supplies the same information [ 19 pieces ] to Washington for all passengers flying between Europe and the US .
But Britain wants the system extended to sea and rail travel , to be applied to domestic flights and those between EU countries .
According to a questionnaire circulated to all EU capitals by the European commission , the UK is the only country of 27 EU member states that wants the system used for " more general public policy purposes " besides fighting terrorism and organised crime .
The so - called passenger name record system , proposed by the commission and supported by most EU governments , has been denounced by civil libertarians and data protection officials as draconian and probably ineffective .
The scheme would work through national agencies collecting and processing the passenger data and then sharing it with other EU states .
Britain also wants to be able to exchange the information with third parties outside the EU .
Officials in Brussels and in European capitals admit the proposed system represents a massive intrusion into European civil liberties , but insist it is a necessary part of a battery of new electronic surveillance measures being mooted in the interests of European security .
These include proposals unveiled in Brussels last week for fingerprinting and collecting biometric information of all non-EU nationals entering or leaving the union .
All airlines would provide government agencies with 19 pieces of information on every passenger , including mobile phone number and credit card details .
The system would work by " running the data against a combination of characteristics and behavioural patterns aimed at creating a risk assessment " , according to the draft legislation .
" When a passenger fits within a certain risk assessment , he could be identified as a high - risk passenger . "
A working party of European data protection officials described the proposal as " a further milestone towards a European surveillance society .
" The draft foresees the collection of a vast amount of personal data of all passengers flying into or out of the EU regardless of whether they are under suspicion or innocent travellers .
These data will then be stored for a period of 13 years to allow for profiling .
The profiling of all passengers envisaged by the current proposal might raise constitutional concerns in some member states . "
The Liberal Democrat MEP Sarah Ludford said : " Where is this going to stop ?
There 's no mature discussion of risk .
As soon as you question something like this , you 're soft on terrorism in the UK and in the EU . "
Britain is pushing for a more comprehensive system based on the experience of a UK pilot scheme that has been running for the past three years .
Officials say Operation Semaphore , monitoring flights from Pakistan and the Middle East , has been highly successful and has resulted in hundreds of arrests .
The scheme has seen one in every 2,200 passengers warranting further investigation , with a tenth of those " being of interest " .
British officials say rapists , drug smugglers and child traffickers have been arrested and want the EU scheme to cover " all fugitives from crown court justice " .
But Ludford said : " If you ask the UK government how many terrorists have been picked up , I do n't think you get a very straight answer . "
EU officials have asked the Home Office minister Meg Hillier for information about the arrests of suspected terrorists .
The " public goods " argument is certainly the most popular economic argument for the state .
It allegedly shows that the existence of government can be Pareto optimal , and that the non-existence of the state cannot be Pareto optimal ; or at least , it shows that the existence of government is justifiable on cost - benefit grounds .
Supposedly , there exist important services , such as national defense , which benefit people whether they pay for them or not .
The result is that selfish agents refuse to contribute , leading to disaster .
The only way to solve this problem is to coerce the beneficiaries to raise the funds to supply the needed good .
In order for this coercion to work , it needs to be monopolized by a single agency , the state .
Public goods arguments have been made not only for national defense , but for police , roads , education , R&D , scientific research , and many other goods and services .
The essential definitional feature of public goods is " non- excludability " ; because the benefits cannot be limited to contributors , there is no incentive to contribute .
( A second definitional characteristic often attributed to public goods is " non-rivalrousness " ; my own view is that this second attribute just confuses the issue , since without the non- excludability problem , non-rivalrousness would merely be another instance of the ubiquitous practice of pricing above marginal cost . )
The concept of externalities is very closely connected to the concept of public goods ; the main difference is that economists usually think of externalities as being both " positive " ( e.g. R&D spill - overs ) and " negative " ( e.g. pollution ) , whereas they usually do n't discuss " public bads . "
In any case , again we have the problem that agents perform actions which harm or benefit other people , and the harm / benefit is " non-excludable . "
Victims of negative externalities can't feasibly charge polluters a fee for suffering , and beneficiaries of positive externalities can't feasibly be charged for their enjoyment .
Government is supposed to be necessary to correct this inefficiency .
( As usual , it is the inefficiency rather than the injustice that economists focus upon . )
Left - anarchists and anarcho - capitalists would probably have remarkably similar replies to this argument , although doubtlessly the tone and emphasis would vary .
Objection # 1 : The behavorial assumptions of public goods theory are false .
It is simply not true that people always act in their narrow self - interest .
Charity exists , and there is no reason to think that the charitable impulse might not be cultivated to handle public goods problems voluntarily on an adequate basis .
Nor need charity as such be the only motive : in Social Contract , Free Ride , Anthony de Jasay lays out an " ethics turnpike " of possible voluntary solutions to serious public goods problems , moving from motivation from high moral principles , to " tribal " motivations , to economic motivations .
As de Jasay writes , " On the map of the Ethics Turnpike ... three main segments are marked off according to the basic type of person most likely to find his congenial exit along it .
The first segment is primarily for the type who fears
God or acts as if he did .
The second segment has exits to suit those who are not indifferent to how some or all their fellow men are faring , and who value only that ( but not all that ) which people want for themselves or for others .
The third is for homo oeconomicus , maximizing a narrowly defined utility that varies only with the money 's worth of his own payoffs . "
In short , much of the public goods problem is an artificial creation of economists ' unrealistic assumptions about human nature .
Anarchists would surely disagree among themselves about human nature , but almost all would agree that there is more to the human character than Hobbesian self - interest .
Some people may be amoral , but most are not .
Moreover , charitable impulses can even give incentives to uncharitable people to behave fairly .
If the public boycotts products of polluters , the polluters may find that it is cheaper to clean up their act than lose the public 's business .
Interestingly , many economists have experimentally tested the predictions of public goods theory .
( Typically , these experiments involve groups of human subjects playing for real money . )
The almost universal result is that the central prediction of public goods theory ( i.e. , that no one will voluntarily contribute to the production of a public good ) is totally false .
While the level of contributions rarely equals the Pareto - optimal level , it never even approaches the zero- provision level that public goods theory predicts .
Summarizing the experimental literature , Douglas Davis and Charles Holt write " [ S ] ubjects rather persistently contributed 40 to 60 percent of their token endowments to the group exchange , far in excess of the 0 percent contributions rate ... "
Subsequent experiments examined the conditions under which voluntary provision is most successful ; see Davis and Holt 's Experimental Economics for details .
Objection # 2 : Government is not the only possible way to provide public goods .
Even if individuals act in their narrow self - interest , it is not true that government is the only way to manage public goods and externalities problems .
Why could n't a left - anarchist commune or an anarcho - capitalist police firm do the job that the neoclassical economist assumes must be delegated to the government ?
The left - anarchist would probably be particularly insistent on this point , since most economists usually assume that government and the market are the only ways to do things .
But thriving , voluntary communities might build roads , regulate pollution , and take over other important tasks now handled by government .
Anarcho - capitalists , for their part , would happily agree : while they usually look to the market as a first solution , they appreciate other kinds of voluntary organizations too : fraternal societies , clubs , family , etc .
But anarcho - capitalists would probably note that left - anarchists overlook the ways that the market might take over government services -- indeed , malls and gated communities show how roads , security , and externalities can be handled by contract rather than coercion .
Objection # 3 : Public goods are rarer than you might think .
Anarcho - capitalists would emphasize that a large number of alleged " public goods " and " externalities " could easily be handled privately by for - profit business if only the government would allow the definition of private property rights .
If ranchers over - graze the commons , why not privatize the commons ?
If fishermen over - fish the oceans , why not parcel out large strips of the ocean by longitude and latitude to for profit - making aquaculture ?
And why is education supposed to create externalities any more than any other sort of investment ?
Similarly , many sorts of externalities are now handled with private property rights .
Tort law , for example , can give people an incentive to take the lives and property of others into account when they take risks .
Objection # 4 : Externalities are a result of the profit - oriented mentality which would be tamed in an anarchist society .
Left - anarchists would emphasize that many externalities are caused by the profit - seeking system which the state supports .
Firms pollute because it is cheaper than producing cleanly ; but anarcho - syndicalist firms could pursue many aims besides profit .
In a way , the state - capitalist system creates the problem of externalities by basing all decisions upon profit , and then claims that we need the state to protect us from the very results of this profit - oriented decision - making process .
While few left - anarchists are familiar with the experimental economics literature , it offers some support for this general approach .
In particular , many experiments have shown that subjects ' concern for fairness weakens many of the harsh predictions of standard economic analysis of externalities and bargaining .
Objection # 5 : The public goods problem is unavoidable .
Perhaps most fundamentally : government is not a solution to the public goods problem , but rather the primary instance of the problem .
If you create a government to solve your public goods problems , you merely create a new public goods problem : the public good of restraining and checking the government from abusing its power .
" [ I ] t is wholly owing to the constitution of the people , and not to the constitution of the government , that the crown is not as oppressive in England as in Turkey , " wrote Thomas Paine ; but what material incentive is there for individuals to help develop a vigilant national character ?
After all , surely it is a rare individual who appreciably affects the national culture during his or her lifetime .
To rely upon democracy as a counter - balance simply assumes away the public goods problem .
After all , intelligent , informed voting is a public good ; everyone benefits if the electorate reaches wise political judgments , but there is no personal , material incentive to " invest " in political information , since the same result will ( almost certainly ) happen whether you inform yourself or not .
It should be no surprise that people know vastly more about their jobs than about their government .
Many economists seem to be aware of this difficulty ; in particular , public choice theory in economics emphasizes the externalities inherent in government action .
But a double standard persists : while non-governmental externalities must be corrected by the state , we simply have to quietly endure the externalities inherent in political process .
Since there is no incentive to monitor the government , democracies must rely upon voluntary donations of intelligence and virtue .
Because good government depends upon these voluntary donations , the public goods argument for government falls apart .
Either unpaid virtue can make government work , in which case government is n't necessary to solve the public goods problem ; or unpaid virtue is insufficient to make government work , in which case the government cannot be trusted to solve the public goods problem .
David Friedman has a particularly striking argument which goes one step further .
Under governmental institutions , he explains , good law is a public good and bad law is a private good .
That is , there is little direct personal incentive to lobby for laws that benefit everyone , but a strong personal incentive to lobby for laws that benefit special interests at the expense of everyone else .
In contrast , under anarcho - capitalist institutions , good law is a private good and bad law is a public good .
That is , by patronizing a firm which protects oneself , one reinforces the existence of socially beneficial law ; but there is little incentive to " lobby " for the re-introduction of government .
As Friedman explains , " Good law is still expensive - I must spend time and money determining which protection agency will best serve me - but having decided what I want , I get what I pay for .
The benefit of my wise purchase goes to me , so I have an incentive to purchase wisely .
It is now the person who wishes to reintroduce government who is caught in a public goods problem .
He cannot abolish anarchy and reintroduce government for himself alone ; he must do it for everyone or for no one .
If he does it for everyone , he himself gets but a tiny fraction of the ' benefit ' he expects the reintroduction of government to provide . "
In Part I of this article , I reviewed the differences between the Blackberry and Treo platforms in hardware and operating system .
I gave a significant edge to the Blackberry for newer and more functional hardware and a much more stable operating system .
This is only half of the decision though .
What you are ultimately going to do with your handheld will really decide which device is right for you .
Information Management
Calendar 
The Palm OS native information management programs are far superior to the Blackberrys .
I believe this goes back to the Palm OS roots  remember , it was originally designed for this function exclusively , and the e-mail , internet and telephony functions were layered on top many years later .
The Palm simply offers easier data entry , manipulation and options for viewing .
If you want to add colors , or icons , or customize the different calendar views , Palm OS is for you .
In fact , one of the more glaring omissions of the Blackberry calendar is the inability to categorize entries .
That being said , the Blackberry calendar is functional , if not overly easy to use .
You can certainly enter and edit calendar entries , and you can view them in a daily , weekly , monthly and agenda view .
Contacts 
The address book function is probably a draw .
There really are not that many things you can do with the core contact information management .
You can categorize entries on both devices , and filter them as needed .
Both operating systems offer the standard range of customized contact information , such as work / home / mobile numbers and multiple e-mail addresses .
Both devices utilize the address book as the primary cellular phone book , which is an enormous advantage of Smartphones in general .
As there is nt much difference between them , I consider this area a tie as well .
Tasks 
Unlike many people , I literally live and die on my task list .
I think I grew to love this function from my days as an early Palm adopter , and because I am a list - maker . 
I have daily to - do lists , project lists , follow up lists , telephone call lists , long - term lists , and more .
I think the best program for utilizing this function is by far the Palm Desktop , which I used for many years before moving to Outlook .
Palm Desktop allows you to prioritize tasks on a scale of 1 - 5 , rather than the high - normal - low priority that Outlook ( and therefore most other systems ) use .
That being said , the Blackberrys task program is fairly meager .
It does the minimum functions of sorting , displaying and editing tasks , but its not easy to use , and it is difficult to customize .
The Palm OS program is much better for this function .
Notes 
On the other hand , this is one area that I use infrequently at best .
Much like the contacts features above , the notes / memos functionality is pretty basic on both devices .
You can create and edit short text memos that you synchronize into Palm Desktop or Outlook .
Neither system will allow reading or editing of native text files , or any other documents for that matter .
I see many people trying to use their handhelds as ultra-portable laptop computers , creating and editing Office applications , but that exceeds the intent of these devices ( in my opinion ) and certainly exceeds the scope of this review .
Again , like contacts , this is a draw .
Third - Party Applications 
Where the native applications fail , you can always install third - party programs to fill in the gaps on both platforms .
Here , as noted previously , the Palm has somewhat of an advantage in the variety and depth of the software .
On the Palm OS , you have options such as Datebk6 ( which was Datebk3 when I registered it ) , or Agendus for full - featured PIM replacements .
I previously used 2 Day , a great simple program to display todays critical information .
There are many others on Palm of varying functionality and price .
For the Blackberry , there are simply not as many options , and that is probably rooted in the origins of the devices I noted above .
There is a decent today program in PocketDay , but its not as good as any of the Palm programs .
Similarly , there is BBTaskPro for task management , but there really is nt a good Datebk6 or Agendus type of program for the Blackberry .
I believe this is due to the limitations of the OS rather than the lack of need , desire or competent programmers , but in third - party programs , as with all PIM functions , the edge goes to the Palm OS .
Email Management
Where the Palm OS shines in personal information management , the Blackberry shines in e-mail .
This is probably because the Blackberry grew up on e-mail .
That is not to say that it is without flaws , but they are annoyances rather than deal - breakers , and I have confidence moving forward that they will be corrected over time .
With regard to the Palm OS and the Treo , I do not have that confidence .
First , one caveat .
This review is limited to Blackberry Internet Service ( BIS ) and not Blackberry Enterprise Server ( BES ) .
BIS is for the majority of us who operate our Blackberry as a personal device  this is the system that allows us to get our Gmail , Yahoo or other e-mail on the Blackberry .
BES is the ( very expensive ) behind the scenes program that allows seamless wireless synchronization of your e-mail , calendar , contacts , etc. to Microsoft Exchange Server .
If your company gave you a Blackberry , and you synchronize to Outlook , BES is probably the system that you are using .
BES is the gold - standard for Blackberry e-mail , but if you re reading this you are probably making a purchasing decision for yourself and not your company , so you are probably going to use BIS .
Setting up e-mail on BIS may be the easiest thing Ive ever done on a computer .
You dont need to know any settings , or what kind of system you are on , or really anything else besides your e-mail address and password .
You go to the web page of your cellular provider , navigate to their BIS gateway , and set up a personal account for the first time .
After that , you simply provide the basic e-mail address and password for your e-mail accounts and it does the rest .
It figures out the system you are on ( POP , IMAP , Outlook Web Access ) , configures itself , downloads the data to your device , and you start getting e-mail .
It s that easy .
Compare this to the process of setting up wireless e-mail on a Treo.
Versamail is an abomination of a program .
It requires you to tweak numerous settings to get your e-mail , has severe limitations on functionality ( Exchange Active Sync only does mail , contacts and calendar , not tasks and notes ) , and it has horrible functionality .
Versamail crashed my Treo countless times , and when it was not crashing it duplicated entries or corrupted data .
I got so fed up with Versamail that I switched to Chatteremail , which is a wonderful stand - alone POP and IMAP program .
Chatter used to be the best option out there for Palm devices until Palm bought the program , employed the developer , started to sell the program on the Palm website , and then immediately discontinued all future development and virtually all support .
When it worked , Chatter was perfect  you got literally instant delivery of IMAP e-mail , true bi-directional synchronization of sent and deleted items , and access to all of your IMAP folders .
Unfortunately , besides eating through your battery as noted in Part I , configuring it was a nightmare , and if you had any problems , you were essentially up the creek .
For example , my company has great tech support , but when we migrated from Exchange Server 2003 to 2007 , Chatter stopped accessing my e-mail .
Our IT staff couldnt figure it out , and there was no support , so we ended up coming up with a work - around that we should have never had to implement to begin with .
Plus , I am convinced that many of my crashes were based in Chatter  it ran in the background , but because the Palm OS does not truly multi-task , it ran into problems when trying to pull down a message with anything else going on .
As I noted above , these crashes were a major factor in my decision to abandon the Palm OS .
This is not to say that the Blackberry is completely without problems .
For example , I am accessing three e-mail accounts through BIS ( you can have up to ten ) .
One is my works Exchange Server that I access through Outlook Web Access .
One is a Gmail account I have configured for IMAP for push email and bi-directional synchronization of sent and deleted items .
The third is a Gmail POP account I use only for delivery of voice mail messages ( I use Simulscribe , which is a great system ) .
The POP delivery is instant , but is limited by POP functionality , namely no synchronization of deleted or sent items .
Unfortunately , my works OWA account and personal Gmail IMAP account do not synchronize the way I expect them to .
First , there is a delay in delivery of my works OWA e-mail that runs up to ten or fifteen minutes .
This appears to be a limitation of BIS  it only polls e-mail servers every fifteen minutes , then more often after a message arrives , then back down to the default fifteen minutes .
It is annoying for me to wait this time for e-mail messages , and for even longer ( up to hours ) for the full e-mail reconciliation of deletes to occur .
For some people , this might be a deal - breaker , but nothing that I do requires truly instant e-mail delivery .
My Gmail IMAP account had some delays in delivery , but working with some of the great people at crackberry .com helped me fix that by removing and restoring that account .
However , there seems to be some limitation in the IMAP synchronization from the Gmail server to the device not marking items read or archived .
Plus if you delete a message on the Blackberry , it actually deletes it on Gmail rather than archiving it .
This is a little more than an annoyance , as it defeats the purpose of Gmails permanent e-mail storage .
Also , Blackberry e-mail is limited to plain - text only without HTML formatting , but this feature is supposed to change with an upcoming operating system update .
One more little note 
Blackberry delivers all e-mail through their servers , no matter who your e-mail provider is originally .
I could not find a program that accesses POP or IMAP e-mail directly on the Blackberry platform , as I thought this might help alleviate some of my delivery and synchronization issues .
This is part of what makes setting up a Blackberry so easy , but when Blackberry s system crashes , you lose your e-mail .
Blackberry users are very sensitive to this issue , as it happened recently and made national news .
I think we all run into this risk with our technology , but it is something to consider .
In the end , my choice was instant e-mail delivery and synchronization with constant crashes , or delays and inconveniences with total platform stability .
For my purposes , I chose the Blackberry for stability .
I also have some degree of confidence that Blackberry ( and perhaps Google with them ) will work to fix some of these issues , much as they are fixing the HTML issue .
I have no confidence whatsoever in Palm to make any improvements in my experience .
In fact , Palm demonstrated with Chatteremail that they could purchase a viable and functional piece of software and stop development and support , essentially removing one of the best options out there .
You should look at the pros and cons of both platforms and decide what is most important for your needs before selecting between Palm and Blackberry .
For me , the edge definitely goes to Blackberry .
Telephony
I cannot spend too much time comparing these devices  ability to make telephone calls as there really is not that much difference between them .
Your telephone experience is probably based much more on the network you use and your cellular provider than it is impacted by the choice between Palm and Blackberry devices .
That being said , there are a few noteworthy differences , none of which will probably make your final decision between devices .
Besides my ( extensive ) comments throughout this article on the stability of the Blackberry compared to the instability of the Treo , the Bluetooth functionality of the Treo has always been a nightmare .
The 700 p had many problems with dropped connections , interference and incompatibilities .
The 755 p was virtually identical to the 700 p with regard to Bluetooth problems .
The Bluetooth on the Blackberry 8830 , on the other hand , works perfectly .
It stays connected , has good audio quality , and even has integrated voice dialing .
The Treo does offer one function that I miss desperately on my Blackberry , though .
The Blackberry has 26 speed dial slots , one for each letter of the alphabet .
You push and hold the letter for the person you want to dial , but hopefully you can remember who you assigned to the  Q  key because its not so easy to pull up the screen that lists the speed dial entries .
In addition , you are limited to only speed dialing telephone numbers and not programs or web sites .
The Treo speed dial application is easier to access and offers much more in the way of functionality .
I do wish I could do this on my Blackberry ( hint , hint Blackberry developers ) .
Internet
Internet access on both devices is certainly not their forte .
If you really want a great handheld internet experience , and that s the primary reason for your decision , you probably want an iPhone .
Both the Palm and Blackberry have small screens and limited browser functionality , but for basic internet access I think they are fine .
I have read many comments about the poor quality of the Blackberry browser , but for basic browsing I think it is acceptable , and actually better than the Blazer browser that comes on the Treo for speed and stability .
I actually dont mind the trackball navigation on the Blackberry browser as it works fairly intuitively , but its still best to stick to mobile - formatted sites .
I installed Opera Mini on both devices , and for non-mobile optimized sites it works fairly well .
I did find Opera faster and more stable on my Blackberry than on my Treo , though .
One last function for internet access is using the device as a cellular modem for a laptop .
On my Treo , I registered PDANet , a great and reasonably - priced program that allows the Treo to get my laptop online from locations that lack a WiFi connection ( like my fiancées moms house ) .
It is a one - time registration , and it worked fairly well , as long as you dont pull down too much data .
You see , its not technically within the terms of service with your cellular provider to use the Treo as a modem .
On the Blackberry , I had to pay $ 10 a month for the tethering  package on Sprint to be able to do this ( actually , I traded access to the horrible Sprint Telenav program for tethering ) .
I found the speed and stability a bit better on the Blackberrys tethering system as well , but it ends up being more costly over time .
Support
One of the most annoying things of using a Smartphone is that your technical support is primarily through your cellular provider , and you all know how responsive and knowledgeable the typical customer service representative is .
That being said , my primary avenue of support is usually online forums such as this one , and for that reason I usually know more than the technical support person does .
I doubt youll get a really good tech support person on any cellular provider who knows more than the basics for either the Blackberry or Treo .
However , on the topic of long - term platform support , I believe that the Palm operating system is stagnant if not dying .
Palm simply has not innovated in any way in its hardware or software in years , and it continues to offer sub - par solutions .
I agree that both Palm and Blackberry have issues , some of which are important and some of which are annoyances .
However , with the larger issues , I have no confidence in Palm to address them .
Palm has had ample time to fix things like stability , wireless e-mail and Bluetooth , and seemingly hasnt done so as of yet .
In fact , when I had my 700 p , Palm released an operating system patch that bricked numerous telephones and made others worse than they originally were .
I no longer trust Palm to provide me with a hardware or software solution for my personal needs going forward .
In comparison , I do have some confidence in Blackberry to address the issues that I have .
They are already coming out with an operating system update that offers HTML e-mail , and I do have confidence that things like the e-mail delivery and synchronization delays will get better .
I agree that the e-mail crashes that take down their entire network are difficult to deal with , but they are rare , and no technology works 100 % of the time .
Conclusions
I think in the end , the strengths and weaknesses of the Treo compared with the Blackberry are based on where they began .
The Palm platform began as the best personal information management system in personal computing history .
It was originally designed to handle calendar , contacts , tasks and memos .
Everything else with the Palm was gravy  the connectivity and tons of other software and accessories all grew from the original primary function of personal information management .
In comparison , the Blackberry was originally a mobile e-mail device .
In fact , for some time , just like the Palm , it didnt have a telephone .
Today , the Palm is still better at the core information functions  the native applications offer more options for customizing how to view your information .
Unfortunately , this is at the expense of handling telephone calls and e-mail messages very badly .
The Blackberry is nt nearly as good at personal information management or customization , but it does an adequate job , it s much more stable , and in the end I have some degree of confidence that the Blackberry will continue to evolve and fix many of my issues .
I do not have any confidence in Palm any longer , and that s the ultimate reason for my switch .

David Cay Johnston 's next book , Free Lunch : How the Wealthiest Americans Enrich Themselves at Government Expense ( and Stick You with the Bill ) , will be released on December 27 , 2007 .
Here is the publisher 's description :
How does a strong and growing economy lend itself to job uncertainty , debt , bankruptcy , and economic fear for a vast number of Americans ?
Free Lunch provides answers to this great economic mystery of our time , revealing how today ’s government policies and spending reach deep into the wallets of the many for the benefit of the wealthy few .
Johnston cuts through the official version of events and shows how , under the guise of deregulation , a whole new set of regulations quietly went into effect — regulations that thwart competition , depress wages , and reward misconduct .
From how George W. Bush got rich off a tax increase to a $ 100 million taxpayer gift to Warren Buffett , Johnston puts a face on all of the dirty little tricks that business and government pull .
A lot of people appear to be getting free lunches — but of course there ’s no such thing as a free lunch , and someone ( you , the taxpayer ) is picking up the bill .
Johnston ’s many revelations include :
How we ended up with the most expensive yet inefficient health - care system in the world
How homeowners ’ title insurance became a costly , deceitful , yet almost invisible oligopoly
How our government gives hidden subsidies for posh golf courses
How Paris Hilton ’s grandfather schemed to retake the family fortune from a charity for poor children
How the Yankees and Mets owners will collect more than $ 1.3 billion in public funds
In these instances and many more , Free Lunch shows how the lobbyists and lawyers representing the most powerful 0.1 % of Americans manipulated our government at the expense of the other 99.9 % .
With his extraordinary reporting , vivid stories , and sharp analysis , Johnston reveals the forces that shape our everyday economic lives — and shows us how we can finally make things better .
F# Web Tools " Ajax " applications made simple
I started thinking about working on " Ajax " framework quite a long time ago - the key thing I really wanted from the beginning was using the same language for writing both client and server side code and the integration between these two sides , so you could write an event handler and specify if it should be executed on the client or on the server side .
About a year ago I visited Cambridge ( thanks to the MVP program ) and I had a chance to talk with Don Syme [ ^ ] .
Don showed me a few things in F# and suggested using F# for this project , so when I was later selected to do an internship at MSR , this was one of the projects that I wanted to work on .
The original reason for using F# was its support for meta- programming ( [ 8 ] , which makes it extremely easy to translate part of the page code - behind code to JavaScript .
During my internship , the F# team was also working on a feature called computational expressions , which proved to be extremely useful for the F# Web Tools as well - I bet you 'll hear a lot about this from Don soon , so I 'll describe only the aspects that are important for this project .
Aside from these two key features that F# has , I also quite enjoyed programming in F# itself - I already used it for a few things during the last year , but I could finally work on a large project in F# ( and discuss the solution with the real experts ! ) and I do n't believe I would be able to finish the project of similar complexity during less than three months in any other language ( but this is a different topic , which deserves separate blog post ) .
What makes " Ajax " difficult ?
Traditional " Ajax " application consists of the server - side code and the client - side part written in JavaScript ( the more dynamicity you want , the larger JS files you have to write ) , which exchanges some data with the server - side code using XmlHttpRequest , typically in JSON format .
I think this approach has 3 main problems , which we tried to solve in F# Web Tools .
There are a few projects that try to solve some of them already - the most interesting projects are Volta from Microsoft [ 1 ] , Links language [ 3 ] from the University of Edinburgh and Google Web Toolkit [ 2 ] , but none of the projects solve all three problems at once .
1. Limited client - side environment
First of the problems with " Ajax " style applications is that significant part of the application runs on the client - side ( in a web browser ) .
Currently majority of the web applications use JavaScript to execute code in the browser , so in the F# Web Tools we wanted to use JavaScript as well , however in the future , when installation of Silverlight [ 4 ] becomes more common , we would like to allow using Silverlight as an alternative .
F# Web Tools allows you to write client - side code in F# ( so if you do n't know JavaScript , you do n't have to learn it ! ) and also use your existing knowledge of .NET and F# classes and functions ( so you can use some of the .NET and F# types when writing client - side code ) .
The code you write in F# is of course executed in JavaScript , so it runs in any browser that supports JavaScript - the current implementation is tested with IE and Firefox , but it could be easily tested with other browsers .
2. Discontinuity between server and client side
The second major problem with " Ajax " applications is that the web application has to be written as two separate parts - client - side part ( when written in JavaScript ) consists of several JS files and the server - side part ( for example in ASP.
NET ) is written as a set of ASPX and C# or VB files .
Also when using JavaScript , both sides use different formats to store the data , so bridging this gap is difficult .
In Silverlight [ 4 ] ( or in GWT [ 2 ] ) , the gap is still there , even though both parts are written using the same technology - the client - side part is usually even a separate project .
In F# Web Tools we wanted to make this discontinuity as small as possible - You can write both server and client - side code in a same file ( as a code - behind code ) .
You can also call server - side functions from the client - side code and you can use certain data - types ( including your own ) in both sides and you can send them as an arguments from one side to the other .
What 's also important is that these calls are done without blocking the browser , but without the usual cumbersome programming style ( calling a function , setting a callback and writing the rest of the code in the callback ) .
3. Components in web frameworks are only server - side
The third key problem appears once we tightly integrate client and server side code , because there is one more step that has to be done - most of the web frameworks have some way for composing web site from smaller pieces ( in ASP.
NET this is done using controls ) and by defining the interaction between these pieces , however they allow defining the interaction only for the server - side , which is rather problematic in " Ajax " applications , where most of the interaction between components is done on the client - side .
Since F# Web
Tools is built using ASP .
NET , we wanted to allow same compositionality as ASP .
NET - to achieve this , controls written using F# Web Tools can wrap both server and client side functionality .
Controls than expose both server and client side properties and events that can be used by the page to implement server - side , respectively client - side interaction between components .
Example - " Ajax " dictionary
I will demonstrate some of the F# Web Tools features using an " Ajax " dictionary application ( see screenshot on the right side ) which displays possible matching words as you type the word you want to find .
This is one of the typical " Ajax " tasks , so it 's a good example to start with .
First , we need to define the code - behind file for the ASP.
NET page - the page itself is quite simple , it contains just two controls - textbox for entering word that you 're looking for ( txtInput ) and generic element for displaying results ( ctlOutput ) , so let 's look at the code - behind :
1 : 2 : 3 : 4 : 5 : 6 : 7 : 8 : 9 : 10 : 11 : 12 : 13 : 14 : // F# record type , which will be used for sending lookup // results from the server - side to the client - side type SearchResult = { English : string ; Other : string ; } //
Code - behind type for the ASP.NET page [< MixedSide >] type Suggest = inherit ClientPage as base // Controls for entering text and displaying result val mutable txtInput : TextBox val mutable ctlOutput : Element (* .. interaction of components will go here .. *)
Aside from the code - behind class , we also defined a type ( SearchResult ) , which will be used for returning loaded results from server to the client side - it is just a F# record containing two strings ( word in English and word in the language we 're translating to ) .
Now let 's look at the methods that define the interaction logic .
The first method that we will look at is a method running on the server - side that takes entered text as an argument and returns a collection of results ( ResizeArray < SearchResult > ) - it is a static method , so it can't modify anything else on the page ( I will write about non-static methods in one of the next articles ) :
1 : 2 : 3 : 4 : 5 : 6 : 7 : 8 : 9 : 10 : // Searches the dictionary for specified prefix static member LoadSuggestions ( prefix ) = server { let db = DictionaryDb ( connectionString ) let res = SQL < @@ { for p in when p .
English .
StartsWith ( -> { English = p .
English ; Other = p .
Other } } |> truncate 10 @@ > return ( new ResizeArray < _ > ( res ) ) }
The method is all wrapped in server computational expression ( this is one of the new F# features - it will be in details described in the Expert F# [ 6 ] book , but I 'll definitely write a few lines about it as well ) - for now you can read it as ( almost ) ordinary F# code wrapped in a block that specifies how the code should be executed .
The server block is executed as ordinary F# code , but wrapping the code in this block allows us to call it from the client side later .
The server block also changes the type of the method , so it does n't return ResizeArray < SearchInfo > , but Server < ResizeArray < SearchInfo > > , where the Server type helps to ensure that the code will be executed only on the correct side .
Now , let 's look at the members that define client - side interaction .
The entry point on the client - side is a method called Client_Load , which is executed when the page is loaded in the browser :
1 : 2 : 3 : 4 : 5 : /// Initialization on the client side - attach event handlers [< ReflectedDefinition >] member this .
Client_Load ( sender , e ) = client { do this .
txtInput .
ClientKeyUp .
AddClient ( this .
UpdateSuggestions ) }
In this case we just register an event handler that will be called whenever user types something to the txtInput textbox .
It is important to note that this code will be executed in JavaScript - even though when writing it , it is easy to forget about this !
You can see the method that is used as an event handler in the next code sample ( this whole method will be executed in JS as well ) :
1 : 2 : 3 : 4 : 5 : 6 : 7 : 8 : 9 : /// When text changes , trigger server call to update suggestions [< ReflectedDefinition >] member this .
UpdateSuggestions ( sender , e ) = client { do !
asyncExecute ( client_async { let sprefix = this .
txtInput .
Text let ! sugs = serverExecute ( Suggest .
LoadSuggestions ( sprefix ) ) do !
this .
DisplayResponse ( sugs ) } ) }
If you look at the method , you can see that it contains call to the asyncExecute function and the argument given to the function is entire block of F# code marked using client_async computational expression .
The asyncExecute function executes the given block asynchronously , which means that it does n't block the calling function ( and it does n't block browser GUI ) - you can look at it as if it created new thread ( but it 's actually using one trick from functional programming called continuation passing style , because JavaScript does n't support threads ) .
In the client_async block , we first read the value from the textbox and then call the LoadSuggestions static method to get collection with matching words .
The call to the server - side functions is done using serverExecute function ( which is a special function , because it bridges the gap between client and the server automatically ) .
Once we get the result we can call the DisplayResponse method to display the results .
You can see that we used a let !
and do !
instead of let and do here - this is because we 're calling a methods that are written using F# computational expressions ( server or client blocks ) .
In general when you 're calling any ordinary code , you can use the operators without the exclamation mark , but when calling a code wrapped in a block you have to use let !
or do ! .
1 : 2 : 3 : 4 : 5 : 6 : 7 : 8 : 9 : 10 : /// Display newly received array with results [< ReflectedDefinition >] member this .
DisplayResponse ( sugs : ResizeArray < Result > ) = client { let sb = StringBuilder ( ) let array = sugs .
ToArray ( ) do Array .
iter ( fun ( res ) -> sb .
Append ( " < li >< strong > " + r .
Source + " </ strong > - " + r .
Target + " < /li > " ) |> ignore ) do this .
ctlOutput .
InnerHtml <- " < ul > " + ( sb . ToString ( ) ) + " < ul > " }
In this last sample code , we just generate HTML code from the data we received from the server and display them .
It is interesting to note , that the code is running on the client - side ( it 's wrapped in the client block ) , but you can still use some F#/.NET types and functions in the code ( we 're using ResizeArray , StringBuilder classes and Array.iter function ) .
This is possible because F# Web Tools re-implements subset of the F#/.NET functionality for the client - side code .
And that 's all - I described slightly simplified version of one of the F# Web Tools demos , but you can get the full source code if you check out our CodePlex project .
You can also look at the live Dictionary sample [ ^ ] .
More information
I think this example gives you a general idea what is the F# Web Tools and why it is interesting .
I will definitely write more about it in the future , because I did n't describe all important features in this example .
If you 're interested in this project , you can also read the Paper we submitted to the ML Workshop or slides from the presentation I did at the end of my internship in MSR Cambridge ( see below ) .
This project is also available to the community at CodePlex , so you can look at the source code ( including two more samples ) .

DES MOINES , Iowa ( Reuters ) - Voters in Iowa begin the process of choosing the next U.S. president on Thursday with two close nominating races , as a new poll showed Democrat Barack Obama leading John Edwards -- with Hillary Clinton falling to a potentially damaging third .
The Reuters / C- SPAN / Zogby poll also showed Republican Mike Huckabee expanding his lead on rival Mitt Romney as the most heavily contested presidential caucus in Iowa history draws to a close .
Other polls show both races even tighter in the final hours before Iowa opens the state - by - state battle to choose candidates to succeed President George W. Bush -- a process that will climax in the November 4 presidential election .
The Democratic caucus begins at 6:30 p.m. CST ( 7:30 EST ) , with Republicans starting 30 minutes later .
Results could begin to appear within an hour or two .
Candidates hit the trail on Thursday for final rallies before the evening caucuses , focusing on driving home their message to undecided voters and launching a mammoth voter turnout effort .
“ We are going to prove that our campaign to stand up for the middle class and stop corporate greed in America is unstoppable , ” Edwards , a former trial lawyer and North Carolina senator , told a rally for steelworkers and campaign volunteers in Des Moines .
For the winner in Iowa , the prize is valuable momentum and at least a temporary claim to the front - runner ’s slot in their party ’s nomination battle .
The third - place finisher in the heavyweight Democratic showdown , meanwhile , could find themselves hobbling into the next contest in New Hampshire on Tuesday .
The final Reuters / C- SPAN / Zogby tracking poll showed Obama , who would be the country ’s first black president , holding a 4 - point lead over Edwards at 31 percent to 27 percent .
Clinton , the former first lady who would be the country ’s first female president , slipped to third place at 24 percent .
The survey carries a statistical margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points .
Polling in Iowa is notoriously difficult given the unpredictability of who attends a caucus , the arcane rules and the low rates of participation -- fewer than 250,000 of the state ’s almost 3 million residents are likely to vote .
For Clinton , who a few months ago was considered in some quarters the almost certain Democratic nominee , a third - place finish in Iowa would create immense pressure to win in New Hampshire next Tuesday .

LUNCH IN DES MOINES
Clinton had lunch with her husband , former President Bill Clinton , their daughter Chelsea and her mother Dorothy Rodham in a Des Moines restaurant along with supporters .
Huckabee , the former Arkansas governor whose bare - bones campaign has steadily climbed since a second - place finish in the Iowa straw poll in August , expanded his lead over Romney in the Republican race , leading 31 percent to 25 percent .
Huckabee returned to frigid Iowa on Thursday after flying to California to appear on “ The Tonight Show ” with Jay Leno .

In Burlington , Iowa , he made a veiled reference to Romney ’s relatively recent switch to become an opponent of abortion rights while talking about his own unwavering belief in the sanctity of unborn life .
“ People here want consistency .
They want somebody who believes something ... and not because they got it from a focus group or an opinion poll , ” said Huckabee , a Baptist minister whose rise has been fueled by support from Iowa ’s sizable bloc of religious conservatives .
Romney , a former governor of Massachusetts who has had to justify his Mormon faith during the campaign , defended his aggressive advertising campaign against Huckabee and Arizona Sen .
John McCain , his top rival in New Hampshire , during a stop at a Des Moines financial company .
“ I ’m going to be forthright on differences on issues we have , ” he said .
“ Part of politics and a good campaign is defining those differences so people know where they line up . ”
The 2008 campaign is the most open presidential race in more than 50 years , with no sitting president or vice president seeking their party ’s nomination .
Iowa ’s opening contest in the nominating battle has traditionally served to winnow the presidential field of laggards and elevate some surprise contenders .
Record turnout is expected for the Democrats , surpassing the 124,000 Iowans who participated in 2004 .
Republicans could challenge their record of 87,000 caucus participants in 2000 .
Sub - freezing temperatures were predicted for Thursday night , when Iowans will leave their homes and join their neighbors at a community gathering spot to publicly declare their support for a candidate .
Not everyone was happy with the focus on Iowa and next week ’s primary in New Hampshire .
“ Defenders say both states take the process seriously , and participants can quiz contenders directly on a snowy sidewalk .
Sorry , but that ’s not good enough , ” the San Francisco Chronicle said in an editorial , proposing a revamp of the nominating system .

" He was superglued to the seat ... his hands were superglued , as were his feet and then his mouth was superglued shut , " a Netcare 911 spokesman said .

The moment at which an incumbent becomes a lame duck fluctuates in every US administration , depending on circumstances .
The day on which the first votes are cast is traditionally the symbolic date , even though the race has been under way in the media for months .
This year 's riveting contests in New Hampshire certainly proved that true , overshadowing whatever interest there was in Bush 's plans for influencing the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
Even before the president left Washington , expectations for his visit were low .
His much - trumpeted meeting of Middle Eastern leaders in Annapolis in November produced a predictably tinny follow - up .
Little happened in the subsequent six weeks , and it was only courtesy to Bush that impelled Ehud Olmert and Mahmoud Abbas to meet again in advance of the president 's touchdown in Tel Aviv on Wednesday and produce the blandest pretence of progress .
According to Olmert 's spokesman , they agreed to " authorise their negotiating teams to conduct direct and ongoing negotiations on all the core issues " .
Is n't this tautological statement merely a repeat of what they had already launched in Annapolis ?
Bush 's engagement in the world 's most intractable dispute is late , piecemeal and phoney .
Above all , it is one - sided .
As Ghassan Khatib , a former Palestinian minister , remarked this week : " Palestinians agree that in the history of the United States , Bush is more biased toward Israel than any other American president . "
In any conflict , responsibility for making the largest concessions always rests on the stronger party , especially when most of the wrong is on its side .
But , despite his rhetoric yesterday , Bush has not used Washington 's enormous leverage over Israel to end the occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem .
He has not even applied pressure for an end to the expansion of Israeli settlements or the dismantling of the spider 's web of roadblocks that make normal life for Palestinians impossible .
A US plan for benchmarks by which to judge Israeli progress was quickly abandoned last spring at the first whiff of concern by Olmert 's government .
Occasional state department pronouncements disapproving of settlement expansion are not followed by measures to reflect US anger when - as happened in Jerusalem again on Wednesday - Olmert makes it clear he will continue the illegal construction of Israeli homes .
Any talk of dealing with " core issues " is meaningless without measures to reduce the daily hardships of Palestinians and end the kidnapping of hundreds of Palestinian leaders .
About 40 Palestinian
MPs who were seized after Hamas 's election victory two years ago remain in Israeli prisons , uncharged and seemingly forgotten by Bush and other western governments .
US and European policies towards Hamas remain hopelessly unjust and counterproductive .
In the first phase of the so - called roadmap that Bush boasts of having revived , Palestinians are supposed to build the institutions of a responsible state .
Yet Israel and the US continue to do all they can to undermine this laudable goal by blatantly taking sides in the rivalry between Fatah and Hamas .
Bush 's comment yesterday in Ramallah about the situation in Gaza was one of history 's most extraordinary examples of tunnel vision .
" Hamas has delivered nothing but misery for Palestinians , " he declared .
Had he said , " My reaction and that of my Israeli and European Union colleagues to the mandate given Hamas by Palestinian voters has delivered nothing but misery for Palestinians " , he would have been closer to the truth .
The human catastrophe deliberately inflicted on Gaza by western policies over the past two years is one of the great crimes of this century so far .
It is especially unjustified since Hamas had been observing a truce in its attacks on Israelis for several months prior to winning the " free , fair and open elections " that the roadmap asked for .
Hamas was , and continues to be , punished not for its occasional use of violence but simply for being popular .
And , as often happens with sanctions , it is not the leaders who suffer , but the whole civilian population of the territory - deprived of medicine , adequate food , public services and jobs .
Rather than pursuing the chimera of a final settlement that would mean nothing without Hamas 's endorsement , western policy should focus on more manageable humanitarian and political goals : lifting the boycott of Hamas , promoting Palestinian unity , and forcing Israel to end its brutal siege of Gaza .
Bush is not the first US president to take an interest in the Middle East in the last year of an eight - year period of office .
Bill Clinton also applied his mind to it in the dying months of his second term .
Yet his performance was very different : Clinton had endorsed the Oslo process early in his first term , and showed considerable energy in pushing it forward and supporting the new Palestinian Authority .
Later , in spite of being a lame duck by the year 2000 , he tried hard to get agreement between Arafat and Barak at Camp David , on a final settlement that was not loaded overwhelmingly in Israel 's favour .
It was a model of how American presidents can act more firmly when released from the pressures of seeking election .
It only needs an effort of will for a lame duck to become the bald eagle of enlightened US power .
In contrast , Bush 's current visit to the region is nothing more than a display of partisan cynicism , coupled with the hope that if some sort of interim deal is signed this year between Olmert and Abbas , it would erase Washington 's failures in Iraq .
Where does that leave Palestinians as the gathering wave of US primaries prepares to reveal the last two candidates for the Bush succession ?
Will they have to wait as long as 2016 before President Clinton or President Obama is free enough to confront Israeli intransigence and to insist on concessions ?
Neither candidate has yet given any sign of breaking away from traditional pro-Israeli views of the problem , so once again Palestinians may have to wait for the eighth - year miracle .
Windows of opportunity open so rarely , yet the need for early action has never been more urgent .

BAGHDAD  When President Bush convened a meeting of his National Security Council on May 22 , 2003 , his special envoy in Iraq made a statement that caught many of the participants by surprise .
In a video presentation from Baghdad , L. Paul Bremer III informed the president and his aides that he was about to issue an order formally dissolving Iraq ’s Army .
The decree was issued the next day .
The broad outlines of the decision are now widely known , defended by proponents as necessary to ensure that Saddam Hussein ’s influence did not outlive his ouster from power .
But with the fifth anniversary of the start of the war approaching , some participants have provided in interviews their first detailed , on - the - record accounts of a decision that is widely seen as one of the most momentous and contentious of the war , assailed by critics as all but ensuring that American forces would face a growing insurgency led by embittered Sunnis who led much of the army .
The account that emerges from those interviews , and from access to previously unpublished documents , makes clear that Mr. Bremer ’s decree reversed an earlier plan  one that would have relied on the Iraqi military to help secure and rebuild the country , and had been approved at a White House meeting that Mr. Bush convened just 10 weeks earlier .
Try these at your own risk .
STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN
Cosmo ’s Erotic Instructions :
“ Sit on the second - to - last ( rock - hard ) stair in the shallow end of the pool with your legs spread …
Have your man stand between your legs with his arms on either side of you as he enters you .
He can lean on his hands for leverage as he thrusts wildly . ”
Smashing your spine and tailbone against the textured concrete stairs as skin tears away from your ass , back , elbows and his shins .
LADDER LOVIN ’
Cosmo ’s Erotic Instructions :
“ This position requires some maneuvering .
( And a complete disregard for personal safety . )
Climb down to the second - to - last rung of the pool ladder .
Do a 180 , holding the ( suntan oil - soaked ) rails , so your back is to the wall .
Lean forward and spread your legs so your guy can lower himself behind you and place his feet between your legs on the rung below you .
( I ’m gonna need a diagram , please .
Possibly a training video . )
Adjust your bodies so he can slip himself inside you . ”
And knock you face - first into the water with his first thrust .
Unless only one hand breaks free , in which case you ’ll simply spin and fall hard , tangling and cutting your legs in the ladder .
Erotically , of course .
( Not to mention the pain inflicted on Little Bruno when your full body weight drops on him unexpectedly . )
I know people who have trouble using these ladders for their intended purpose , let alone as an improvised sex platform .
( And by the way , has anyone ever seen a ladder like this anywhere but a public pool ? )
SEXY SPRINKLER
Cosmo ’s Erotic Instructions :
“ Save this position for a day or night when you two have the backyard to yourselves .
( So you ’re saying during the family barbecue is a bad idea , Cosmobvious ? )
Stand beside a soft - spraying sprinkler and bend over so the water hits your genitals …
Your partner should stand behind you and put his hands around your waist as he enters you . ”
More humorous than hazardous – although the high probability of a neighbor calling the cops or hitting the front page of YouTube with the video he shot of you , does add some danger .
But to pull this off , you ’ll just need a few minor things : 1 – A “ soft - spraying ” sprinkler , shooting up , as pictured , at an angle I have never seen before , instead of all over , as sprinklers are designed to do .
2 – The absence of the nine other sprinklers that typically work together to water your lawn .
Unless sex in the “ rain ” is your thing .
3 – A way to get warm water to come out of the sprinkler , instead of the usual ice cold water .
4 – A woman willing to be outside , bent over , completely naked , cold water shooting into her “ genitals ” , with soaking wet hair .
And running mascara .
5 – A snorkel to keep her from drowning as you erotically hold her head over an active sprinkler .
SLIPPERY WHEN WET
Cosmo ’s Erotic Instructions :
“ Stand facing the side of the tub directly under the showerhead with water running .
( “ With water running ” ?
Anyone ever say , “ Hey baby .
Wanna go stand in a dry shower and have sex ?
The smell of mildew and soap scum gets me hot . ” )
Lean slightly forward , keeping your back straight and your hands on your thighs .
( Because bracing yourself against the wall would be the intelligent thing to do . )
Your man stands behind you and holds your waist as he enters you .
He can intensify the action ( and the probability of falling and breaking a kneecap ) , by pulling you back and forth . ”
BREAKING THE WAVES
Cosmo ’s Erotic Instructions :
“ Your partner sits cross -legged at the shoreline or in shallow water .
Straddle his lap with your knees planted on either side of him as you lower yourself onto his member .
( Am I the only one who thinks the word “ member ” is funny ? )
Rest your hands on his shoulders , and have him place his hands on your butt so he can help you move up and down . ”
While not appearing dangerous at first glance , let ’s look at this carefully .
How many shorelines have you been on that were n’t covered in shells , rocks , broken glass , jagged driftwood , or even hypodermic needles ?
And look at whose naked , exposed ass is nestled right down in there .
While she “ moves up and down ” .
Hmmm .
Lots of shells , rocks and other sharp stuff .
Sensitive exposed opening .
That ’s an explanation I do not want to be giving to the admissions nurse at the ER .
In fairness to Cosmo , here are three that you can try without needing medical insurance or a good bail bondsman :
HOT - TUB-HUG
You can argue therapeutic benefits all you want , hot tubs were made for sex .
Why you would need written instructions for how to do it , I have no idea .
But Cosmo has them if you click here .
They do suggest she “ take advantage of this you - on - top pose to titillate his pleasure - receptive nipples . ”
Always a welcome plus .
But they do forget to mention strategically placing the water jets .
DEEP -WATER DARE
She ’s weightless .
You have the excitement of being in public without the danger of getting caught .
Waves add to the motion .
Perfect unless you live near the Great Barrier Reef .
Or her bottoms float out to sea .
>
RANDY RAFT
And , finally , the perfect position for you less active guys out there – you get to have great sex , can raise and lower her legs to hit different angles like a pro , and at the same time put out very little effort .
There might even be room on the raft for your beer .

Posted under , , ,
We 're currently in the midst of building the new web property I alluded to in a previous post .
Before I write a single line of code , I want to have a pretty clear idea of what the user interface will look like first .
I 'm in complete agreement with Rick Schaut here :
When you 're working on end - user software , and it does n't matter if you 're working on a web app , adding a feature to an existing application , or working on a plug - in for some other application , you need to design the UI first .
This is hard for a couple of reasons .
The first is that most programmers , particularly those who 've been trained through University - level computer science courses , learned how to program by first writing code that was intended to be run via the command line .
As a consequence , we learned how to implement efficient algorithms for common computer science problems , but we never learned how to design a good UI .
Of course , UI is hard , far harder than coding for developers .
It 's tempting to skip the tough part and do what comes naturally -- start banging away in a code window with no real thought given to how the user will interact with the features you 're building .
Remember , to the end user , the interface is the application .
Does n't it make sense to think about that before firing up the compiler ?
It 's certainly true that there are limitations on how the UI can be built based on the technology you 're using .
Just because some pixels can be arranged a certain way in Photoshop does n't mean that can magically be turned into a compiling , shippable product in any sane timeframe .
To ameliorate that problem , take advantage of visual design patterns .
If you 're building a GUI application , use a palette of widgets common to your GUI .
If you 're building a web application , use a palette of HTML , CSS , and DOM elements from all over the web .
Let the palette enforce your technology constraints .
It should n't be difficult to sit down with a few basic tools and slap together a rough mockup of how the user interface will look .
However , it is extremely important at this point to stay out of technical development environments when mocking your user interface , or the temptation to turn the model into the product may be too strong for your team to resist .
Try to avoid the prototype pitfall .
So how do we prototype the UI without relying on our development tools ?
One way is simple paper prototyping .
The book Paper Prototyping : The Fast and Easy way to Design and Refine User Interfaces is an excellent introduction to paper prototyping .
You can interactively browse sections of this book at Amazon , through Google Books , and the book 's own dedicated web site .
There 's a certain timelessness to paper prototyping that holds a deep appeal , as Jacob Nielsen points out :
Paper prototyping has a second benefit , besides its impact on your current design project 's quality .
It will also benefit your career .
Consider all the other books you 've read about computers , Web design , and similar topics .
How much of what you learned will still be useful in ten years ?
In twenty years ?
In the immortal words of my old boss , Scott McNealy , technology has the shelf life of a banana .
In contrast , the paper prototyping technique has a shelf life closer to that of , say , paper .
Once you 've learned paper prototyping , you can use it in every project you do for the rest of your career .
I have no idea what user interface technologies will be popular in twenty years , but I do know that I 'll have to subject those designs to usability evaluation , and that paper prototyping will be a valuable technique for running early studies .
Paper prototypes are usually pitched in terms of doing low - fi usability studies , and rightly so .
But I find a paper prototype tremendously helpful even if I 'm the only one that ever sees it .
I need to create an image in my mind of what I 'm building , as it will be seen by the world , before I start pouring the concrete to make it real .
If you need any more convincing that paper prototyping is an incredibly valuable tool -- even for mere developers -- consider the advice of Jared Spool 's company , User Interface Engineering :
I also recommend reading through Common Concerns about Paper Prototyping if you 're still on the fence .
But what happens when you outgrow paper prototying ?
Jensen Harris , one of the principal UI designers on the Office 2007 team , first introduced me to PowerPoint prototyping :
We use PowerPoint as kind of a better version of [ Office 2007 ] paper prototypes .
This technique has several advantages : prototypes can be made to feel somewhat interactive , because the content is electronic it can be modified more easily than paper , and ( best of all ) the usability participant uses the mouse and is on the computer , so it feels natural to them .
Of course , it does n't have to be PowerPoint .
Use whatever tool you like , as long as it's not a development tool .
You do n't want something too powerful .
What you want is mild interactivity while remaining simple and straightforward for quick iterative changes .
That 's the logical next step up from paper prototyping .
It 's a lot easier to share this digital artifact on a distributed team than it is to share a bunch of physical paper .
If you 're curious about the nuts and bolts of PowerPoint prototyping , dig in :
The pursuit of UI - First software development is more important than any particular tool .
Use paper , use PowerPoint , use Keynote , use whatever makes sense to you .
As long as you avoid , in the words of Manuel Clement , pouring concrete too early .
How does your team practice UI - First software development ?
Here is the transcript of the interview :
JEREMY PAXMAN : Good evening , welcome to a Newsnight special in which we 'll be cross-examining the Prime Minister on the confrontation with Iraq .
After yesterday 's performance at the UN America looks more determined than ever to go to war .
Our government is George Bush 's closest ally yet many here and around the world would not believe the case for war has been made .
Tonight in the Baltic Centre in Gateshead we 've invited the Prime Minister to face an audience of ordinary people from here in the north - east , all of whom are sceptical about the arguments for war with Iraq .
Facing them is the Prime Minister .
He has confessed himself worried he has not yet made the case for war .
Tonight , taking questions from our audience and from me he 'll have the chance to do so .
Prime Minister , for you to commit British forces to war there has to be a clear and imminent danger to this country - what is it ?
TONY BLAIR :
The danger is that if we allow Iraq to develop chemical , biological , and nuclear weapons they will threaten their own region , there is no way that we would be able to exclude ourselves from any regional conflict there was there as indeed we had to become involved last time they committed acts of external aggression against Kuwait .
JEREMY PAXMAN : But right now there is no danger , it 's a danger some time in the future .
TONY BLAIR : I 've never said that Iraq was about to launch an attack on Britain but if you look at the history of Saddam Hussein there is absolutely no doubt at all that he poses a threat to his region .
If he was to use chemical , biological and nuclear weapons in the rest of his region , there is no way that Britain could stand aside from that , or indeed the rest of the world .
And that is precisely why we have had 12 years of United Nations resolutions against him .
JEREMY PAXMAN : Well you said of those UN resolutions and the sanctions which followed them in the year 2000 , you said that they had contained him .
What 's happened since ?
TONY BLAIR : I did n't actually , I said they 'd been contained him up to a point and the fact is -
JEREMY PAXMAN : I 'm sorry Prime Minister - we believe that the sanctions regime has effectively contained Saddam Hussein in the last ten years , you said that in November 2000 .
TONY BLAIR : Well I can assure you I 've said every time I 'm asked about this , they have contained him up to a point and the fact is the sanctions regime was beginning to crumble , it 's why it 's subsequent in fact to that quote we had a whole series of negotiations about tightening the sanctions regime but the truth is the inspectors were put out of Iraq so -
JEREMY PAXMAN : They were not put out of Iraq , Prime Minister , that is just not true .
The weapons inspectors left Iraq after being told by the American government that bombs will be dropped on the country .
TONY BLAIR : I 'm sorry , that is simply not right .
What happened is that the inspectors told us that they were unable to carry out their work , they could n't do their work because they were n't being allowed access to the sites .
They detailed that in the reports to the Security Council .
On that basis , we said they should come out because they could n't do their job properly .
JEREMY PAXMAN : That was n't what you said , you said they were thrown out of Iraq -
TONY BLAIR :
Well they were effectively because they could n't do the work they were supposed to do
JEREMY PAXMAN : No , effectively they were not thrown out of Iraq , they withdraw .
TONY BLAIR : No I sorry Jeremy , I 'm not allowing you away with that , that is completely wrong .
Let me just explain to you what happened .
JEREMY PAXMAN : You 've just said the decision was taken by the inspectors to leave the country .
They were therefore not thrown out .
TONY BLAIR :
They were effectively thrown out for the reason that I will give you .
Prior to them leaving Iraq they had come back to the Security Council , again and again , and said we are not being given access to sites .
For example , things were being designated as presidential palaces , they were n't being allowed to go in there .
As a result of that , they came back to the United Nations and said we can't carry out the work as inspectors ; therefore we said you must leave because we will have to try and enforce this action a different way .
So when you say the inspectors , when you imply the inspectors were in there doing their work , that is simply not the case .
JEREMY PAXMAN : I did not imply that , I merely stated the fact that they were not thrown out , they were withdrawn .
And you concede they were withdrawn .
TONY BLAIR :
They were withdrawn because they could n't do their job .
I mean let 's not be ridiculous about this , there 's no point in the inspectors being in there unless they can do the job they 're put in there to do .
And the fact is we know that Iraq throughout that time was concealing its weapons .
JEREMY PAXMAN : Right .
TONY BLAIR : Well hang on , you say right , they were concealing their weapons , they lied both about the existence of their nuclear weapons programme and their biological weapons programme and it was only when people were interviewed , when they defected from the Iraq regime and were interviewed , that we discovered the existence , full existence of those programmes at all .
JEREMY PAXMAN : Has not Colin Powell demonstrated yesterday , quite conclusively , that a regime in which those weapons inspectors are back in Iraq is one in which it is impossible for Saddam Hussein to continue developing weapons of mass destruction ?
TONY BLAIR : No , because what he is doing is engaging in a systematic campaign of concealment and what Colin Powell was doing yesterday was giving evidence , for example , intelligence evidence and other evidence , of direct conversations which are evidence of the concealment is happening .
We still do n't know , for example , what has happened to the thousands of litres of botulin and anthrax that were unaccounted for when the inspectors left in 1999 .
So , you know , the idea that -
JEREMY PAXMAN : And you believe American intelligence ?
TONY BLAIR : Well I do actually believe this intelligence -
JEREMY PAXMAN : Because there are a lot of dead people in an aspirin factory in Sudan who do n't .
TONY BLAIR : Come on .
This intelligence is backed up by our own intelligence and in any event , you know , we 're not coming to this without any history .
I mean let 's not be absurdly naïve about this -
JEREMY PAXMAN : Hans Blix said he saw no evidence of hiding of weapons .
TONY BLAIR : I 'm sorry , what Hans Blix has said is that the Iraqis are not cooperating properly .
JEREMY PAXMAN : Hans Blix said he saw no evidence , either of weapons manufacture , or that they had been concealed .
TONY BLAIR : No , I do n't think again that is right .
I think what he said was that the evidence that he had indicated that the Iraqis were not cooperating properly and that , for example , he thought that the nerve agent VX may have been weaponised .
And he also said that the discovery of the war heads might be - I think I 'm quoting here - may be the tip of an iceberg .
I think you 'll find that in that report .
JEREMY PAXMAN : You produced a dossier last September in which you outlined Iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction .
All the sites in that report were visited by UN inspectors who found no evidence of the weapons or no evidence of there having been hidden .
TONY BLAIR : I 'm sorry , it is absolutely clear what has been happening over the past few months , which is of course , I mean the moment we mentioned those in our intelligence reports we were aware of the fact that the Iraqis would then have a significant period of time in which they could conceal these weapons .
But , you know , if this were some country that we had no history of this problem with and this was the first time anyone had ever raised the issue , there might be a point in what you 're saying .
It is absurd in the case -
JEREMY PAXMAN : But you concede it 's true -
TONY BLAIR : I do n't concede it 's true at all .
It is absurd ¿
JEREMY PAXMAN : Well , your own foreign minister Mike O'Brian said it is true .
TONY BLAIR :
It is absurd to say in a situation where Iraq has definitely had these weapons , developed them over a long period of time , concealed them , that there is nothing to be suspicious of when they can't even account for the weapons that we know were there when the Inspectors left in 1999 .
JEREMY PAXMAN : Right , let 's hear from our first member of the audience .
Lesley Farrow , what do you make of the evidence ?
( Male 1 ) I do n't think there 's sufficient evidence at the moment , like when Mr Bush yesterday come out with this supposedly new evidence I do n't think there was anything there .
TONY BLAIR :
Well what there was , was evidence , I mean this is what our intelligence services are telling us and it's difficult because , you know , either they 're simply making the whole thing up or this is what they are telling me , as the Prime Minister , and I 've no doubt what the American Intelligence are telling President Bush as well .
And that is that there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq , we know they were there before , but the Iraqis are now trying to conceal those .
But although they 're allowing the inspectors access to sites they 're not actually fully co-operating with inspectors , for example , they 're not allowing the experts that worked on these programmes to be interviewed properly by the inspectors , and what Colin Powell was talking about at the UN yesterday was the systematic attempt to try and conceal this , to disperse it into the country so that it could n't be found by the inspectors .
So , we 're faced with a situation where , I mean , here am I as Prime Minister , this is the evidence that 's coming to me day in , day out , and I think it would just be wrong of us and irresponsible of me not to act on that .
Now , if Iraq wanted to co-operate with the weapons inspectors they could do it perfectly easily .
They could say here are all the experts that have worked on our programme , come and interview them free from Iraqi minders , not in designated places , this is what has happened to the stuff that was left over from the inspectors before .
If they did all that they would be co-operating , and then I agree with you , it would be a different situation .
( Male 1 ) So how come America has got spy satellites and they can't seem to pick anything up .
TONY BLAIR : Well they are of course picking things up .
( Male 1 ) They do n't seem to be picking any mass weapons up of anything other .
TONY BLAIR :
Well they 're picking up certainly movement of material and one of the things that Colin Powell was talking about yesterday was the movement of material shortly before an inspection took place .
So , you know , you 've got to put it all together and make a judgement .
JEREMY PAXMAN : The gentleman next to you .
( Male 2 ) Prime Minister , you must see the evidence that was presented yesterday as laughable , it was Morecambe and Wise - esque - the warhead sketch .
It was just absolutely laughable what Colin Powell put in front of the UN yesterday .
TONY BLAIR : Well I do n't think it was laughable at all .
JEREMY PAXMAN : You 've put your point of view , the Prime Minister has said that he accepts the evidence .
Monica Frisch .
TONY BLAIR : Well can I just deal with this for a moment .
Look , leave aside what 's been happening in the last few months and all the debate about whether we have a war in Iraq or not .
I mean , you would n't dispute with me that this is a barbaric and appalling regime .
( Male 2 ) :
I would say to you Prime Minister that the war is to get rid of a despotic dictator who has no real democratic mandate , who 's very destabilising , who commits human rights violations .
Is Mr. Bush next perhaps ?
TONY BLAIR : Well , you think Saddam 's the same as George Bush .
( Male 2 ) I 'm saying Mr. Bush has a lot of comparisons .
TONY BLAIR : I think that 's a bit unfair you know .
I do n't think George Bush has quite done that .
JEREMY PAXMAN : Right Monica Frish .
Female 1 : I 'm totally opposed to anyone having , or developing nuclear weapons .
But that goes for British and American nuclear weapons as well .
This country has lots of nuclear weapons and the United States has nuclear weapons .
The United States has dropped nuclear bombs , do n't let us forget that .
How can we possibly justify criticising Iraq for developing nuclear weapons when we 're doing so little to get rid of our own .
Is n't it incredibly hypocritical ?
JEREMY PAXMAN : Prime Minister ?
TONY BLAIR : I do n't believe so for two reasons .
First of all we 're obviously part of a whole lot of agreements to do with nuclear weapons .
Secondly , Britain has not menaced and used external aggression with these types of weapons against our neighbours .
You know , Saddam , every time he has been allowed to do so has started a war with the countries around him .
He used chemical weapons against the Iranians some years ago .
He invaded Kuwait shortly afterwards .
I mean he is , you know , in a sense I can totally understand the argument about whether the war is right or wrong and I understand the concerns that people have , I genuinely do , which is one of the reasons I wanted to do the programme tonight - to try and answer some of those concerns .
But the one thing I hope we can all agree on is that Saddam Hussein is in a different category from virtually any other regime in the world in terms of his use of appalling repression against his own people , external aggression against other people and the fact is , he is the one power in this world that has actually used chemical weapons against his own people .
JEREMY PAXMAN :
Prime Minister , if you 're looking at countries in the Middle East that have got arsenals of chemical weapons , I mean what about a country like Syria which has the biggest chemical weapons arsenal in that part of the world , and whose president you invite to this country to have tea with the Queen .
TONY BLAIR : But he has not started a war with his neighbours , using those weapons .
JEREMY PAXMAN : Yes - well - not using those weapons - he 's had wars with Israel .
TONY BLAIR : Well , I mean , look , well there is a real issue to do with Syria and terrorism which is important . -
JEREMY PAXMAN : It 's a state sponsor of terrorism
TONY BLAIR :
Hang on , Syria has not started a war with its neighbours .
Saddam twice , in fact every time he 's been allowed to .
First of all the war with Iran in which a million people died .
Secondly , the invasion of Kuwait .
Now Syria is not in that category .
I 'm not saying there are n't issues to do with Syria .
There are issues to do with Syria and we can get on to those .
But the one point that I 'm simply making to you is that this is not an issue that comes with no history and a history particularly relevant to the nature of this regime - that 's all I 'm saying .
JEREMY PAXMAN : Is there one more person from the audience ?
Yes .
Female 2 : Yes , I think we should be adopting a policy of contain and deter with the Iraq conflict .
JEREMY PAXMAN : Contain and deter ?
Female : Yes , and I 'm very concerned that we 're following the US along a line of conflict and war and I do n't understand why we 're taking that line .
TONY BLAIR : Well , let 's go back to this issue of containment , because I agree of all the arguments against this , this is the best one .
I mean , OK Saddam 's a bad man , he 's a terrible man , he 's got these weapons but can't we work out a policy of containment .
Now the reason I was saying to Jeremy earlier , containment worked up to a point is this , that there were two methods that we had to contain him .
One was the method of sanctions which , because of the way he implements those sanctions is actually a pretty brutal policy against the Iraqi people .
Sixty per cent of the Iraqi people need food aid in order to survive , even though it 's actually a wealthy country and the fact is , with a different regime , without these weapons , sanctions could be lifted and the Iraqi people would in fact be far better off .
But anyway , that 's one element of the containment which is sanctions .
But what we were finding , really in the year 2001 when we were trying to negotiate a new sanctions regime , was that those sanctions were no longer working properly .
What the sanctions were supposed to do was to stop him selling oil except for food and medicine .
But we were finding , and I think in 2001 round about $ 3 billion worth was being leached away through illicit sales of that oil .
So the sanctions were n't working that well .
The second part of it was the inspectors , and as we were saying earlier , I mean you can split hairs about did they leave or were they thrown out .
But the fact is they could n't do their job .
And therefore , the second part of containment we were n't able to do .
Now the reason for going back down the UN path , some people wanted to go to war last year .
I said no , we have got to go down the UN path .
Put the inspectors back in there because we could have then , if the inspection regime was working properly we could have made the policy of containment work .
But the inspectors can only do their work with the co-operation of the Iraqis .
JEREMY PAXMAN : Right , you said of those weapons inspectors that they needed time and space to be able to do their job .
How much time ?
TONY BLAIR :
The time to make a judgement as to whether Iraq is co-operating or not , because the inspectors are n't there as a detective agency , it 's not a game of hide and seek .
What is supposed to happen is that the Iraqis are supposed to co-operate , actively , as Kofi Annan said , with the inspectors .
They 're not doing that at the moment .
JEREMY PAXMAN : OK , so they report back next week .
Will you give an undertaking to this audience , and indeed to the British people that before any military action you will seek another UN Resolution , specifically authorising the use of force .
TONY BLAIR : We 've said that that 's what we want to do .
JEREMY PAXMAN : But you have n't given an explicit commitment that those are the only circumstances under which British forces will be used .
TONY BLAIR : I have n't but what I 've said is this - those are the only circumstances in which we would agree to use force except for one caveat that I 've entered .
And I 'll explain exactly why I 've done this .
If the inspectors do report that they can't do their work properly because Iraq is not co-operating there 's no doubt that under the terms of the existing United Nations Resolution that that 's a breach of the Resolution .
In those circumstances there should be a further Resolution .
If , however , a country were to issue a veto because there has to be unanimity amongst the permanent members of the Security Council .
If a country unreasonably in those circumstances put down a veto then I would consider action outside of that .
JEREMY PAXMAN :
But Prime Minister , this is , you say , all about a man defying the wishes of the United Nations .
You can not have it both ways .
If one of the permanent five members of the Security Council uses its veto and you , with your friend George Bush , decide somehow that this is unreasonable , you can't then consider yourself absolutely free to defy the express will of the Security Council .
What 's it for otherwise ?
TONY BLAIR : First of all , let me make two points in relation to that .
Firstly you can't just do it with America , you have to get a majority in the Security Council .
Secondly , because the issue of a veto does n't even arise unless you get a majority in the Security Council .
Secondly , the choice that you 're then faced with is this .
If the will of the UN is the thing that is most important and I agree that it is , if there is a breach of Resolution 1441 which is the one that we passed .
If there is a breach and we do nothing then we have flouted the will of the UN .
JEREMY PAXMAN : We have flouted the will of the UN .
TONY BLAIR : If we do n't act in those circumstances .
Look ¿
JEREMY PAXMAN : Are you saying there 's already an authorisation for war ?
TONY BLAIR : No , what I 'm saying is this .
In the Resolution that we passed last November we said that Iraq , it 's actually interesting to look at the Resolution .
Iraq had what was called a final opportunity to comply .
The duty of compliance was defined as full co-operation with the UN Inspectors .
The Resolution then goes on to say " any failure to co-operate fully is a breach of this Resolution and serious consequences i.e. action , would follow " .
Now , we then also put in that
Resolution that there will be a further discussion in the Security Council .
But the clear understanding was that if the inspectors do say that Iraq is not complying and there is a breach of that resolution , then we have to act .
Now if someone comes along and says , OK I accept there 's a breach of Resolution 1441 but I 'm issuing a veto I think that would be unreasonable .
Incidentally I do n't think that 's what will happen .
I think that we will , if the inspectors do end up in a situation where they 're saying there is not compliance by Iraq then I think a second resolution will issue .
FEMALE : Do you not agree that most of Britain do n't want us to act alone without the United Nations , and do you not agree that it 's important to get France , Germany and Russia on board with support to help us ?
TONY BLAIR : Yes I do .
I agree with that .
That 's what I 'm trying to get .
So ¿
JEREMY PAXMAN : Why not give an undertaking that you would n't go to war without their agreement .
TONY BLAIR : Because supposing one of those countries - I 'm not saying this will happen , I do n't believe it will incidentally .
But supposing in circumstances where there plainly was a breach of Resolution 1441 and everyone else wished to take action , one of them put down a veto .
In those circumstances it would be unreasonable .
Then I think it would be wrong because otherwise you could n't uphold the UN .
Because you 'd have passed your Resolution and then you 'd have failed to act on it .
JEREMY PAXMAN : And who are we to say it's " unreasonable " as you put it ?
TONY BLAIR :
You say that , if in circumstances where the inspectors - not us - have come back to the UN and said we can't do our job .
Now look - I think it 's a perfectly simple way of putting this thing and incidentally , I do n't believe we 'll get to the stage of vetoes and so on .
I think we 'll be in the position that you 're talking about .
Now the reason I wanted this to go down the UN path last year .
I mean , in the summer people were thinking you were about to start the war .
Myself and other people said , no , we 've got to take this back to the United Nations and go through the UN route .
And I think we will be in circumstances where the UN passed the second Resolution and I take it in the sense from what you 're saying I think this is where the majority of people are .
Is that if the UN did pass a second Resolution people would support it .
LAURA SEWELL : I 'd like to know if the UK and the US just ignore the UN , just go ahead with war without a UN Resolution .
How can you expect any other country to listen to the UN in the future ?
TONY BLAIR : Well , that comes back to the point that we 're making .
The first thing is that it would be odd to say that we 'd ignored the UN since ¿
LAURA SEWELL : What if you go against a UN Resolution , are you not ¿
TONY BLAIR : We must n't go against the UN Resolution .
SEWELL : If you go without the UN Resolution .
TONY BLAIR :
The point that I 'm making is this .
There are only one set of circumstances .
I mean the reason I wo n't give the absolute undertaking that Jeremy was asking me to give , is because of this one set of circumstances where Resolution 1441 , the one that has been passed , where everyone 's agreed on .
If that is breached and the inspectors say , no I 'm sorry we can't do our job and in those circumstances the Resolution 1441 effectively says well then a second Resolution issues .
If someone then at that point vetoes wrongly , what do we do ?
FEMALE : It 's only you that thinks it 's wrong , like George Bush thinks that they 're doing that unreasonably .
TONY BLAIR : No , no ¿
FEMALE : It 's the point of the veto , not that that can happen in that sort of situation .
TONY BLAIR : What happens is that there are 15 members of the Security Council , there 's five permanent members and the five permanent members have got the veto .
The other ones do n't .
Now , the issue of a veto only arises if we 've got a majority of people on the Security Council with us , so there 's not - Britain and America that would be doing this on our own in any event .
JEREMY PAXMAN :
Who else is concerned about this business of the UN .
Yes , you sir , right in front there .
MALE : Prime Minister - do you not think that this war could cause even more conflict in the Middle East in that this could cause other rogue states to actually go and sit behind Saddam and actually support him - countries like Syria that Jeremy mentioned before .
Iran , countries like that .
JEREMY PAXMAN : Yes , I think we 're going to come to that point and some of the broader possible implications later on but , yes , you sir right in the back row .
MALE : I agree with something that the Rt. Hon Member for Texas North said a few minutes ago ,
TONY BLAIR : I gather you 're not wholly in favour then .
MALE : ¿ which was that there is not likely to be a veto in the Security Council because when Bush ( sic ) comes to shove I think everybody will fall in line .
But aside from that , on the point of the inspectors - is n't it strange , Mr. Vice President that with the information that was displayed to the world by Colin Powell yesterday , that the video evidence , the photographs taken from satellites , why is it then that if this information was available to the US way back in November , December , that it was not given to the UN inspection team to give them some pointers as to where to look at .
Because , one of the things that was said there was the topsoil was removed to take away all traces of chemical agents .
So why was n't that information given to Hans Blix and his team , to say go and look over there >
TONY BLAIR : There 's a very simple explanation for that .
In respect of much of this information it 's only coming to light now .
Some of the intelligence about what has happened earlier has only come to light now .
In respect of other stuff however , we are co-operating with the inspectors .
We are trying to give inspectors the whole time to allow them to do the work .
JEREMY PAXMAN : These were satellite photographs that were taken before , and in one case during , and other cases after , UN inspections .
So they could have been made available to them at any time .
Did they lose them ?
TONY BLAIR : No we do make the information available to the inspectors but where , for example , you have evidence that they 're moving stuff before the inspections , obviously then there 's not much point in the inspections taking place in those circumstances .
Now in fact I think in this particular instance they did do the inspection but you know , do n't be under any doubt at all , we are trying the whole time to co-operate with the inspectors and give them what intelligence we can .
But there is n't really much doubt about what is going on inside Iraq .
They tried to conceal the stuff .
JEREMY PAXMAN : The question referred to you by the way , Prime Minister , as Vice President and Honourable Member for Texas North .
But it 's not just him .
I mean , when a great world figure like Nelson Mandela calls the British Prime Minister the American Foreign Minister - do n't you feel embarrassed ?
TONY BLAIR : I 've huge respect for Nelson Mandela .
But I do n't feel that I 'm doing the wrong thing and I may not be doing the easy thing but I do believe I 'm doing the right thing .
JEREMY PAXMAN : So when people say you 're a poodle ..
TONY BLAIR : Yeah , well you know , you can do that and be the Right Hon Member for Texas and all that .
Look , it depends whether you want to deal with this at the level of humour and satire or whether you want to try and make sense of what are difficult issues .
Now , look , I 'm faced with a situation here where you know , we know the history of Iraq , we know these weapons of mass destruction .
We can see in our own country for example what is happening with the problems of international terrorism .
I simply tell you , you can believe it , do n't believe it .
Now hang on a minute .
I just want to finish this thing .
Because this is the reason I 'm doing what I 'm doing , even though I know that it is difficult and unpopular in certain quarters .
It is a matter of time before these issues of chemical biological nuclear weapons which are now increasingly easy to get hold of with irresponsible , unstable states proliferating them .
It is a question of time before that comes together with international terrorism in a devastating way for this country and other countries in the world .
And , I 've said this before , it may be , even if I 'm the only person left saying it , I 'm going to say it .
It 's a threat and a danger that we have to confront and there 's no reason for these people to have these weapons in this way , there is no reason why they can't co-operate with the UN and these terrorist groups out there they are trying every day as we speak to get hold of this stuff and use it .
These are not separate threats , they 're related and linked .
JEREMY PAXMAN : You know your defence intelligence assessment is that there is currently no link between Baghdad and al - Qaeda .
TONY BLAIR : No they did n't say that .
What they said was - which is absolutely right - is that historically al - Qaeda which wants these Arab states to become religious states .
That al - Qaeda obviously would regard Iraq as a secular state and relations between al - Qaeda and Saddam Hussein would not have been of any great historical importance , that is not to say in circumstances where Iraq faces a threat from possible military action and al - Qaeda have also been subject to action being pursued at international level they are n't coming together and there is evidence that links the two .
I 've never suggested that .
JEREMY PAXMAN : Hang on , with respect , I mean this is the defence intelligence staff terrorism analysis sell a paper to you on the 12th January , there have been contacts between al - Qaeda and the regime in the past .
It is now assessed that any fledgling relationship foundered due to lack of trust .
TONY BLAIR : First of all , it was n't a paper to me .
I mean I know the BBC ...
JEREMY PAXMAN : What , you 're on the circulation list ?
TONY BLAIR : I 'm not actually on the circulation list .
I know the BBC keeps saying it's a paper to me and I'm on the circulation list since we keep telling them that it is n't .
The papers that I get are from the joint intelligence committee .
That was a paper primarily actually about the relations between Iraq and terrorism more generally and I can absolutely assure you the evidence that we have is not that Iraq was responsible for the 11th September or some such thing .
I do n't suggest that .
But what Colin Powell was talking about yesterday is correct .
The poison factory in northern Iraq , not strictly under the control of Saddam , is run by operatives that have people in Baghdad and the stuff that they are producing there which includes ricin and other poisons we believe is being dispersed throughout the world .
Now , I 'm not sitting here and saying to you that 's the reason why we 're taking action against Saddam , it is n't .
But it would not be correct to say there is no evidence linking Al Qaeda and Iraq .
JEREMY PAXMAN : If that danger that you and George Bush perceive apparently independently is as real as you suggest , where else are you prepared to follow him in action ?
TONY BLAIR : You say apparently independently .
I mentioned this issue of weapons of mass destruction in February 2001 , I majored on it in my press conference with George Bush , before 11 September had happened .
Three days after 11th September when I went to the House of Commons I said that the next issue on our agenda is weapons of mass destruction .
The worry is not just Britain and America .
As you can see from the eight other European leaders that signed letters last week , in fact the ten Eastern European Union leaders , and this is a worry to anybody who looks at this seriously .
To be fair to France and Germany , France and Germany may have a difference about how we 're tackling this problem but they do n't have any difference with us in that it is a problem .
JEREMY PAXMAN : All right , let 's take some of these other countries .
I mean , you were asked about North Korea in the Commons last week and you said we have to confront North Korea about its weapons programme .
Well when someone shouted when do we stop , you said we stop when the threat to our security is properly and fully dealt with .
What does that mean ?
TONY BLAIR :
It means that in respect of each of the countries that poses a threat with these weapons of mass destruction , we confront them and try and deal with it and you would deal with it in different ways in different countries .
JEREMY PAXMAN : So you are willing to attack North Korea
TONY BLAIR : No , I 'm not saying that .
But what I am saying is that you cannot ignore the risk .
North Korea is a country , its people are starving , that is virtually living on the export of ballistic missile technology .
Their nuclear scientists are people who are working for other countries as well as North Korea and I 'm simply saying to people , if you allow this stuff to proliferate , if you allow it to be traded in , and there are companies so - called supposedly respectable companies in the world trading in this stuff , the terrorists are trying to get hold of it - they will succeed at some point unless we deal with it .
JEREMY PAXMAN : Prime Minister , you said of Iraq that it was only the threat of force that got the UN weapons inspectors back in there , and you 're not prepared to say the same about North Korea which has , as you know , thrown out inspectors .
TONY BLAIR : Well .
I 'm not saying that in respect of North Korea that I agree with them throwing out the inspectors .
What I 'm saying is you will adopt different strategies for different countries and the UN as you know will have a discussion about North Korea .
JEREMY PAXMAN : So there 's no threat of force against North Korea ?
And when the North Koreans say today that they will themselves engage in pre-emptive strikes if there 's an American military build - up are they not merely following the example that has been set them by the threats that you and George Bush have made ?
TONY BLAIR : No - because as you know , North Korea have withdrawn from the non proliferation treaty , that 's extremely serious .
We are trying to work with other allies now to make sure they come back .
That 's one of the reasons why this is an issue we 've been discussing , I had a conversation about this with President Putin a few days ago .
This is a serious issue .
JEREMY PAXMAN : Yes .
TONY BLAIR :
Well we 're going to have to deal with each of these countries that is doing this .
JEREMY PAXMAN : OK , Ian Davies Davies : Yes , Mr. Prime Minister .
I mean the question has almost been asked already .
TONY BLAIR : There 's a compliment for you .
JEREMY PAXMAN : Let 's see what it is first !
Davies : Since September 11 , obviously the United States has sort of been aggressive towards Afghanistan and now Iraq .
Where it 's going to stop , who 's going to be next ?
TONY BLAIR : Well , you know , where does it stop .
It stops when we 've dealt with these two twin issues which is , as I say , unstable states who are developing weapons of mass destruction and international terrorism .
I think this is the threat the world faces .
Davies :
But does that mean that we 'll be tagging along on Mr. Bush 's shirt - tails all the time ?
TONY BLAIR : No , but it means ...
Davies :
Well that 's what it 's looking like at the moment .
TONY BLAIR : No , we 've got to do what 's right for us .
OK , and what I 'm saying to you is I believe this is a threat that concerns us .
You see , I think that the world we live in today which is an interdependent world , there is no way that any of these states could use this type of weaponry and us not be involved in this in some way .
You saw with Afghanistan or the 11th September attack , there 's no way Britain could have stood apart from that .
I mean we could have taken a back seat , but we were still involved .
You know , the terrorists that are operating in countries today , they 're operating in Britain yes , but they 're operating in France , they 're operating in Sweden , they 're operating in Italy , they 're operating in countries that have n't taken a high profile in this .
Davies :
But it was only last week that the US warned Pakistan about its terrorist links .
Are they going to be next , and bearing in mind that our historic links with Pakistan , what position does that put us in ?
TONY BLAIR : We 've got different strategies , I say , for different countries . ,
Some we will sit down and negotiate with .
The reason why the strategies we have in relation to Iraq is that we 've gone through a history of aggression from Iraq and the United Nations Resolutions are there because of Iraqi aggression .
But you 're not wrong , there are real issues to do with Pakistan .
India and Pakistan and the potential for conflict there , is still a huge issue .
Davies :
Yes but the US warned them regarding their terrorist links last week , it was reported in The Times .
So where do we stand with that warning ?
TONY BLAIR : Well , we fully support that warning .
In fact we 've been talking to the Pakistanis ourselves about doing this .
But , let 's be clear , the difference is that Pakistan does not launch an external war of aggression .
Now , that 's not to say there are n't real issues to do with weapons of mass destruction and Pakistan .
JEREMY PAXMAN : Not recently anyway .
Gentleman in the front row .
MALE : Prime Minister , this has been going on now for 12 years .
Why have we had to wait 12 years to get to this state that we 're in now - why ?
TONY BLAIR : Because we went through a whole process where the inspectors went in ...
MALE : With respect , 12 years - a process - that 's nearly three terms of a government .
TONY BLAIR :
You might say having had 12 years it 's about time you got rid of the weapons .
MALE : Well I think that should have been done a long , long time ago .
TONY BLAIR : Well can I just explain the 12 years , as to what happened .
MALE : What are we going to accomplish with war ?
TONY BLAIR : Disarmament of Iraq , of the weapons of mass destruction .
MALE : And then we move round the world ?
TONY BLAIR : No , we do n't move round the world creating war on everyone , but what we do do is we do confront those countries that have this material and if we can do it through partnership and by agreement with them , we have to reduce the threat that they pose .
Because otherwise this stuff will carry on proliferating and it will be traded round the world and that causes a threat to us .
And just , I 'd like to deal with your 12 years .
Because what actually happened was , in April 1991 when the first UN Resolution was passed people went in .
The inspectors were supposed to be there , a few weeks .
I mean , the way the inspectors are supposed to work is the way they worked in respect of South Africa .
MALE : With respect , when there was this problem with South Africa , South Africa said that 's where they are , that 's where they are , that 's where this is , that 's where this is .
Why has n't somebody told Saddam 12 years ago either do it that way , come out in the open and say you 've got these things - they 're there .
Take them away from him .
TONY BLAIR : But that 's what we 've been saying for 12 years .
But he 's not done it .
MALE : 12 years !
TONY BLAIR :
What you 're really arguing for is that we should have taken action earlier .
JEREMY PAXMAN : There 's a chap here in the front row who 's had his hand up for ages .
MALE : The difference between Korea and Iraq is it purely based on oil , because Iraq 's an oil - producing country and Korea is n't .
TONY BLAIR : No , let me just deal with the oil thing because this is one of the ... we may be right or we may be wrong , I mean people have their different views about why we 're doing this thing .
But the oil conspiracy theory is honestly one of the most absurd when you analyse it .
The fact is that , if the oil that Iraq has were our concern I mean we could probably cut a deal with Saddam tomorrow in relation to the oil .
It 's not the oil that is the issue , it is the weapons , which is why the UN Resolutions have gone over 12 years in relation to the weapons and why we 've actually allowed Iraq to export oil but we 've had to try to keep it in an account used for food and medicine because of our worry that otherwise it would be used to buy arms .
MALE : The three biggest countries against the war at the moment are Russia , China and France and they 've all signed agreement with Saddam to explore the western oilfields .
Is that why they 're against it because they 're frightened that if the US and Britain go in the contracts will be torn up ?
TONY BLAIR : No , I do n't think that 's the reason either actually .
Let 's wait and see where France and Russia and China end up on this .
I mean , there have been differences between ourselves and France , between those countries you 've mentioned and ourselves and the United States .
But let 's just be clear where we 're all in common .
We 're all in common on Resolution 1441 .
We 're all in common that Saddam has to disarm .
We 're all in common that the inspectors are the best way to do it .
But actually , we 're all in common also that if the inspectors can't do it it 's going to have to be done by force .
The only issue between us really is well , when do you make the judgement that the inspectors can do it or not .
MALE : So at this moment in time , in Great Britain everything over the economy everything else , the most frightened thing I should be scared of is Saddam Hussein ?
TONY BLAIR : I think the thing you should be most worried about in terms of security , obviously there are economic issues in our country and the rest of the world today .
But the thing to be most worried about , I would say , yes , is the link between terrorism and weapons of mass destruction .
JEREMY PAXMAN : Can we look , Prime Minister , if it does come to war , about what the possible implications are for us in this country and elsewhere .
You were one of the very first to realise the moment that this all got serious - the importance of addressing the whole Israel - Palestine question .
I suggest to you that going to war with Israel as a tacit ally is likely to make the threat of terror in this country a great deal greater .
TONY BLAIR : I do n't think it will .
First of all , we 're going to be at risk of terrorism in respect of what happens .
Where did the last major terrorist event happen ?
In Bali , in Indonesia , a Moslem country .
There are arrests being made , there have been something like 3,000 arrests made in 90 different countries over the past few months .
If you hide away from this issue you 're not going to stop being a threat .
France has just been arresting people in connection with terrorist events and they 're supposed to be on the other side of the argument .
JEREMY PAXMAN : There have been 66 arrests in Europe in the past two months , 29 of them have been in Pakistan , there have been something like 16 from Algeria , 14 from elsewhere in North Africa , not one of them has been an Iraqi .
TONY BLAIR : What do you prove by that ?
JEREMY PAXMAN : Well I 'm just asking you about the connection between terrorism and the looming war on Iraq .
TONY BLAIR : Well , that 's a different issue actually , what you were asking about I thought was will we make ourselves a bigger terrorist threat , or more threat from terrorists if we engage in military action in Iraq and my point to you is that we are a terrorist threat , we 're going to be a terrorist threat frankly , irrespective of what happens there .
But I do believe that it is very very important that we push the peace process forward on the Middle East .
But I think that 's important in its own terms , irrespective of what happens in Iraq .
JEREMY PAXMAN : Do you consider this a just war do you , if it comes to war ?
TONY BLAIR : I would n't go to war if I did n't consider it right .
But I just want to point this out to you , we could still avoid war today if Saddam did what he should do , and as the gentleman just said there , it 's not a mystery - South African did it .
When they had their nuclear weapons programme shut down they called in the inspectors , they let the experts be interviewed , the experts said well this is what 's happened to the programme , the inspectors said fine - they shut it down .
That 's all he needs to do .
It 's not a mystery .
There 's no difficulty in him knowing what it is we need him to do .
JEREMY PAXMAN : Gentleman in front row .
MALE : Could America - because George Bush has said that his object is regime change in Iraq .
We might be able to avoid war but can Bush without regime change ?
TONY BLAIR : Well , George Bush has gone along with Resolution 1441 as well and it was absolutely clear , last thing we both said last November - if the Iraqis obey this Resolution and as I say , it 's not a mystery what they have to do , all they have to do is agree to do what the inspectors say .
If they did that we would n't even be sitting here having this discussion .
Now , the choice in the end is for them and the reason why I wanted to go through the United Nations is to give them a last chance , is to say , OK you know , we 've had this long history of this thing , there is still an issue here .
We 've got to confront this issue but let 's confront it peacefully so that the UN inspectors do their work .
Now what 's actually happening at the moment , there is massive intimidation going on of their experts and their witnesses to this programme .
They 're effectively told they 'll be killed if they give proper evidence .
They 're not being allowed to come and be interviewed by the inspectors except with a colleague alongside them that is obviously there for the purposes of intimidation .
You know , it could be done so easily if he wanted to do it .
And therefore , when people say you 're hell bent on this war , I 've tried to avoid being in this position and I honestly thought there was some prospect last November when we passed the UN Resolution that he would realise we were serious about this and that if he did n't cooperate he was going to be in trouble .
JEREMY PAXMAN : Rabina Ahmed , in the back row , there , you have concerns about the possible domestic consequences of any war .
FEMALE : Yes Prime Minister , I am a Muslim and I live in Britain .
When you said we have to do what is right by us , does that include me , because I feel that a lot of Asians up and down the country feel threatened if Britain goes to war with Iraq .
Unfortunately Saddam is a madman , in my view - sort him out !
Why do the Iraqi people need to suffer ?
Why do the Muslims in this country , not just the Muslims , the view that British whites have of Asians is everybody is a Muslim .
There is prejudice , there is growing racism -
JEREMY PAXMAN : Do you think it will make race relations worse ?
FEMALE : It will - it will definitely make things worse , it has already reached that point where things are getting bad .
TONY BLAIR : Well I mean I 've been in , I mean I totally understand the point you 're making .
I 've been involved in conflicts twice before .
The first was Kosovo when we went to the help of Kosovo Albanians - who were Muslims - to stop ethnic cleansing , and where we took on Milosevic who is a orthodox Christian .
FEMALE : Yes .
TONY BLAIR : Now I hope that 's some indication that we 're not singling out -
FEMALE : But people have forgotten that .
TONY BLAIR : Well let 's remind them .
FEMALE : After September the 11th everything is linked to Muslim .
Everything seems then to be linked to anyone with a colour that is not white .
TONY BLAIR : Well I mean I agree that that is a perception amongst certain parts of our Muslim community but let me just say this to you .
When we entered Afghanistan , a lot of people said to me then , if you take military action against Afghanistan , this war , this is a problem for , for Muslims .
But actually what has happened in Afghanistan is Afghanistan remains a Muslim country , but people are free - you know , I was just talking to the president of Afghanistan the other day and he was telling me , look we 've got huge problems still in this country but people are free , they can go about their daily business , we 've got now three million children in school , one and a half million of them are girls , girls were n't even allowed to go to school .
You know , those two conflicts , I think are some indication that we try and do what we have to do with care and I just simply say to you , if we do have to come to military action in Iraq and remove Saddam , then I honestly believe the people who will rejoice first will be the Iraqis because they have been the victims of Saddam .
FEMALE : But so many Iraqis , so many British people , so many Americans are going to die .
Innocent blood is going to flow .
TONY BLAIR :
If you get into war and conflict it is true -
FEMALE : Can it be avoided
TONY BLAIR : Well it can be avoided if Saddam abides by the United Nations - if we do take military action , we have to do everything we possibly can to minimise the civilian casualties .
Of course we 've got to do that .
But I simply do say to you , the people that have suffered most from Saddam are the Iraqi people themselves .
I mean I spoke to ten Iraqi exiles the other day , who were women , who described to me , not just the deaths of members of their family , but the appalling human rights abuses , torture , the fact that they were still , some of them , under threat of death - living abroad - from this guy .
I mean , you know , this , this is not a humane regime -
FEMALE : No coming back to my question .
JEREMY PAXMAN : No one denies the man 's a monster .
TONY BLAIR : Yes , but that is of importance then in asking how do you deal with someone - okay let 's accept -
JEREMY PAXMAN : She 's asked you about deaths of innocent people , I mean as a Christian how do you feel about innocent people dying ?
As they always die in war .
APPLAUSE
TONY BLAIR :
That is why you avoid war if you possibly can , and that is why we went through the United Nations .
Now there were innocent people , I 'm afraid as well as guilty that died in Kosovo , and in Afghanistan .
But in the end I felt on both occasions we had no option but to do this .
And I remember at the time of Kosovo , I remember saying no let the peace negotiations go on several more weeks in order to try and get them sorted so that we did n't have to take on Milosevic .
But when you say that Saddam is a monster that is irrelevance , I 'm afraid , to how you deal with the situation because a monster is not somebody you want to allow to develop chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .
JEREMY PAXMAN : The question is what freedom he has under the current inspection regime but we 've discussed that already , I want to explore a little further about your personal feelings about this war .
Does the fact that George Bush and you are both Christians make it easier for you to view these conflicts in terms of good and evil ?
TONY BLAIR : I do n't think so , no , I think that whether you 're a Christian or you 're not a Christian you can try perceive what is good and what is , is evil .
JEREMY PAXMAN : You do n't pray together for example ?
TONY BLAIR : No , we do n't pray together Jeremy , no .
JEREMY PAXMAN : Why do you smile ?
TONY BLAIR : Because - why do you ask me the question ?
JEREMY PAXMAN : Because I 'm trying to find out how you feel about it .
TONY BLAIR : Possibly .
JEREMY PAXMAN : Right , would anyone else like to have a question ?
FEMALE : Yes , I would like to ask do you believe that the people of your country are behind you at the moment ?
TONY BLAIR : I think that , I think if there were a second UN resolution then I think people would be behind me .
I think if there 's not then there 's a lot of persuading to do .
FEMALE : Because I do n't , I do n't share any confidence that the people are behind you at the moment .
Everybody that I 've spoken to within my circle oppose what 's happening at the moment .
APPLAUSE
TONY BLAIR : Supposing there were a second resolution then , would that make a difference ?
FEMALE Yes .
TONY BLAIR : Well .
JEREMY PAXMAN : Prime Minister but you said , in your view , it may be necessary to go to war without a second resolution .
TONY BLAIR : Well I said that in one set of circumstances .
JEREMY PAXMAN : Yes , an unreasonable veto , as you put it .
But if that happened , would you be prepared to go to war despite the fact that apparently the majority of people in this country would not be with you ?
TONY BLAIR :
Well you can only go , obviously , with the support of parliament but I think that if you do get to a situation where the inspectors say , look we can't do , you know , Saddam 's not cooperating with us , we can't do this through inspections and there was n't just the United States and Britain but other countries too were supporting us in that view , so you had a majority of countries in the UN Security Council , I think that would be , I think that would make a difference to people .
And I also think that as , as more emerges about the nature of this regime , as well , I think people , at least I hope they can realise why it is not safe to allow a regime such as this the freedom to develop these weapons .
I understand it is not an easy task because I think the very first point that Jeremy was making to me is the point that is most difficult for people , what is , you know , why now are we suddenly doing this ?
And my answer to that is actually this does have a long history to it and I think the one thing that has changed my thinking about these issues , in relation to the 11th of September , is that , you know , I keep having this mental picture in my mind of August 2001 and coming along to people and saying there 's this terrorist organisation in Afghanistan , they are evil people who will try and mount major terrorist attacks on our country , we 've got to go into Afghanistan and deal with them .
I think people would have said to me , you know you must be crackers what on earth are you on about .
I mean people would n't have even have heard of who al - Qaeda was but a month later it happened .
And I think that if these people could have got hold of an even worse weapon than the weapon they used , in a sense , which was the planes , they would .
And you know , Jeremy talked about 90 arrests , actually as I say , there 's something like 3000 that have gone on in the last few months worldwide .
I just think these , these dangers are there and I think that it 's difficult sometimes for people to see how they all come together but it's my honest belief that they do come together and I think it 's my job as prime minister , even if frankly I might be more popular if I did n't say this to you or said I 'm having nothing to do with George Bush , I think it 's my duty to tell it to you if I really believe it and I do really believe it .
I may be wrong in believing it but I do believe it .
JEREMY PAXMAN : Prime Minister , thank you .
And thank you all and goodnight from the Baltic Centre .

Pakistan culled thousands of birds last year to stop bird flu spreading
The first case of human - to - human transmission of avian flu in Pakistan has been confirmed .
Tests carried out by the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) show that bird flu killed some members of a family in north - west Pakistan late last year .
The WHO says steps were taken to prevent future fatalities in the area .
Pakistan 's north - west and southern regions were hit by bird flu last year .
Thousands of birds were culled to control the spread of the disease .
Brothers
The confirmation of people dying from bird flu came on Thursday , after samples collected from a family in the north - western city of Peshawar tested positive .
Dr Mukhtiar Zaman Afridi , head of the isolation ward for avian flu patients at Khyber Teaching Hospital in Peshawar , told the BBC that a poultry worker in Peshawar apparently passed the disease on to members of his family .
The worker , whose name is being withheld on the request of the WHO , was brought to the hospital with avian flu symptoms on 29 October 2007 , he says .
He has fully recovered since then .
But on 12 November , the elder brother of the poultry worker was brought in with similar symptoms .
He died a week later .
On 21 November , two more brothers of the same worker came down with bird flu .
One of them died on 28 November , while the other has recovered , Dr Afridi said .
Apart from the poultry worker , none of the others was found to have had any direct contact with sick or dead poultry .
Genetic sequencing tests performed by WHO laboratories in Egypt and the US on samples collected from three of the four brothers established human - to - human transmission .
' Appropriate steps '
Serum taken from all three was found to have been infected by the H5N1 avian influenza virus .
A WHO report says the tests suggest " limited human - to - human transmission . "
It adds , however , that this " outbreak did not extend into the community , and appropriate steps were taken to reduce future risks of human infections . "
Pakistan 's north - western region is home to 85 % of the country 's poultry farms .

Later bar - hour push for GOP convention hits early last call

A Minnesota state senator has withdrawn a bill which would have extended drinking hours at local bars during the Republican National Convention next summer .
The legislation would have changed the closing time from 2 am to 4 am for bars in the seven - county Minneapolis - St. Paul area between Aug. 29 and Sep. 8 .
Legislator Linda Scheid gave up her effort following just an hour of debate in the state legislature , after she found that the police had concerns that it would affect all bars , not just those near the convention .
Even convention organizers were unenthusiastic about the plan , with spokespeople for both the committee running the convention and that handling local hosting emphasizing that the idea had n't come from them .
" That was quick , " Scheid said on Monday evening .
" It would have been a very short law , too . "

Making Globalization Work by Joseph E. Stiglitz Norton , 358 pp. , $ 26.95 ; $ 15.95 ( paper )
1 .
Making Globalization
Work is the third of Joseph Stiglitz ’s popular , and populist , books .
1 Like Jeffrey Sachs , Stiglitz is an economist turned preacher , one of a new breed of secular evangelists produced by the fall of communism .
Stiglitz wants to stop rich countries from exploiting poor countries without damaging the springs of wealth - creation .
In that sense he is a classic social democrat .
His missionary fervor , though , is very American .
“ Saving the Planet , ” one of this new book ’s chapter headings , could have been its title .
Stiglitz is in favor of globalization — which he defines as “ the closer economic integration of the countries of the world . ”
He criticizes the ways it has been done .
The “ rules of the game , ” he writes , have been largely set by US corporate interests .
Trade agreements have made the poorest worse off and condemned thousands to death through AIDS .
Multinational corporations have stripped poor countries of their natural resources and left environmental devastation .
Western banks have burdened poor countries with unsustainable debt .
Much of this is well said .
Although it is not new , it bears repeating .
But the main problem at present is not how to make globalization fairer for poor countries .
It is how to make it less volatile ; and to remove the threat it poses for poor and middle - income people in rich countries — those voters who have the power to derail it .
Anti-globalization sentiment is a rich - country phenomenon .
It is rather bizarre , therefore , to write a book about making globalization work that pays so little attention to the concerns of people in rich countries .
This is the more regrettable because Stiglitz ’s technical work , for which he got a Nobel Prize in economics , is about market failures typical of developed economies .
The “ Shapiro - Stiglitz ” model explains why wages cannot be sufficiently flexible to maintain continuous full employment — an insight that could have been profitably applied to the effects of low - wage competition from East Asia .
But , as in his other writings on globalization , Stiglitz has been primarily influenced by his experience as chief economist of the World Bank in the 1990s .
This convinced him that Washington - inspired policies to promote economic development in poor countries were , in fact , hindering it .
He was particularly outraged by the response of the International Monetary Fund during the East Asian meltdown in 1997 –1998 , which , he said , through its poorly conceived bailout efforts , turned slowdowns into recessions , and recessions into depressions .
His public criticisms are said to have led to his removal from the World Bank in 2000 at the behest of then US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers .
This book expands on his earlier criticism of Western development policies and proposes social - democratic alternatives .
2 .
In Stiglitz ’s view , postwar trade regimes — GATT , WTO , NAFTA — have been heavily weighted in favor of the rich countries — by which he means primarily the United States , Europe , and Japan .
These countries have used their greater knowledge and economic power to out - bargain poor countries .
The rich countries have forced liberalization of trade — first in industrial goods , then in skilled services — on poor countries , while retaining their own …
Definition : brute force attack
A method of defeating a cryptographic scheme by trying a large number of possibilities ; for example , exhaustively working through all possible keys in order to decrypt a message .
see [ en.wikipedia.org ]
Definition : Dictionary Attack
In cryptanalysis and computer security , a dictionary attack is a technique for defeating a cipher or authentication mechanism by trying to determine its decryption key or passphrase by searching a large number of possibilities .
see [ en.wikipedia.org ]
In order to do a brute force attack , one has to go through 2^127 , or 170141183460469231731687303715 ... possible combinations on the average to crack an AES 128 bit cipher .
The dictionaries used in a dictionary attack are much smaller , but from a cracker 's point of view , they leave a giant blind spot when it comes down to ' good ' passwords .
We 're told to use first letters of phrases to come up with these phrases , but I 'm willing to bet there are a lot of repeats .
For example , a patriotic American might use 0scucBtde1 .
Out of 300 million Americans , there 's a good chance this will repeat .
Note : Crackers caught on a long time ago to using digits instead of letters .
I 'm not just cynical , I 'm outright paranoid , and with the possability of adding to a cracker 's dictionary , I wo n't touch this .

Not everyone is fond of the flaky characters who make or respond to posts on Craigslist , but the company itself has a fairly clean , people - friendly reputation .
It 's certainly not typically known for going on bullying sprees around the ' Net in an attempt to protect its own trademarks , ala Apple and the use of the word " pod " or , say , logos that also happen to contain representations of apples .
But that reputation could be changing , as Craigslist recently issued legal threats against a blogger over trademark infringement .
Tim White started the Craigslist Blog ( located at craigslistblog.org ) in late February of this year .
He published your average blog posts there , such as rants about craigslist rental listings , observations about Craigslist 's revenue , and opinions about whether craigslist should ban its " erotic services " category .
At the time , Craigslist ( the company ) did not yet have its own company blog , but that changed more than a month later when the company launched its own blog at blog.craigslist.org .
This blog contained postings relating to official company announcements ( such as new language support ) and anecdotes about life at Craigslist 's San Francisco office .
Although the two blogs appear to be pretty easily differentiated by their content , the names of the two were still strikingly similar .
Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster thought so , anyway , which spurred him to send a strongly - worded takedown request to White this week .
In the letter published on the ( unofficial ) Craigslist Blog , Buckmaster asks White to " stop using the infringing domain CRAIGSLISTBLOG.ORG immediately , and arrange for tranfer [ sic ] of it to us asap . "
Not only that , but the name " Craigslist Blog " is also infringing , Buckmaster said , as well as the subhead " Best of Craigslist " and the reposting of excerpts from Craigslist ads .
( If that last one is infringing , then I infringe regularly on my own blog when I quote funny / interesting / sad Craigslist posts I find from the city of Chicago . )
The original letter reminds
White that continuing to use an " infringing domain " can result in a penalty of up to $ 100,000 .
Unofficial Craigslist
Blog on the top , official one on the bottom
White was n't one to back down .
But first , he made a number of changes to his site in order to accommodate Craigslist , such as adding the word " unofficial " to his site 's header and removing all quotes from Craigslist postings on the site .
He challenged Craigslist 's demand to hand over the domain , though , by asking whether Buckmaster was also pursuing a number of other Craigslist - themed domains .
Buckmaster was not amused by this , and rather tersely e-mailed Craigslist 's legal counsel with a mere carbon copy to White .
" Unfortunately it sounds like Tim may prefer to go the legal route here , " Buckmaster wrote to an attorney at Perkins Coie .
" Unless you hear otherwise from him shortly , please proceed . "
Although the unofficial Craigslist Blog may be walking a thin line with its domain name , the site could have some legal legs to stand on if the case were to escalate .
During a somewhat similar case between Lowe's and the owner of Lowes - sucks.com , EFF staff attorney Corynne McSherry told Ars that trademark law is meant to protect consumers and provide them with accurate information about a company 's product .
She said that spinoff and complaint sites fall into that category , because they provide others with information about certain people 's experiences or opinions .
Since the unofficial Craigslist Blog does n't claim to be Craigslist ( or even the official company blog ) , merely using the name " Craigslist " in its domain is n't likely to substantiate a trademark infringement claim .
The company 's PR team did not respond to our request for comment by publication time , despite us giving them several days , but Buckmaster has already posted an update on the official Craigslist blog about the situation and appears to have softened a hair on White .
" Fwiw , we have no interest in shutting down blogs about Craigslist , critical or otherwise , and have never tried to do so .
But in the strange world of trademarks and copyright , it 's poor practice to allow a confusingly similar domain or business name to go unchallenged . " he wrote .
" But there was no need for me to act like a jerk , provoked or not . "
Seeking his own XO clarity
When I posted that Walter Bender is the former President of Software and Content for One Laptop Per Child , I thought he had just moved to Deployment .
Now I 've heard an even more shocking development :
Walter Bender resigned from OLPC !
Apparently , rumor has it that Nicholas Negroponte is close to abandoning Sugar and Linux in favor of Microsoft XP , to spur sales of the XO laptop .
Negroponte thinks that many more laptops need to be sold and a partnership with Microsoft is the way to achieve that goal .
Walter Bender disagreed with this near - total abandonment of the original mission - constructionism as children learning learning to create life - long exploration and collaboration through open information and communication technologies .
And so he walked away from OLPC the organization for one laptop per child , the global movement .
Personally , I think I 'm going into shock for a bit .
As I 've made clear , I feel that XP on the XO is the end of OLPC as an education project .
If OLPC falls to the Dark Side , I may just join Walter Bender in resignation .
Updated : Walter resigned around April 14th , according to his own staffing edits on the wiki .
And we now have a statement from Walter Bender on his resignation from OLPC

Dwarf galaxies are relatively small galaxies containing a few billion stars A controversial theory of physics may explain some aspects of galaxy behaviour better than rival , but more widely accepted , ideas .
That is the claim of an astronomer who studied eight so - called dwarf galaxies .
Modified Newtonian Dynamics ( Mond ) is proposed as an alternative to the widely accepted theory of dark matter to explain the dynamics of galaxies .
Garry Angus , from St Andrews University , said Mond effects could be very important for small galaxies .
Details of the study have been presented at the UK National Astronomy Meeting in Belfast .
Essentially , Mond would add a new constant of nature - called a0 - to physics , besides the speed of light , Planck 's constant , and many others .
Above it , accelerations are exactly as predicted by Newton 's second law , which says that a force equals an object 's mass times its acceleration .
Below it , gravity decays with distance from a mass , rather than distance squared .
This constant would be so small that it would go unnoticed with the large accelerations that we experience in day - to - day life .
For instance , when we drop a ball the gravity is 100 billion times stronger than a0 and the accelerated motion of the Earth round the Sun is 50 million times stronger .
However , when objects are accelerating extremely slowly , as is seen in galaxies or clusters of galaxies , the constant makes a significant difference to the resulting gravitational forces .
Problem cases Mr Angus took two key parameters of the eight Milky Way dwarf galaxies and tried to fit them to predictions made by the Mond theory .
These two parameters were the ratio of mass to the amount of light emitted by the stars in the dwarf galaxies ( the mass - to - light ratio ) and the orbital paths of stars in the galaxies .
" Six out of the eight definitely fit the available data very , very well , " the University of St Andrews researcher told BBC News .
" There are two problem cases , and we 're going to run simulations to check them . "
The most troublesome of these problem cases is a dwarf galaxy called Draco .
But Mr Angus said this could be because this galaxy was falling towards the Milky Way at a speed of 300 km / s .
Our galaxy 's gravity could be acting upon it , such that tidal forces were beginning to tear Draco apart .
The value for Sextans could also be due to tidal effects but also due to using old measurements of the galaxy 's luminosity .
Mr Angus said the data were improving all the time for these ultra dim objects .
But he explained : " The larger the systems you go to , the worse Mond fits the data .
Presumably there is something we 're not understanding at the scales of clusters of thousands of galaxies and upwards . "
At these scales , dark matter seems to be the only realistic proposal .
This invisible form of matter is thought to make up some 22 % of the Universe .
The matter we can see makes up a paltry 4 % .
The origins of the dark matter theory date back to 1933 , when the Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky found evidence for unseen mass within a galaxy cluster .
This became known as the " missing mass problem " .
Observational evidence for dark matter has since been obtained from the study of the motions of galaxies .
And this continues to be the dominant theory to explain observations of galaxies .

The problem with sites like YouTube is that every notable bit of pop culture from the advent of talkies onward is available somewhere online .
Not being renowned for my self - control , I often end up digging around in places I should n't , like a Victorian - era archaeologist dismissively ignoring the warnings on a cursed tomb .
The latest cultural mummy to strike my consciousness is " La Isla Bonita , " a Madonna song that clogged the airwaves in the late ' 80s .
The lyrics confounded me when I first heard them , but I always attributed that to the poor quality of my friends ' stereo systems .
Surely the lyrics could n't be as bad as they sounded , I thought .

Well , thanks to YouTube and various lyric sites , I 've finally been able to resolve this mystery :
The lyrics really are as bizarre as they seemed .
They appear to have been written down , chopped into bits , thrown in the air , then pasted back together in random order like the middle eight of " Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite , " but to much lesser effect .
Here are some of the worst offenders :
" Young girl with eyes like the desert . "
This is almost poetic .
But it kind of veers away and becomes an ad for Visine instead .
I 'm not sure which version of " like the desert " she means .
Full of sand ?
Kind of taupe - ish ?
I 'm going to go with " lacking in plant life . "
" I want to be where the sun warms the sky . "
There are very few places where the sun cools the sky .
Even in subzero climates , the landscape is slightly more survivable during the day .
Maybe she wants to rule out places where the sun does n't rise at all for months at a time .
So she wants to be somewhere other than the Arctic or Antarctic .
And not underground .
That ... does n't really narrow it down .
" When it 's time for siesta you can watch them go by . "
This is just a sad excuse to put a Spanish word in the lyrics .
Siesta is when you take a nap .
If it 's really time for siesta , you 're sleeping , not watching them go by .
Indeed , they 're not going by at all , because it 's time for siesta .
So really , this lyric should be , " If it 's time for siesta , but you do n't want to actually take a siesta , you can watch them go by , assuming they 're of a similar mindset concerning siestas . "
Or just substitute " fiesta . "
" Where a girl loves a boy and a boy ... loves a girl . "
I like the little moment of tension before the end here .
A boy what ?
Breeds aardvarks ?
Writes essays exploring Manichaean dualism ?
Dances with other boys while listening to Madonna ?
Oh , loves a girl !
So she 's limiting herself to places where heterosexuality is n't outlawed .
Also above ground and between the North and South Poles .
She 's pretty easygoing when you think about it .
" And when the samba played / The sun would set so high / Ring through my ears and sting my eyes / Your Spanish lullaby . "
I believe the third level of hell is filled with evil English teachers forced to diagram this sentence for all eternity .
I think what she 's saying is , " When your Spanish lullaby – which was also a samba for some reason – played , the sun would set so high that it stung my eyes while the aforementioned lullaby / samba rang through my ears . "
I 'm still not sure how the sun would set so high .
I guess it would just stay above the horizon .
So we 're back above the Arctic circle .
Make up your mind , Madonna !
" Warm wind carried on the sea / He called to me , te dijo te amo . "
The climatology is unexpectedly sound here , but the translation is iffy .
As far as I can make out , it literally means , " He called to me , ' He told you I love you . ' "
So some guy is calling out to Madonna that some other guy told Madonna that he , the first guy , the guy who 's talking to Madonna right now , loves Madonna .
Apparently conversation in San Pedro is very roundabout .
I guess that 's why they do n't call it " La Isla de Comunicación Clara . "

When NASA begins launching astronaut teams on 800 - day missions to Mars , one of the greatest survival tests these explorers will face is the inevitable alienation they 'll experience with their remoteness from Earth and the harshness of the frozen Red Planet .
After rocketing halfway around the solar system for 180 nights , these astronauts will start the first of 500 days on the Martian surface observing a cocoa-colored dusk fade into a star - saturated nightfall .
Earth , 400 million kilometers away , will appear as just a twinkling blue diamond in the skies .
The astronauts will have never felt so alone .
But NASA thinks it has an answer to the psychological challenge of interplanetary isolation .
While aerospace engineers are designing the Ares rockets to be deployed in the Mars missions , a more starry - eyed contingent at NASA is testing networking and virtual reality technologies that they think will connect the first wave of Mars pioneers with their families , friends and colleagues back on Earth , in a 3 - D virtual world cut from the mold of Second Life or World of Warcraft .
" We want to help our remote explorers ' phone home ' in a way that lets them sit around a dinner table with their family , help their children with homework and analyze the latest findings with their Earth - bound peers , " says Jeanne Holm , chief knowledge architect at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory .
The initiative is the latest in the space agency 's enthusiastic push into virtual worlds .
In May , NASA set up its own island in Second Life to enable online collaboration on technology projects , and the agency is working to create 3 - D simulations of the orange - red deserts of Mars , so astronauts can experience the Red Planet before going there .
" Virtual worlds will play a key role in returning to the Moon and exploring Mars , says Jessy Cowan - Sharp , who helped create NASA 's CoLab island in Second Life .
But an interplanetary virtual world faces the seemingly intractable limits imposed by the speed of light .
When on diametrically opposite sides of the sun , Mars and Earth are separated by 20 light - minutes ; when closest , the planets are still four light - minutes apart .
That 's a long ping time , and jacking into a virtual world over a radio link of that distance would be like diving into a vat of very thick molasses .
NASA can put a man on the Moon , but can it conquer connection lag ?
Daniel Laughlin , learning technologies project manager at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center , is optimistic .
He 's studying earthbound " immersive synthetic environments " for use in the space program , and he says NASA is trying to figure out how to work around the interplanetary lag problem .
While e-mail messages would seem like an obvious solution , and one easily in reach of current technology , it 's not good enough , Laughlin says .
Forcing the Mars astronauts to rely solely on e-mail communication with family and friends could underscore , rather than erase , the vast gulf between them .
In contrast , the immediacy and intimacy of synthetic worlds would make astronauts feel at home .
" If we were meeting in Second Life or World of Warcraft to chat , we would both have the sense of being in the same place overlaid on our sense of physical location , " Laughlin muses .
" The experience encodes into our memories as if we were in the same place . "
If NASA 's virtual world gambit seems like a pipe dream , there 's no doubt that astronauts traveling to Mars , or returning to the Moon , will enjoy a wealth of tech communications options that the Apollo crews could n't have imagined .
Chris McKay , a planetary scientist at NASA Ames Research Center , says that with high - resolution videocameras , podcasts and web forums , the first Mars invaders could stage the ultimate reality show , with some becoming super - icons back on Earth .
Just knowing that their every move is being watched by a rapt audience at home could help the Mars voyagers find the strength to solider on in the face of " long - term conditions of isolation , privation and psychological stress , " says Robert Zubrin , author of The Case for Mars and founder of The Mars Society .
" The psychological boost enjoyed by Mars - bound astronauts of knowing that they are ' golden people , ' celebrated as heroes by millions on Earth , cannot be overstated , " says Zubrin .
NASA 's Laughlin , though , is committed to giving astronauts a more interactive experience .
They might even be able to tap the internet from Mars to order Christmas gifts from e-Bay or cards from northpole.com for delivery to friends still on their home world , he says .
Or they might download the latest singles from iTunes or e-books from Amazon.com .
Of course , with a single interplanetary TCP handshake clocking in at 12 to 60 minutes , the Mars mission will probably want to use One - Click .

At the request of election officials , the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation has seized voting machines for forensic analysis and has launched a criminal investigation into the Franklin County Board of Elections .
The investigation was launched after Jennifer Brunner , Ohio's Secretary of State and chief election official , found that a candidate 's name was marked as withdrawn on the electronic voting machine that she used during the recent primaries , an irregularity that was also reported by voters in other precincts .
The state attorney general is now working with a team of computer forensic consultants to determine if there was any tampering .
Preliminary analysis conducted by specialists from SysTest Labs indicates that the internal audit capability of the Franklin County voting machines had been manually disabled by county election board programmers last year , making it almost impossible to tell if any nefarious changes have been made to the systems .
SysTest also discovered that the election board had failed to adhere to routine machine testing standards and had tested only one machine in each precinct rather than all of the machines .
Ohio has seen one electronic voting disaster after another ever since counties in the state began adopting the technology .
Two Cuyahoga election officials were convicted of rigging a recount in May 2004 because they literally admitted to doing precounts and displayed the evidence while being recorded on videotape .
A different Cuyahoga county recount , for a November 2007 local election , was equally marred when Brunner turned the state 's voter - verifiable paper audit trail law into a mockery by conducting the recount with paper ballots reprinted after the election from voting machine memory cards .
After all of these incidents , Brunner launched a $ 1.9 million security review which determined that the voting machines used in the state are all egregiously insecure and susceptible to manipulation and outright fraud in numerous ways .
The review produced over 1,000 pages of documentation describing the profound flaws that impact the systems .
According to WHIOTV , which conducted a television interview with Brunner , the state will consider dumping the faulty touch - screen voting machines and switching to more reliable optical scanners that read votes from conventional paper ballots .
Rep. Kevin DeWine , a state legislator and deputy chairman of the Ohio Republican Party , vehemently opposes returning to paper ballots because doing so would likely cost the state an estimated $ 64 million .
His arguments seem dubious in the face of the growing costs associated with cleaning up the messes created by the defective touch - screen voting systems .
Security evaluations conducted in several states demonstrate clearly that electronic voting machines commercially available from virtually all of the mainstream vendors utterly fail to meet even the most basic security standards .
With the important 2008 elections approaching quickly , states need to reevaluate the implications of their election policies and seriously consider going back to paper if more advanced technology can't get the job done .

It appears that the CDU ( Christian conservatives ) and the Greens in Hamburg have agreed a programme of government and the two parties will coalesce at State level for the first time .
http://www1.ndr.de/nachrichten/hamburg/koalitionsvertrag16.html
One interesting issue that they have agreed upon in the deepening of the Elbe .
They are to deepen the port by 1 meter .
This was one of the campaign promises of the CDU and opposed by the Greens .
On the other hand the Greens have secured a commitment that a coal burning station in Moorburg will now not be built .
The Other issues in the negations centered around more regular politics , such as the CDU promising the Greens 3 senators in the Upper House .
A similar agreement is being hammered out in the state of Hessen ( where Frankfurt is ) between the CDU and the Greens .
This trend towards greater involvement by the Green movement in government with their natural enemies is obviously not confined to Germany .
It seems to be a marriage of conveience for Green parties to coalesce with center right parties .
It automatically gives both credence with their greatest critics .
Its shows the center right to be not as evil as they might appear and that the Greens are not as nutty and not nearly as left wing as they are often portrayed .
Of course it may well be reflective of the shifting political ground in Europe .
The right can no longer ignore the environmental agenda while the Greens cannot continue to cling on to outdated ideals of of opposition for opposition stake .
Perhaps the Green movement are rationalizing their apparent shift to the right by saying that it is a temporary movement made necessary by the huge challenges confronting humanity ( see my brothers blog for more ) .
However these challenges are unlikely to go away any time soon and it this blogs hunch that the era of the leftist Green Party is over .
No lie , Isuzu is outta here .
The Japanese automaker , famous for its commercials featuring a less - than - honest salesman , said Wednesday that it would stop selling passenger vehicles in the U.S. , as sales declined to almost nothing in recent years .
The move , effective one year from today , marks the end of a 27 - year run here and makes Isuzu the first Asian car company to abandon the world ’s largest market since South Korea ’s financially troubled Daewoo stopped selling here in 2002 .
Although Isuzu ’s U.S. sales were paltry of late -- it made just 7,098 of the 16.1 million new vehicles sold in the country last year -- the company ’s influence on the industry , as innovator and promoter of sport utility vehicles such as the Trooper and the Rodeo in the 1980s and ‘ 90s , was huge .
“ It ’s a shame , ” said Rebecca Lindland , director of automotive research at Global Insight .
“ From a historical perspective , they were quite significant .
Isuzu was almost ahead of its time . ”
News of the decision surprised many at the company ’s U.S. headquarters arm in Cerritos , as well as its network of 199 American dealers , including 18 in California .
“ I ’m still digesting all the information , ” said Isuzu Motors America spokesman Chip Letzgus , who said the company ’s U.S. president , Terry Maloney , spent Wednesday talking with employees and dealers about the news .
The decision to cease distribution was based in part on the fact that the two models Isuzu currently sells here , the Ascender SUV and the i-series pickup ( both manufactured by General Motors for Isuzu ) , will no longer be made , and the company has no plans to design a new vehicle .
Isuzu will instead focus on its commercial trucks , a much larger business in the U.S. and abroad .
In the fiscal year that ended last March , Isuzu earned $ 910 million on $ 14.2 billion in worldwide sales .
The company said that quitting the U.S. passenger vehicle market would cost about $ 37 million over two years , including fees to franchised dealers .
“ Isuzu has a tendency to keep everything to their chest , ” said Paul Bluntzer , general manager of All Star Isuzu in Corpus Christi , Texas , which led the nation with 351 Isuzus sold last year .
Bluntzer said he and other dealers would participate in a conference call with Isuzu executives today .
“ We hold out hope that a surprise new product will come . ”
One individual who was n’t surprised to hear the news was Joe Isuzu himself .
David Leisure , who portrayed the salesman in a series of Isuzu ads in the late 1980s and early ‘ 90s , said he had n’t seen an Isuzu on the road for years .
“ I thought they already had stopped selling here . ”
Leisure , an unknown actor before landing the role , gained fame for smarmy lines such as “ If I ’m lying , may lightning hit my mother , ” in goofy commercials that promised vehicles that could drive faster than a speeding bullet .
The commercials , he said , landed him acting jobs on several comedy series , and in 2001 , he made a brief return to Isuzu ads , where he pitched the Axiom .
“ Isuzu gave me an actual career , ” said Leisure , who has owned two Troopers over the years .
Joe Isuzu , meanwhile , made Isuzu a very popular brand .
After building pickups for GM in the 1970s , Isuzu began selling its own vehicles in the U.S. in 1981 , with low - cost vehicles such as the Pup pickup and the Trooper .
Aside from the Jeep Cherokee , the Trooper was the only four - door SUV available for years , and it helped build a market for what would become a hugely successful category .
Isuzu ’s U.S. sales peaked at 127,630 vehicles in 1986 , according to AutoData .
But as other carmakers entered the SUV market , Isuzu lost its position as an SUV innovator , instead focusing on producing sedans , favoring joint - venture deals with Subaru and other carmakers , and selling Rodeo SUVs to Honda , which re-badged them as Passports .
By 1997 , sales were down to 91,483 units , and introductions of new models such as the Axiom and Ascender did little to halt the slide .
Isuzu ’s 2007 volume was the smallest of any Asian carmaker in the U.S .
“ The cost of maintaining an Isuzu consumer brand simply did n’t justify the volume sold , ” said Jesse Toprak , industry analyst at Edmunds.com .
While some felt a wave of nostalgia over the brand ’s departure , others were equivocal .
“ I ’m not devastated , ” said Leslie Thurman , an entertainment executive in Westwood who drives a 10 - year - old Rodeo .
“ I ’ve been wanting to buy a hybrid anyway . ”

PET images ( color ) of [ 11 C ] - salvinorin
A in the baboon brain overlaid on MRI template ( black and white ) summed from 3 - 7 minutes post - injection .
High concentrations ( red ) were observed in the cerebellum and activity was seen throughout cortical and subcortical regions .
The maximum concentration of [ 11 C ] - salvinorin
A in the brain occurs in 40 seconds and clears with a half - life of only 8 minutes , matching the pharmacological duration of action .
Brain - imaging studies performed in animals at the U.S. Department of Energy ’s Brookhaven National Laboratory provide researchers with clues about why an increasingly popular recreational drug that causes hallucinations and motor - function impairment in humans is abused .
Using trace amounts of Salvia divinorum – also known as “ salvia , ” a Mexican mint plant that can be smoked in the form of dried leaves or serum – Brookhaven scientists found that the drug ’s behavior in the brains of primates mimics the extremely fast and brief “ high ” observed in humans .
Their results are now published online in the journal NeuroImage .
Quickly gaining popularity among teenagers and young adults , salvia is legal in most states , but is grabbing the attention of municipal lawmakers .
Numerous states have placed controls on salvia or salvinorin A – the plant ’s active component – and others , including New York , are considering restrictions .
“ This is probably one of the most potent hallucinogens known , ” said Brookhaven chemist Jacob Hooker , the lead author of the study , which is the first to look at how the drug travels through the brain .
“ It ’s really important that we study drugs like salvia and how they affect the brain in order to understand why they are abused and to investigate their medicinal relevance , both of which can inform policy makers . ”
Hooker and fellow researchers used positron emission tomography , or PET scanning , to watch the distribution of salvinorin A in the brains of anesthetized primates .
In this technique , the scientists administer a radioactively labeled form of salvinorin A ( at concentrations far below pharmacologically active doses ) and use the PET scanner to track its site - specific concentrations in various brain regions .
Within 40 seconds of administration , the researchers found a peak concentration of salvinorin A in the brain – nearly 10 times faster than the rate at which cocaine enters the brain .
About 16 minutes later , the drug was essentially gone .
This pattern parallels the effects described by human users , who experience an almost immediate high that starts fading away within 5 to 10 minutes .
High concentrations of the drug were localized to the cerebellum and visual cortex , which are parts of the brain responsible for motor function and vision , respectively .
Based on their results and published data from human use , the scientists estimate that just 10 micrograms of salvia in the brain is needed to cause psychoactive effects in humans .
Salvia does n’t cause the typical euphoric state associated with other hallucinogens like LSD , Hooker said .
The drug targets a receptor that is known to modulate pain and could be important for therapies as far reaching as mood disorders .
“ Most people do n’t find this class of drugs very pleasurable , ” Hooker said .
“ So perhaps the main draw or reason for its appeal relates to the rapid onset and short duration of its effects , which are incredibly unique .
The kinetics are often as important as the abused drug itself . ”
The Brookhaven team plans to conduct further studies related to salvia ’s abuse potential .
The scientists also hope to develop radioactive tracers that can better probe the brain receptors to which salvia binds .
Such studies could possibly lead to therapies for chronic pain and mood disorders .

“ There is just no predicting that , ” Colonel Pagel said .
“ There are just too many variables . ”
Each of the 14 cases now pending presents legal tangles .
In one , the morass grew so thick that the judge scheduled pretrial proceedings after the date he had set for the trial , evidently realizing that there were too many unresolved issues to rush the case .
In another , a detainee refused to leave his cell for an arraignment and had to be forcibly extracted .
On Wednesday , proceedings were delayed when a detainee complained that the tribunal translation was flawed .
After that was resolved , the detainee , Ahmed Mohammed Ahmed Haza al Darbi , declared the proceeding political and refused to participate , adding , “ History will record these trials as a scandal against you . ”
Prosecutors planned this week to arraign two suspects , one who they say was a Qaeda paymaster and the other , they say , a propaganda chief .
But that rudimentary step is not to go off as they had hoped .
The case of the propaganda chief had to be postponed because his military lawyer had recently left the defense office , taking that case back to its starting point .
By chance , the alleged paymaster and the alleged propaganda chief were the first ones identified for war crimes trials by the Pentagon back in 2004 .
Yet all Guantánamo cases were derailed in 2006 when the Supreme Court struck down the Bush administration ’s first war crimes system .
The first trial of a detainee under the new system is now scheduled for May 28 .
But defense lawyers for that defendant , Salim Ahmed Hamdan , who was a driver for Osama bin Laden , have filed nearly 30 legal motions , raising questions that included procedural issues and basic challenges to the Guantánamo system itself .
Andrea J. Prasow , one of Mr. Hamdan ’s lawyers , said her experience in a comparatively simple Guantánamo case showed the extraordinary complexities that seem certain to entangle all of the battles here .
It may be possible , Ms. Prasow said , for one or two cases to be tried by the fall .
But , she said , “ I do n’t see how it is remotely possible for the others to get under way . ”
Oldest gold artifact in Americas found by UA prof
Ancient Peruvians may not have been as sophisticated as we are today , but they had good taste in jewelry .
A University of Arizona anthropologist has discovered a 4,000 - year - old necklace that has been radiocarbon - dated as the oldest known gold artifact in the Americas .
Professor Mark Aldenderfer found the nine - bead necklace while excavating a burial site in 1999 near Lake Titicaca in southeastern Peru .
He delayed publicizing the finding until Monday so anthropologists could finish their work at the site without attracting looters .
In 2005 , scientists dated the necklace 's age at roughly 2100 B.C. Previously discovered gold artifacts were dated at least 600 years later .
Aldenderfer 's findings are being published Tuesdayin the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Beyond the excitement of finding gold , the discovery sheds light on how an ancient society lived .
Gold metalwork is complex and demanding and was often thought possible only in societies with sufficient wealth .
That wealth arose from food surpluses as people graduated from hunting to cultivating their own crops .
The necklace 's discovery calls the theory into question .
It suggests that using gold to display wealth happened long before more complex , agricultural societies emerged .
Aldenderfer said whoever owned the necklace likely was important .
The bones nearby were too deteriorated to determine if they belonged to a male or female , he said .
" The fact that they buried this with a dead person suggests the person had enough prestige and status and perhaps wealth , " he said .

Professor Frankel acknowledged in a telephone interview on Thursday that the new World Bank figures badly damaged that argument .
“ I would have to retract that based on these latest numbers , ” he said .
But Professor Frankel said that many other economic indicators showed that the yuan was undervalued and should be allowed to rise .
He cited China ’s huge and growing trade surplus , its ever - rising foreign exchange reserves , market speculation on a further appreciation of the yuan  it has already risen 5.9 percent this year  and signs that the Chinese economy might be overheating as exports soared .
Some economists , including the former head of the China division at the International Monetary Fund , question whether the World Bank has now gone too far in the other direction and overstated prices in China .
While describing the estimates as an important step toward making international comparisons of economies , they point out that the bank looked mainly at affluent Chinese cities in coastal provinces with big export industries .
China ’s economic output in 2005 was worth $ 2.24 trillion at prevailing prices and actual market exchange rates .
That is the calculation most commonly used by economists and the best indicator of a country ’s ability to buy and sell a diverse range of internationally traded products , like oil , steel and computers .
The World Bank had previously calculated that China ’s output was worth $ 8.8 trillion in 2005 if the goods and services produced in the country were valued at American prices .
That figure was revised this week down to $ 5.3 trillion .
The bank found that prices in China were closer to world levels than it previously assumed .
So World Bank economists calculated that the purchasing - power parity of China ’s economy was also closer to the market exchange value .
Even with the revision , China is still the world ’s second - largest economy in purchasing - power - parity terms , after the United States .
At market exchange rates , China also trails Japan .
The scrutiny of Sen. Barack Obama ’s relationship to the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , the recently retired pastor of Obama ’s Chicago church , highlights the complex intersections of religion and race in the United States .
Neither Wright ’s purportedly inflammatory statements nor the pressure on Obama to repudiate them are anything new .
The tangled webs of religion and race are two of the most persistent themes in American history .
Wright ’s simultaneous embrace of Christianity and condemnation of the United States , mostly for its failure to live up to Christian ideals of social justice , has been a part of African - American rhetoric since the first slave conversions to Christianity .
Looking back even further , preaching condemnation against the nation stretches back to the Old Testament .
The jeremiad , a sermon calling for repentance to avoid judgment , is named after the Hebrew prophet Jeremiah , an irony critics of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright fail to grasp .
Even Obama , who has recently distanced himself from Wright , would do well to remember the rhetorical tradition of Wright ’s criticisms have a long history in the speeches and writings of African - American leaders who are exalted by black and white Americans alike .
Frederick Douglass , whose autobiography of his escape from slavery to freedom is a mainstay of American civic education , spoke in terms similar to those for which Wright is castigated :
“ I will hold up America to the lightning scorn of moral indignation .
In doing this I shall feel myself discharging the duty of a true patriot ; for he is a lover of his country who rebukes and does not excuse its sins . ”
Even Martin Luther King Jr. , whose legacy political candidates of all races and parties try to claim , shared Wright ’s condemnation of American aggression , criticizing “ the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today – my own government . ”
Wright ’s call that “ God damn America ” creates a paradox for his critics , especially those on the Christian right , because he takes seriously the idea of the United States as a Christian nation .
Wright ’s denomination , the United Church of Christ , descends directly from the Puritans who settled in New England .
The Puritans wanted to create a Christian society that would be “ a city upon a hill ” that would be a model for all the world .
But they also understood that God would hold them accountable for their failings , since Puritan jeremiads highlighting failures were far more common than sermons claiming success .
( War was a leading sign of God ’s judgment . )
By the 19th century , black preachers had adapted the jeremiad - style sermon , calling upon American Christians to be faithful to the ideals of equality and justice rooted not only in the sacred texts of Christianity , but also in the sacred texts of the nation , the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution .
Alongside this historical amnesia , calls for Obama to distance himself from Wright reflect a racial bias as well .
The racial double - standard in America requires a member of a minority group to dissociate him - or herself from fellow “ troublemakers ” in ways not expected of whites .
Racial similarity between Obama and Wright ( and , earlier , with Louis Farrakhan ) as much as religious relationships account for the pressure for Obama to publicly denounce the former leader of his church .
At the same time , Sen . John McCain ’s religious supporters have received little scrutiny .
Conservative Christian supporters such as the Revs. Rod Parsley and John Hagee have a long record of hate - filled statements about Islam , Judaism , Catholicism and most anything besides their form of Christianity .
White Republican candidates have not faced similar pressures to repudiate views of other politically vocal conservative Christian leaders , such as Pat Robertson and the late Jerry Falwell , who have long pointed to evidence of God already having “ damned ” America in catastrophes such as Sept. 11 , 2001 , and Hurricane Katrina .
They just disagree with Wright on what sins ought to provoke divine wrath .
The rhetoric that has brought Wright into the spotlight is a distillation of the dual experiences of hope and alienation that have always characterized the African - American religious experience .
Wright ’s call for God ’s judgment is not a rejection of either the Christian faith or the American nation .
Rather , like his forebears , Wright ’s preaching is an affirmation of religious and democratic ideals and a call to uphold them .
The uproar over Wright ’s preaching is not because he is wrong , but rather the uncomfortable realization he is right .

The planet has recursive real - estate - many islands have littler islands around them , and so on .
I suspect it 's got many more islands all together than the number of people in the world , so there 's plenty of room for everyone .
I showed this at the SIGGRAPH98 Web 3D Roundup in Orlando .
There were dozens of demos there , and mine was the only one that did not use any plug-ins ( I dare you to try to make one of these in VRML ... ) .
I 've also recently made a somewhat different interface that lets you zoom in and out continuously .
Technogeeky Info :
This work is a variant on the " Random Fractal Forgeries " by Richard Voss , when he was working with Benoit Mandelbrot at Yale and IBM .
In that work Voss introduced the idea of zooming forever into islands around islands on a fractally generated planet , and he created a nice little film demonstrating that .
I wanted to try something in the same spirit using my noise function , and to make it all work in real - time on the Web .
The surface texture is formed by a summation of noise functions .
Portions of this summation are used in various ways to form clouds , ocean , mountains , snow , etc .
The starfield that surrounds the planet is also formed out of noise functions .
The planet has atmospheric haze ( how else could you breathe ? ) .
Four dimensional noise : Java really can't compute the planet
In related work , NYU grad student Daniel Thor Kristjansson ported the planet into C++ and we got it running in real time on a 32 processor SP2 , graciously donated by IBM , with each processor computing every 32nd pixel .
For this , we wanted the continents to evolve interactively .
So I provided Daniel with a four dimensional noise function .
By dragging the planet through time , you can watch planetary evolution take place .
You can see gorgeous movies of this here .
More Technogeeky Info : Java really can't compute the planet in real - time .
So I 've got a new , patent - pending ( yes , really ) progressive rendering scheme , which renders the image as a gradually finer fractal pattern .
It 's " optimal " in the sense that no surface point is ever computed twice , and it provides a cool impressionist look while the planet is rendering ( while actually only plotting squares ) .
Practically , what this gives you is a good sense of the planet 's appearance in well under a second , even if you 're running on a slow machine where the super - quality final rendering might take more than a minute .
Way Too Technogeeky Info : Normally , rendering would become intolerably slow as the user zooms in , since I need to sum ever more frequencies of noise with increasing magnification .
But rendering does n't get any slower , because I cache low frequencies of this summation into a grid of Catmull - Rom splines , so I only need to recompute the high frequencies .
The code for the Java class I implemented to do this splining is accessable here .
Further reference :
If you want to read about Voss 's work and related work , a good place to start is the on - line manual page for ppmforge .
Also , the most beautiful fractal planets are the ones created by Ken Musgrave , who worked with Benoit Mandelbrot after Voss moved on to other things .
Future plans : I 'm going to open it up for a real - estate grab at some point soon , thru a server - side registry .
Anyone will be able to have their own island , to own , build on , put messages on , set up shop in , or trade .
I 'm going to set up the rules so that " size does n't matter . "
Tiny islands with the right features ( lakes , lagoons , proximity to the right cool places and folks , etc ) will be worth more than big boring islands .
People can always find a really awesome tiny new island in the land grab ( which can go on for quite a while ) that had been overlooked .
Then people can start to build their semi-automatically architected cities , trade messages , form alliances , etc .
I am also about to add a " survival of the prettiest " ( brilliant concept by Karl Sims - who is a living example ) evolution scheme so that people can genetically evolve their own personal planet , which can appear mars - like , venus - like , or whatever .
In this scheme , the user can ask that different portions of the planet have different " looks " .
They can click on the portion that they think looks best , which defines a median starting point for the next set of variations , and so on .
Serve when done .
Under the hood , any particular " look " is actually a set of parameter values .
But it will be more fun to let people evolve their own personal planet by example than to make people tweak a bunch of sliders .

Right now , things look bad .
Every day , the economic news looks worse .
Unemployment has been creeping up .
The service sector is shrinking for the first time in half a decade .
Consumer confidence is declining .
The stock market 's performance of late reflects this news .
The S&P 500 is down nearly 9 % year to date , and some stocks have been completely mauled .
It 's just a couple of months into 2008 , and InterContinental Exchange ( NYSE : ICE ) , Garmin ( Nasdaq : GRMN ) , and Baidu.com ( Nasdaq : BIDU ) have already all been clobbered by more than 30 % .
You might expect that sort of monthly volatility from small caps , but these are well - known companies that had market caps of $ 10 billion or more .
And none of them has really announced any bad news .
Things look so bad that you might think that there 's nowhere to go but up .
But I think this crisis has just begun .
An explosive situation
For months , we 've been experiencing a liquidity crisis that has locked up credit markets .
It 's now apparent that the debt market was a disaster waiting to happen ... and that the collapsing housing market was all that was needed to end the wait .
The problem is , if you look at the catalyst for this crash , you 'll see that the correction may have just begun .
As of November , housing was 8.4 % off its peak .
That 's right , a mere 8.4 % decline has caused financials to melt down , homebuilders to go bankrupt , and the panicked Federal Reserve to ignore its inflation - fighting mandate and push through interest - rate cuts -- despite the highest inflation rates since 1990 .
But how bad could it get ?
Well , Goldman Sachs ( NYSE : GS ) -- noteworthy for being the one big investment bank that was smart enough to not get burned by securitized mortgages -- has predicted that if there 's no recession , the housing market will probably fall by 15 % .
If there is a recession , Goldman thinks prices could fall by 30 % .
That 's a heck of a lot more than the current 8.4 % decline .
A negative equity landslide
And if housing continues to fall , the problems will only get worse .
For instance , you may have heard of people with negative equity in their homes walking away from their houses and their mortgages .
If you owe more on your house than it 's worth , deliberately pursuing foreclosure can be a rational -- if unethical -- decision .
It is n't surprising that this is happening .
For years , lenders have been using legal fine print to gouge borrowers by raising the interest rates on credit cards and charging obscure fees seemingly whenever the mood struck them .
Borrowers are now playing the same game , taking advantage of legal loopholes to dodge their debts .
But this is happening with only with an 8.4 % fall in the housing market .
What happens with a 15 % or 30 % fall ?
For the mortgage industry , it 's more than a rhetorical question .
Using data from December 2006 , First American ( NYSE : FAF ) calculated how many homeowners would be under water if house prices started falling .
The numbers are startling .
Total % Decline in Housing % Mortgages With Negative Equity 8.4 % ( Today ) 13.5 % 15 % ( No Recession ) 21 % 30 % ( Recession ) 39 %
So , using Goldman 's 15 % estimated decline , 21 % of people with mortgages will owe more money than their house is actually worth .
If a recession develops -- which , frankly , seems likely to me -- and the market falls 30 % , then nearly two of every five mortgages will be under water .
A vicious cycle ?
In light of those numbers , it 's not so surprising that the Fed is panicking .
Default could make sense financially for a huge number of people , and if there 's negative equity , lenders will have lost money , even before you consider the high costs of foreclosure .
What 's more , since lenders are generally highly leveraged , moving from a manageable 1 % to 2 % default rate to a 5 % to 6 % default rate can destroy capital adequacy ratios at an increasing rate .
This will reduce the liquidity in the mortgage market , making it harder for housing sales to improve .
And again , this crisis may have only just begun .
The average foreclosure in a good market takes a little more than 10 months , according to a research paper from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis .
So , we 've only begun ironing out the foreclosures resulting from the credit crunch that started over the summer .
The impact on the economy wo n't just be the direct effect of the loss of lending , real estate , and construction jobs .
As consumers ' equity in their homes falls , it means that they can no longer borrow against that equity to buy consumer goods .
This may sound like a small problem , but this borrowing has been helping our economy grow .
In recent years , it 's been estimated to be equal to 6 % to 8 % of consumers ' disposable income .
If the economy has slowed this much when consumers continue to have some spending power , how bad will it get if they have to stop spending completely ?
What investors should do
I do n't think you should panic , but at times like these , you should be very aware of what 's in your portfolio .
Moving entirely to cash is n't the right strategy , because then you 'll miss out on the bottom and what will be the best buying opportunity in the next decade .
Instead , make sure that your portfolio is completely solid .
Overvalued story stocks are not going to cut it in this market .
For example , in early January , I warned against buying SunPower ( Nasdaq : SPWR ) and First Solar ( Nasdaq : FSLR ) .
Since then , these companies are down 50 % and 23 % , respectively .
It 's not surprising -- grossly overvalued stocks have no margin of safety , so in a panicky market , there 's absolutely nothing to support their stock prices .
Instead , focus on stocks that are trading for less than their fair value .
Such stocks have a margin of safety and therefore tend to find support even in bad times .
What 's more , cheap stocks are often cheap precisely because people are expecting bad news .
As a result , any bad news tends to have little effect , while good news causes a jump .
So , when the market turns , you can sometimes make money in these stocks extremely quickly .
In fact , that 's the one good thing about this market .
There are some stocks that are now unbelievably cheap , and these stocks could have fantastic returns in the next few years .
The Foolish bottom line
Be extremely cautious in this market , but keep looking for opportunities .
Position your portfolio in undervalued stocks to reduce your risk and give you potentially huge gains when the market finally turns .

SAN FELIPE , Mexico ( Reuters ) -
The vaquita , a tiny stubby - nosed porpoise found only in Mexico 's Sea of Cortez , is on the brink of extinction as more die each year in fishing nets than are being born , biologists say .
A drop in vaquita numbers to as few as 150 from around 600 at the start of the decade could see the famously shy animal go the same way as the Chinese river dolphin , which was declared all but extinct in 2006 .
" The urgency now is to prevent the vaquita becoming extinct , " Omar Vidal , the WWF conservation group 's director in Mexico , told Reuters in San Felipe , a fishing town in the upper Gulf of California , or Sea of Cortez , where the vaquitas live .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
" The latest studies suggest that we have perhaps one or two years for that , " said Vidal , one of a team that has been battling to preserve the species for over 10 years .
The world 's smallest porpoise , growing to a maximum of 5 feet long and gray in color , vaquitas are so timid that they are hardly ever sighted .
They shun the showy acrobatics of other porpoises , and when they come up for air they poke their odd - looking faces , with their black - circled eyes and beak , above the surface for just a second or two before diving quietly back below .
Identified only 50 years ago when some skulls were found , vaquitas are tracked using underwater microphones to pick up the high frequency clicks they use to communicate .
TANGLED IN FISHING NETS
The drop in numbers suggests they are getting tangled in fishing nets at a faster rate than they can reproduce .
Female vaquitas only produce young once every two years and the genetic pool is now too small for effective breeding .
Meanwhile mesh gillnets used to catch sea bass , mackerel , shrimp and sharks also trap and drown air - breathing vaquitas , whose name is Spanish for " little cow . "
The government is trying to persuade some fishermen to ditch their nets and start conservation - based tourism businesses , like boat trips to see marine life .
But one person in four in the area lives off fishing and few want to give up a trade where a small fishing boat can haul in 441 pounds ( 200 kg ) of blue shrimp , worth thousands of dollars to the export market , in a single day .
" We 've been fishermen all our lives .
It 's what we do , " said Tomas Ceballos , 51 , talking over the top of a government official trying to promote a scheme of financial incentives to start tourism projects .
Conservationists are also trying to get fishermen to switch to new nets that are less likely to trap vaquita .
Jose Campoy , head of a marine reserve set up in 1993 to protect endangered species in the area , said one vaquita death a year in nets was too many for the struggling species .
Environment Minister Juan Elvira Quesada said the government would spend $ 10 million this year on protecting the vaquita .
" Every day that goes by is a lost day , " he said .

The Dallas Morning News gets hold of Clinton caucus " training materials , " in which supporters are instructed to fight for procedural control of caucuses .
The materials say in part , " DO NOT allow the supporter of another candidate to serve in leadership roles . "
It goes on to say , " If our supporters are outnumbered , ask the Temporary Chair if one of our supporters can serve as the Secretary , in the interest of fairness .
" The control of the sign - in sheets and the announcement of the delegates allotted to each candidate are the critical functions of the Chair and Secretary .
This is why it is so important that Hillary supporters hold these positions . "
World War I …. who would have thought there were original color photos of WWI ?
Although color photography was around prior to 1903 , the LumiÃ¨re brothers , Auguste and Louis , patented the process in 1903 and developed the first color film in 1907 .
The French army was the primary source of color photos during the course of World War One .

Playwright Tennessee Williams was gay .
Poet Lord Byron had several homosexual affairs in his day .
And artist Leonardo da Vinci was charged with sodomy at the age of 24 .
But public school students in Tennessee wo n't learn that information if a bill passes barring teachers from discussing homosexuality .
Representative Stacey Campfield of Knoxville filed a bill last week that would prevent public elementary and middle schools from allowing " any instruction or materials discussing sexual orientation other than heterosexuality . "
" This is the kind of bill that you would have seen introduced back in the 1990s as a reaction to SpongeBob SquarePants or Heather Has Two Mommies , " says Tommie Simmons with the Shelby County Committee of the Tennessee Equality Project .
The group advocates equal rights of gay , lesbian , bisexual , and transgendered people .
Campfield says the bill was a response to a National Education Association resolution that suggests schools provide information on diversity of sexual orientation and gender identification in sex-education classes .
" I think the schools should stick to the basics : reading , writing , and arithmetic .
And maybe some civics , " says Campfield .
" But teaching transgenderism to middle school students ... I do n't think that 's the road we should go down .
I think that 's what parents should be doing . "
Currently , individual school boards decide whether or not sexual orientation and gender identity will be discussed within the sex - ed curriculum .
Memphis City School officials are currently considering a new curriculum that would address sexual orientation and gender identity .
Shelby County School officials did not return phone calls by press time .
" Why does [ Campfield ] feel the need to take control of what 's taught in a school system away from local boards of education and away from local communities ? " asks Earl Wiman , president of the Tennessee Education Association .
Campfield 's bill allows discussion of heterosexuality because he wants students to learn biology and the science of reproduction .
" If I were to say ' Jack and Jill went up the hill ' or ' George Washington and Martha Washington were husband and wife , ' there are groups out there that would say we were pushing a heterosexual agenda .
To keep those lawsuits from coming , I thought we should still be able to talk about that side of it , " Campfield says .
Over the years , Campfield has proposed other controversial legislation , such as replacing the state 's food tax with a tax on pornography and requiring the state to issue death certificates for aborted fetuses .
In 2005 , Campfield compared the state 's Black Caucus to the Ku Klux Klan when they refused to let him join because he is white .
Though Campfield 's bill is intended to deal with instruction , opponents worry that it would have a chilling effect on students ' free speech .
" Let 's say you have an eighth - grade writing class with an open - ended essay assignment .
What if a student chooses to write about a current issue on sexuality ? " says Chris Sanders , president of the Tennessee Equality Project .
" This bill could be misinterpreted .
It 's overly vague and far - reaching . "
Wiman worries the bill could lead to further alienation of gay students or students of gay parents .
" We have such a high adolescent suicide rate , and a large number of those killing themselves are struggling with sexual orientation , " Wiman says .
" It 's a real concern for us that we be able to help boys and girls without some kind of arbitrary restrictions . "
Here ’s the opening of a MoveOn fundraising letter that I got just before going out of town last week .
I ’ve cut it off at the point where I stopped reading :
From : Nita Chaudhary , MoveOn.org Political Action < moveon-help@list.moveon.org >
Subject : 60 votes to win
Date : 3/19/2008 6:46 AM
Dear MoveOn member ,
It ’s happened again and again this year , on every issue we care about .
Iraq .
Health care .
The climate crisis .
Strong bills have sailed through the US House , only to stall in the face of Republican obstruction in the Senate .
Republicans are on pace to double the Congressional record for the most filibusters .
Here ’s the good news : Republicans are defending 23 Senate seats next year , compared to just 12 for the Democrats .
Democrats could gain as many as 60 seats in the Senate , enough to break Republican filibusters and usher in a new era of progressive reform .
We ’ve got a plan to take advantage of every seat that ’s in play , make even more races competitive , and create a progressive majority that will last for a generation .
But it ’s going to take sustained support from you to pull it off and there ’s no time to waste .
Can you contribute $ 15 per month ( you can cancel at any time ) from now through Election Day ?
Last year , the Senate Republicans obstructed numerous bills including stalling health insurance for the children who need it most and blocking a time - line to bring the troops home from Iraq .
Now look at some of the proposals from the Democratic presidential candidates that will almost certainly take 60 votes in the Senate to pass :
No more blank checks in Iraq . . .
I stopped reading here because this is a lie .
It does not take 60 votes in the Senate to pass
No more blank checks in Iraq .
It does not take a filibuster - proof supermajority in the Senate — any more than it takes a veto - proof majority in the House — to halt blank - check funding for the Iraq War .
It does n’t take positive legislation of any kind at all to halt funding for the Iraq War ; all that it takes is a lack of any more laws to keep on funding it , whether in the form of regular budget line items or in the form of the repeated off - the - ledger infusions of cash which go to fund the Occupation ’s perpetual state of emergency .
Republican Senators can’t filibuster a non-bill and neither can President George W. Bush — or any President who might succeed him — veto it .
It does n’t take 60 Senators or 290 Representatives to stop bills from passing .
All you need is a simple majority , which the Democrats already have , and have had for the last year and a half , and with which they have done worse than nothing over and over again .
The reason that those blank checks keep getting written , with Democrat Harry Reid and Democrat Nacy Pelosi ’s signatures right by the X , is because the Democratic leadership , so - called , does n’t give enough of a damn about ending the war to take on the political costs of blocking funding for it .
The only reason that they could possibly think that doing what they want depends on having a larger majority than they already have is if what they want to do is something other than halting war funding .
The Democratic leadership clearly wants a larger majority in Congress , and they are going to keep on giving George Bush every dollar he asks for unless and until they get that larger majority .
They do n’t need the larger majority to stop sending him the money , so one of two things must be true .
Either the Democratic leadership is waiting until they consolidate more political power so that they can pass a plan which will prolong the war rather than ending it , or else they are waiting until they consolidate more political power because they do n’t want to end the war until after they ’ve fully exploited it as a campaign issue in the upcoming Congressional and Presidential elections .
In either case , the strategy is despicable .
And in either case , it ’s shameful to see a putatively antiwar group repeating their opportunistic lies .
No union with war - mongers , spiritually or politically .

The presidents of Ecuador ( left ) and Colombia had traded accusations
The crisis had been triggered by a cross - border raid by Colombian troops into Ecuador to attack Farc rebels .
Earlier there had been heated exchanges between the heads of state at the Rio Group summit in the Dominican Republic .
The summit of Latin American leaders had originally been planned to discuss energy and other issues .
But the crisis , which started with the raid last Saturday , had erupted into the worst political spat in the region for years .
Venezuela and Ecuador cut diplomatic ties with Bogota and sent troops to their borders after the Colombian operation which left 20 Farc rebels dead , including a senior Farc commander , Raul Reyes .
As the summit debate unfolded , Colombia 's defence minister announced that another rebel leader , Ivan Rios , had been killed - this time on Colombian soil and at the hands of his own men .
Verbal sparring
Nicaragua 's President Daniel Ortega , who had also broken off diplomatic ties with Colombia , said they would be re-established after the presidents shook hands .
The handshakes were broadcast live on television across Latin America in response to a special request from the summit's host , Dominican Republic President Leonel Fernandez .
Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa and his Colombian counterpart Alvaro Uribe had clashed at the opening of the summit .
Mr Correa condemned Colombia's " aggression " , while Mr Uribe accused his opposite number of having links with the Farc rebels .
The Colombian president said he had not warned Ecuador before the raid because Mr Correa had not co-operated in the fight against terrorism .
He also claimed material seized in the operation proved links between Mr Correa 's government and the rebels .
Mr Correa rejected the claims , saying his hands were not " stained with blood " .
He admitted there had been communications with Farc , but only because his government was trying to secure the release of hostages held by the rebels , including former Colombian presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt .
But before shaking hands , to applause from the summit delegates , Mr Correa said : " With the commitment of never attacking a brother country again and by asking forgiveness , we can consider this very serious incident resolved . "
The BBC's Jeremy McDermott says President Uribe 's huge gamble in ordering the air strike that killed Reyes appears to have paid off .
He said Mr Uribe knew it would lead to a diplomatic incident with Ecuador , but perhaps did not realise that Venezuela and Nicaragua would also break off diplomatic relations .

Preventing Debian Package Upgrades
Posted by Steve on Fri 31 Dec 2004 at 22:45
The simple mechanism Debian has for performing package upgrades , apt - get , is often touted as a good thing and indeed it is .
But sometimes you will have a package installed that you absolutely do not want to be upgraded .
There are two ways that you can achieve this , depending on what it is that you 're trying to achieve .
If you have a locally modified package which you do n't want to upgrade then you can put this on " hold " .
This means that even if a newer version of that package is available it will not be upgraded .
Ever .
This does mean that you run the risk of being behind the curve , and missing out on a security fix , but that 's something that you will have to deal with yourself .
If , for example , you do n't wish to upgrade the package apache then you should run the following command as root :
echo " apache hold " | dpkg -- set - selections
To remove the hold run this :
echo " apache install " | dpkg -- set - selections
Rather than putting a package on hold , to prevent the whole thing from being upgraded , you might wish to make sure that a single binary contained within a package is n't upgraded .
This might be because you 've made local changes and you can't investigate any diversions right now - you just want to keep your local version at the risk of losing out on future improvements to the Debian version .
The Debian packaging command , dpkg , has a system for diverting upgrades .
With this system you can cause all upgrades which should happen to a file to be written elsewhere .
For example perhaps you 've written a wrapper around gcc which applies some common options to all compilations , if you upgrade your copy of GCC then you 'll lose this - so you wish to keep your local copy instead .
What you should do is divert the gcc script to another file , such as gcc.real :
dpkg- divert -- add -- rename -- divert /usr/ bin/gcc.real
/usr/bin/gcc
Once you 've done this you 'll see that your installed version of GCC has been renamed , and any future upgrades of the GCC package will install to gcc.real instead .
Now you can place your wrapper in the file / usr / bin / gcc confident that it will be untouched on upgrade .
To remove the diversion you could run :
dpkg- divert -- remove /usr / bin/ gcc
This will rename the gcc.real back to gcc , and allow upgrades to occur as they would have done previously .

Facebook WARSAW ( AP ) 
A pro-business opposition party that wants Poland 's troops out of Iraq ousted Polish Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski's government in parliamentary elections Sunday , as Poles opted for leadership offering a more cooperative approach to the European Union .
Donald Tusk 's Civic Platform party led with 41.1 % of the vote after 11 % of the votes were counted early Monday , and exit polls for TVN24 private television showed the party winning 226 seats in the 460 - seat Sejm lower house .
That was short of the 231 needed for a majority — but close enough for it to join with a smaller party to form a government .
Appearing before supporters late Sunday , Kaczynski conceded defeat , saying , " we did n't manage in the face of this unprecedented broad front of attacks , " referring to the opposition 's campaign .
His Law and Justice party got 31.6 % of the vote and a projected 156 seats , according to partial results and exit polls .
Complete results are expected either later Monday or Tuesday .
A hard - fought campaign generated voter turnout of 55.3 % , higher than any parliamentary elections since the fall of communism , according to an exit survey conducted by the PBS DGA polling institute .
The election result means Poland will no longer have twin brothers holding the two highest offices ; Jaroslaw Kaczynski's brother , Lech Kaczynski , will remain the country 's president with a term lasting until 2010 .
The 58 - year - olds are former child movie stars who as adults became activists with the Solidarity trade union movement that helped topple communism in 1989 .
Both Tusk and Kaczynski favor good relations with the United States , but Tusk argues Poland has not gotten enough from its close ties with Washington and wants the country 's 900 - strong detachment in Iraq to come home .
He also says Poland should drive a tough bargain in return for hosting a missile defense base .
It is a stinging defeat for Kaczynski , whose socially conservative party was elected two years ago and has since been criticized for its assertive approach to the EU and efforts to purge former communists from positions of influence .
Tusk , the favorite to become the next prime minister , said the election showed that Poles want to focus on the economic opportunities presented by the country 's membership in the EU , which Poland joined in 2004 .
" It is Civic Platform 's intention to make Poles feel much better in their own country than they have felt so far , " Tusk told cheering supporters late Sunday .
" We are going to do huge work and we will do it well .
You have the right to rejoice today . "
Kaczynski had sought the elections two years ahead of schedule after his party could not overcome bickering with the two smaller parties it needed to form a majority .
He has clashed with other EU countries over a new treaty to govern how the union makes decisions , demanding more say for Poland .
He is also at odds with the EU over environmental protection , government backing for Polish firms , and the death penalty , which Poland does not have but Kaczynski supports .
The country 's deployment of soldiers to Iraq has been extended through the end of the year by the current government , but Kaczynski has suggested it could be extended again .
Tusk 's party , on the other hand , wants the troops to come home , although some party officials have said that could take as long as until the end of 2008 .
Tusk 's party also calls for additional security guarantees for Poland such as the U.S. Patriot short - range anti-missile and anti-aircraft system , and suggests Kaczynski has failed to win rewards such as visa - free travel for Poles to the United States .
Both Kaczynski and Tusk began their political careers as anti-communist dissidents in the Solidarity movement , which paved the way for the fall of communism in 1989 .
Today , however , they part ways on how to deal with the ex-communists who were once their enemies .
Kaczynski favors a belated purge of ex-communists and their secret collaborators from public life — a reckoning purposely avoided in the peaceful transition of power .
He maintains that the ex-communists continue to wield undue influence .
But a court overturned his legislation to have up to 700,000 people , including journalists and teachers , screened for collaboration .
Tusk 's party opposes that kind of reckoning , saying that Poland should not divert its attention from the new economic opportunities presented since the country joined the EU in 2004 .

Major musicians are exploring the market potential for directly interacting with their fans and releasing music independently .
Nine Inch Nails and Radiohead both made headlines recently for experimenting with Internet - based releases , but NIN frontman Trent Reznor has just called Radiohead 's effort " insincere . "
" I think the way [ Radiohead ] parlayed it into a marketing gimmick has certainly been shrewd , " Reznor said when speaking to Australian Broadcasting Corporation 's Michael Atkin .
" But if you look at what they did , though , it was very much a bait and switch to get you to pay for a MySpace - quality stream as a way to promote a very traditional record sale . "
Reznor is referring to Radiohead 's release of " In Rainbows " as lossy 160 kbps ( max ) MP3 downloads , which many would argue are sub-par when compared to DRM - free offerings from Amazon and iTunes Store ( both of which offer 256 kbps DRM - free music ) .
Furthermore , Radiohead 's album is also no longer offered as a digital download , as the band openly stated that they were still going to rely on traditional labels and distribution channels for the rest of In Rainbows ' sales .
" There 's nothing wrong with that , " Reznor continued , " but I do n't see that as a big revolution [ that ] they 're kinda getting credit for . "
In addition to the quality of Radiohead 's MP3s , NIN 's frontman also took issue with the band 's omission of artwork and altogether not taking care of the fans .
" To me that feels insincere .
It relies upon the fact that it was quote - unquote ' first , ' and it takes the headlines with it . "
This new movement of independent , DRM - free music distribution is indeed undiscovered country , and both of these bands have wildly different approaches .
Nine Inch Nails was among the first major acts to completely break ties with its label , diving head first into the new realm of fan interactivity and digital distribution .
Radiohead , on the other hand , is clearly still depending on its label , in hindsight classifying its " In Rainbows " experiment as more of a toes - in - the - water move than the sort of bold departure on par with Nine Inch Nails ' .
Were both bands ' experiments a success ?
There 's no doubt .
While Radiohead has declined to offer actual numbers from its " pay if you want " experiment , frontman Thom Yorke has stated that " in terms of digital income , we 've made more money out of this record than out of all the other Radiohead albums put together , forever . "
Nine Inch Nails , on the other hand , told the Chicago Tribune on March 12 that " Ghosts " has brought in 781,917 transactions from the website so far , netting a total revenue of $ 1.6 million in just one week .
Not too bad for virtually zero marketing of an instrumental album .
Instead of offering a limited digital download , then switching to CD distribution like Radiohead , however , Nine Inch Nails has offered a variety of formats — including lossless downloads , optical discs , and even vinyl — on its own from the start .
Reznor also does n't show any signs of cutting off digital downloads , either .
When Atkin asked whether the labels would learn from successes like " Ghosts , " Reznor did n't sound enthusiastic .
" The level of ineptitude I 've seen at the major labels is stunning .
The people in charge of a lot of the digital technologies and the aspects that are decimating their business that I 've seen are people that seem to not even be on the Internet . "
To be sure , any venture into the online distribution space that favors the consumers fans is a good one .
Reznor may have a point , however , in saying that Radiohead did n't quite go far enough .
By controlling both the creative process and distribution method for " Ghosts , " then offering a wide variety of formats and even a " try before you buy " free sample , Nine Inch Nails produced a quality experience that sets the bar pretty high for those who follow .
Further reading
IT IS not hard to find examples of the peculiar divergence between how the world looks from Tehran , Iran 's capital , and how it looks in the West .
Take the recent release of a long - awaited report on Iran 's nuclear programme by the International Atomic Energy Agency , the UN 's nuclear watchdog .
To Iran 's state - controlled television , the report showed Iran 's innocence and slapped its detractors in the face .
In Washington , DC , the focus was on the report 's doubts , which appeared to justify a push for further punitive sanctions .
But in many ways , the sparring capitals look more like mirror images than polar opposites .
On different scales , both Iranians and Americans tend to take an imperial view .
Both governments demonise the other .
They use past resentments to reap political rewards by looking tough .
Yet in both America and Iran , currents of dissent are growing , even inside their administrations .
In neither case do the dissenters differ much from their leader 's stated objective : for Iran it is to claim a perceived right to nuclear technology ; for America it is to perform an assumed duty to stop Iran making atomic bombs .
In both cases , critics lambast their leaders for tactics that may take their countries to war .
In some respects , those leaders are oddly similar .
George Bush and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad are both deeply religious , referring frequently to God 's guiding hand .
Both are idealists rather than pragmatists , and skilled at folksy populism .
Both have replaced dozens of competent officials with like - minded conservatives .
And both are now considered , by a large slice of their countrymen , to be bungling and dangerous .
The difference is that it has taken Mr Ahmadinejad just two years in power to achieve the unpopularity Mr Bush has gained after six .
There are differences , of course .
Mr Bush may be accused of curtailing civil liberties in pursuit of his war on terror .
But his government does not drag women off the streets for maladjusting hijabs , the obligatory covering of head and shoulders , or jail student activists as dangers to national security or smear political opponents as traitors or muzzle their speech .
On the other hand , Mr Ahmadinejad may be bombastic but he has not implied he may bomb America — and could not , even if he wanted to .
Oceans and an unparalleled armoury separate America from any conceivable enemy , except small bands of terrorists .
The strategic view from Tehran , by contrast , is of guns pointing from every direction , at close range , and of potential treachery from within .
Only a paranoid fringe in America thinks the country 's constitution or the values underpinning it face an imminent threat of being overturned .
That fringe is in charge in Iran .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's inner circle consists of zealots determined to keep the flame of the 1979 Islamic revolution burning , no matter how much fuel it takes ; in fact , it takes a great deal .
Of the literal kind , hydrocarbons , Mr Ahmadinejad is lucky to have plenty to burn .
For Iran has the world 's second - largest reserves of natural gas and third largest of oil .
This president 's tenure has coincided with surging prices that have pushed Iran 's oil income above $ 50 billion a year .
By some counts , it has earned nearly as much under Mr Ahmadinejad as it did in the two four - year terms of his predecessor , Muhammad Khatami .
But to the dismay of Iranian economists , Mr Ahmadinejad has used this windfall to build immediate political capital rather than invest in the future .
He has tirelessly toured the provinces , promising massive spending on local projects while maintaining subsidies that , by some estimates , devour a third of the government 's budget and account for some 15 % of GNP .
Not only has this postponed what many see as vital reforms .
The flood of government cash has helped push annual inflation towards 20 % .
Property prices have risen even faster , sending rents in Tehran beyond the means of new households when the population pyramid 's widest tier bulges in the 20 - 30 age bracket .
Property owners have benefited , but sociologists note that the gap between rich and poor yawns as widely as under the hated shah whom the ayatollahs ousted .
Not that wealthy Iranians are very happy either .
Businessmen , unlike ordinary citizens , are painfully aware of how international sanctions squeeze the economy and how tougher sanctions could hurt it far more .
Until now , traders have generally found ways to keep going .
They have switched en masse from Western to East Asian suppliers , such that in a few short years China has replaced Europe as Iran 's main trading partner .
They have also found ways to skirt the rather effective American pressure on international banks to avoid dealing with Iran , mostly by working through foreign intermediaries , and in non -dollar currencies .
But such means come at increasing expense .
One economist reckons that extra charges to open letters of credit via Dubai add 10 - 20 % to the cost of every transaction .
Small businesses courier cash back and forth to the Gulf emirate , but should banking strictures tighten , bigger firms would face serious trouble .
The local assembler of Peugeot cars , says a consultant , is not going to be able to pay for 100,000 French - made gearboxes in cash .
Government officials try hard to project confidence .
They point , for instance , to a boom in house construction and to Iran 's success at gaining self - sufficiency in such things as wheat , steel and cement .
Petrol rationing , which sparked widespread protest when introduced in June , has , in fact , sharply cut imports .
It is true , too , that despite the sanctions imposed by America since the revolution , Iran has enjoyed two decades of steady if unspectacular economic growth .
The country seems mildly prosperous compared with its neighbours , with tidy parks , clean streets and impressive figures for schooling and health care .
We do n't really need you anyway
Another common official refrain is that the world needs Iran more than Iran needs the world .
There is some truth to this .
With its 70 m consumers , many of them young , Iran is a hugely tempting market .
China and India thirst for Iranian energy , while Europe dreams of finding an alternative to dependence on Russia for its gas .
Yet it is hard , hearing tales of bureaucratic hurdles , corruption and Mafia - like interference by such privileged groups as the Revolutionary Guards , and seeing the level of talent displayed by many Iranian entrepreneurs , not to conclude that a country with such rich natural endowments is performing far below its potential .
Iranian analysts debate whether Mr Ahmadinejad 's free - spending ways have bolstered or diminished his base of support .
Some argue that the rural poor , long disregarded by the urban elite , have directly benefited from state handouts and still warm to his rhetoric of class retribution .
Even the middle class , they say , can see for itself the improvements in infrastructure , such as the underground train systems being built in four provincial cities , as well as for the capital .
Others note that in local elections last December , the president 's men , who generally fared badly , fared worst in districts where Mr Ahmadinejad previously served in local government .
The implication is that those who know him best believe him least .
Iranians grumble openly about the economy .
They tend to be less vocal but more worried about Mr Ahmadinejad 's other policies .
Unbidden , many express dismay at his inflammatory questioning of the Nazi Holocaust , citing this as an example of antics that achieve nothing for Iran .
When the mayor of Tehran , Muhammad Qalibaf , a pragmatic conservative , recently called for more “ maturity and intelligence ” in the handling of foreign affairs , the rumble of approval was almost audible over Tehran 's traffic din .
His voice joined a chorus that has spread across Iran 's complex political spectrum , from the left wing of idealist reformers through the varied hues of conservatism in the centre and up to the margins of the usulgaran ( fundamentalist ) faction , whose radical right wing Mr Ahmadinejad represents .
Yet such criticism has tended to be muted .
Iran is no longer as brutal a police state as in the revolution 's early years nor even as oppressive as many of its neighbours .
Though Iranians bemoan the ineffectiveness of the reformists who dominated the country under his predecessor , Mr Khatami , many do credit them with dispelling the mood of fear that permeated the 1980s and much of the 1990s .
But under Mr Ahmadinejad , selective repression has intensified just enough to signal that open dissent has again grown dangerous .
His fellow fundamentalists who dominate such institutions as the judiciary , the state prosecution service and the police have gleefully carried out orders to harass reformist newspapers , stifle student and labour protests , and crack down on “ bad hijab ” , supposedly improper adherence to strict Islamic dress codes .
Their efforts have proved quite effective .
Most Iranians probably resist the idea of returning to the supposed Islamic purity of the early revolution , yet most are far too preoccupied with getting by to protest .
The hijab , even reformists admit , is not much of an issue to the broader public , even though many hate the bullying , hectoring ways by which it is imposed .
Indeed , most Iranians are probably quite proud of their experiment with Islamic - flavoured semi-democracy .
Despite the flaws in the system , they tend to respect their institutions .
As several young Iranians volunteered to this correspondent , having lived through one revolution , the last thing they want is another .
Knowing the right beards
Besides , Mr Ahmadinejad has had powerful allies .
The supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has directly blessed the fierce morality campaign , and said he considers this the best administration the Islamic Republic has yet seen , though a newspaper close to Mr Khamenei this week accused the president of treating his opponents “ immorally ” .
Surprisingly to outsiders , who tend to view Iran through the lens of its articulate dissidents , Mr Khamenei remains a revered figure ; his office still basks in the shadow of the republic 's founding father , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini .
Indeed , official portraits of the bearded head of state show a smaller inset of his famously glowering , even more lushly bearded predecessor peering over Mr Khamenei 's shoulder .
The supreme leader cultivates an aura of aloofness from mundane affairs , but his backing carries more than moral weight .
He directly controls the state broadcasting system and the 125,000 - man Revolutionary Guards corps , which mans Iran 's borders ( so profiting , it is said , from smuggling rackets ) , liaises with overseas Islamist groups such as Lebanon 's Hizbullah and the Palestinians ' Hamas , and also runs hundreds of commercial enterprises .
AFP
Revering the president 's favourite mosque
Mr Khamenei is also constitutionally charged with setting the broad foreign - policy agenda .
He appoints top judges and half the members of the Guardian 's Council , a body of clerics that , among other things , vets candidates for political office .
The leader has access to a pool of funds that includes pious donations as well as income from several bonyads , holding companies tied to religious foundations .
Still , Mr Khamenei , a shrewd arbiter of Iran 's bruising politics , has been careful not to allow the president full rein .
Crucially , he has refrained from blocking the rise of conservative rivals of Mr Ahmadinejad , such as Hashemi Rafsanjani , a pragmatic former president , in key institutions .
Yet the supreme leader has so far concurred with Mr Ahmadinejad 's hard line on one crucial issue , the nuclear file .
This may reflect a similar world view : both deeply distrust Western intentions , sense that offence may be Iran 's best defence , and feel that Iran is poised to regain its natural place as the region 's strongman .
Iran has , after all , so far got away with defying the UN Security Council 's order to stop enriching nuclear fuel .
But his support on this score for the president also reflects
Mr Khamenei 's respect for the skill of a populist who has , far better than his rivals , conveyed to the public a link between possession of nuclear technology and a semi- sacred sense of national destiny .
Clever advertising jingles
This is important , because the nuclear programme is not easy to promote .
Practically speaking , it makes little sense .
Iran has poured an estimated $ 10 billion into building a complete , home - grown nuclear industry , yet it has just one nuclear power plant , the Russian - built Bushehr reactor , due to come on stream next year .
The same money could have built ten conventional plants of the same capacity , fired solely by the natural gas that Iran currently flares off into the sky , because it has not invested in the technology to recover it .
Russia has pledged a ten - year supply of fuel for the Bushehr reactor , meaning that there should be no use , any time soon , for the output of Iran 's costly nuclear - enrichment plant at Natanz .
The purpose of its heavy - water facility at Arak is even more obscure .
Yet the nuclear issue has been successfully portrayed to the Iranian public as a question not of economics but of national pride .
Iranians bristle at the suggestion that they may not need nuclear energy .
Why , they retort , should they not have it ?
The sole reason , as Mr Ahmadinejad insists , is that the West wants to keep Iran backward .
Most Iranians appear convinced by their government 's repeated assertions that the programme is entirely peaceful .
Even if Iran produces a nuclear weapon , comes the common retort , so what ?
Neighbouring Pakistan , far less stable , has them .
So does Israel .
Those countries have only existed since the 1940s , whereas Iran has been home to a brilliant civilisation since history 's beginning .
So the rhetoric goes .
Given Iran 's sense of itself as a thwarted great power , it is easy to see how the issue has grown so touchy .
Yet unease persists among sophisticated Iranians .
Even some religious conservatives understand that the nuclear question is not a Manichean one , pitting the good of Iranian progress against the bad of its enemies ' ill will .
Western countries , led by America , have been inept at explaining that they do not wish to deny nuclear know - how to Iran but simply do not trust its leaders .
But the less outspoken opposition of nearly all Iran 's neighbours , as well as of Russia and China ( see article ) , is starting to focus Iranian minds .
The barrage of official praise for the latest report of the UN 's nukes - watching agency cannot disguise the fact that it includes some pointed criticisms .
True enough , Iran has co-operated pretty much to the letter with the agency .
What is missing , the report strongly implies , aside from the required obedience to the Security Council 's diktat over nuclear enrichment , is Iran 's recognition that it could easily do more to dispel doubts as to its intentions .
It is this point that is starting to cause schisms in Tehran .
In a brave move , Shireen Ebadi , a Nobel prize - winning human - rights lawyer , recently called in public for an immediate stop to the enrichment programme .
Needless to say , Ms Ebadi is seen as anathema in Iran 's ruling circles .
Yet her point that Iran would lose little by such a step merely aired in public what more establishment figures say in private .
It also served to underline the anxiety generated by another of Mr Ahmadinejad 's brash gestures .
Following a speech in which he blasted critics of his nuclear policy as traitors , his government announced it would press espionage charges against Hossein Mousavian , who served as Iran 's chief nuclear negotiator under Mr Khatami .
This , it seems , is what drew this week 's sharp rebuke of the president from the supreme leader 's camp .
The common explanation in Tehran is that the espionage charge was aimed at tarring the previous administration and reformists in general as dangers to the revolution .
Mr Mousavian is known to be close to Mr Rafsanjani — some would say under his protection .
Yet this kind of tough domestic politicking also showed up Mr Ahmadinejad 's government as dangerously isolated in the world .
If there is really nothing to hide about the Iranian nuclear programme , what could there be to spy on ?
Mr Ahmadinejad may be correct in judging that , for the time being , he can brazen out his nuclear programme .
Most Western countries plainly judge the risks of a military attack on Iran to be greater than its rewards .
America is probably beginning to see the advantages of co-operation with Iran in resolving Iraq 's woes .
But Mr Ahmadinejad is wrong to think that he is home free .
The danger of an unwanted outbreak of hostilities , provoked by some chance incident , remains great .
Iran will continue to pay a high price , even without toughened sanctions , for its lack of openness on the nuclear issue .
Perhaps most distressing for Mr Ahmadinejad , he is likely to pay a high price in domestic politics for his lack of tact .
Assuming there is no American attack on Iran to provoke a nationalist backlash , his radical fundamentalists may well get drubbed in the parliamentary elections in March .
In the poll that brought him to power in 2005 , some 20 m Iranians refrained from voting .
Many are itching to get in a word this time .
Rather like his nemesis , Mr Bush , Mr Ahmadinejad may find himself facing a punchy parliament packed with people who want to get rid of him .
Supreme Court rejects ACLU challenge to wiretaps Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday February 19 , 2008

Print This Email This The Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the Bush administration 's domestic spying program .
However , the justices ' decision Tuesday included no comment explaining why they turned down the appeal from the American Civil Liberties Union .
 Although we are deeply disappointed with the Supreme Courts refusal to review this case , it is worth noting that todays action says nothing about the cases merits and does not suggest in any way an endorsement of the lower courts decision .
The courts unwillingness to act makes it even more important that Congress insist on legislative safeguards that will protect civil liberties without jeopardizing national security , " ACLU Legal Director Steven R. Shapiro said in a news release .
The setback comes as Congress spars with President Bush over whether to grant legal immunity to telecommunications companies .
The ACLU and other groups say some 40 similar lawsuits pending against the private companies , rather than the government itself , are among the only means of oversight of Bush 's warratnless wiretapping program .
 Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act intending to protect the rights of U.S. citizens and residents , and the president systematically broke that law over a period of more than five years , " said Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLUs National Security Project .
" It s very disturbing that the presidents actions will not be reviewed by the Supreme Court .
It shouldnt be left to executive branch officials alone to determine what limits apply to their own surveillance activities and whether those limits are being honored .
Allowing the executive branch to police itself flies in the face of the constitutional system of checks and balances .
The court said plaintiffs represented by the ACLU could not sue the government because they could not prove their communications had been warrantlessly monitored by the National Security Agency .
Shapiro also called it a " Catch - 22 " scenario because records of who the government spied on were classified .
The ACLU wanted the court to allow a lawsuit by the group and individuals over the warrantless wiretapping program .
An appeals court dismissed the suit because the plaintiffs cannot prove their communications have been monitored .
The government has refused to turn over information about the closely guarded program that could reveal who has been under surveillance .
Developing ... ( with wire reports )
By Karishma Vaswani
India business correspondent , BBC News , Mumbai
Indian salaries climbed by an average 15 % last year , the fastest rate of growth worldwide , a survey has claimed .
And that growth is expected this year as well , even though the economy is set to slow .
So who exactly is making all this money ?
It has been a good year for 35 - year - old chauffeur Bharat Jadhav .
Getting people about in Mumbai 's crazy traffic is a real skill
He is a secondary school graduate , which means he left school with a basic education at the age of 15 .
Finding a well paying job was tough a decade ago when he first arrived in Mumbai - jobs for people with his qualifications were few and far between .
Even if you did eventually find a job , it tended to be some form of menial labour , with minimal wages .
Bharat managed to get a job as a driver - but even then , the salary at that time was n't enough to make ends meet .
But thanks to the boom in the economy over the last ten years , Bharat is now making more than $ 150 a month .
" You can make good money now in Mumbai as a driver - although the salary does depend on the boss , " he says as he washes his car .
" My wages have gone up every year by over $ 100 - that 's almost a 20 % jump annually . "
That is because there is a real shortage of personal chauffeurs in Mumbai .
And vacancies have multiplied - as a result of more executives taking up posts in the city who need someone reliable to drive them around in Mumbai 's mad traffic to and from their meetings .
Some drivers can command almost $ 300 a month if they speak some English .
That is just a little bit lower than starting salaries of entry - level call centre workers outside of Mumbai .
Talking head
It is not just drivers in India who are seeing their salaries soar - some of the country 's worst paid professionals are also seeing a boost in their pay packets .
Journalism has never been one of the best paid jobs - in India or otherwise .
Even up until last year , many senior print journalists in India for prestigious newspapers or websites were not taking home more than $ 1,000 a month .
Standing up and speaking into a camera is not an easy job But for Taneia Bhardwaj , a senior correspondent at one of India 's newest television channels , UTVi , money is no longer so much of an issue .
Taneia spends most of her days zipping from one press conference to another , interviewing folks from all walks of life .
It 's a tiring job - but she is not complaining .
" If you were to compare what I made say four years ago , to what I make now then I probably make six times the amount I used to ! "
Taneia explains in between getting sound bites at a press conference .
" Media has really picked up in India - and there 's a whole slew of new channels that have come up .
" There are only so many people who are trained in the medium , and who can do the job of being a journalist and being on television well - so there 's a lot of demand for good , strong talent . "
Making hay A dearth of talent is one of the main reasons why salaries have gone through the roof in India .
And it is jobs in the real estate sector that are bringing home the biggest bucks , according to a recent survey on salaries in India by Hewitt .
It said that on average wages in India 's real estate sector have jumped some 25 % - beating the average rise in salaries across the country and industries , which came in at 15 % .
The shortage of skills means people can change career easily
The main reason salaries in the real estate sector have taken off is because of the boom in India 's property market .
Property prices have soared in India - some 40 % in the last year - as newly rich Indians look for a home for their families or some real estate to buy as an investment .
As a result , young professionals like Viral Desai have reaped the benefits of this boom .
The 28 - year - old property consultant has seen his salary double - despite the fact that before this job he had never worked in real estate .
Previously he was a manager in a call centre - but was hired because of his enthusiasm for the property sector , and his attention to detail .
" Make hay while the sun shines I say !
I 've seen salaries jump more than 50 % in the real estate sector , " Viral says .
" Now more people can buy houses thanks to these higher salaries , buy a car - all of this was not possible some time back - so as a result of everyone making more money , the standard of living has also increased . "
Hire and fire Currently , there is an unprecedented demand for skilled workers in India .
Property consultancy Knight Frank , where Viral works , needs to fill two or three vacancies every single week as they try to keep up with demand and keep their operations running .
" Do you know sometimes I have to turn down transactions ? , " Pranay Vakil , the chairman of Knight Frank in India says .
" I am willing to train new people , and fresh graduates - and even though I may spend money on their training , and then they may leave me , it 's worth it - because at least I will keep the business running for that time . "
The lure of a government office job is no longer as strong as it was The Indian operations of Knight Frank have grown substantially in the last year - and as a result the salaries of young employees at the firm have as well .
New graduates used to earn some $ 10,000 a year - but now no one will accept anything less than $ 20,000 .
But these higher salaries may also come at a high price .
" I think what the higher salaries are going to bring about is hire - and - fire laws , " says Pranay Vakil .
" When you are paying or overpaying someone , then you wo n't live with any nonsense - you 'll look for the alternatives .
" There 's a new culture that 's emerging and the patience is kind of running out with people who do n't perform up to the expectations of employers . "
Shifting perspectives
This new attitude can been seen in the cultural change taking place in offices across India .
For decades after India 's independence , the ideal job was one in a government office - a secure position that was guaranteed for life .
Granted , the downside was you may not make very much money , and certainly owning a house would not become a reality until you hit your late forties .
But you would always have a job .
All of that changed when India 's economy opened up in the 1990s and competition entered the Indian workplace .
Western ways of working were adopted by Indian staff , and with them came the desire for Western goods and Western - style salaries .
Indian wages are surging as a result , and while that may rake in huge rewards for employees , the risks could be just as great .

and is taking Nintendo to court over its implementation
Normally when we see somebody filing a lawsuit with interface - related patents in question , we 're talking about some vague thing filed a couple months after that product went into production and with little relation to the real - life technology under fire .
No such luck for Nintendo this time around : Patrick Goschy , an ex-Midway employee , has a YouTube video of himself demonstrating something astoundingly similar to a Wiimote / Nunchuck ... eight years ago .
His demo shows his hacked - together controllers providing a surprisingly - responsive interface for a bit of Ready 2 Rumble Boxing on the Dreamcast .
Goschy , who appeared on Fox News in Chicago last night , says that he has had no formal involvement with the Wii , but holds the related patents .
Rumor has it that Nintendo might have to sacrifice as much as 47 seconds of retail profits were the company to lose in court .
Video is after the break , brace yourself for a complete lack of pants .
[ Thanks , Boyo ]
Patrick 's wife Sheri contacted us to set the story straight and says that Patrick is n't suing Nintendo ( yet ) .
She also gave us the link to the news story , which provides some further info and a Nintendo statement which denies any Goschy involvement in the Wii 's technology .
JOHN McCAIN spent half of last week in California and it looks like he was n't just fundraising .
The state legislature has just passed a measure allowing for the proportional allotment of electoral votes in the presidential election .
There were burblings about this back in the autumn — state Republicans were agitating for a ballot initiative to that effect .
But it was thought that Democrats would have no trouble blocking it ; Democratic presidential candidates need to win all of California 's 55 electoral votes to counter the Republicans ' hold on the south and middle America .
Did Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , who has endorsed Mr McCain , twist some arms ?
Or was California tired of being overlooked in the general as the candidates lavish their love on Florida and Ohio and Missouri ?
Either way , this is very bad news for the Democrats .
With California going proportional , it is likely that Mr McCain will win anywhere from 15 to 20 electoral votes in the state .
That 's the equivalent of winning Ohio .
As expected , Mr McCain has called it a " fair move " for a state that is " increasingly shading red . "
Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton , meanwhile , are fuming ; they 've actually forgotten to fight each other today , although Mr Obama will soon realise that this makes Mrs Clinton 's primary victory in California seem rather less important .
Also a bit , uh , discomfited is the Democratic National Committee , which issued the following scathing press release .
Believe it or not , Pokemon GO is still played by lots of people .
Niantic developer said that currently there are over 65 million people worldwide who are still playing the game each month .
Moreover , the app has won the Best Mobile and Handheld Game award , which was given at the British Academy of Film , Television and Arts Game Awards .
Moreover , IGN awarded the game the Mobile Game of the Year prize , and BBC Radio named it the Best Game in 2017 .
Future possibilities
Last weekend , Niantic thanked everyone for all the awards they received and revealed some other details about future possibilities to come for people who are playing the game .
One of the most interesting things the developers mentioned is the fact that the co-op multiplayer option could be arriving soon to Pokemon GO .
According to them , players are in for a new and exciting co-op gameplay experience .
However , for now we do n’t have more information about the multiplayer features , but we hope that the developer will announce them soon enough .
They also said that this change will be just in time for spring arriving in the northern hemisphere , which is true .
In this way , Trainers can find new reasons to spend more time outside and to enjoy the great weather to come .
Looking back , we have to admit that Pokemon GO was quite a hit .
Immediately after its release it brought together millions of players , especially those who were nostalgic about the game of their childhood .
Naturally , there were also lots of criticism , some associated with the fact that it caused accidents and even injuries or death , while some regarded the fact that after the high peak , the developers did little to keep their players loyal , which led to a decline in their numbers .
Dallas man freed by DNA testing after 27 years in prison Associated Press
Published : Tuesday April 29 , 2008

Print This Email This By SCHUYLER DIXON DALLAS  James Lee Woodard could have been out of prison long ago , had he just confessed to a parole board that he was guilty of killing his girlfriend in 1980 .
But the convicted Dallas man eventually stopped attending those hearings rather than admit to something he said he did n't do .
Instead , he waited 27 years until a judge on Tuesday made him the nation 's longest - serving inmate to be freed as a result of DNA testing .
" It says a lot about your character that you were more interested in the truth than your freedom , " state District Judge Mark Stoltz told Woodard after making his ruling , which must be formalized by an appeals court or a pardon from Gov. Rick Perry .
Woodard , jailed since New Year 's Day 1981 after his girlfriend was raped and murdered , became the 18th person in Dallas County to have his conviction cast aside .
That 's more than any other county in the nation , according to the Innocence Project , a New York - based legal center that specializes in overturning wrongful convictions .
Wearing a purple shirt and tie with a black sport coat , Woodard stepped out of the courtroom and raised his arms to a throng of photographers .
Supporters and others in a crowded hall outside the court erupted in applause .
" I thank God for the existence of the Innocence Project , " Woodard , 55 , told the court .
" Without that , I would n't be here today .
I would be wasting away in prison . "
Overall , 31 people have been formally exonerated through DNA testing in Texas , also the most in the U.S.
That does not include Woodard and at least three others whose exonerations are not yet official .
Like nearly all the exonorees , Woodard maintained his innocence throughout his time in prison .
But seven letters to police and prosecutors , six writs with appeals courts and two requests for DNA testing went nowhere .
Eventually , he was labeled an abuser of the system , according to the Innocence Project .
" On the first day he was arrested , he told the world he was innocent ... and nobody listened , " said Jeff Blackburn , chief counsel for the Innocence Project of Texas .
Blackburn and prosecutors hailed Tuesday 's hearing as a landmark moment of frequent adversaries working together .
Since the DNA evidence was tied to rape and Woodard was convicted of murder , Innocence Project attorneys had to prove that the same person committed both crimes .
They said they could n't have done that without access to evidence provided by Dallas County District Attorney Craig Watkins ' office .
" You 've got to have very good lawyers with a lot of experience and skill ... working on both ends of this case , hard , " Blackburn said .
" And you 've also got to have government power behind what you do . "
Under Watkins , Dallas County has a program supervised by the Innocence Project of Texas that is reviewing hundreds of cases of convicts who have requested DNA testing to prove their innocence .
While the number of exonerations on Watkins ' watch continues to grow , he said this one was a little different .
" I saw the human side of it , and seeing the human said of it just gives you more courage to advocate for issues like this , " said Watkins , who had breakfast with Woodard on Tuesday morning .
" It gives me that resolve to go even further to find out who ( the killer ) is so that we can get him into custody . "
Woodard was sentenced to life in prison in July 1981 for the murder of a 21 - year - old Dallas woman found sexually assaulted and strangled near the banks of the Trinity River .
He was convicted primarily on the basis of testimony from two eyewitnesses , said Natalie Roetzel , the executive director of the Innocence Project of Texas .
One has since recanted and the accuracy of the other has been questioned , Roetzel said .
Four men previously exonerated in Dallas County cases attended the hearing for Woodard , who was presented $ 100 by one of them .
Woodard said his family was " small and scattered , " although he pointed out a niece in the courtroom .
He said his biggest regret was not being with his mother when she died while he was in prison .
" I can tell you what I 'd like to do first : breathe fresh , free air , " Woodard said during a news conference in the courtroom after the hearing .
" I do n't know what to expect .
I have n't been in Dallas since buses were blue . "

The Video Appeals Committee upheld an earlier decision that the game could be sold , following a nine - month battle between makers Rockstar and UK censors .
The British Board of Film Classification had taken the fight to ban the game to the High Court , saying the game " went too far " .
An edited version of the title will be released with an 18 certificate .
The game was first banned in June 2007 and an edited version of the game was later rejected by the BBFC .
David Cooke , director of the BBFC said : " As I have said previously , we never take rejection decisions lightly , and they always involve a complex balance of considerations .
Who should we believe when it comes to video games - developers or the BBFC ?

" We twice rejected Manhunt 2 , and then pursued a judicial review challenge , because we considered , after exceptionally thorough examination , that it posed a real potential harm risk .
" However , the Video Appeals Committee has again exercised its independent scrutiny .
It is now clear , in the light of this decision , and our legal advice , that we have no alternative but to issue an 18 certificate to the game . "
Developers Rockstar Games has always maintained that the content of Manhunt 2 is no different from other 18 - rated entertainment products , such as the film series Saw .
In a statement , the company said : " We are pleased that the VAC has reaffirmed its decision recognizing that Manhunt 2 is well within the bounds established by other 18 + rated entertainment .
" Rockstar Games is committed to making great interactive entertainment , while also marketing our products responsibly and supporting an effective rating system . "
Update : several more recent versions of my Perl Myths talk are available .
These have significant updates .
Slides can be found on slideshare .
net and screencasts can be found on my blip.tv channel .
I ’ve uploaded my Perl Myths presentation to slideshare .
net and google video :
“ Perl has it ’s share of myths .
This presentation debunks a few popular ones with hard facts .
Surprise yourself with the realities . ”
While I agree with Andy Lester that Good Perl code is the best form of evangelism , I wanted to put together a presentation that others could refer to when they encounter misinformation about Perl .
I cover these myths that I ’ve heard recently :
Perl is dead
Perl is hard to read / test / maintain
Perl 6 is killing Perl 5
and pull in a wealth of upto date information , some of it quite surprising even to those familiar with Perl and its community .
There are two versions , plus a video .
I recommend the one with notes ( which have useful extra detail and context for the slides ) which is best viewed as a PDF .
There ’s also one without notes which I ’ve embedded here :
I videoed an extended version of this presentation at IWTC in Dublin in February .
The first 40 minutes or so correspond with the slides above .
In the remaining 30 minutes or so I talk about Parrot and Perl 6 .
I ’ve embedded the video below , but wordpress forces me to use a small size so you ’ll probably prefer to view it at video.google.com :
ALTHOUGH HIS poll rankings are perpetually low , it 's easy to spot Dennis Kucinich in the crowd of Democrats running for president :
He 's the bright green man , the one pushing for an almost utopian recommitment to the environment .
Kucinich proposes a WGA - Works Green Administration - after Franklin Roosevelt 's Depression - era Works Progress Administration , which enlisted millions of unemployed people to work on public projects such as building bridges , roads , schools , and parks .
Kucinich 's WGA would spend federal funds on a sweeping environmental makeover .
The WGA would work with NASA to develop new wind and solar energy devices .
It could " put millions to work , " Kucinich recently told the Globe , because workers could be hired to manufacture these devices and install them in homes .
And America could share the new technology with the rest of the world .
It would make government dollars do three jobs at once : protect the environment , pump - prime the economy , and retrain the workforce .
It 's an idea that sounds too good to be possible , a vision of an America where every city is an Emerald City .
And it 's easy for Kucinich to talk big since his chances of becoming president are so small .
But take Kucinich 's grand idea and scale it down , and it becomes quite plausible .
That 's where the Green Jobs Act comes in .
Cosponsored in the US House by Massachusetts Democrat John Tierney , the bill would train a citizens army of " green - collar workers , " employed in the fields of renewable energy and energy efficiency .
" Green - collar jobs can provide living wages and upward mobility , " Tierney said in Congress in August .
" For some , they will create a way out of poverty , even as they help improve our environment and buttress our national security by lessoning reliance on foreign oil . "
In an interview , Tierney praised EBSCO Publishing , an Ipswich company that revived an old mill building and installed solar panels .
EBSCO was able to go green and boost the local economy by contracting with four other Massachusetts companies to supply the materials and do the job .
It 's these companies , Tierney said , that need more skilled workers .
The bill would help by investing $ 125 million a year for five years to guide 35,000 workers toward promising , environmentally sound careers .
Programs would update the skills of current workers , and train returning veterans , the unemployed , disadvantaged youths , nonviolent ex-offenders , and workers affected by changes in national energy policy .
If this bill becomes law , it will be a step toward Kucinich 's ideal world , where it 's a lot easier to be green .

Some record labels want persistent pirates thrown off the net European politicians have voted down calls to throw suspected file - sharers off the net .
The idea to cut off persistent pirates formed part of a wide - ranging report on creative industries written for the European parliament .
But in a narrow vote MEPs backed an amendment to the report which said net bans conflicted with " civil liberties and human rights " .
It puts MEPS at odds with governments planning tough action against pirates .
Piracy police " The vote shows that MEPs want to strike a balance between the interests of rights holders and those of consumers , and that big measures like cutting off internet access should n't be used , " said a spokeswoman for the European Parliament after the vote .
The amendment was added to the so - called Bono Report on the Cultural Industries .
This was written by French MEP Guy Bono to inform forthcoming European parliament policy that would encourage growth in the region 's creative industries .
The amendment called on the EC and its member nations to " avoid adopting measures conflicting with civil liberties and human rights and with the principles of proportionality , effectiveness and dissuasiveness , such as the interruption of internet access . "
The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) , which represents Europe 's music industry , said the amendment was " badly drafted " and contradicted the rest of the report .
" We look forward to a full discussion in the European Parliament in the coming months on how best to address copyright theft online , " said the IFPI .
The vote has no legal force and leaves national governments free to implement their own anti-piracy plans .
But , said the Open Rights Group , it does " signify resistance " among European law makers to the strict measures that nations such as France are implementing .
In late November 2007 France announced its intention to implement a law that turns net firms into anti-piracy watchdogs .
Information gathered about individuals who persistently share music and movies online will be passed to a government unit that will issue warnings or ask for an individual 's net access to be suspended or shut off .
The British government has floated similar plans but net firms have rejected calls for them to act as watchdogs .

Quote of the Day : Pundits
My friend Helene ( a well regarded technician ) had an interesting quote yesterday on pundits :
Clearly , the recession that has n't begun yet is over .
At least , that 's what all the folks who never saw the recession coming , then decided we were going to have one , and who now say it 's over , believe .
I know because I heard them say so on TV , time and again .

EU ’s common position on Kosovo :
So what ?
As the European Union announces ( for once ) that it is near to reaching a common position on something - Kosovo , so what if it does ?
It would seem that certain EU countries forget their role in the horrendous break - up of Yugoslavia afer hastily recognizing States which never existed and the chaos that followed as military aid poured into the newly proclaimed “ Republics ” , the Serbs were demonised and the Balkans map defied 600 years of history .
Are they going to make the same mistake again ?
EU ’s common position on Kosovo :
So what ?
To begin with , the legality of any decision or position taken by the EU countries on any territory outside its borders is absolutely nil .
Secondly , Kosovo is a Province of the Republic of Serbia , period .
Thirdly , any decisions which recognise any form of independence for the Kosovar Albanians is illegal , since it goes against the fundamental principles of international law , set forth under the UN Charter Article 2 ( 4 ) regarding the inviolability of frontiers .
Independence is not a game or merely a word to be taken lightly .
The independence of a people or a nation is a process set upon the foundations of hundreds , if not thousands , of years of history which in turn is based upon due process and the tests and trials of the most complex of socio-cultural , ethnic and historical vectors .
Any “ taking of position ” by the EU in an area outside its frontiers can only be taken as an act of intrusion , an attempt to put pressure of Sebia into losing 15 % of its territory and moreover , the birthplace of its nation , the very essence of its psyche .
Asking Serbia to give up Kosovo to the Albanians is like asking the Serb people to tear their hearts out .
If this is what the Kosovar Albanians are waiting for , then let it be crystal clear that under international law , any declaration of independence is meaningless and any recognition of states which do not exist is condoning the breach of international law .
Let the European Union solve its own considerable number of nationalities questions and stop interfering .
God knows how many problems have been created worldwide due to the European nations ’ colonialistic and imperialistic past .
It seems they have yet to learn the lesson .

BBC News , Nablus
Six years ago , Abdul - Latif Nasif and his two brothers built their family home on one of the hills over - looking the West Bank city of Nablus .
The house has a commanding view over Nablus ...
It has spectacular views over the city and surrounding area - but that has been its curse .
" This just is n't my home any more , " says the 47 - year - old Palestinian bank manager , " it might as well belong to the Israeli army . "
Less than a month after it was finished , Mr Nasif says Israeli troops banged on the door and came in with dogs and guns , telling all his family to gather in one room .
He says they took control of the upper storeys of the house and used it as a base and observation post as the army invaded Nablus .
" They stuck maps on the wall in my living room and brought computers to make the room like a control room . "
They stayed for over a month .
Mr Nasif says there was huge relief in his family when the army finally left , but the joy was short - lived .
Magazine spread
Over the last six years , the Israeli army has made frequent incursions into the city , to arrest and kill militants .
When it does , the soldiers often return to bang on Mr Nasif 's door .
... which makes it a favoured lookout for Israeli soldiers " They come any time they want , in the morning , or in the middle of the night .
It scares us . " says Mr Nasif .
" Sometimes they stay for a night , sometimes for weeks . "
" They use anything they want .
They have used my bed , my children 's beds , the bathrooms , the gas , electricity - everything . "
On one occasion , the soldiers took photographs of themselves camped in Mr Nasif 's living room and sent the pictures to an Israeli magazine .
When they next raided Nablus , they gave Mr Nasif a copy of the magazine .
In total , 22 members of Mr Nasif 's family live in the house .
They include his five children and 73 - year - old mother .
" I do n't know what to do , or who to speak to , or where to take my family .
Me and my brothers spent all our money building this house , but we are not safe . "
Militant history Mr Nasif says his youngest son , Yusuf , was just 15 days old when the army first came to the house .
" Yusuf is six years old now , and all through his life this has been happening .
They were here again just two days ago . "
Mr Nasif says the Israeli soldiers sleep on his children 's ' beds Nablus does have a history of militancy .
In the past , perpetrators of bombings in which Israeli civilians were killed , came from the city .
Although those attacks have dramatically decreased in number over recent years , the army says that does not mean attacks are not still being planned .
That is why it says it needs to keep on making its raids into Nablus .
But Mr Nasif is upset that he and his family have to suffer .
" When I ask the soldiers to leave us alone , they say I should tell people to stop planning bombings in Israel , but I say it 's nothing to do with me .
I have done nothing wrong to the state of Israel .
We do n't deserve this , " he says .
Mr Nasif says he has written letters of complaint to the offices of Israeli politicians , but never had a reply .
Mr Nasif says the Israeli soldiers arrive without warning
He said he also sent a letter to the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat asking him to help and complaining to him of the damage the soldiers had caused to his house .
Mr Arafat sent him a cheque for $ 150 ( £ 75 ) to make repairs .
As to its use of Mr Nasif 's house in incursions , the Israeli army says it cannot comment on its operations .
The peace process was re-launched in November , but Mr Nasif says he has not noticed any difference in the frequency of the army raids on Nablus .
He says he still fears the arrival of Israeli troops at any time .

PORNOMEDIA AND PETTER HEGRE PRESENT : THE Y PROJECT COLLECTION
No two creatures are created equal .
We are , each one of us , as different as two sunsets , as unique us our fingerprints .
So it is with the female sex flower .
It is as diverse as our very existence .
It is life 's most vital organ .
The German philosopher Martin Heidegger tells us that when an object or desire passes from concealment to revelation , truth appears .
The Y Project , we have taken Heidegger 's musings , drawn back the multiple layers of suppression and inhibition and shown that , in the candid eye of the microscope , humanity 's point of entry possesses an individuality that is surely truth itself .
The flesh of this rare object of desire is delicate but firm , as soft as a peach , as complex as an onion .
It is as aromatic and distinctive as the spices in a bazaar .
It is shaped as if by the hand of an artist so driven to seek the illusive golden mean , he is never satisfied with what he has created and each day must begin again .
As these images demonstrate , the sex flower comes in all shapes and sizes , each as unique as it is beautiful , each a fragment of true perfection .
The photographs from Petter Hegre 's Y Project Collection have until now only been seen at exhibits at the Stavanger Museum of Art in Norway , and the Galeria Antonio de Bernola in Barcelona .

Technical & HR Interview Questions of Google , Microsoft , Yahoo and many more Companies .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Internet leader Google Inc GOOG.O said on Thursday it saw no impact from a weakening U.S. economy as it posted a better - than - expected quarterly profit and waved off fears of an online advertising slump .
A Google search page is seen through the spectacles of a computer user in Leicester , England July 20 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Darren Staples
Google ’s hard - hit shares surged 18 percent above $ 500 -- a level last seen in February -- as the company showed signs of better cost control and earned more revenue abroad than at home for the first time , partly because of the weak dollar .
“ It ’s clear to us that we ’re well positioned for 2008 and beyond , regardless of the business environment that we find ourselves surrounded by , ” Chairman and Chief Executive Eric Schmidt told investors on a conference call .
Google , one of the hottest technology stocks of 2007 , had seen its shares erase last year ’s 50 percent gain since the start of 2008 on investor concerns that the online ad industry was maturing and vulnerable to a U.S. economic downturn .
“ It ’s a good time to be a Google bull , ” said Colin Gillis , an analyst with Canaccord Adams .
“ The boys delivered . ”
But Cowen &
Co analyst Jim Friedland said the surge in the shares was not based on dramatic improvements in Google ’s growth outlook , simply on relief that the economy was not dragging down the company ’s results as had been feared .
“ It was sort of an uneventful quarter other than taking a major concern -- the economy -- off the table , ” he said .
First - quarter net income rose to $ 1.31 billion , or $ 4.12 per diluted share , from $ 1 billion , or $ 3.18 per share , a year earlier .
Excluding one - time items and stock option expenses , profit was $ 4.84 per share , comfortably ahead of the average Wall Street forecast of $ 4.53 on Reuters Estimates .
Gross revenue rose 42 percent to $ 5.19 billion , just ahead of Wall Street targets .
By contrast , Google ’s revenue grew at a 63 percent rate in the same quarter a year ago .
International revenue accounted for 51 percent of the total , surpassing U.S. revenue for the first time and powering the company ’s results .
Translating overseas sales into a weaker dollar helped boost Google revenue by nearly 4 percent .
Google 's performance may strengthen Yahoo Inc YHOO.
O in its efforts to wring a higher takeover offer from would - be buyer Microsoft Corp MSFT.O .
“ This signals that the online advertising market is still healthy , which should help Yahoo get a better price for its company if it does decide to sell to Microsoft , ” said Peter Dunay , chief investment strategist at broker - dealer Meridian Equity Partners .
BETTER THAN FEARED
Google has been the subject of intense Wall Street debate over whether recent comScore data showing Google having trouble converting Web searchers into ad viewers is an indication its best days of growth are behind it .
Paid clicks , a measure of how often users of its
Web search click on ads tied to search results , rose 4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007 and grew 20 percent from a year ago .
“ Clearly the area that Google was trying to focus on -- having more relevant searches -- is working , ” Global Crown Capital analyst Martin Pyykkonen said .
Measured on clicks ,
Google ’s performance was better than feared , but a far cry from a year ago , when the number of Google users clicking away grew 52 percent on the year before .
Some of the slowing growth is self - inflicted .
Since August , officials say Google has been axing low - performing ads in order to encourage clicks on more meaningful ads at higher rates .
Google ’s traffic acquisition costs -- the cut of advertising revenue paid out to affiliated sites that run its ads -- amounted to 29 percent of ad revenue in the first quarter .
A year ago , the proportion was 31 percent .
Google closed a $ 3.4 billion acquisition of ad technology company DoubleClick in March .
The move strengthened its position against Yahoo and Microsoft in the market for online brand advertising preferred by corporate marketers .
Co-founder Sergey Brin said in a phone interview that the company aimed this quarter to link up DoubleClick ’s system for buying and selling online display ads with Google ’s own AdSense system for buying and selling other types of online ads .
“ We really feel we ’re in a position to become the world ’s largest display ads provider , ” added Jonathan Rosenberg , Google ’s senior vice president for product management .
Google shares shot up to $ 529.38 in extended trading from its close of $ 449.54 on the Nasdaq earlier on Thursday .
Helping that rebound , Schmidt said Google was confident its targeted advertising could withstand most economic scenarios .
“ On the macro side we ’ve looked at this really carefully and we do not see an impact as of this time , ” Schmidt told analysts and investors on the quarterly conference call .
“ Our conclusion is that we ’re well positioned , should economics change , to continue to do well because our model is so targeted and targeted advertising does well in pretty much most scenarios , we think . ”
The citizens of the homeland did n't hear about it when he died , and many of them would n't have cared .
They should be grateful we 're occupying their country , some said .
We 're building new roads and bringing them our civilization .
And did n't we let them elect their own representatives ?
The Senators spoke fine words , but when push came to shove they yielded authority to their leader to do whatever he wanted .
And so it came to pass that one more body was broken and one more life was taken .
You did n't need to " profile " him to know he was suspicious - more suspicious than most of the prisoners that were seized and taken to that infamous prison .
His religion , his ethnicity , and his Middle Eastern name made him suspect from the start .
Worse , he was an ardent follower of his desert religion , with its holy book full of blood crimes and beheadings .
And he was an outspoken street speaker , part of a radical fringe that wanted the interlopers out of his country .
Then there was the matter of the one who turned him in to the authorities .
A lot of the folks being carted off to prison had been caught the same way , with an unconformed denunciation from a neighbor , a family member , or a business rival .
Many of them had never been named at all .
They were just in the wrong place at the wrong time .
And this guy looked suspicious , with his crazy desert clothing and his long fanatic 's beard .
He did n't just challenge the foreign occupiers , either .
He denounced leaders in his own religion when he felt they had become too comfortable with those who wielded power .
Make no mistake : there were those among his people who would do bloody things , who would kill as many occupiers as they could .
He was n't one of them .
But the torturers were n't very discriminating .
They all look pretty much alike underneath a hood , anyway .
They seized him one night and took him to a secret prison , where they beat and tortured him .
They posed him in humiliating positions .
The only reason they did n't videotape and photograph the ritualized pain was that there were n't any cameras around .
But they made sure that lots of the locals saw him being tortured .
They thought it would have a discouraging effect on the more militant ones .
He was innocent .
He had no intention of hurting anyone .
He was more concerned with the well - being of his fellow detainees than he was with himself .
That 's the kind of guy he was .
There were others who were violent , who wanted to slaughter the invaders .
But torturing him did n't help the occupiers find the ones planning to kill .
It never has .
It only added converts to the rebellion .
The torturers did n't know that , though .
They had n't learned from those who had come before them .
That 's the thing about torturers : they never learn .
Finally they killed him .
It was a pre-emptive and public assassination .
They assumed that he would be scorned , ridiculed , and then forgotten .
But he was n't .
His words may have been forgotten among the powerful , but some of the powerless whisper them still .
" Whatever you do to the least of these , " he said , " you do to Me . "

Elizabeth Edwards has cancer .
John McCain has had cancer in the past .
Last weekend , Mrs. Edwards bluntly pointed out that neither of them would be able to get insurance under Mr. McCain ’s health care plan .
It ’s about time someone said that and , more generally , made the case that Mr. McCain ’s approach to health care is based on voodoo economics  not the supply - side voodoo that claims that cutting taxes increases revenues ( though Mr. McCain says that , too ) , but the equally foolish claim , refuted by all available evidence , that the magic of the marketplace can produce cheap health care for everyone .
As Mrs. Edwards pointed out , the McCain health plan would do nothing to prevent insurance companies from denying coverage to those , like her and Mr. McCain , who have pre-existing medical conditions .
The McCain campaign ’s response was condescending and dismissive  a statement that Mrs. Edwards does n’t understand the comprehensive nature of the senator ’s approach , which would harness “ the power of competition to produce greater coverage for Americans , ” reducing costs so that even people with pre-existing conditions could afford care .
WASHINGTON , March 27 ( Reuters ) - Somebody forgot to tell Hillary Clinton the Democratic presidential race is over and Barack Obama won .
Obama has captured more state contests , more votes and more of the pledged convention delegates who will help decide which Democrat faces Republican Sen.
John McCain in November 's presidential election .
But Clinton , a New York senator who has flirted with disaster before in the back - and - forth nominating battle with Obama , shrugs off growing predictions of doom and still sees at least a narrow path to victory .
" I hear it in the atmosphere , " Clinton said of the increasingly loud chatter about whether she should drop out and let Democrats focus on the general election campaign .
" But the most common thing that people say to me ... is ' Do n't give up , keep going .
We 're with you . '
And I feel really good about that because that 's what I intend to do , " she told reporters on Tuesday .
Clinton has not been hearing those words of encouragement from a chorus of media commentators and Obama supporters who have questioned why she is pursuing her uphill fight to catch the Illinois senator .
The Politico newspaper declared Clinton " has virtually no chance of winning . "
A New York Times columnist called her campaign " the audacity of hopelessness " -- a pun on Obama 's book " The Audacity of Hope . "
New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson , a Cabinet member for her husband Bill , the former president , said it was time for Democrats to rally around Obama -- and was called a " Judas " by Clinton loyalist James Carville for his views .
Clinton and her campaign aides have worked hard to debunk the idea the race is over , holding daily conference calls to tout their viability and issuing a lengthy memo to rebut the " myth " that Clinton cannot win .
" In a campaign with dozens of unexpected twists and turns , bold prognostications should be viewed with a healthy dose of skepticism , " the memo said .
But Clinton needs almost everything to go her way in the next few months .
She had a setback last week when her push for revotes in Michigan and Florida failed .
Her victories there did not count because the contests were not sanctioned by the national party .
She also faced an uproar this week over her misstatements about coming under sniper fire on her arrival in Bosnia in 1996 .
TARGET : SUPERDELEGATES
The Clinton case for victory in the Democratic nomination fight is built on the backs of nearly 800 superdelegates -- elected officials and party insiders who are free to support anyone .
With 10 nominating contests remaining , Clinton lags Obama by more than 100 in the count of pledged delegates won in the state - by - state voting since January and has little chance of catching Obama .
But neither candidate is on track to win the 2,024 delegates needed to clinch the nomination -- making superdelegates the ultimate kingmakers .
Both camps have wooed them heavily , with Obama contending they should follow the will of Democratic voters .
By the last nominating contests on June 3 in Montana and South Dakota , Obama says , he will have won the most votes and delegates .
Clinton says she offers the best chance of beating McCain in November .
To help her make that argument she needs to close the gap on Obama by rolling up big wins in many of the remaining contests , beginning on April 22 with Pennsylvania .
" The Obama campaign is trying to persuade everybody that this is over .
I hope they do n't get their hands on the federal budget because they surely can't count , " said Clinton adviser Harold Ickes .
" We think that both candidates are going to be within a hair of each other by the time the last state votes .
At the end of this process , neither candidate will have the nomination " and superdelegates will decide , " Ickes said .
Clinton says she has won more big , diverse states crucial to Democratic hopes in November like Ohio , New Jersey and California , proving her worth in a general election battle .
The longer she continues , the more chance Obama might slip up and make a mistake that turns the tide of the campaign .
Clinton has made it clear she will not consider bowing out of the race until all of the states have concluded their voting .
At that point , Democrats hope , a winner will emerge without the battle continuing all the way to the August party convention in Denver .
" I think that what we have to wait and see is what happens in the next three months , and there 's been a lot of talk about what - if , what - if , what - if .
Let 's wait until we get some votes , " Clinton said .
British troops will only be sent to war in future after their deployment has been approved by MPs under moves announced by Jack Straw , the Justice Secretary .
The Prime Minister will lose the unlimited power to order military action in a package of constitutional reforms which also includes the abolition of the ban on protests near Parliament .
Before wars begin , the Government will have to spell out the aims of the military action and give information about its legality .

The issue was brought into focus by Britain 's involvement in the invasion of Iraq five years ago .
Although Tony Blair allowed MPs a vote on the eve of war , he was not obliged to do so .
Under the plans set out in a White Paper , the only exception would be when secrecy was essential – such as during covert action by special services – or in times of emergency .
Mr Straw said the change would " define a clear role for Parliament in the most critical of all decisions to face a nation , while ensuring that our nation 's security is not compromised " .
The ban on demonstrations within 1 km of Parliament without police permission will be scrapped .
It came into disrepute after it was used to arrest anti-war activists who read out the names of servicemen and women killed in Iraq and the organisers of a peace " tea party " in Parliament Square .
A Whitehall source said : " The current law just has n't worked . "
The Government will consult MPs over protecting access to Westminster .
The US says there were similarities between the Syrian and North Korean reactors
The United States has accused North Korea of helping Syria build a nuclear reactor that " was not intended for peaceful purposes " .
The site , said to be like one in North Korea , was bombed by Israel in 2007 .
Syria must " come clean " about its secret nuclear programme , the White House said in a statement after CIA officials briefed members of Congress .
Syria has repeated denials that it has any nuclear weapons programme , or any such agreement with North Korea .
Syrian officials have said the site that was bombed by Israel in September last year was an unused military facility under construction .
Building on the site had stopped some time before the air strike , the Syrians said .
SEQUENCE OF EVENTS 6 Sept 2007 : Israel bombs site in Syria 1 Oct : Syria 's President Assad tells BBC site was military 24 Oct : New satellite images taken show site bulldozed clear
Full text : US allegations US allegations raise questions Send us your comments
In late October 2007 , an independent American research organisation , the Institute for Science and International Security ( ISIS ) , released pre- and post - strike satellite images of the site which indicated it had been bulldozed flat after the bombing .
But the White House said the " cover - up " operation that Syria carried out after the Israeli air strike reinforced its belief that the alleged reactor " was not intended for peaceful activities " .
" Until 6 September , 2007 , the Syrian regime was building a covert nuclear reactor in its eastern desert capable of producing plutonium , " the statement said .
" The Syrian regime must come clean before the world regarding its illicit nuclear activities . "
The statement added that the US had long been " seriously concerned about North Korea 's nuclear weapons programme and its proliferation activities " .

But the White House insists it is committed to the on - going six-nation diplomacy , between North Korea and US , China , Japan , South Korea and Russia that led to a landmark deal with Pyongyang , in February 2007 .
Ulterior motive ?
North Korea agreed to give up its nuclear weapons in return for aid and its removal from a blacklist of state sponsors of terrorism .
But the US has accused Pyongyang of missing the deadline to make a full nuclear declaration as promised .

The CIA briefing and statement coincides with the end of a two - day meeting between US and North Korean officials on Pyongyang 's nuclear programme , which both sides say has gone well - fuelling speculation that a deal may be imminent .
The BBC's James Coomarasamy , in Washington , says the question being asked by some in the US capital is whether the reactor statement is designed to reinforce those diplomatic efforts or an attempt by some in the administration to undermine them .
Damning images ?
The CIA briefings included pictures which the US says prove that North Koreans were working inside the secret site .
One of the images , which shows two men standing side by side , was said by the CIA to be of the head of the North Korean nuclear plant and the head of the Syrian atomic energy commission together in Syria .
The images - said to have been obtained by Israel - showed striking similarities between the Syrian facility and the North Korean reactor at Yongbyon , the US said .
However , the facility was not yet operational and there was no fuel for the reactor , officials said .
Israeli fears Republican Congressman Pete Hoekstra , who attended the CIA briefing , said the US needed " good , clear , verifiable information " from the countries involved before North Korea could be removed from the terrorism blacklist , the AFP news agency quoted him as saying .
The US says this is the North Korean and Syrian nuclear chiefs in Syria Mr Hoekstra criticised the Bush administration for waiting eight months to brief the intelligence committee and warned that it could jeopardise any future agreement with North Korea .
Syrian officials have denied any North Korean involvement in their country .
" These allegations are ridiculous , " Syria 's ambassador to the UK , Sami Khiyami , told the BBC .
" We are used to such allegations now , since the day the United States has invaded Iraq - you remember all the theatrical presentations concerning the WMDs [ weapons of mass destruction ] in Iraq . "
Mr Khiyami said the facility was a deserted military building that had " nothing to do with a reactor " .
Syria is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) , which gives it the right to enrich its own fuel for civil nuclear power , under inspection from the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .
North Korea has previously denied transferring nuclear technology to Syria .
The BBC's Katya Adler in Jerusalem says the apparent strike on the reactor , deep inside Syria , was seen by many in Israel as a sign of their military prowess .
But she says Israeli defence officials now have expressed concern over the revelation of classified data in the US .

And we knew they knew and we were right .
ABC
News aired a segment on their daily news show that after a five month investigation , they could say that Bush 's most senior officials not only knew about the torture they were inflicting on suspected terrorists , but decided down to the last detail exactly how much torture to inflict .
The discussions in the White House were top secret and sources say , involve some of the President ’s most senior and influential advisors , principals of the National Security Council .
In dozens of private talks and meetings , sources said that a handful of top advisors discussed specific high - value al Qaeda prisoners and exactly how those prisoners would be interrogated .
Whether , for example , they would be slapped , pushed , deprived of sleep or subjected to simulated drowning , called waterboarding .
The discussion about the “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” were so detailed , sources said , the interrogations were almost choreographed , down to the number of times the CIA could use a specific tactic .
Former CIA director George Tenet , in an interview last year with ABC News told Charles Gibson , “ It was authorized .
It was legal , according to the Attorney General of the United States . ”
It also was discussed and approved in meetings by the National Security Council ’s Principals Committee , a group that included Vice President Cheney , Condoleezza Rice , Colin Powell , Donald Rumsfeld , George Tenet , John Ashcroft .
There 's your war crimes tribunal list right there .
While ABC brings up two terrorists that were connected to 9/11 -- implying that even though our country 's leaders have dragged us down to torturing people , at least they directed it at bad men who committed the worst tragedy on American soil -- but what they fail to connect are names like Maher Arar , Khaled al - Masri , Bisher al - Rawi and Mohamed Farag Ahmad Bashmilah .
Names of innocent men who were guilty of nothing more than being Muslim and were renditioned and tortured for information they could not provide .
So while it is a small comfort that a MSM is actually acknowledging and validating things that the liberal blogosphere have been yelling about for years , it is but a incremental step towards the truth that all Americans must know .
158 Polymorphism Performance Mysteries Explained
Author : Dr. Heinz M. Kabutz Date : 2008-04-01 Java Version : 6 Category : Performance
Abstract :
In this newsletter , we reveal some of the polymorphism mysteries in the JDK .
The HotSpot Server Compiler can distinguish between mono - morphism , bi-morphism and poly - morphism .
The bi-morphism is a special case which executes faster than poly - morphism .
Mono - morphism can be inlined by the compiler in certain circumstances , thus not costing anything at all .
A warm welcome to The Java( tm ) Specialists '
Newsletter , sent to you from the Island of Crete in the Mediterranean .
Last week I was in Estonia , a delightful little country just south of Finland .
The total population is about 1.2 million people .
For those Dilbert lovers out there , Estonia is not Elbonia ... ;-)
Therefore , do not expect to find waist - high mud and pigs on phone lines .
Instead , you will find a booming little country with super fast internet , plus if you are lucky , a bit of snow and ice .
It is a country that is worth visiting , especially now that they are a member of the Schengen states , which simplifies travel for people on odd passports ( such as my South African ) .
We had several programmers from other cities and countries on our Java Specialist Master Course .

Polymorphism Performance Mysteries Explained
After our previous newsletter , Cliff Click , the author of the Server HotSpot VM , confirmed what we had observed by experimentation .
Before we go into the details of mono - morphism , bi-morphism and poly - morphism , I would like to show you some code that you can use today to demonstrate to your friends and colleagues that Java is " infinitely " faster than C++ / C# / Pascal / [ their favourite language here ] .
Infinitely faster , that is , at doing nothing :-)
Let 's take the following class FastJavaFast .
It will call a method 1000000000000000000000000000 times in under a second .
That is 10 to the power of 27 .
The method will not just be any method , but an overridden method ( like virtual methods in C ++ ) .
You need to start the program with the - server flag in Java 6 .
public class FastJavaFast { public void test ( ) { for ( int i = 0 ; i < 1000 * 1000 * 1000 ; i++) { test2 ( ) ; } } public void test2 ( ) { for ( int i = 0 ; i < 1000 * 1000 * 1000 ; i ++) { test3 ( ) ; } } public void test3 ( ) { for ( int i = 0 ; i < 1000 * 1000 * 1000 ; i ++) { foo( ) ; } } // this is a " virtual " method , in the C++ sense public void foo ( ) { } public static void main ( String [ ] args ) { FastJavaFast fast = new FastJavaFast ( ) { // I am overriding the foo( ) method public void foo ( ) { // do nothing } } ; long time = System.currentTimeMillis ( ) ; fast.foo( ) ; fast.test3 ( ) ; fast.test2( ) ; fast.test ( ) ; time = System.currentTimeMillis ( ) - time ; System.out.println ( " time = " + time ) ; } }
On my old Dell D800 notebook , I can execute the test in just a couple of milliseconds !
Calling an overridden method 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 in under a second is simply blazingly fast !
If we keep on calling test ( ) , it eventually executes in 0 milliseconds .
Swallow that one , C# !
No other language can do nothing as fast as Java :-)
Now for the explanation .
The first time that a method is run , the HotSpot Compiler tries to optimize the code .
It uses something called On - Stack - Replacement ( OSR ) , where it replaces some of the byte codes with optimized code .
This is not the best optimization , but a start .
If you call the method a second time , the newly optimized method is called .
Since we call the foo( ) method first , the HotSpot compiler determines that there is only one implementation of the method being called .
When we call the test3 ( ) method , it has already determined that foo ( ) can be inlined , and it eliminates the loop altogether .
We then call test2 ( ) , where it again has already determined that test3 ( ) does nothing , thus eliminating the loop in test2 ( ) .
Lastly , we call test ( ) and similarly , the loop is optimized out .
You can test this by inlining the calls to test2 ( ) and test3 ( ) , thus having a method test ( ) such as :
public void test ( ) { for ( int i = 0 ; i < 1000 * 1000 * 1000 ; i++) { for ( int j = 0 ; j < 1000 * 1000 * 1000 ; j++ ) { for ( int k = 0 ; k < 1000 * 1000 * 1000 ; k++ ) { foo( ) ; } } } }
I estimate this should take approximately 79,274,479,959 years to complete on my Dell ...
The amazing performance of inlining code should affect how we code Java .
We should stay clear of long methods and rather break them up more .
Lots of small methods usually result in less duplicate copy and paste .
Since the inlining is done for you by the Server HotSpot Compiler , there is no cost in calling the method .
This was one of the reasons for the strange results in my previous newsletter , where the initial results were faster than subsequent runs .
Instead of calling a test method many times in our main ( ) method , we should rather extract that code into a separate method and call that from main ( ) .
Thanks to Cliff Click 's input , I changed my test code to show these effects .
First off , instead of hard - coding the instances , I generate a bunch of random B subclasses and put them into an array .
In my test , I then iterate over the A instances and call the run ( ) method .
Instead of showing you all the classes again , I will just show you one example and refer you to my website for a zip file containing all the sources .
We start with a common interface for all the tests , called Test.java .
The run ( ) method calls B's foo ( ) function , which might be a subclass instance .
The description ( ) returns a String showing what the test is doing .
public interface Test { public void run ( ) ; public String description ( ) ; }
For example , here we have A3 , B3 , C3 :
public class A3 implements
Test { private final B3 b ; public A3 ( B3 b ) { this .b = b ; } public void run ( ) { b.f( ) ; } public String description ( ) { return " Bi-Morphic : Two subclasses , via interface " ; } } public interface B3 { public void f( ) ; } public class C3 implements B3 { public void f( ) { } }
In this new test class , we choose the test at start - up with a command - line argument .
Depending on the test chosen , we generate instances of different test cases .
The command line arguments are :
0 - No-morphic : Single subclass , pointed to directly 1 - Mono - Morphic : Single subclass , via interface 2 - Bi-Morphic :
Two subclasses , via interface 3 - Poly - Morphic :
Three subclasses , via interface 4 - Poly - Morphic : Four subclasses , via interface 5 - Poly - Morphic : Eight subclasses , via interface
We generate the test data by making instances of the relevant classes ( A1 , A2 , etc. ) with the corresponding B* classes and subclasses .
For A4 , the interface would be B4 and the implementations of B4 would be C4 , D4 , E4 .
When we run the test , we pick a random set of 10 instance , and then call the run ( ) method on those .
In order to " warm - up " the HotSpot Server Compiler , we run through all of the tests first , to let the compiler settle .
Once that is completed , we do the actual runs .
You can see from our results below that our standard deviation is rather low .
import java.lang.reflect .Constructor ; import java.util .
Random ; public class PolymorphismCliffRandomTest { private static final int UPTO = 100 * 1000 * 1000 ; public static void main ( String [ ] args ) throws Exception { int offset = Integer.parseInt( args [ 0 ] ) ; Test [ ] tests = generateTestData( offset ) ; printDescriptions ( tests ) ; System.out.println ( " Warmup " ) ; testAll( tests ) ; System.out.println ( " Actual run " ) ; printHeader ( tests ) ; testAll( tests ) ; } private static void testAll ( Test [ ] tests ) { for ( int j = 0 ; j < 10 ; j++ ) { runTests ( tests ) ; } } private static void printDescriptions ( Test [ ] tests ) { System.out.println(tests [ 0 ].getClass().getSimpleName( ) + " : " + tests [ 0 ].description ( ) ) ; System.out.println ( ) ; } public static void runTests ( Test [ ] tests ) { long time = System.currentTimeMillis ( ) ; test ( tests ) ; time = System.currentTimeMillis ( ) - time ; System.out.
print ( time + " \t " ) ; System.out.flush ( ) ; System.out.println ( ) ; } public static void test ( Test [ ] sources ) {
Test t0 = makeRandomTest ( sources ) ; Test t1 = makeRandomTest ( sources ) ; Test t2 = makeRandomTest ( sources ) ; Test t3 = makeRandomTest ( sources ) ; Test t4 = makeRandomTest ( sources ) ; Test t5 = makeRandomTest ( sources ) ; Test t6 = makeRandomTest ( sources ) ; Test t7 = makeRandomTest ( sources ) ; Test t8 = makeRandomTest ( sources ) ; Test t9 = makeRandomTest ( sources ) ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < UPTO / 10 ; i ++) { t0.run ( ) ; t1.run ( ) ; t2.run ( ) ; t3.run ( ) ; t4.run ( ) ; t5.run ( ) ; t6.run ( ) ; t7.run ( ) ; t8.run ( ) ; t9.run ( ) ; } } private static Test makeRandomTest ( Test [ ] sources ) { return sources [ ( ( int ) ( Math.random ( ) * sources.length ) ) ] ; } private static void printHeader ( Test [ ] tests ) { System.out.print( tests [ 0 ].getClass().getSimpleName ( ) ) ; System.out.print ( ' \t ' ) ; System.out.println ( ) ; } private static Test [ ] generateTestData( int offset ) throws Exception { switch ( offset ) { default : throw new IllegalArgumentException ( " offset : " + offset ) ; case 0 : return fillSources ( A1 . class , B1 . class , B1. class ) ; case 1 : return fillSources ( A2 . class , B2 . class , C2 . class ) ; case 2 : return fillSources ( A3 . class , B3 . class , C3 . class , D3 . class ) ; case 3 : return fillSources ( A4 . class , B4 . class , C4 . class , D4 . class , E4. class ) ; case 4 : return fillSources ( A5 . class , B5 . class , C5 . class , D5 . class , E5 . class , F5 . class ) ; case 5 : return fillSources ( A6 . class , B6 . class , C6 . class , D6 . class , E6 . class , F6 . class , G6 . class , I6 . class , J6 . class ) ; } } private static Test[ ] fillSources ( Class <? extends Test > a Class , Class <?> b Class , Class <?>... b Classes ) throws Exception { Test [ ] sources = new Test [ 1000 ] ; Random rand = new Random ( 0 ) ; Constructor <?
extends Test > constr = a Class.getConstructor( bClass ) ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < sources.
length ; i++) { int offset = Math.abs(rand.nextInt( ) % b Classes.length ) ; Object b = b Classes [ offset ].newInstance ( ) ; sources [ i ] = constr.newInstance(b ) ; } return sources ; } }
We run this six times , one for each test case .
Here are the test cases :
A1 : No-morphic : Single subclass , pointed to directly A2 : Mono - Morphic : Single subclass , via interface A3 : Bi-Morphic :
Two subclasses , via interface A4 : Poly - Morphic :
Three subclasses , via interface A5 : Poly - Morphic : Four subclasses , via interface A6 : Poly - Morphic : Eight subclasses , via interface
On my server , the average results are :
A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 0 ( 0 ) 0 ( 0 ) 495 ( 9 ) 2855 ( 31 ) 2838 ( 18 ) 2837 ( 10 )
When you run it with Java 6 - server , A1 and A2 come back with an average of 0 ( 0 ) .
The standard deviation is in brackets .
In the case of a simple pointer to B or where there is a single subclass of B , the method call is inlined .
A3 is the bi-morphic case , where we have two subclasses of B .
In this case , the results come back as 495 ( 9 ) .
The Server HotSpot compiler , according to Cliff Click , deals with bi-morphism as a special case of poly - morphism : " Where the server compiler can prove only two classes reach a call site , it will insert a type - check and then statically call both targets ( which may then further inline , etc ) . "
The cases A4 , A5 and A6 are all where we have more than two subclasses of B .
In these cases , the results come back as 2855 ( 31 ) , 2838 ( 18 ) and 2837 ( 10 ) .
They are pretty much equal and much slower than the bi-morphic case .
According to Cliff Click : " HotSpot uses an inline - cache for calls where the compiler cannot prove only a single target can be called .
An inline - cache turns a virtual ( or interface ) call into a static call plus a few cycles of work .
It 's is a 1 - entry cache inlined in the code ; the Key is the expected class of the ' this ' pointer , the Value is the static target method matching the Key , directly encoded as a call instruction .
As soon as you need 2 + targets for the same call site , you revert to the much more expensive dynamic lookup ( load/ load / load / jump - register ) .
Both compilers use the same runtime infrastructure , but the server compiler is more aggressive about proving a single target . "
It was nice having my discoveries confirmed by the guy who wrote the JVM Server Hotspot Compiler :-)
Thanks to Cliff Click for taking the time to explain how it works .
We also saw that Java is really fast at doing nothing , so be extra careful with empty loops that you inserted into your code instead of Thread. sleep ( ) .
Since Java 6 , they are in danger of being removed .
We see again how good design wins : short methods , lots of polymorphism .
If we do not need the polymorphism , it is optimized out of our code .
Thus the penalty for using it is extremely small , usually non-existant where it counts .
I am in the process of expanding my Java Design Patterns Course to include more patterns .
This has been one of my most popular courses to date .
If this would interest you , please let me know :-) .
Kind regards
Heinz

WASHINGTON  Older White House computer hard drives have been destroyed , the White House disclosed to a federal court Friday in a controversy over millions of possibly missing e-mails from 2003 to 2005 .
The White House revealed new information about how it handles its computers in an effort to persuade a federal magistrate it would be fruitless to undertake an e-mail recovery plan that the court proposed .
" When workstations are at the end of their lifecycle and retired ... the hard drives are generally sent offsite to another government entity for physical destruction , " the White House said in a sworn declaration filed with U.S. Magistrate Judge John Facciola .
It has been the goal of a White House Office of Administration " refresh program " to replace one - third of its workstations every year in the Executive Office of the President , according to the declaration .
Some , but not necessarily all , of the data on old hard drives is moved to new computer hard drives , the declaration added .
In proposing an e-mail recovery plan Tuesday , Facciola expressed concern that a large volume of electronic messages may be missing from White House computer servers , as two private groups that are suing the White House allege .
Facciola proposed the drastic approach of going to individual workstations of White House computer users after the White House disclosed in January that it recycled its computer backup tapes before October 2003 .
Recycling — taping over existing data — raises the possibility that any missing e-mails may not be recoverable .
At a House committee hearing last month , a computer expert who previously worked at the White House called the e-mail system " primitive " and said it was set up in a way that created a high risk that data would be lost from White House servers where it was being archived .
Under pressure to provide details about its computer system , the White House told the congressional committee that it never completed work that began in 2003 on a planned records management and e-mail archiving system .
The White House canceled the project in late 2006 and says it is still working on a new version .
In the absence of a permanent archiving system , the White House has been archiving e-mails on White House servers since early in the administration .
The White House says it does not know if any e-mails are missing , but is looking into the matter .
It would be costly and time - consuming for the White House to institute an e-mail retrieval program that entails pulling data off each individual workstation , the court papers filed Friday state .

It ’s not going that bad . ”
What was going bad , however , was Captain Fallon ’s cargo of fresh fruit .
Forklift Operator Mickey Dollend remained at home Wednesday after his near - disastrous accident late Tuesday morning .
When asked if Mr. Dollend would face disciplinary action , company officials replied that “ Mickey is always clowning around and doing stuff like this .
Everything is fine . ”
When pressed about the surprising similarity of this accident to several others that resulted in large insurance settlements , company officials refused comment .
In attempting to act out a long - held “ Miami Vice ” fantasy , best friends Byron Willliams and Teddy Kosavac were shocked to learn they both suffered from identical forms of diplopia ( lack of depth perception ) .
The friends now have identical internal injuries and halo collars .
A Daylight Savings mix - up turned ugly early Friday morning when ground crews found themselves in the flight path of a 45 - ton transport plane .
Ground Crew Supervisor Butch Posser explained that while time changes have always screwed him up , this year will be his last .
“ Remembering to check my calendar is better than having to change my shorts twice a year . ”
Forced to explain the events that led the rookie crane operator into attempting a dredge - out from in the water versus the more traditional land - based method , the water - logged operator suggested that instead of being disciplined he should be commended for trying to approach a situation differently .
He is no longer with the firm .
Frustrated by the lack of free boat launches , Nathan Fillion and his family attempted to find an alternate solution .
Mr. Fillion contends his only error was in attempting to drive forward versus the more traditional practice of backing the boat toward the water .
He maintains that given a second chance , he is almost certain he " could have made it . ”
The Giant Mining Co. introduced a new initiative to decrease site accidents .
Red tape was used to outline the “ no driving area ” for regular vehicles so as to not impede the movement of large mining trucks .
Unfortunately , the individual in charge of setting up the red tape neglected to follow the new rules .
Forced to concede his truck was not actually able to haul “ any damn thing you put in it , ” driver Morris Lukatis is now faced with finding a large jack that can “ lift any damn thing it wants . ”
Good luck , Mr. Lukatis !
Math proved a problem early Monday when a small ship was overloaded way beyond its capacity , causing it to sink quickly and out of sight .
“ I could swear I only counted 75 containers , ” said Josh Nichol of Container Management .
“ I really need to be writing this kind of stuff down . ”
Convinced the horse would leap safely over their car during a midnight game of auto - horse chicken , brothers Roger and Rezko Rollins underestimated the attraction that an open box of sugar cubes visible on their front seat would hold for the sweet - toothed stallion .
Smiling for the camera and trying to put a happy face on a tough situation is Barry Clarke , 42 .
The jovial outdoorsman was dismayed to see his truck destroyed by falling timber but encouraged that the small branch lodged in his anus was still visible , hopefully making its safe removal more than likely .
Lawsuits were filed today on behalf of Transport Shipyards and Grady Shipping against container loader Walter Dovetree , a one - time world domino champion .
Details were limited but lawyers do admit a concern that Mr. Dovetree had not yet gotten over his recent overtime loss to the Russian domino champion , which was putting his on - the - job focus into question .
The captain of the “ The Litunia ” explained Thursday that while the accident was serious , it came as no real surprise to him .
“ I was a waiter for six years and I could n’t balance anything to save my life then either . ”
The ship 's owners have let it be known they are now actively seeking a new captain - ASAP .
Residents of a Mesa , Arizona rest home received the shock of their lives when a large meteorite crashed through their roof , crushing a blue recliner and narrowly missing Ricky Frankin ( pictured left ) who is now claiming ownership .

Why ca n’t I keep it ? ”
After a hard - fought and often bitterly personal campaign against City Hall to have new power poles installed on his street , Fred McCutcheon finally succeeded .
When asked how he felt about his victory , Fred admitted that while he was pleased overall , his feelings were somewhat mixed .
“ I may have won the battle but I think I lost the war . ”
Realizing that his wife ’s brother - in - law was not the qualified mechanic he claimed to be came too late for ATV racer John Shepard .
After losing the race in question , Mr. Shepard confronted his relative about the shocking equipment malfunction .
Whatever immediate response was offered must have been inadequate as Mr. Shepard is currently facing assault charges for attempting to insert both ATV tires inside Mr. Pritchard .
Neither offered a comment at press time .
Update 3-19 - 08 : Rumors of an outbreak now spreading to schools in Florida and Maine .
Visit Treehugger for the latest news on this crisis !
Recently , schools across the country have been experiencing increased absences due to a nasty strain of the flu .
It appears that children and teachers are n’t the only ones falling ill , but school office equipment has succumb to a different , common disease .
According to Kenny Luna of Treehugger :
In a report just in from the Robert Moses Middle School in North Babylon NY , students and staff there have become concerned by the fact that the school photocopy machine is exhibiting signs of a strange illness .
They ’re not yet quite certain what it is , but a key symptom they ’re reporting is a propensity to chew up trees at an amazing rate before spitting them out in shreds with some sort of toxic goo all over them .
And all while consuming vast amounts of water , paper , and energy that ’s leading to global warming through the release of CO2 .
Mr Luna is well known for his bright idea : to give every child in America one compact fluorescent bulb for their home .
Perhaps Mr. Luna will solve the current crisis facing school copy machines .
If you suspect your child ’s school photocopier may be affected please contact copycrisisteam ( @ ) gmail ( dot ) com .
Expect statements from the presidential candidates and the CDC on this mysterious illness soon .

Eat Your Meat but Do n't Have a Cow
April 28th , 2008 by Michelle Bennett
For years I ’ve been reading about the benefits of a vegetarian lifestyle .
Beef production creates more CO2 than autos , factory farm conditions are unhealthy and awful , and veggies are healthier too !
But let me be frank : I really really really like bacon .
I can cut down on my meat intake , no problem !
I only eat it with friends and relatives .
But say good bye to succulent chicken breast , or slow - cooked BBQ ribs … forever ?
Well there ’s only so much a girl can do , my friends .
So I suppose it ’s not surprising that some people are looking for meat alternatives , and I ’m not talking about Tofurkey .
I ’m talking about real meat , but minus the animal .
PETA , the folks who brought you ultra - soft vegetarian porn and plenty of responsible living tips , is offering 1 million dollars to “ the first person to come up with a method to produce commercially viable quantities of in vitro meat at competitive prices ” ( contest details here )
That ’s right , it ’s lab - grown meat that never met its maker – namely , an animal .
Though no one has yet claimed the prize , I can already see controversy on the issue .
Would you eat test - tube meat ?
If someone snuck you a lab - steak , would you know the difference ?
Would producers be required to label the product or would it go incognito like GMOs ?
And what about GMO lab - meat ?
EcoGeek also opens a whole new door of possibilities .
What does whale taste like , and is it OK to eat it if no whales were harmed in the making of your meal ?
How about an endangered tiger - steak or hippo pot roast ?
Would you sample lab - grown humming bird hearts ?
They might be tasty .
The issue at hand is our definition of “ meat ” and concepts of food .
Given the recent controversy and publicity within our meat mass - production industry , it ’s no surprise that people are starting to ask if there ’s a better way .
But where do we draw the line between the food we grow and the food we create ?
I must admit my own trepidation on the concept .
Though I ’ll try anything once , the idea of my chicken breast slowly forming in a petri dish is n’t exactly appetizing .
On the same token , I also believe it ’s important to avoid essentialist ideas of “ purity ” and “ essence ” that I see so frequently in debates about food , animals , and the mythical Mother Nature .
Is there some quality of protein and fat that changes when grown in different environments ?
Is it the molecular makeup or strategy of growth that ’s important in food ?
After all , a lab is much cleaner than a chicken and I doubt a lab - meat product would hit supermarkets unless the quality of the meat was comparable to animal - based products .
When we slaughter an animal , we do n’t eat all of its parts , and sometimes we ’d rather not know where the extra bits end up .
By removing the resources to breed , feed , raise , and slaughter an animal – simultaneously removing questions of environmental impact and humane treatment – we could dramatically streamline a growing international industry .
Maybe we could even make meat taste better with some creative “ growth techniques ” .
Since this is just a contest and no one has successfully managed in vitro meat yet , I ’ll be content to sit back and watch the show .
I ’m hoping for some real fireworks on this one !
But at the end of the day it will be consumers who decide , and I sincerely hope people will take a moment to read the facts before hitting their local grocery .
If , by chance , this turns out to be a better and tasty technology , it would be a shame to shun it on nostalgic ideas of a along - gone farmland and its inhabitants lined up for slaughter .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) - Bear Stearns executives sold stock in the firm worth more than $ 20 million in December , although they remain big shareholders in the beleaguered broker , according to Thomson Financial data .
James Cayne , chairman of Bear BSC , - 10.00 % , sold 172,621 shares in December worth $ 15.4 million , while President Alan Schwartz sold 67,900 shares worth just over $ 6 million , Thomson data show .
Alan Greenberg , chairman of Bear 's executive committee , sold 99,293 shares worth $ 8.8 million in December , while Chief Executive Officer Samuel Molinaro sold 27,726 shares worth almost $ 2.5 million , according to Thomson .
Insiders at Bear sold a total of 715,000 shares last year worth more than $ 75 million , up from 2006 but down considerably from 2004 , when sales of more than 1.5 million shares worth $ 147.9 million took place , the data show .
Since 2000 , Cayne has sold 2.37 million shares worth about $ 182.7 million , while Schwartz has sold more than one million shares for roughly $ 67.2 million .
Bear almost collapsed last week and had to be bailed out by J.P. Morgan Chase JPM , - 0.84 % and the Federal Reserve .
J.P. Morgan offered to buy the broker for $ 2 a share , a huge discount to where the stock was trading just a week before .
The near - collapse has been a disaster for some staff .
Executives and other employees at Bear own at least a quarter of the shares .
See related story .
Wilmington
Trust , which holds stock on behalf of executives and other employees , owns 23 % of the firm 's shares , Thomson data show .
Some of those shares were awards as part of incentive plans .
One of those plans - a long - term one called the Capital Accumulation Plan - awarded restricted stock to senior managing directors of Bear .
When those shares vested , executives usually sold and they did that in December 2007 , according to InsiderScore , a Web site that tracks insider transactions .
Despite selling in December , Bear executives are still major shareholders of Bear .
Cayne owns almost 5 % of the firm and Schwartz owns almost 1 % , according to Thomson data .
We ’re told that every successful business starts with a great idea .
That ’s a half - truth .
Our nine - year track record of transforming exceptional entrepreneurs into successful CEOs shows us that great companies start with great ideas — and a great business plan .
We ’ve written more than 4,000 business plans for a diverse array of companies who have gone on to raise more than $ 2.5 billion .
Our clients , early stage and middle market companies , just like yours , are engaged in every type of business , from building boutique hotels to wifi- hotspots .
The following five concepts , based on a recent Business Week Online interview with Growthink partner Dave Lavinsky , are critical to building a successful business plan — and most importantly — a successful business :
1. Why You Need a Business Plan
A business plan is the marketing document telling the story of your company : its purpose , achievements and objectives .
A business plan helps you obtain investment capital .
Ideally , your business plan should be 15 - 25 pages long and it should include an executive summary of between 2 - 4 pages , depending on the complexity of the business and the purpose of the plan , which answers the two questions asked by every experienced investor : :
What are the key value propositions of your business to your targeted marketplace (s ) ?
Why and how will an investor receive a return on their invested dollars ?
Your business plan should also include an operating plan .
In addition to other components , the operating plan contains milestones — the list of business objectives your company will achieve by a certain date .
2. Research , Research , Research
Entrepreneurs of the world : do your homework .
Investors reading your business plan want to see that you ’ve thought long and hard about the potential promise — and pitfalls — of starting or expanding your company .
Your dutiful due diligence must supply answers to these questions potential investors are asking themselves — and willask you :
Who are your competitors ?
Who are your customers ?
What companies have succeeded or failed in your sector ?
Why fund your company now , rather than a year from now ?
Or a year ago ?
Here ’s the blunt bottom line :
If your business plan does n’t include research that helps you present a clear , compelling case to potential investors , why should anyone trust you with their money ?
3. Investor Insight : Experience Over Speed
Ah , the days of 1999 , when we believed that First Mover Advantage , like Venture Incubators , was the key to success .
Well , we ’ve been burned and we ’ve learned that , for a range of ventures , from e-tailing ( Boo.com anyone ? ) to streaming networks ( Quokka.com , RIP ) , that being first does n’t mean finishing first among your competitors .
Many investors now want to see a track record — for example , a history of revenue and customers .
Have you been running your business for awhile or is it still just a great idea , looking for capital ?
This change in investor strategy makes for longer funding cycles : that period between presenting your business plan to potential investors and receiving an initial round of funding .
Longer funding cycles are frustrating for emerging stage business owners who need investment capital sooner , rather than later .
4. Seek Specialist Funding
Does your company generate annual revenues over $ 1 million dollars ?
Are you an early stage company or a pre-revenue concern that owns its intellectual property ?
Well , there are investors seeking to fund companies justlike yours .
Growthink ’s capital partners represent a wide range of investment mandates .
Thousands of companies have come to Growthink for the capital and counsel critical to their success .
5. Get Great Advisors — And Listen To Them
Your business plan should include the creation of an advisory board .
The advisory board is a group of external experts who are not involved with the day to day business operations .
A good advisory board helps keep your team on track towards achieving the milestones contained in your operating plan and alerts you to the changes and opportunities occurring in your target market .
6. Have Questions ?
We Have The Answers
Founded in 1999 , Growthink is a leading business plan consulting firm and middle market investment bank .
Our professional business plan writers and investment bankers have assisted more than 1,500 clients in launching and growing their businesses , and raising more than $ 1 billion in growth financing .

The pernicious and blatantly unconstitutional REAL ID
Act has met with strenuous objections from many state officials , and , to their credit , some states have actually taken legislative action to forestall the program 's implementation .
Even so , as the Associated Press reported on March 21 , 2008 , only Maine , Montana and South Carolina have not " sought extensions to comply , or already started toward compliance with Real ID . "
New Hampshire has asked to be exempted , but the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) has deemed that request " not legally acceptable . "
So thus far , out of fifty states , only four have had the courage to tell the federales to go jump in a lake .
Now , I understand that , by filing requests for extensions , other states may be trying to drag the issue out until after the general election .
Some state lawmakers do n't want to comply , but they 're afraid they 'll be accused of being " soft on terrorism " ( or , even worse , breaking party ranks — horrors ! ) if they oppose it outright , so they 'd rather stall in the hope that a new Congress and a new administration might repeal REAL ID and thereby solve the problem for them .
But this solution , while pragmatic from a certain political point - of - view , is exacerbating the overall problem of federal usurpation .
By filing for a compliance extension , states are playing by the federal government 's rules , and in doing so they are tacitly acknowledging the legitimacy of those rules ( and the supremacy of those making them ) .
On the other hand , the non-complying states are sending an entirely different message to Washington .
They are denying that the federal government has any rightful authority to impose this program at all .
In the process , they are also tacitly arguing that states have a right to interpret the Constitution for themselves , and to decide when the federal government has overstepped its bounds .
Enter Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer .
Schweitzer is not your typical Democrat .
Indeed , he has been called the " antithesis of the Democrat stereotype . "
In a 2006 article in the New York Times , it was said that Schweitzer has " seized the heartland imagery generally monopolized by Republicans , " and represents a new " Democratic brand of libertarian - tinged prairie populism " that may threaten the GOP 's traditional hold on the western states .
I can't support Schweitzer on every issue but I 'll take his brand of Democrat over Hillary or Obama anytime .
For instance , on the topic of guns , Schweitzer has remarked that he owns " more than I need but less than I want , " and says , " In Montana we think gun control is hittin ' what you 're shootin ' at . "
It 's hard not to like a man who thinks that way .
Schweitzer is also a leading opponent of REAL ID , which he has called " another harebrained scheme , an unfunded mandate to tell us that our life is going to be better if we 'll just buckle under on some other kind of rule or regulation . "
Among America 's governors , he is easily the most outspoken on the issue , and has promised that Montana will not yield .
Regarding the powers - that - think - they - be in Washington , Schweitzer recently told NPR , " We usually just play along for a while , we ignore them for as long as we can , and we try not to bring it to a head .
But if it comes to a head , we found that it 's best to just tell them to go to hell and run the state the way you want to run your state . "
After hearing Schweitzer on NPR , Matthew Dunlap , Secretary of State for Maine , commented : " We were pretty impressed .
We had n't heard rhetoric like that in many a year . "
Schweitzer 's impressive rhetoric stems from the fact that he possesses qualities that have become increasingly rare in American politics : namely , principles and guts .
He has the courage of his convictions , and , God bless him , he 's doing what he can to inspire others to cultivate brains and backbones of their own .
On January 18 , 2008 , Schweitzer sent a letter to the governors of seventeen states , appealing for their help in stopping REAL ID .
The following are some excerpts from the letter :
Last year , the Montana Legislature unanimously passed , and I signed , a bill to prevent our state from participating in Real ID … We recognized that Real ID was a major threat to the privacy , constitutional rights , and pocketbooks of ordinary Montanans …
Today , I am asking you to join with me in resisting the DHS coercion to comply with provisions of Real ID … I would like us to speak with one , unified voice and demand that Congress step in and fix this mess …
[ DHS ] Secretary Chertoff 's remarks yesterday , albeit about WHTI , not Real ID , reflect DHS continued disrespect for the serious and legitimate concerns of our citizens .
I take great offense at this notion we should all simply " grow up . "
Please do not accept the Faustian bargain of applying for the DHS extension .
If we stand together , either DHS will blink or Congress will have to act to avoid havoc at our nation 's airports and federal courthouses .
According to the Associated Press , as of March 14 , Schweitzer 's office had been flooded with a grand total of two replies , " both simply acknowledging receipt of the letter . "
Tragically , this fact upholds my long - standing suspicion that , among America 's elected officials , the women are n't the only ones wearing panties .
For his part , however , Schweitzer continues to soldier on .
On March 21 , Montana 's Attorney General , Mike McGrath , sent a letter to DHS Secretary Chertoff , informing him that Montana 's licensing requirements are already " one of the most secure in the nation , " and that he cannot authorize implementation of REAL ID because the Montana legislature has forbidden it .
McGrath also asked that DHS not take any steps that would " penalize Montanans ' ability to use their valid Montana drivers licenses for federal identification purposes and commercial air travel . "
DHS replied that it would have to treat McGrath 's letter as " a request for an extension , " to which Governor Schweitzer responded , " I sent them a horse and if they want to call it a zebra , that 's up to them .
They can call it whatever they want , and it was n't a love letter . "
Principles and guts , ladies and gentlemen .
Principles and guts .
The battle over REAL ID is one that we cannot afford to lose .
Its implementation would mark the beginning of a new era in America 's decline , and not just because it would limit the average American 's ability to board an airplane or enter a federal building .
REAL ID will do far more than that .
If successful , it will very quickly become the standard for identification purposes in every area of life and business where the federal government is involved , and there are precious few areas where it is not involved these days , thanks mainly to the war on drugs and the People 's glorious income tax system .
You may be required to produce a REAL ID if you start a new job ; open a bank account ; buy a gun ( and most likely ammunition , too ) ; or even to purchase certain over - the - counter medicines , as DHS Assistant Secretary for Policy Stewart Baker recently told the Heritage Foundation .
I can even foresee a time when you may not be permitted to vote without the Mark of the Bush on your person .
REAL ID will also become a patriotic shibboleth test and a law enforcement red flag .
The Department of Homeland Security , working closely with law enforcement officials in collaborating — er , cooperating — states , will instruct officers to be on the look - out for vehicles with tags from non-complying states .
Drivers of such vehicles will be pulled over more often , searched more often , and generally harassed and subjected to thuggery more often .
Count on it .
DHS and state officials may deny it — or not , in this age of brazen police - state tactics and intimidation — but , either way , it will happen .
These people are on a witch hunt , and anyone who dares to challenge their methods is automatically under suspicion of having a broom and a pointy hat hidden away in his or her closet .
In a nutshell , REAL ID will , for the first time , give the federal government real power to destroy the lives of political dissenters ; not by direct means , as this would assuredly spark a rebellion , but by indirect means .
By simply denying an individual the ability to live a normal life .
By blocking them in at every turn .
By treating them like outcasts , if not virtual traitors .
If you doubt that such things could ever happen here in America , I would encourage you to research civil liberties under Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt , and particularly under Abraham Lincoln .
There was a time in this country when it was considered the height of patriotism to harass and imprison those who criticized the government , to burn the towns and fields of dissenters , and to steal food from the mouths of women and children in the name of the flag .
Our leaders are openly following in the ideological footsteps of the tyrants of the past , and , sadly , some in the highest courts in the land are prepared to excuse their abuses .
Not only can it happen here , it already has happened here .
And it can and will happen again unless those in positions of responsibility , like Governor Brian Schweitzer , stand up to tyranny , look it in the eye , and call it what it is , even when it comes wrapped in red - white - and - blue packaging .
Furthermore , such brave men and women will need the support — the very loud and public support — of every single American who cares enough about freedom to do something more than complain about its decline .
The Washington establishment must know that people like Schweitzer have our active support , and that we will do everything in our power to oppose the overthrow of this republic .
Write and call your elected officials .
Let them know that REAL ID is an affront to the principles of American liberty and that it must be repealed .
Give them the example of Schweitzer .
Ask that they not let him be the lone voice for sanity and freedom among America 's governors where REAL ID is concerned .
Encourage them to stand with him .
Point out that REAL ID was never even debated by Congress , but was attached as a rider to an " emergency " war - funding bill !
Remind them that states do have the right to oppose unconstitutional federal edicts .
In fact , I would go further than that — remind them that they are sworn to uphold the Constitution of the United States , and thus that they are obligated to oppose its violation .
And above all , let them know that , if they will stand for you , you will stand with them .
There stands Schweitzer like a stone wall .
Rally behind the Montanans !

Robert Hawes is the author of One Nation , Indivisible ?
A Study of Secession and the Constitution .
This article , along with his past writings , can be found on his blog .
He lives in South Carolina with his family , and is working on a career as a freelance writer .
The Best of Robert F. Hawes Jr.
— Three UNC football players were the victims in a kidnapping , robbery and sexual assault incident involving two women , the university confirmed Thursday afternoon .
Chapel Hill police said the assault happened about 3:30 a.m.
Sunday at an apartment complex where all three victims were bound with tape and then assaulted by the suspects .
At a bond hearing Thursday , Orange County Assistant District Attorney Morgan
Whitney said police arrived at the scene and found two of the victims , tied up , in boxer shorts .
The third victim was fully clothed with his hands tied .
At least two were sexually assaulted , Whitney said .
He is still waiting on the final police report to see if the third man was also .
None of the victims required medical attention .
" I am relieved that the players were not injured , " UNC head coach Butch Davis said in a prepared statement Thursday .
" We will assist them in any way we can . "
Prosecutors said the victims met the suspects – Monique Jenice Taylor , Tnikia Monta Washington and Michael Troy Lewis – during a birthday celebration at a downtown bar and that they all went back to the victims ' apartment .
Initially , one of the football players welcomed sexual advances from Taylor and Washington , Whitney said .
" They brought him back and put him in the bedroom , " Whitney said .
" When the victim left the bedoom , there was a naked black male in the hallway who had a knife . "
Whitney said Taylor then pulled off the victim 's pants , pushed him down on a bed , attempted to tie his hands with his belt and started to fondle him against his consent .
" The more that he wrestled , Mr. Lewis put his knife further , or closer , to the victim 's neck , " Whitney said .
" Ms. Taylor fondled his private parts .
He repeatedly said no , and as he continued to resist , Ms. Taylor and the codefendant , Ms. Washington , began to beat him in the face . "
Taylor 's attorney , Glenn Gerding , said the fondling was consensual .
A neighbor , Bobby Roberson , who lives across from the players , said he heard shouting and yelling coming from the apartment .
" Somebody sounded like they were getting slammed up against a wall , " Roberson said .
" Then , all of sudden , you heard a guy saying , yelling for help .
It was like , ' Help , help , help ! ' "
Police arrested Taylor and Washington at the scene .
Lewis fled after a confrontation with officers , Chapel Hill police said .
He surrendered on Wednesday .
Taylor , 28 , of 209 Millbrook St. in Greenville , and Washington , 29 , of 814 Belvin Avenue in Durham , are each charged with one count of first - degree sex offense , three counts of kidnapping , one count of resisting arrest and three counts of conspiracy to commit a felony .
Lewis , 32 , of 2118 Lexington St. in Durham , is charged with two counts of robbery , two counts of assault on a government official , two counts of possession of stolen goods , three counts of kidnapping , one count of resisting arrest and three counts of conspiracy to commit a felony .
All three suspects were initially placed in jail under a $ 500,000 secured bond , but Judge Cathrine Stevens reduced Taylor and Washington 's bond to $ 50,000 Thursday .
All three were in the Orange County Jail Thursday afternoon .
" This is a very unusual case , " Gerding said .
" Almost unbelievable , at first blush . "

Witnesses Describe Beating Of Female Prisoner For Exposing Corruption
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : media@aclu.org ; ( 212 ) 549-2666
TRENTON – The American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of New Jersey filed court papers today requesting that the New Jersey Superior Court impose sanctions against the New Jersey Department of Corrections ( DOC ) for witness tampering , official misconduct and violations of court rules .
The ACLU ’s motion for sanctions charges that the DOC obtained false and misleading statements from women prisoners about conditions in the prison in an attempt to defend the prison against claims of inhumane treatment .
A female prisoner who exposed the DOC ’s misconduct reports being beaten as a result .
“ Witness tampering is a serious criminal act , ” said Ed Barocas , ACLU of New Jersey Legal Director .
“ The Mercer County Prosecutor should immediately investigate the allegations of abuse of power by DOC personnel and attempted fraud on the court . ”
The ACLU asserts that James Drumm , Assistant Administrator of the New Jersey State Prison , offered female prisoners reductions in their disciplinary sentences in exchange for making false statements describing women ’s prison conditions in the New Jersey State Prison ( NJSP ) - a men ’s supermax prison - as better than they were .
The statements were obtained from women prisoners held in NJSP ’s women ’s disciplinary segregation unit but described conditions in a different part of the prison where these women did not even reside .
DOC officials then introduced the women ’s statements in court .
After one prisoner , Kareema Thomas , disclosed what had occurred to the ACLU , she was beaten by a prison guard , according to the sworn statements of Thomas and three other women prisoners .
This is the latest chapter in Jones v Hayman , an ACLU class action lawsuit against the DOC challenging the improper transfer of a group of women to the men ’s prison and subjecting them to inhumane and virtual lock - down conditions .
On February 8 , 2008 , the Department of Corrections offered into evidence in that case a letter written by Thomas as proof that conditions for the transferred women prisoners were adequate , even though she had never seen the unit in which the transferred women are held .
Although most women prisoners in New Jersey are confined in the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility in Clinton , women subject to “ disciplinary segregation ” have for years been held in a section of New Jersey State Prison known as unit “ 1 FF . ”
The ACLU clients who were transferred to the men ’s prison , however , are being held in a separate unit called “ 1EE . ”
Furthermore , none of the women in 1EE were transferred for violating prison rules – the usual criteria for disciplinary segregation – but were transferred arbitrarily to the men ’s prison without justification .
“ Mr. Drumm made it sound like if I wrote him a letter saying certain things , my time in segregation would be cut , ” Thomas said in her sworn statement .
Thomas ’ account was corroborated by another woman prisoner to whom Drumm made the same offer .
Thomas alleges she was brutally beaten by a prison guard the day after she met with ACLU attorneys to tell her story , raising questions about whether the beating was retaliatory .
Thomas says that during the beating , the guard said , “ You have a big mouth ” and called her a “ nigger with no home training . ”
Thomas also alleges that , following the beating , Drumm told her , “ You ’re causing problems in my institution , ” and that she should “ stop causing trouble . ”
In addition to seeking sanctions against the Department of Corrections for witness tampering and retaliation , the ACLU also charges that prison officials violated court rules by conducting psychiatric examinations of the women the ACLU represents without first notifying their attorneys , and under the guise of the examinations , extracted information from the women about the case .
The ACLU ’s request for sanctions also presents evidence of prison officials regularly reading confidential attorney - client correspondence and listening in on prisoners ’ phone calls to lawyers .
“ The Department of Corrections is taking a scorched earth approach to the civil rights lawsuit brought by these women prisoners , ” said Mie Lewis , the ACLU ’s lead counsel in the case .
“ The women deserve a fair hearing of their claims , and that means the Department has to obey the law and court rules . ”
Sanctions sought by the ACLU include striking from the record all of the unlawfully obtained evidence ; reassignment of the guard who allegedly beat Thomas ; a ban on further evidence - gathering by James Drumm ; and permission for the ACLU to further investigate the Department ’s misconduct .
A hearing in the New Jersey Superior Court is scheduled for April 11 , 2008 .
Attorneys on the case are Lewis and Lenora Lapidus from the ACLU Women ’s Rights Project and Barocas from the ACLU of New Jersey .

The proposed see -saw could light a classroom after five minutes
Design student Daniel Sheridan has created a simple see -saw which generates enough electricity to light a classroom .
The device works by transferring the power , created by a child moving up and down on it , to an electricity storage unit via an underground cable .
The Coventry University student has won £ 5,500 in funding to develop the idea .
Power play
The 23 - year - old consumer product design student scooped the cash at two separate university student enterprise award schemes and now has enough money to create a working prototype .
Ultimately I would love to design a whole playground of different pieces of equipment that could generate electricity
Daniel Sheridan
Inspiration for the product began during a volunteering trip to a school on the island of Wasimi , south of Mombasa , in Kenya last summer .
Here , Daniel helped to build a school and even did some teaching .
" The number of children we saw there that loved to play , and their energy and their vibrancy , I thought it would be great if I could somehow make use of this , " he said .
" They do n't have Gameboys and all the rest .
They are just so genuine and keen to help - they would grab the wheelbarrows we were working with given half the chance .
" Considering what little they have , they were so inspiring to be around .
It really was quite humbling . "
When he returned , Daniel did some research into power through play looking at how he could turn this positive and joyful activity into something useful for the wider community .
Light work
And after talking to experts in development , he hit upon the idea of generating electricity through playground equipment and designed the see-saw .
He said : " The current need for electricity in sub-Saharan Africa is staggering .
Without power development is extremely difficult .
" The potential for this product is huge and the design could be of benefit to numerous communities in Africa and beyond . "
He has calculated that five to 10 minutes use on the see - saw could generate enough electricity to light a classroom for an evening , for example .
Many schools in Africa open their doors in the evening to much older pupils but are only able to light their classrooms with candles or kerosene lamps .
Village dream
However , as the energy from the see - saw can be stored , the owners could decide exactly how they wanted to use it .
He will now travel to a village near to the Ugandan city of Jinja where he will test and finalise the prototype using locally sources parts .
" It would be fantastic if I could get this started as a business or even set it up as a charity .
" Ultimately I would love to design a whole playground of different pieces of equipment that could enough generate electricity to power a whole village . "

The use of psychedelic substances can be traced back for millennia , to the dawn of human history .
Since time immemorial , plant materials containing powerful , consciousness - expanding compounds were used to induce non-ordinary states of consciousness or , more specifically , an important subgroup of them , which I call “ holotropic ” ( Grof 2000 ) .
These plants have played an important role in shamanic practice , aboriginal healing ceremonies , rites of passage , mysteries of death and rebirth , and various other spiritual traditions .
The ancient and native cultures using psychedelic materials held them in great esteem and considered them to be sacraments , “ flesh of the gods ” ( Schultes , Hofmann , and Raetsch 2001 ) .
Human groups , which had at their disposal psychedelic plants , took advantage of their entheogenic effects ( entheogenic means literally “ awakening the divine within ” ) and made them the principal vehicles of their ritual and spiritual life .
The preparations made from these plants mediated for these people experiential contact with the archetypal dimensions of reality –deities , mythological realms , power animals , and numinous forces and aspects of nature .
Another important area where states induced by psychedelics played a crucial role was diagnosing and healing of various disorders .
Anthropological literature also contains many reports indicating that native cultures have used psychedelics for enhancement of intuition and extrasensory perception for a variety of divinatory , as well as practical purposes , such as finding lost persons and objects , obtaining information about people in remote locations , and following the movement of the game that these people hunted .
In addition , psychedelic experiences served as important sources of artistic inspiration , providing ideas for rituals , paintings , sculptures , and songs .
In the history of Chinese medicine , reports about psychedelic substances can be traced back about 3,000 years .
The legendary divine potion referred to as haoma in the ancient Persian Zend Avesta and as soma in the Indian Vedas was used by the Indo - Iranian tribes millenia ago .
The mystical states of consciousness induced by soma were very likely the principal source of the Vedic and Hindu religion .
Preparations from different varieties of hemp have been smoked and ingested under various names : ­hashish , charas , bhang , ganja , kif , and marijuana –in Asia , in Africa , and in the Caribbean area for recreation , pleasure , and during religious ceremonies .
They represented an important sacrament for such diverse groups as the Indian Brahmans , certain orders of Sufis , ancient Scythians , and the Jamaican Rastafarians .
Ceremonial use of various psychedelic substances also has a long history in Central America .
Highly effective mind - altering plants were well known in several Pre-Columbian Indian cultures–among the Aztecs , Mayans , and Olmecs .
The most famous of these are the Mexican cactus peyote ( Anhalonium Lewinii ) , the sacred mushroom teonanacatl ( Psilocybe mexicana ) and ololiuqui , or morning glory seeds ( Rivea corymbosa ) .
These materials have been used as sacraments until this day by several Mexican Indian tribes ( Huichols , Mazatecs , Cora people , and others ) , and by the Native American Church .
The famous South American yajé or ayahuasca is a decoction from a jungle liana ( Banisteriopsis caapi ) with other plant additives .
The Amazonian area is also known for a variety of psychedelic snuffs ( Virola callophylla , Piptadenia peregrina ) .
Preparations from the bark of the shrub iboga ( Tabernanthe iboga ) have been used by African tribes in lower dosage as a stimulant during lion hunts and long canoe trips and in higher doses as a ritual sacrament .
The above list represents only a small fraction of psychedelic compounds that have been used over many centuries in various countries of the world .
The impact that the experiences encountered in these states had on the spiritual and cultural life of pre-industrial societies has been enormous .
The long history of ritual use of psychedelic plants contrasts sharply with a relatively short history of scientific efforts to identify their psychoactive alkaloids , prepare them in a pure form , and to study their effects .
The first psychedelic substance that was synthetized in a chemically pure form and systematically explored under laboratory conditions was mescaline , the active alkaloid from the peyote cactus .
Clinical experiments conducted with this substance in the first three decades of the twentieth century focused on the phenomenology of the mescaline experience and its interesting effects on artistic perception and creative expression ( Vondrá?ek 1935 , Nevole 1947 , 1949 ) .
Surprisingly , they did not reveal its therapeutic , heuristic , and entheogenic potential of this substance .
Kurt Beringer , author of the influential book Der Meskalinrausch ( Mescaline Inebriation ) published in 1927 , concluded that mescaline induced a toxic psychosis ( Beringer 1927 ) .
After these pioneering clinical experiments with mescaline , very little research was done in this fascinating problem area until Albert Hofmann ’s 1942 epoch - making accidental intoxication and serendipitous discovery of the psychedelic properties of LSD - 25 , or diethylamid of lysergic acid .
After the publication of the first clinical paper on LSD by Walter A. Stoll in the late 1940 ’s ( Stoll 1947 ) , this new semisynthetic ergot derivative , active in incredibly minute quantities of micrograms or gammas ( millionths of a gram ) , became practically overnight a sensation in the world of science .
The discovery of powerful psychoactive effects of miniscule dosages of LSD started what has been called a “ golden era of psychopharmacology . ”
During a relatively short period of time , the joint efforts of biochemists , pharmacologists , neurophysiologists , psychiatrists , and psychologists succeeded in laying the foundations of a new scientific discipline that can be referred to as “ pharmacology of consciousness . ”
The active substances from several remaining psychedelic plants were chemically identified and prepared in chemically pure form .
Following the discovery of the psychedelic effects of LSD - 25 , Albert Hofmann identified the active principles of the Mexican magic mushrooms ( Psilocybe mexicana ) , psilocybin and psilocin , and that of ololiuqui , or morning glory seeds ( Ipomoea violacea ) , which turned out to be monoethylamid of lysergic acid ( LAE - 32 ) , closely related to LSD - 25 .
The armamentarium of psychedelic substances was further enriched by psychoactive derivatives of tryptamine–DMT ( dimethyl - tryptamine ) , DET ( diethyl - tryptamine ) , and DPT ( dipropyltryptamine ) –synthetized and studied by the Budapest group of chemists headed by Stephen Szara , the active principle from the African shrub Tabernanthe iboga , ibogaine , and the pure alkaloid from ayahuasca ’s main ingredient Banisteriopsis caapi , known under the names harmaline , yageine , and telepathine had already been isolated and chemically identified earlier in the twentieth century .
In the 1950s , a wide range of psychedelic alkaloids in pure form was available to researchers .
It was now possible to study their properties in the laboratory and explore the phenomenology of their clinical effects and their therapeutic potential .
The revolution triggered by Albert Hofmann ’s serendipitous discovery of LSD was underway .
During this exciting era , LSD remained the center of attention of researchers .
Never before had a single substance held so much promise in such a wide variety of fields of interest .
For psychopharmacologists and neurophysiologists , the discovery of LSD meant the beginning of a golden era of research that could solve many puzzles concerning neuroreceptors , synaptic transmitters , chemical antagonisms , and the intricate biochemical interactions underlying cerebral processes .
Experimental psychiatrists saw LSD as a unique means for creating a laboratory model for naturally occurring functional , or endogenous , psychoses .
They hoped that the “ experimental psychosis , ” induced by miniscule dosages of this substance , could provide unparalleled insights into the nature of these mysterious disorders and open new avenues for their treatment .
It was suddenly conceivable that the brain or other parts of the body could under certain circumstances produce small quantities of a substance with similar effects as LSD .
This meant that disorders like schizophrenia would not be mental diseases , but metabolic aberrations that could be counteracted by specific chemical intervention .
The promise of this research was nothing less that the fulfillment of the dream of biologically oriented clinicians , the Holy Grail of psychiatry –a test - tube cure for schizophrenia .
LSD was also highly recommended as an extraordinary unconventional teaching device that would make it possible for clinical psychiatrists , psychologists , medical students , and nurses to spend a few hours in a world similar to that of their patients and as a result of it to understand them better , be able to communicate with them more effectively , and hopefully be more successful in treating them .
Thousands of mental health professionals took advantage of this unique opportunity .
These experiments brought surprising and astonishing results .
They not only provided deep insights into the world of psychiatric patients , but also revolutionized the understanding of the nature and dimensions of the human psyche and consciousness .
Many professionals involved in these experiments discovered that the current model , limiting the psyche to postnatal biography and the Freudian individual unconscious , was superficial and inadequate .
My own new map of the psyche that emerged out of this research added two large transbiographical domains –the perinatal level , closely related to the memory of biological birth , and the transpersonal level , harboring the historical and archetypal domains of the collective unconscious as envisioned by C. C. Jung ( Grof 1975 , Jung 1959 ) .
Early experiments with LSD also showed that the sources of emotional and psychosomatic disorders were not limited to traumatic memories from childhood and infancy , as traditional psychiatrists assumed , but that their roots reached much deeper into the psyche , into the perinatal and transpersonal regions ( Grof 2000 ) .
This surprising revelation was accompanied by the discovery of new powerful therapeutic mechanisms operating on these deep levels of the psyche .
Using LSD as a catalyst , it became possible to extend the range of applicability of psychotherapy to categories of patients that previously had been difficult to reach–sexual deviants , alcoholics , narcotic drug addicts , and criminal recidivists ( Grof 2001 ) .
Particularly valuable and promising were the early efforts to use LSD psychotherapy in the work with terminal cancer patients .
Research on this population showed that LSD was able to relieve severe pain , often even in those patients who had not responded to medication with narcotics .
In a large percentage of these patients , it was also possible to ease or even eliminate difficult emotional and psychosomatic symptoms , such as depression , general tension , and insomnia , alleviate the fear of death , increase the quality of their life during the remaining days , and positively transform the experience of dying ( Cohen 1965 , Kast and Collins 1966 , Grof 2006 ) .
For historians and critics of art , the LSD experiments provided extraordinary new insights into the psychology and psychopathology of art , particularly paintings and sculptures of various native , so - called “ primitive ” cultures and psychiatric patients , as well as various modern movements , such as abstractionism , impressionism , cubism , surrealism , and fantastic realism ( Roubí?ek 1961 ) .
For professional painters who participated in LSD research , the psychedelic session often marked a radical change in their artistic expression .
Their imagination became much richer , their colors more vivid , and their style considerably freer .
They could also often reach into deep recesses of their unconscious psyche and tap archetypal sources of inspiration .
On occasion , people who had never painted before were able to produce extraordinary pieces of art .
LSD experimentation brought also fascinating observations , which were of great interest to spiritual teachers and scholars of comparative religion .
The mystical experiences frequently observed in LSD sessions offered a radically new understanding of a wide variety of phenomena from the spiritual domain , including shamanism , the rites of passage , the ancient mysteries of death and rebirth , the Eastern religions and philosophies , and the mystical traditions of the world ( Forte 1997 , Roberts 2001 , Grof 1998 ) .
The fact that LSD and other psychedelic substances were able to trigger a broad range of spiritual experiences became the subject of heated scientific discussions .
They revolved around the fascinating problem concerning the nature and value of this “ instant ” or “ chemical ” mysticism ” ( Grof 1998 ) .
As Walter Pahnke demonstrated in his famous Good Friday experiment , mystical experiences induced by psychedelics are indistinguishable from those described in mystical literature ( Pahnke 1963 ) .
This finding , that was recently confirmed by a meticulous study by researchers at Johns Hopkins University ( Griffith et al. 2006 ) , has important theoretical and legal implications .
Psychedelic research involving LSD , psilocybine , mescaline , and the tryptamine derivatives seemed to be well on its way to fulfill all the above promises and expectations when it was suddenly interrupted by the unsupervised mass experimentation of the young generation in the USA and other Western countries .
In the infamous Harvard affair , psychology professors Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert lost their academic posts and had to leave the school after their overeager proselytizing of LSD ’s promise .
The ensuing repressive measures of administrative , legal , and political nature had very little effect on street use of LSD and other psychedelics , but they drastically terminated legitimate clinical research .
However , while the problems associated with this development were blown out of proportion by sensation - hunting journalists , the possible risks were not the only reason why LSD and other psychedelics were rejected by the Euro - American mainstream culture .
An important contributing factor was also the attitude of technological societies toward holotropic states of consciousness .
As I mentioned earlier , all ancient and pre-industrial societies held these states in high esteem , whether they were induced by psychedelic plants or some of the many powerful non-drug “ technologies of the sacred ” –fasting , sleep deprivation , social and sensory isolation , dancing , chanting , music , drumming , or physical pain .
Members of these social groups had the opportunity to repeatedly experience holotropic states of consciousness during their lifetime in a variety of sacred contexts .
By comparison , the industrial civilization has pathologized holotropic states , rejected or even outlawed the contexts and tools that can facilitate them , and developed effective means of suppressing them when they occur spontaneously , Because of the resulting naiveté and ignorance concerning holotropic states , Western culture was unprepared to accept and incorporate the extraordinary mind - altering properties and power of LSD and other psychedelics .
The sudden emergence of the Dionysian element from the depths of the unconscious and the heights of the superconscious was too threatening for the Euro - American society .
In addition , the irrational and transrational nature of psychedelic experiences seriously challenged the very foundations of the materialistic worldview of Western science .
The existence and nature of these experiences could not be explained in the context of mainstream theories and seriously undermined the metaphysical assumptions concerning priority of matter over consciousness on which Western culture is built .
It also threatened the leading myth of the industrial world by showing that true fulfillment does not come from achievement of material goals but from a profound mystical experience .
It was not just the culture at large that was unprepared for the psychedelic experience ; this was also true for the helping professions .
For most psychiatrists and psychologists , psychotherapy meant disciplined face - to - face discussions or free - associating on the couch .
The intense emotions and dramatic physical manifestations in psychedelic sessions appeared to them to be too close to what they were used to associate with psychopathology .
It was hard for them to imagine that such states could be healing and transformative .
As a result , they did not trust the reports about the extraordinary power of psychedelic psychotherapy coming from those colleagues who had enough courage to take the chances and do psychedelic therapy , or from their clients .
To complicate the situation even further , many of the phenomena occurring in psychedelic sessions could not be understood within the context of theories dominating academic thinking .
The possibility of reliving birth or episodes from embryonic life , obtaining accurate information about world history and mythology from the collective unconscious , experiencing archetypal realities and karmic memories , or perceiving remote events in out - of - body states , were simply too fantastic to be believable for an average professional .
Yet those of us who had the chance to work with LSD and were willing to radically change our theoretical understanding of the psyche and practical strategy of therapy were able to see and appreciate the enormous potential of psychedelics , both as therapeutic tools and as substances of extraordinary heuristic value .
In one of my early books , I suggested that the potential significance of LSD and other psychedelics for psychiatry and psychology was comparable to the value the microscope has for biology and medicine or the telescope has for astronomy .
My later experience with psychedelics only confirmed this initial impression .
These substances function as unspecific amplifiers that increase the cathexis ( energetic charge ) associated with the deep unconscious contents of the psyche and make them available for conscious processing .
This unique property of psychedelics makes it possible to study psychological undercurrents that govern our experiences and behaviors to a depth that cannot be matched by any other method and tool available in modern mainstream psychiatry and psychology .
In addition , it offers unique opportunities for healing of emotional and psychosomatic disorders , for positive personality transformation , and consciousness evolution .
Naturally , the tools of this power carry with them greater risks than more conservative and far less effective tools currently accepted and used by mainstream psychiatry , such as verbal psychotherapy or tranquillizing medication .
Clinical research has shown that these risks can be minimized by responsible use and careful control of the set and setting .
The safety of psychedelic therapy when conducted in a clinical setting was demonstrated by Sidney Cohen ’s study based on information drawn from more than 25,000 psychedelic sessions .
According to Cohen , LSD therapy appeared to be much safer than many other procedures that had been at one time or another routinely used in psychiatric treatment , such as electroshock therapy , insulin coma therapy , and psychosurgery ( Cohen 1960 ) .
However , legislators responding to unsupervised mass use of psychedelics did not get their information from scientific publications , but from the stories of sensation - hunting journalists .
The legal and administrative sanctions against psychedelics did not deter lay experimentation , but they all but terminated legitimate scientific research of these substances .
For those of us who had the privilege to explore and experience the extraordinary potential of psychedelics , this was a tragic loss for psychiatry , psychology , and psychotherapy .
We felt that these unfortunate developments wasted what was probably the single most important opportunity in the history of these disciplines .
Had it been possible to avoid the unnecessary mass hysteria and continue responsible research of psychedelics , they could have undoubtedly radically transformed the theory and practice of psychiatry .
I believe that the observations from this research have the potential to initiate a revolution in the understanding of the human psyche and of consciousness comparable to the conceptual cataclysm that modern physicists experienced in the first three decades in relation to their theories concerning matter .
This new knowledge could become an integral part of a comprehensive new scientific paradigm of the twenty - first century .
At present , when more than three decades elapsed since official research with psychedelics was effectively terminated , I can attempt to evaluate the past history of these substances and glimpse into their future .
After having personally conducted over the last fifty years more than four thousand psychedelic sessions , I have developed great awe and respect for these compounds and their enormous positive , as well as negative potential .
They are powerful tools and like any tool they can be used skillfully , ineptly , or destructively .
The result will be critically dependent on the set and setting .
The question whether LSD is a phenomenal medicine or a devil ’s drug makes as little sense as a similar question asked about the positive or negative potential of a knife .
Naturally , we will get a very different report from a surgeon who bases his or her judgment on successful operations and from the police chief who investigates murders committed with knives in back alleys of New York City .
A housewife would see the knife primarily as a useful kitchen tool and an artist would employ it in carving wooden sculptures .
It would make little sense to judge the usefulness and dangers of a knife by watching children who play with it without adequate maturity and skill .
Similarly , the image of LSD will vary whether we focus on the results of responsible clinical or spiritual use , naive and careless mass self - experimentation of the young generation , or deliberately destructive experiments of the military circles or secret police .
Until it is clearly understood that the results of the administration of psychedelics are critically influenced by the factors of set and setting , there is no hope for rational decisions in regard to psychedelic drug policies .
I firmly believe that psychedelics can be used in such a way that the benefits far outweigh the risks .
This has been amply proven by millennia of safe ritual and spiritual use of psychedelics by generations of shamans , individual healers , and entire aboriginal cultures .
However , the Western industrial civilization has so far abused nearly all its discoveries and there is not much hope that psychedelics will make an exception , unless we rise as a group to a higher level of consciousness and emotional maturity .
Whether or not psychedelics will return into psychiatry and will again become part of the therapeutic armamentarium is a complex problem and its solution will probably be determined not only by the results of scientific research , but also by a variety of political , legal , economic , and mass - psychological factors .
However , I believe that Western society is at present much better equipped to accept and assimilate psychedelics than it was in the 1950s .
At the time when psychiatrists and psychologists started to experiment with LSD , psychotherapy was limited to verbal exchanges between therapist and clients .
Intense emotions and active behavior were referred to as “ acting - out ” and were seen as violations of basic therapeutic rules .
Psychedelic sessions were on the other side of the spectrum , evoking dramatic emotions , psychomotor excitement , and vivid perceptual changes .
They thus seemed to be more like states that psychiatrists considered pathological and tried to suppress by all means than conditions to which one would attribute therapeutic potential .
This was reflected in the terms “ hallucinogens , ” “ delirogens , ” “ psychotomimetics , ” and “ experimental psychoses , ” used initially for psychedelics and the states induced by them .
In any case , psychedelic sessions resembled more scenes from anthropological movies about healing rituals of “ primitive ” cultures and other aboriginal ceremonies than those expected in a psychiatrist ’s or psychotherapist ’s office .
In addition , many of the experiences and observations from psychedelic sessions seemed to seriously challenge the image of the human psyche and of the universe developed by Newtonian - Cartesian science and considered to be accurate and definitive descriptions of “ objective reality . ”
Psychedelic subjects reported experiential identification with other people , animals , and various aspects of nature , during which they gained access to new information about areas about which they previously had no intellectual knowledge .
The same was true about experiential excursions into the lives of their human and animal ancestors , as well as racial , collective , and karmic memories .
On occasion , this new information was drawn from experiences involving reliving of biological birth and memories of prenatal life , encounters with archetypal beings , and visits to mythological realms of different cultures of the world .
In out - of - body experiences , experimental subjects were able to witness and accurately describe remote events occurring in locations that were outside of the range of their senses .
None of these happenings were considered possible in the context of traditional materialistic science , and yet , in psychedelic sessions , they were observed frequently .
This naturally caused deep conceptual turmoil and confusion in the minds of conventionally trained experimenters .
Under these circumstances , many professionals chose to shy away from this area to preserve their respectable scientific world - view and professional reputation and to protect their common sense and sanity .
The last three decades have brought many revolutionary changes that have profoundly influenced the climate in the world of psychotherapy .
Humanistic and transpersonal psychology have developed powerful experiential techniques that emphasize deep regression , direct expression of intense emotions , and bodywork leading to release of physical energies .
Among these new approaches to self - exploration are Gestalt practice , bioenergetics and other neo-Reichian methods , primal therapy , rebirthing , and holotropic breathwork .
The inner experiences and outer manifestations , as well as therapeutic strategies , in these therapies bear a great similarity to those observed in psychedelic sessions .
These non -drug therapeutic strategies involve not only a similar spectrum of experiences , but also comparable conceptual challenges .
As a result , for therapists practicing along these lines , the introduction of psychedelics would represent the next logical step rather than dramatic change in their practice .
Moreover , the Newtonian - Cartesian thinking in science , which in the 1960s enjoyed great authority and popularity , has been progressively undermined by astonishing developments in a variety of disciplines .
This has happened to such an extent that an increasing number of scientists feel an urgent need for an entirely different world - view , a new scientific paradigm .
Salient examples of this development are philosophical implications of quantum - relativistic physics ( Capra 1975 , Goswami 1995 ) , David Bohm ’s theory of holomovement ( Bohm 1980 ) , Karl Pribram ’s holographic theory of the brain ( Pribram 1971 ) , Ilya Prigogine ’s theory of dissipative structures ( Prigogine 1980 ) , Rupert Sheldrake ’s theory of morphogenetic fields ( Sheldrake 1981 ) , Gregory Bateson ’s brilliant synthesis of systems and information theory , cybernetics , anthropology , and psychology ( Bateson 1979 ) , and particularly Ervin Laszlo ’s concept of the PSI field ( akashic field ) , his connectivity hypothesis , and his “ integral theory of everything ” ( Laszlo 1993 , 2004 ) .
It is very encouraging to see that all these new developments that are in irreconcilable conflict with traditional science seem to be compatible with the findings of psychedelic research and with transpersonal psychology .
This list would not be complete without mentioning the remarkable effort of Ken Wilber to create a comprehensive synthesis of a variety of scientific disciplines and perennial philosophy ( Wilber 2000 ) .
Even more encouraging than the changes in the general scientific climate is the fact that , in a few cases , researchers of the younger generation in the United States , Switzerland , and other countries have in recent years been able to obtain official permission to start programs of psychedelic therapy involving LSD , psilocybin , dimethyltryptamine ( DMT ) , methylene - dioxy - methamphetamine ( MMDA ) , and ketamine .
I hope that this is the beginning of a renaissance of interest in psychedelic research that will eventually return these extraordinary tools into the hands of responsible therapists .

Voting as a rational decision , by Andrew Gelman and Noah Kaplan , Vox EU : About fifteen years ago , I attended a lecture by venerable pollster Mervyn Field , who told us that when he started in the business in the 1950s , there was a lot of concern about nonvoters .
What was going on with these people who were too alienated to participate in society in this most basic way ?
But , recently , Field continued , the question has become , Who are these “ voters ” ?
What makes them tick ?
Who are these unsung heroes who make our democracy work by bothering to show up on election day ?
Voter turnout is lower in the United States than in Europe .
What would happen if all the Americans eligible to vote did so ?
According to opinion polls , nonvoters , when forced to declare a preference , are slightly more supportive of Democratic than Republican candidates , and Highton and Wolfinger ( 2001 ) estimate that , under 100 % turnout , the Democrats would receive about 3 percentage points more of the national vote — not a lot , but enough to have swung the two most recent presidential contests .
But election campaigns are not static .
Jonathan Nagler and Jan Leighley ( 2007 ) show that nonvoters care about different issues than voters , and they conjecture that increased turnout would raise the profiles of these issues in the campaign .
From the other direction , it has been argued that low turnout is a good thing , so that the election is decided by the most well - informed voters .
But what if voting is done not by the serious citizens , but rather the most foolish — or by the people who have nothing better to do on a Tuesday ?
This is what would seem to be implied by a straightforward decision - theoretic calculation .
In the notation of Riker and Ordeshook ( 1968 ) , the utility U gained from voting can be written as the sum of three terms , U = p* B - C + D , where p is the probability that your single vote is decisive , B is the benefit you gain from your preferred candidate winning the election , C is the cost incurred by going to the trouble to vote , and D is the direct benefit of voting irrespective of the outcome .
C – D is the net cost of voting .
For a large election , the probability p can only be estimated as extremely small in any national election .
A quick calculation : suppose there are 100 million voters choosing between two candidates , each of whom is expected to receive between 45 % and 55 % of the vote .
The probability that your vote will swing the outcome of the election is then 1 in 10 million .
( Analysis becomes more complicated when using real election forecasts for America ’s two - stage presidential voting system , but the final number does n’t change much . )
Even for a benefit B that is fairly large , for example , $ 10,000 , the product p*B is tiny .
Given that the act of voting has a nonzero cost , voter turnout is thus usually attributed to some mix of irrationality , confusion , and the direct gratifications of voting ( including the performance of a civic duty ) ; that is , a negative net cost of the act of voting .
However , these motivations do not explain observed variations in voter turnout between elections .
In addition , voting is an act with large - scale consequences beyond any immediate satisfaction it gives to the voter .
At the very least , many voters seem to consider their voting actions with more seriousness than other low - cost consumption decisions .
This is why voter turnout has been called “ the paradox that ate rational choice theory ” ( Fiorina , 1990 , Green and Shapiro , 1994 ) .
Rational voting
But here 's the good news .
If your vote is decisive , it will make a difference for tens of millions of people .
If you think your preferred candidate could bring the equivalent of a $ 100 improvement in the quality of life to the average person in your country — not an implausible hope , given the size of national budgets and the impact of decisions in foreign policy , health , the environment , and other areas — you ’re now buying a billion - dollar lottery ticket .
With this payoff , a 1 in 10 million chance of being decisive is n't bad odds .
And many people do see it that way .
Surveys show that voters choose based on who they think will do better for their country as a whole , rather than their personal betterment .
Indeed , when it comes to voting , it is irrational to be selfish .
The probability of your vote being decisive is roughly inversely proportional to the size of the electorate ( see Gelman , King , and Boscardin , 1988 , Gelman , Katz , and Bafumi , 2004 , and Mulligan and Hunter , 2002 , for details and empirical evidence ) , and your personal benefit remains flat , but the “ social benefit ” — the total gain for the country that you would anticipate , if your candidate wins — is proportional to the population , so that the product p*B approaches a constant , not zero , as the number of voters increases .
( It is not necessary for this social benefit to be accurately perceived — see Caplan , 2007 — for it to determine people ’s votes . )
In “ Voting as a rational choice : why and how people vote to improve the well - being of others , ” co-authors and I show how this reasoning implies a feedback mechanism : if turnout declines , then the probability of a tied election increases , which in turn implies that , on the margin , it then becomes rational for some people to vote .
The feedback with voter turnout is why voting is not a simple free - rider or prisoner ’s dilemma problem : the more people who free ride ( by not voting ) , the higher the expected benefit to you of voting , and so extremely low turnout is not an equilibrium .
In addition to predicting nontrivial turnout rates among rational voters , the model also explains the rationality of giving money to a candidate : Large contributions , or contributions to local elections , could conceivably be justified as providing access or the opportunity to directly influence policy .
But small - dollar contributions to national elections , like voting , can be better motivated by the possibility of large social benefit than by any direct benefit to you .
Such civically motivated behavior is consistent with both small and large anonymous contributions to charity .
In two laboratory experiments on college students , Fowler ( 2006 ) and Fowler and Kam ( 2006 ) found that voters are more likely than nonvoters to behave altruistically ( as is consistent with the social - benefit utility model ) and display delayed - gratification behaviour ( as is consistent with the fact that the costs of voting are immediate whereas the benefits are delayed ) .
The social motivation from voting also explains declining response rates in opinion polls .
In the 1950s , when mass - opinion polling was rare , we would argue that it was more rational to respond to a survey than to vote in an election : as one of 1000 respondents in a national poll , there was a real chance that your response could noticeably affect the poll numbers ( for example , changing a poll result from 49 % to 50 % ) .
Nowadays , polls are so common that a telephone poll was done recently in the US to estimate how often individuals are surveyed ( the answer was about once per year ) .
It is unlikely that a response to a single survey will have much impact .
Thus far , we have primarily emphasised our theory as explaining the “ mystery ” that people vote .
However , it also has implications for vote choices .
Why you vote and how you vote are closely connected .
If you are voting because of the possibility that you will decide the election and benefit others , then you will vote for the policy that you think will lead to the largest average benefit .
There is no reason to vote for a policy that has idiosyncratic benefits to you because the individual - benefit term in your utility is essentially irrelevant for large electorates .
This could be one reason why the rhetoric of politics tends to be phrased as benefits to society generally or to large deserving groups , rather than naked appeals to self - interest .
No doubt many people are biased to think that what benefits them will benefit others , but we predict that most people will try to vote to benefit society at large or some large affinity group .
Our contention therefore runs contrary to much of the political - economy work of the past few decades .
Except in very small elections , a rational person who votes will choose the candidate or party with the best perceived social benefits to the population .
Rationality and selfishness
In surveys , voters say they are motivated by national conditions , and their turnout is consistent with this assumption , so perhaps we should believe them .
Conversely , rational and purely selfish people should not vote .
We have rescued rational choice theory from the voter turnout paradox , but at a price , by formally decoupling rationality from self - interest ( except in the uninteresting tautological sense that anything you do must be in your self - interest because otherwise you would n’t be doing it ) .
As theorists have noted previously ( for example , Margolis , 1981 ) , rationality need not imply selfishness .
At some level , this is obvious : consider , for example , a volunteer fire department deciding how best to spend its annual capital improvements budget .
But in common discourse , even ( or especially ? ) among economists , the two concepts go together , so much so that psychologists have found that people overly attribute self - interest as a motivation even for their own actions ( Miller , 1999 ) .
Voting and vote choice ( including related actions such as the decision to gather information in order to make an informed vote ) are an interesting example of decisions that are rational in large elections only to the extent that voters are not selfish .
This in turn has implications for how people gather and weigh information in deciding their votes .

( CNN ) --
An Atlanta , Georgia , judge who ordered white lawyers out of his courtroom so he could lecture African - American defendants called that decision a " mistake " Tuesday night .
Judge Marvin Arrington says he is fed up with the defendants he keeps seeing in his courtroom .
" In retrospect , it was a mistake , " Judge Marvin Arrington told CNN .
" Because my sheriff said to me , ' Judge , that message should be given to everybody ' --
' Do n't violate the law , make something out of yourself , go to school , find a role model , somebody that will help you advance your life . ' "
Arrington , who is African - American , is a judge in Fulton County , Georgia , which includes the city of Atlanta .
He said he got fed up seeing a parade of young black defendants shuffle into his courtroom and decided to address them one day last week -- out of the earshot of white lawyers .
" I came out and saw the defendants , and it was about 99.9 percent Afro-Americans , " Arrington told CNN affiliate WSB - TV of Atlanta , " and at some point in time , I excused some lawyers -- most of them white -- and said to the young people in here , ' What in the world are you doing with your lives ? ' "
The judge thought his message would make a greater impact if he delivered it to a black - only audience , he said .
Watch judge talk about decision to lecture black defendants »
" I did n't want them to think I was talking down to them ; trying to embarrass them or insult them ; be derogatory toward them , and I was just saying , ' Please get yourself together , ' " Arrington said .
In his Tuesday night appearance on CNN , Arrington told Anderson Cooper that that seeing the same faces walk in and out of his courtroom year after year takes its toll .
" I ask them all the the time , ' What progress are we making with you ? '
And sometime they cannot answer , " he said .
He said he would open his court doors to everyone on Thursday and " I am going to give the same identical speech : ' You 've got to do better . ' "

Readers of London 's Sunday Times kept telling the auto reporters that the official mileage numbers for the Prius were overstated by about 15 imperial mpg .
Intrigued , the Times decided to test things out by running a Prius against a BMW 520d with regenerative braking from London to Geneva , a 460 - mile trip .
Then they added 100 miles of urban running to give the Prius a chance to recover ground on its proper turf .
The verdict : the conventional diesel with Efficient Dynamics beat the full hybrid by 2.2 imperial mpg , or 1.8 US mpg .
This means that an executive sedan with all the mod-cons and 500 extra pounds beat the mollusk - shaped sip-tastic wunderkind known as the Prius .
And the diesel 's COemissions are just 32 g / km higher than the hybrid poster - child , to boot .
Admittedly , we find the test a bit unfair -- the Prius is not meant show its muscle at " 75 - mph into a headwind , " and adding 100 miles of urban driving does n't make up for 460 miles of autoroute .
Reverse those driving conditions and then let 's see who won .
Still , for all of us diesel fans out there , it 's a feather we wo n't mind putting in the cap .
Thanks for the tip , George !

Like Hillary , both governors won second terms in landslides and have the executive experience that women are supposed to need in triplicate to get elected .
So maybe the pipeline is n’t empty .
But maybe the pipeline is n’t the only way to go , or wo n’t be by the time the next presidential campaign rolls around .
If Barack Obama could come out of nowhere to sweep voters off their feet , maybe the same could be true for some charismatic woman running for president in the not - too - distant future .
Two years ago , both Geraldine Ferraro , the first female candidate of a major political party to run for vice president , and Jesse Jackson were quoted as saying that they thought a black man would have a harder time than a white woman getting elected president , a commonplace view at the time .
If perceptions of possibility have fluctuated so much in just two years , imagine how much they could turn around again in four or eight .
It ’s possible that what we ’ve been waiting for is not a woman who has logged years in Senate committees or kissing babies at state fairs , but a dynamic woman with Mr. Obama ’s combination of dramatic back story and cerebral bona fides .
Since most of us had never heard of him before his inspirational speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention , consider , just for fun , a woman you may never have heard of : Samantha Power .
Ms. Power is a former war correspondent turned Harvard academic whose book about genocide , “ A Problem From Hell , ” won the Pulitzer Prize and changed national dialogue on the subject .
A foreign policy adviser for Mr. Obama , she could very well end up in his cabinet ( and she ’ll be right around his age , 46 , eight years from now ) .
She has not mastered Mozart ’s Piano Concerto in D minor , unlike that other pipeline buster of a female foreign policy expert ; but she has also been known to shoot hoops with George Clooney .
Do n’t go rushing to register Powerforpresident.com , though  she was born in Ireland , and , therefore , ca n’t run .
But she has the kind of irresistible profile that could be what it takes .
Maybe right now there ’s some 37 - year - old female Iraq vet  fighter pilot would be nice ; high ranking , naturally  who ’s a former Rhodes Scholar , who raised her three siblings on food stamps and who plays a mean bass .

Kissinger 's 1974 Plan for
Food Control Genocide
by Joseph Brewda
On Dec. 10 , 1974 , the U.S. National Security Council under Henry Kissinger completed a classified 200 - page study , " National Security Study Memorandum 200 : Implications of Worldwide Population Growth for U.S. Security and Overseas Interests . "
The study falsely claimed that population growth in the so - called Lesser Developed Countries ( LDCs ) was a grave threat to U.S. national security .
Adopted as official policy in November 1975 by President Gerald Ford , NSSM 200 outlined a covert plan to reduce population growth in those countries through birth control , and also , implicitly , war and famine .
Brent Scowcroft , who had by then replaced Kissinger as national security adviser ( the same post Scowcroft was to hold in the Bush administration ) , was put in charge of implementing the plan .
CIA Director George Bush was ordered to assist Scowcroft , as were the secretaries of state , treasury , defense , and agriculture .
The bogus arguments that Kissinger advanced were not original .
One of his major sources was the Royal Commission on Population , which King George VI had created in 1944 " to consider what measures should be taken in the national interest to influence the future trend of population . "
The commission found that Britain was gravely threatened by population growth in its colonies , since " a populous country has decided advantages over a sparsely - populated one for industrial production . "
The combined effects of increasing population and industrialization in its colonies , it warned , " might be decisive in its effects on the prestige and influence of the West , " especially effecting " military strength and security . "
NSSM 200 similarly concluded that the United States was threatened by population growth in the former colonial sector .
It paid special attention to 13 " key countries " in which the United States had a " special political and strategic interest " : India , Bangladesh , Pakistan , Indonesia , Thailand , the Philippines , Turkey , Nigeria , Egypt , Ethiopia , Mexico , Brazil , and Colombia .
It claimed that population growth in those states was especially worrisome , since it would quickly increase their relative political , economic , and military strength .
For example , Nigeria : " Already the most populous country on the continent , with an estimated 55 million people in 1970 , Nigeria 's population by the end of this century is projected to number 135 million .
This suggests a growing political and strategic role for Nigeria , at least in Africa . "
Or Brazil : " Brazil clearly dominated the continent demographically . "
The study warned of a " growing power status for Brazil in Latin America and on the world scene over the next 25 years . "
Food as a weapon
There were several measures that Kissinger advocated to deal with this alleged threat , most prominently , birth control and related population - reduction programs .
He also warned that " population growth rates are likely to increase appreciably before they begin to decline , " even if such measures were adopted .
A second measure was curtailing food supplies to targetted states , in part to force compliance with birth control policies : " There is also some established precedent for taking account of family planning performance in appraisal of assistance requirements by AID [ U.S. Agency for International Development ] and consultative groups .
Since population growth is a major determinant of increases in food demand , allocation of scarce PL 480 resources should take account of what steps a country is taking in population control as well as food production .
In these sensitive relations , however , it is important in style as well as substance to avoid the appearance of coercion . "
" Mandatory programs may be needed and we should be considering these possibilities now , " the document continued , adding , " Would food be considered an instrument of national power ? ...
Is the U.S. prepared to accept food rationing to help people who can 't / wo n't control their population growth ? "
Kissinger also predicted a return of famines that could make exclusive reliance on birth control programs unnecessary .
" Rapid population growth and lagging food production in developing countries , together with the sharp deterioration in the global food situation in 1972 and 1973 , have raised serious concerns about the ability of the world to feed itself adequately over the next quarter of century and beyond , " he reported .
The cause of that coming food deficit was not natural , however , but was a result of western financial policy : " Capital investments for irrigation and infrastucture and the organization requirements for continuous improvements in agricultural yields may be beyond the financial and administrative capacity of many LDCs .
For some of the areas under heaviest population pressure , there is little or no prospect for foreign exchange earnings to cover constantly increasingly imports of food . "
" It is questionable , " Kissinger gloated , " whether aid donor countries will be prepared to provide the sort of massive food aid called for by the import projections on a long - term continuing basis . "
Consequently , " large - scale famine of a kind not experienced for several decades — a kind the world thought had been permanently banished , " was foreseeable — famine , which has indeed come to pass .
Michigan voters to decide on legal medical marijuana Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday April 29 , 2008
|
Print This Email This When Michigan voters head to the polls this November , they 'll have the chance to remove the legal hassles for tens of thousands of their neighbors whose pain and suffering caused by a dozen diseases can be eased with medical marijuana .
A measure that will appear on the ballot there this fall would remove penalties for suffering patients who find their only relief from smoking a joint , eating a pot brownie or brewing tea with the infamous herb .
A poll last month found two - thirds of Michiganders support the proposal , which would make their state the 13th to legalize medical marijuana .
The Detroit News spoke to some of the state 's upstanding citizens whose efforts to ease their pain have forced them to the other side of the law .
Rochelle Lampkin is a 49 - year - old grandmother of 10 who used to picket in front of dope houses in her Detroit neighborhood , chanting " this is wrong , shut it down . "
Today , she knowingly breaks the law by using marijuana to ease searing eye pain -- a side - effect of the multiple sclerosis that struck her more than 20 years ago .
She must use a cane or walker to get around .
...
" Years ago , I was at an MS group meeting and someone suggested I try marijuana because it can help with the pain and the eye problems , " Lampkin recalled .
" I said : ' I 'm not doing that .
It 's dope . ' "
But the flare - ups of optic neuritis convinced her to change her mind about four years ago .
" You have enough pain , you 'll try anything , " she said .
" Somebody gave me a marijuana cigarette and I puffed on it a couple times and got relief from the pain behind my eyes .
I was shocked that it worked . "
Sponsors of the Michigan proposal , backed primarily by the Marijuana Policy Project , says it could help as many as 50,000 patients , who now either have to go without what some doctors see as the best treatment or dodge the law to find it .
The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws says marijuana can be used to treat at least 17 diseases , including HIV , Hepatitis C , Multiple Sclerosis and Alzheimer 's Disease .
The federal government still considers medical marijuana illegal , and DEA agents have raided some medical marijuana dispensaries in states like California , which was the first to legalize medical marijuana in 1996 .
Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have called prosecution of medical marijuana patients unnecessary , but neither has advocated outright decriminalization of the drug .
Republican John McCain seems more willing to continue the drug war in its current form .

Ever wonder why John " Let 's stay 100 years in Iraq ! " McCain is doing so well with anti-war primary voters ?
Maybe it has to do with bobbleheaded discussions like this one on This Week with George Stephanopoulos , where the round table panel thinks that Iraq is a winning issue for McCain .
Despite the fact that most Americans want out of Iraq within a year and do not think " success " ( I 'm still waiting for someone to define this for me ) is not possible , Time Magazine 's Jay Carney thinks that McCain can coast to the White House by distinguishing himself from his Democratic rivals with his wargasmic rhetoric , a bizarre assertion that neither George Stephanopoulos , Claire Shipman nor Mark Halperin find questionable at all .
So let 's get this straight : almost two - thirds of the country wants us out of Iraq , but the guy who wants us to be there indefinitely ( and Carney thinks this concept has " honor " as opposed to pulling out ) , will resonate with voters .
And Democratic voters have been turning out consistently during these primaries more than two times as often as their Republican candidates .
And McCain faces a mutiny from the noise machine on his own side for not being conservative enough .
And despite the continual White House and media spin that the " surge " has been a success , there is no measurable documentation to back that up .
So , with absolutely no facts on their side , the media has decided to champion McCain 's candidacy on the one area that he is diametrically opposite from the majority of Americans .
I ask you , what planet do these bobbleheads live on ?
Transcripts below the fold :
CARNEY : On Iraq , I ’m not sure that it ’s …that he ca n’t win that argument .
I think that if you ’re forward looking , that the public has already decided what it thinks about what happened and how we got in and whether it ’s been done well .
But I think , you know , McCain can effectively frame an argument that says , you know , “ I ’m a much better steward going forward ” than Democrats who are going to come in and say , “ let ’s just get out . ”
Imagine what will happen with the military brass and conservative establishment and people who just do n’t want to see us hightail it out of there without honor .
I think that can be a very effective argument and the Democratic nominee , whether it ’s Obama or Clinton , has to have an answer to that that ’s acceptable .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Probably works better against Obama than Clinton ?
SHIPMAN : Yeah , and also I think it works better if the subject shifts back to Iraq than the economy .
I mean , I think people are so focused on the economy right now , I ’m not sure that ’s going to be a compelling issue …
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But I also wonder if he ’s damned by success in Iraq , Mark Halperin , if it ’s going well , yes , people may have forgotten that they did n’t like the war in the first place , but if it ’s going well , that could become all the more reason to bring the troops out .
HALPERIN : Well , it could be , but there ’s going to be a troop presence there .
The Democrats , if you talk to their advisors [ inaudible ] of course there ’s going to be a troop presence there for the foreseeable future , of a pretty substantial size .
I do n’t Iraq goes off the table , and I think again , you ’re right .
If it gets better there , maybe he ca n’t argue as much about the importance of it .
But he ’s going to have to make foreign policy — Iraq , War on Terror — the centerpieces of his general election campaign or he could not win .
Explosion at recruiting station in Times Square RAW STORY
Published : Thursday March 6 , 2008

Print This Email This Update : Defense officials alert recruiting stations across US A small bomb caused minor damage to a landmark military recruiting station in the heart of Times Square before dawn Thursday , and police were searching for a hooded bicyclist seen on a surveillance video pedaling away .
The video shows the bicyclist getting off a bike at 3:40 a.m. Thursday and walking toward the building .
A minute or so later , the person returned to the bike and rode away .
A brief flash and a cloud of white smoke follows .
A bike , believed used in the crime , was later found in the trash on West 38th Street , Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said .
The blast left a gaping hole in the front window and shattered a glass door , twisting and blackening its metal frame .
No one was hurt , but Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said the device , though unsophisticated , could have caused " injury and even death . "
" If it is something that 's directed toward American troops then it 's something that 's taken very seriously and is pretty unfortunate , " said Army Capt .
Charlie Jaquillard , who is the commander of Army recruiting in Manhattan .
Witnesses staying at a Marriott hotel four blocks away said they could feel the building shake with the blast .
" It shook the building .
I thought it could have been thunder , but I looked down and there was a massive plume of smoke so I knew it was an explosion , " said Terry Leighton , 48 , of London , who was staying on the 21st floor of the Marriott .
David Hassan , who operates a breakfast cart across the street , said he was in the area when the explosion happened .
" I saw smoke and there was a loud boom , " he said .
" I was scared .
I 'm still shaky . "
The military 's 1,600 recruiting stations nationwide were alerted and advised to use extra caution , said Douglas Smith , spokesman for the Army recruiting command .
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said no official higher state of alert had been issued .
" We do get occasional vandals at our recruiting stations , " Whitman said .
" It 's unfortunate but it happens from time to time . "
The office recurits for the Navy , Marines , Air Force and Army .
New York recruiters will temporarily work out of their Union Square , Whitman said .
Members of the police department 's bomb squad and fire officials gathered outside the station in the early morning darkness , and police cars and yellow tape blocked drivers  most of them behind the wheels of taxicabs  from entering one of the world 's busiest crossroads .
Police began allowing some traffic through around the start of rush hour .
Authorities were still trying to determine exactly what kind of device was used .
When investigators went through the evidence , they found a metal ammunition box that is believed to have contained the explosive .
It was being sent for testing .
Kelly said the box was readily available in Army - Navy surplus stores .
" Whoever the coward was that committed this disgraceful act on our city will be found and prosecuted to the full extent of the law , " Mayor Michael Bloomberg said .
The recruiting station , located near the theater district on a traffic island , is surrounded by chain stores and restaurants and several TV studios , has occasionally been the site of anti-war demonstrations , ranging from silent vigils to loud rallies .
In October 2005 , a group of activists who call themselves the Granny Peace Brigade rallied there against the Iraq war .
Eighteen activists , most of them grandmothers with several in their 80s and 90s , were later acquitted of disorderly conduct .
The recruiting station was renovated in 1999 to better fit into the flashy ambiance of Times Square , using neon tubing to give the glass and steel office a patriotic American flag motif .
For a half century , the station was the armed forces ' busiest recruiting center .
It has set national records for enlistment , averaging about 10,000 volunteers a year .
Police said it was too early to say if the blast may have been related to two other minor explosions in the city .
In October , two small explosive devices were tossed over a fence at the Mexican consulate , shattering three windows but causing no injuries .
No threats had been made against the consulate , and no one took responsibility for the explosion , police said .
At the time , police said they were investigating whether it was connected to a similar incident at the British consulate on May 5 , 2005 .
In that incident , the explosions took place in the early morning hours , when Britons were going to the polls in an election that returned Prime Minister Tony Blair to power .
In both cases , the instruments were fake grenades sometimes sold as novelty items .
They were packed with black powder and detonated with fuses , but incapable of causing serious harm , police said .

Defense officials alerted recruiting stations across the country after a small bomb damaged one station in New York early Thursday .
Army officials notified roughly 1,600 military recruiting offices nationwide , telling them about the explosion in Times Square and advising them to use extra caution , said Douglas Smith , spokesman for the Army recruiting command .
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said no official warning or higher state of alert had been issued .
" We do get occasional vandals at our recruiting stations , " Whitman said , adding that he did n't have figures on how many .
" It 's unfortunate , but it happens from time to time . "
With police still investigating , the Times Square station had not yet been turned over to the Defense Department , but officials were hoping they would be able later Thursday to assess damage and find out what repairs are needed .
" This is a law enforcement matter at this point , " Whitman said .
Recruiters who normally work in the damaged building will be working temporarily out of the Union Square office , Whitman said .
The Times Square office was empty when the blast occurred around 3:45 a.m. , and no one was hurt .

Which countries are increasing in oil production ?
Which are decreasing ?
How is this changing ?
Can we expect that the increasing ones will continue to increase in 2008 ?
Does the megaprojects data give any insight into the future increases of growing countries ?
These are some of the questions that Matt Mushalik and I explore in this post using what Matt calls " incremental production graphs " .
Matt has an ingenious way of graphing oil production .
In his graphs , he separates oil production between base production , which stays the same during the entire graphing period , and incremental production , which is the " top " of the graph , after base production is subtracted .
He then groups together different countries with similar production patterns , for some interesting analyses .
It has been about six months since our previous article .
The additional time allows us to continue and deepen the analysis .
As in the earlier post , incremental production profiles of various countries or groups of countries are stacked in such a way that it gives us information about production trends .
Incremental production in a given country and period is defined as the production exceeding the minimum production in that period .
Individual Country and Small Group Profiles
Figure 1 shows incremental production profiles for selected countries and groups .
The tick marks on the side correspond to 1 million barrels of oil a day , so one can tell approximately how much production has recently been increasing or decreasing , for the countries or groups shown .
What is shown for each country or group is equivalent to the top " slice " of the graphs for that country or group .
Figure 1 - Incremental Crude Oil Production Profiles , December 2007
A few comments about the profiles on the above chart :
• Iraq - production drops during and after the Iraq war
• Venezuela - a steady decline and a big drop during the strike in 2003
• Angola , Brazil , Azerbaijan , Kazakhstan , Algeria , Libya , Canada , China , and Russia - all countries with increasing production
• Saudi Arabia - boosts production during the Iraq war and in 2004 , but then is not able to maintain production levels in 2006 / 07 .
Recent uptick in production still leaves it below 2004 /2005 .
• Nigeria - fairly flat production ; high year 2005
• Peaks 2006/2007 - Ecuador , Vietnam , India , Qatar , EIA 's " Other " , Kuwait , UAE - These countries appear to be on a plateau or slightly declining .
• Peak 8/2005 - Iran , Mexico , Malaysia
• UK and Norway - shows North Sea decline
• Post Peak - Indonesia , Egypt , Syria , Gabon , Argentina , Colombia , Australia , Oman , Yemen , Denmark - all in terminal decline
• US - on a declining path since its peak in 1971 , showing production drops during hurricane seasons
Four Major Groups of Countries
To get a better overview of the underlying trends further groups are formed :
Figure 2 - Incremental Crude Oil Production Profiles for Groupings of Countries 2007
• Top Group - Iraq and Venezuela shown separately with their big production drops in 2003
• Second Group - the growth wedge (+ 8 million b/d ) showing clear signs that Russia plus some other hitherto growing countries are maxing out
• Third Group - " peaking group " - the various recent peak and the plateau groups -
This group is dominated by Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and UAE .
The rebound in 2007 is mainly from Saudi Arabia .
Production for this group dropped between 2001 and 2002 , then increased by a whopping 6 million barrels a day between 2002 and 2005 .
If one compares 2001 and 2007 , production is just 2 million barrels a day higher now .
• Fourth Group - the decline wedge ( US , North Sea , others post peak ) .
This group 's incremental production went down from 6 million barrels a day in 2001 to 2 million barrels a day in 2007 .
In these graphs , note that the base production ( the amount that did not change ) is not shown .
Also note the colors of countries are the same between graphs , so that they can be better identified .
These groups can now be stacked in two different ways to give us different information :
(1) Starting with declining countries on the bottom
(2) Staring with the growing countries on the bottom
Graph with Declining Countries on the Bottom
From bottom to top : declining group , peaking group and growing group .
Iraq and Venezuela are put on top as their one - off production drops in 2003 distort the picture if stacked somewhere in between .
Because of the definition of incremental production , their layers are disproportionately thick because of the big temporary drops in production .
To minimize the distortion this causes , they are put at the top of the graph .
This is the graph shown at the top of the post , which we show again here .
Figure 3 - Incremental Oil Production Stacked with Declining Groups at Bottom
The bottom black line shows the underlying trend in the declining group of countries .
The second from the bottom black line outlines the sum of the bottom two groups - that is , the declining group , and the recent peak / plateau group .
The trend line clearly shows an underlying peak when these two groups are combined .
The third from the bottom black line adds the " growing group " to the previous two groups .
The growing group of countries was able to offset the declining trend after the peak and lift total crude production to an only slightly declining trend .
White and black crosses mark the points used for the declining trend lines .
Increasing trend lines have been inserted by estimating the growth between a low in 2002 to a maximum in May 2005 .
Graph with Growing Countries at the Bottom
Figure 4 - Incremental Oil Production Stacked with Growing Groups at Bottom
In a different view of the same data , production profiles from growing countries are stacked at the bottom and Saudi Arabia on top .
The graph clearly shows that Russia , Kazachstan and Brazil have maxed out ( unless megaprojects change this in the future ) and that Saudi Arabia is no longer performing its function as swing producer .
This analysis helps us understand what the late Dr. Ali Bakhtiari called the transition phase T1 between growth and decline .
During the Australian Senate hearings on oil supplies in July 2006
Ali said this transition phase would start in 2006 and last for three to five years .
It seems the transition phase is marked by two crude oil peaking events , one in 2005 and another one happening right now .
The big question is therefore how long will that peaking of the hitherto growing group take ?
These are the current trends :
Former Soviet Union
We have already mentioned that Russia seems to be at peak .
In other Former Soviet Union countries , Kazachstan 's doubling of oil production starting in 2005 has stalled , leaving just Azerbaijan with an annual increase of 200 thousand barrels a day .
It is possible that the increase will be greater than this .
Russia , Kazachstan , and Azerbaijan have megaprojects scheduled to begin production in 2008 which total 1,186,000 million barrels a day in maximum production .
This total production is not expected to be reached in 2008 , and a significant share of it will be needed to offset declines in older fields .
Given these considerations , increased production for the Former Soviet Union may be somewhat more than 200,000 barrels a day , perhaps on the order of 400,000 barrels a day .
This may very well be an overestimate .
Numerous reports suggest , such as this one , indicate that Russian production will fall in 2008 .
Figure 5 - Incremental Oil Production for Azerbaijan and Kazachstan
Angola and Brazil
Angola joined OPEC and will come under a quota system .
A recent announcement indicates that Angola 's production for 2008 is expected to reach a plateau of 2 million barrels a day , and maintain that level until 2013 .
Production for December 2007 is reported to be 1,986,000 barrels per day , so Angola has apparently now reached its peak production , and only a plateau can be expected henceforth .
Brazil 's growth has apparently flattened .
There are four megaprojects scheduled to start production in Brazil in 2008 .
The ultimate production for the 2008 projects is expected to be 475,000 barrels a day , although not all of this is expected to be realized in 2008 .
There are also a number of megaprojects ( totalling 648,000 barrels a day in ultimate production ) that were expected to begin near the end of 2007 .
If the various 2007 and 2008 projects come on board as planned , Brazil 's production may increase by 400,000 or 500,000 barrels a day in 2008 .
( All of these future production estimates are very rough . )
Other African Countries
In another group of African countries Algeria 's and Libya 's growth is modest , but steady while Sudan and Equatorial Guinea grew at 300 Kb/d last year .
There do not seem to be any significant megaprojects for these countries for 2007 and 2008 .
If decline rates are as in other countries , the increases for these countries may be smaller for 2008 .
Figure 6 - Incremental Oil Production for Several African Countries
Canada
For Canada we know the potential is in syn crude from tar sands but this is limited by the supply of natural gas .
CO2 emissions are a big problem and NASA climatologist James Hansen has not included this un-conventional oil in his carbon balance .
There is just no room for it , according to this paper he wrote .
Irrespective of environmental and climate change concerns , there are a number megaprojects planned for the Canadian tar sands .
The ultimate production from these total 266,000 barrels a day from projects with 2007 start dates and 605,000 barrels a day for projects that are planned to start in 2008 , according to the megaprojects list .
Some of these are very long term projects - not to be completed until 2018 .
Actual production increases are likely to be much more modest .
Canada 's oil production grew less than 100,000 barrels a day in 2007 .
It would be surprising if Canada 's 2008 oil production grows more than 200,000 or 300,000 barrels a day .
Conclusions
This analysis is mostly a review of what has happened in the past with oil production .
Another article , very closely related to this one , was written by Matt and is posted on the Sydney Peak Oil website .
We have included a few very rough estimates of production for some of the increasing countries for the future .
It looks as though there still will be countries with increases in 2008 .
Our rough estimates of increases for the countries shown total only about 1.0 to 1.5 million barrels a day .
This is fairly similar to what the increases for the growing group of countries has been over the past five years .
This is not very much to offset the countries with declining production .
There are many countries that we have not considered to be growing , that theoretically may grow in the future .
Saudi Arabia and Iran would be two in this category .
We have not made any estimates , upward or downward , for these countries .
If oil production is to stay on its current plateau , it would seem like we would need increases from some of these countries as well .
We remain on a bumpy crude plateau , where the exact timing of new projects and the coming hurricane season will determine which temporary wiggles we get on the production curve .
2008 should be an interesting year .
When Iraqi Prime Minister al - Kerensky sent his " army " to fight the Mahdi Army in Basra , President Bush called it " a defining moment . "
It turned out instead to be a confirming moment .
It confirmed that there is no state in Mesopotamia .
One of the most common signs that America ’s leadership is clueless about 4GW is the language they use .
Fourth Generation war has few if any defining moments .
Nor does it have " turning points , " another common Bushism .
In his testimony on Tuesday , General David Petraeus revealed the limits on his own grasp of 4GW when he said , " We ’ve got to continue .
We have our teeth into the jugular , and we need to keep it ( sic ) there . "
4GW opponents have no jugular .
4GW is war of the capillaries .
What we have our teeth into in Iraq is a jellyfish .
If we are to see Iraq and other Fourth Generation conflicts as they are and not through the looking glass , we need to use words more carefully .
Because there is no state in Iraq , there is also no government .
Orders given in Baghdad have no meaning , because there are no state institutions to carry them out .
The governmental positions of Iraqi leaders have no substance .
Their power is a function of their relationship to various militias , not of their offices .
( Mr. al - Maliki has no militia , which means he is a figurehead . )
The Iraqi " army " and " police " are groupings of Shiite militias , which exist to fight other militias and which take orders from militia leaders , not the government .
Government revenues are slush funds militia leaders use to pay their militiamen .
All of these phenomena , and many more , are products of the one basic reality : there is no state .
The failure of Mr. al - Maliki ’s " big push " into Basra put Iraq ’s statelessness on display .
Ordered to do something it did not want to do , the Iraqi " army " fell apart , as militias usually fall apart when given unwelcome directives .
Iraqi " soldiers " and " police " went over or went home , in considerable numbers .
Those who did fight had little fight in them ; the affair reportedly ended with the Mahdi Army controlling more of Basra than it did at the beginning .
Mr. al - Maliki , desperate for a cease - fire , had to agree in advance to any conditions Muqtada al - Sadr cared to impose .
American policy proved even more reckless than that of Mr. al - Maliki .
To win in Iraq , we must see a state re-emerge .
That means we should stay out of the way of anyone with the potential to recreate a state .
Muqtada al - Sadr is at or near the head of the list .
The al - Maliki " government " is n’t even on it .
So what did we do ?
Why , we went to war against al - Sadr on behalf of al - Maliki , of course .
Our leadership cannot grasp one of the most basic facts about 4GW , namely that the splintering of factions makes it more difficult to generate a state .
Should we have the bad luck to " win " this latest fight and destroy the Mahdi Army , we will move not toward but further away from that goal .
In the end , the Administration ’s ( and the Pentagon ’s ) insistence that the Iraqi state , government , army and police are real blinds only themselves .
Iraqis know they are not .
The American public knows they are not .
The average Hottentot probably knows they are not .
Do the members of the Senate Committees on Armed Services and Foreign Relations know less that the average Hottentot ?
So last week ’s hearings might suggest , and such is the power of empty words .

Witness : Rezko said ' Fitzgerald would be eliminated ' Associated Press
Published : Monday April 28 , 2008
|
Print This Email This CHICAGO -- A government witness testified Monday that political fundraiser Antoin " Tony " Rezko told him three years ago that Chicago 's chief federal prosecutor was to be fired and replaced by someone chosen by then - U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert .
Restaurant owner Elie Maloof quoted Rezko as saying the new U.S. attorney in Chicago , whom Rezko said would be chosen by Hastert , would then kill a federal investigation into corruption under Gov. Rod Blagojevich .
" The federal prosecutor would no longer be the federal prosecutor , Patrick Fitzgerald would be eliminated , " Maloof told Rezko 's fraud trial .
Prosecutors said last week that former Illinois Finance Authority executive director Ali Ata , who is to take the witness stand later in the trial , would testify that Rezko told him of a plan to replace Fitzgerald .
Prosecutors told U.S. District Judge Amy J. St. Eve that Ata would say he had a talk with Rezko about such efforts on the part of Springfield lobbyist Robert Kjellander and former presidential adviser Karl Rove .
Kjellander denied he had ever discussed such a thing and Rove 's lawyer , Robert Luskin , said his client had no memory of such discussions .
Maloof 's testimony Monday was the first time Hastert 's name had come up in testimony .
" The conversation was that Mr. Hastert would name a new U.S. attorney , " Maloof said .
" What would be the effect of having a new U.S. attorney on the investigation ? "
Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Niewoehner asked .
" They would order the prosecutor to drop the investigation , " said Maloof , who was not asked to elaborate on who " they " were .
A message seeking comment was left Monday at Hastert 's office .
Republicans in Washington could presumably be persuaded to spike an investigation into Democrat Blagojevich because Rezko raised money for the GOP too and is accused of scheming with Republican heavyweight Stuart Levine , who has pleaded guilty in the case and testified against Rezko .
Kjellander , former treasurer of the Republican National Committee , received $ 809,000 in consulting fees for Blagojevich 's 2003 sale of state bonds , much of which prosecutors believe was funneled through a Rezko associate to Rezko " assignees . "
Kjellander has not been charged with wrongdoing .
Rezko , 52 , is charged with scheming to split a $ 1.5 million bribe from a contractor who wanted state permission to build a hospital in the McHenry County suburb of Crystal Lake and pressure kickbacks out of money management firms seeking to do business with a state pension fund .
Prosecutors say Rezko's fundraising for Blagojevich made him highly influential in the administration and as a result he could manipulate the state boards that decide on hospital construction and allocate money from the pension fund to investment firms .
U.S. attorneys are nominated by the president but traditionally are chosen by the senior senator of the president 's party .
Fitzgerald was the candidate of Sen. Peter Fitzgerald , R - Ill. , no relation , who said openly that he wanted someone from out of state who would be independent and attack the corruption long plaguing Illinois .
Since taking over as U.S. attorney in September 2001 , Patrick Fitzgerald has launched a vigorous attack on corruption , sending former Gov. George Ryan and a number of other political insiders to federal prison .
Peter Fitzgerald and Hastert , while both Republicans , often were at odds with each other .
It would not be unusual to allow a senior congressman to suggest a candidate for U.S. attorney if there were no senator of the president 's party from the state .
Maloof , a former employee of a Rezko pizza business , testified under a grant of immunity from prosecution for anything he might say on the stand .
Among other things , he testified that Rezko told him to say as little as possible when called before a federal grand jury investigating corruption in the Blagojevich administration .
And he said Rezko told him anything he might say about Rezko himself would " tie back to Blagojevich . "
The governor has not been charged with any wrongdoing in the case .
Siberian Tigers are known for there mellow and fair tempered demeanor .
Compared to other species of tigers , the Siberian Tiger has a larger mane , furrier paws and generally more white and less striping in their coats .
These incredible cats can weigh anywhere from 100 to 350 kg and are slightly taller than their popular Bengal Tiger cousins .
Amur Tiger also known as the Siberian Tiger :
With approximately 400 to 500 of these incredible cats left , the Amur Tiger 's days are numbered .
The cat lives throughout China , the Korean Peninsula , South Eastern Russia and North Eastern Mongolia .
Many of these cats are literally months from being extinct .
You can do your part by donating to the World Conservation Union .
Unless something is done soon , most of these cats wo n't be around too much longer .
Limited efforts are being taken to try and save most of these cats .
The main issue unfortunately is that with so few of these cats left , the incidence of inbreeding is much higher which can cause it's own problems like genetic disorders , reduced fertility , higher infant mortality , reduced effectiveness of immune system , lower birth rate and so on .
Asiatic lion :
With approximately 350 of these cats left , time is running out for this sub species of the Lion .
The Asiatic Lion only exists in a small forest in the state of Gujarat , India .
The Asiatic Lion ranges anywhere from 145 to 250 kgs in weight .
Compared to their African cousins , they have slightly shaggier coats .
The main reason for the decline of the Asiatic Lion is due to a loss of natural living habitat .
Sumatran Tiger :
This cat used to be found in the Indonesia and the island of Sumatra .
Estimates place this cat 's population at approximately 350 to 500 left .
These cats weigh in at anywhere from 200 lbs to 300 lbs .
A decline in living habitat has contributed to this cat 's decline .
The Sumatran Tiger is the smallest of all sub-species of cats .
Iberian Lynx : Found primarily in Spain and Southern Europe , there are believed to be only 100 to 300 of these cats left .
These cats weigh 12 to 26 kgs in size .
The main reason for this cat 's decline was because of hunting .
The Iberian Lynx is now a protected species .
Unfortunately , it may be too late .
North African Leopard : This large cat lives in Eastern Africa and South West Asia .
According to some reports , there be as many as 250 examples of the North African Leopard left .
I could n't find any accurate weight estimates for this cat but it would appear that they can weight as much as 200 lbs .
The cat prefers to live in lowland forests and heavily wooded areas .
Florida Panther :
The number of living Florida Panthers are estimated at around 60 to 100 .
This species of panther can be found primarily in palm forests and swamps in Southern Florida .
The cats range in size from 125 to 140 lbs .
With Southern Florida being a fast developing area , there is a rapidly declining area for this panther to live in .
Asiatic Cheetah also known as the Iranian / Indian Cheetah :
This cat is very close to extinction with only 50 to 100 known to exist in the world .
The cat is rumored to be extinct from India and there are still examples of this cat in Northern Iran .
This cat ranges in size from 39 to 65 kgs in weight .
Factors that threaten this cat are a decline in prey , hunting and the rapid reduction of this cat 's natural habitat .
Arabian Leopard :
This species of Leopard lives in the high mountains of Arabia .
Due to their hunting style , the cats tend to be widely distributed over vast amounts of land .
According to most experts , there may be as little as 50 to 100 of these cats left in the world .
The Arabian Leopard generally range in size from 18 kg to 30 kg in weight .
This cat is endangered by trophy hunters looking to capture their rare coat .
To this day , they are still hunted for their coats and killed by people protecting their livestock .
Eastern Cougar also known as the North American Cougar :
There are no accurate population figures for this cat that I could find .
From what I can tell , there are approximately 50 of these cats left .
It is believed that this cat primarily resides in the Appalachian Mountain regions .
The Eastern Cougar can weigh as much as 140 pounds once fully grown .
The Eastern Cougar is a solitary animal which makes it harder to judge how many are left .
South China Tiger :
With as little as 30 of these cats left , the South China Tiger has been listed as one of the world 's 10 most endangered species .
This cat use to be found in South and South Central China .
Poaching , destruction of it's prey and declining living habitat have all contributed to this cat 's rapidly declining population .
The South China Tiger can weight as much as 240 lbs to 330 lbs .
Amur Leopard : Depending on who you talk to , there are anywhere from 25 to 50 of these beautiful cats left .
This species of cat is commonly referred to as the Siberian Tiger and Far East Leopard .
You can usually find this cat in the Southeastern Russia , North Korea and North East China .
Amur Leopards weigh between 32 - 75 kg so they can be a fairly large cat .
The main reason for this cat 's critical status are poachers and loss of habitat .
In April of last year , a female Amur Leopard was shot leaving only six known females left in the wild .
Anatolian Leopard :
The last verified sighting of this cat was in 1974 .
Since then , there have been several unverified sightings of this beautiful cat .
It 's generally accepted that this cat only lives in Turkey 's Mediterranean Region and on the Eastern Black Sear region .
More specifically , many observers believe that the remaining species of this cat are mostly found in the Kackar Mountains of the North Eastern region of Turkey .
Size estimations vary but generally speaking , the cat grows up to 200 to 250 centimeters in length and approximately 90 kg in weight .
The near extinction of this cat can be mostly attributed to trophy hunting in Turkey 's Mediterranean Region .
Unfortunately there are no recognized population figures for this cat but many believe that there are probably as little as none to as high as 15 members of this cat left in the world .

" These pictures were circulated like trophies , " Mr. Delgado said .
Some were posted in command headquarters .
He said it seemed to him that the shooting of the prisoners and the circulation of the photos were viewed by enlisted personnel and at least some officers as acceptable -- even admirable -- behavior .
Mr. Delgado said that when his unit was first assigned to Abu Ghraib , he believed , like most of his fellow soldiers , that the prisoners were among the most dangerous individuals in Iraq .
He said : " Most of the guys thought , ' Well , they 're out to kill us .
These are the ones killing our buddies . " '
But while at work in a headquarters office , he said , he learned that most of the detainees at Abu Ghraib had committed only very minor nonviolent offenses , or no offenses at all .
( Several investigations would subsequently reveal that vast numbers of completely innocent Iraqis were seized and detained by coalition forces . )
Several months ago Mr. Delgado gave a talk and presented a slide show at his school , New College of Florida in Sarasota .
To his amazement , 400 people showed up .
He has given a number of talks since then in various parts of the country .
His goal , he said , is to convince his listeners that the abuse of innocent Iraqis by the American military is not limited to " a few bad apples , " as the military would like the public to believe .
" At what point , " he asked , " does a series of ' isolated incidents ' become a pattern of intolerable behavior ? "
Two years after Google Inc. began a big push in China , Baidu.com Inc. continues to dominate the country 's Internet search market , thanks in significant part to a controversial and legally risky offering : searches for free , unlicensed music downloads .
Now , Google is preparing a counterstrike , according to people close to the situation .
The U.S. search giant is in the late planning stages of a joint venture with a Chinese online music company that would permit it to provide free -- licensed -- music downloads in China .
The service , which is likely to offer access to tunes from three global music companies as well as dozens of smaller players , could start in the next several weeks barring any last - minute hiccups .
The music pact marks a turning point in Google 's battle with Baidu to gain dominance in an Internet market that is soon expected to surpass the U.S. this year in number of users .
Baidu has proved a brash adversary for the much larger Google , leveraging its status as hometown champion in China to beat the U.S. Internet giant at its own game .
From the start , Baidu has boasted that its knowledge of China and the Chinese language would give it a natural advantage over foreign rivals .
" We 've been the No. 1 Web site in China for a number of years , and in fact we are the largest Web site outside of the U.S. , " says Robin Li , Baidu 's co-founder and chief executive .
" When people get to know about the Internet , the first Web site they learn is about Baidu in China . "

Editor 's Note :
In our Behind the Scenes series , CNN correspondents share their experiences covering news and analyze the stories behind events .
Dan Rivers , CNN's Bangkok , Thailand , correspondent , writes about an unforgettable encounter with a boy in Thailand .
( CNN ) -- He does n't know how old he is , but he thinks he 's 7 .
His name is Khin Zaw Lin .
He 's lived in a garbage dump virtually his entire life .
Khin Zaw Lin lives in a Thai garbage dump with only his adopted mother and his toy gun to protect him .
I find Lin walking in a festering landscape of rotting food , plastic bags and junk at the Mae Sot garbage dump in Thailand near the Thai - Myanmar border .
His parents are long gone .
His home is a makeshift shelter made from salvaged bags , cloth and wood .
Lin is one of about 300 refugees in the dump who survive on other people 's trash .
Many are children .
Some are women with babies .
Their daily routine follows the same pattern :
They mill about the dump , waiting for the next truck to arrive , hoping for enough discarded food to get them through the day .
Lin pokes through the rubbish with a machete .
He says he collects bottles and plastic for three cents a sack .
He shows me his feet , which were filthy and ribbed with cuts .
He tells me through an interpreter that he can't afford shoes .
He walks barefoot through the treacherous landscape .
My assistant told me about Lin's home while he was researching another story on the border area in Myanmar , the country once known as Burma .
I found it hard to believe at first , but I was curious .
I persuaded my camera crew to make the six - hour drive from Bangkok .
When we arrive at the dump , people are afraid of us .
We 'd been told there are orphans living at the dump , but people are wary .
They think we are there to take away the orphans or ask for bribes .
I tell them I want to help , and I am eventually directed to Lin .
He greets me with a soft , hoarse voice .
But he 's all energy and purpose when he resumes plucking bottles from the mountain of trash .
A recycling firm offers the closest thing to steady employment for Lin and his family .
It buys what bottles and plastics Lin and others salvage .
Lin gives the money to his adopted mother .
She tells me that Lin 's biological mother gave him to her in Myanmar when he was a baby because she could n't cope with the responsibility .
Life under the military junta in Myanmar can be brutal .
The country 's economy is collapsing , and torture and rape under the country 's military regime is commonplace .
Lin's new mother decided to flee to Thailand in search of a better life .
She found a garbage dump instead .
Still , she says scavenging for food in the dump is actually an improvement on her previous life .
As I listen to Lin 's story , a question keeps going through my mind :
How can a 7 - year - old spend his entire childhood in this squalor ?
Watch as Lin and others root through the dump »
Perhaps it 's because Lin is invisible -- he does n't have a passport or papers .
He is part of special group of refugees from Myanmar that do n't officially exist .
The United Nations established refugee camps in Thailand for those who flee Myanmar , but the camps are reserved only for victims of political persecution .
Refugees fear if they enter a refugee camp , they 'll be classified as migrant workers and deported .
As a result , these refugees are trapped in the garbage dump -- not enough money to go elsewhere and no prospects back home .
I thought I had become accustomed to the grinding poverty I had encountered in parts of Asia .
I 've met my fair share of children who are denied the luxury of hope .
But Lin 's story angers me .
I feel close to losing all objectivity .
Near the end of my meeting with Lin , I ask his adopted mother if she , and Lin , would ever escape the rubbish dump .
Her answer is as hard as the world she and Lin inhabit .

All About Thailand • Myanmar
Look , the whole ducking evidence of what seemed politically expedient back in the day on NAFTA is n't a big deal , really , although it would make sense for Senator Clinton to simply say she changed her mind rather than live in fear of the flip - flop label it might earn her .
And the taxes ?
Well , she 's busy .
I get it .
She 's the campaigner .
Never mind that there are pictures of Bill with Jeremiah Wright , or both of them with Rezko , I get it , politicians are often sought out by guys like Rezko , and for years everybody thought Wright was a patriotic , Christian ex-Marine , after all .
Hell , most still do once they hear his comments in context .
( Quick links to the " America 's chickens are coming home to roost " story and the use of " Nigger " in comparing Clinton and Obama 's background - which pretty much silence all but the most pig - headed of critics . )
But this depraved line she held to about the risks in Bosnia ?
Is that what we want on Day One in the Oval Office ?
Is the pre-requisite for a Commander In Chief handling calls at 3 a.m. the willingness to lie for personal aggrandizement and political points ?
Seriously - do we take our daughters into life - threatening situations ?
Watch the harrowing arrival in Bosnia , then you make the call .
How did all those reporters miss the sniper fire ?
Somebody here has just made a serious career - limiting mistake .
The Fed chairman is to make a rate announcement later
The US economy grew at an annual pace of 0.6 % in the first three months of 2008 , slightly faster than expected .
The US Commerce Department figures exceeded analyst expectations of an annualised growth rate of 0.2 % and eased fears of a recession .
However , there were some worrying signs and consumer spending , a key driver of growth , rose by just 1 % in the quarter .
The US central bank is widely expected to cut interest rates to 2 % from 2.25 % later on Wednesday .
Analysts said that there may be more rate cuts later this year should the rate of economic growth and consumer spending not pick up .
The 0.6 % growth in the first quarter was a smidgen better than the 0.58 % growth rate seen in the last three months of 2007 .
Consumer weakness Capital Economics said that the figures would " no doubt prompt plenty of speculation that the economy will narrowly avoid a recession " .
" We see very little reason for optimism , however .
There are some very troubling signs in this report . "
Consumer spending , which accounts for two - thirds of economic activity , grew at the weakest rate since the second quarter of 2001 , the Commerce Department report showed .
The strength is slightly misleading
Stephen Malyon , Scotia Capital
Can the US economy be revived ?
It rose 1 % after growing 2.3 % in the fourth quarter .
" The outlook on the consumer side is still cloudy .
There is no assurance that consumer spending is even steady , " said Pierre Ellis , senior global economist at Decision Economics .
Spending on residential construction fell 26.7 % , indicating the extent of the slowdown in the American housing sector .
High inventories also masked the true picture , other analysts said .
Stephen Malyon , senior currency strategist at Scotia Capital , said the GDP figures were a bit stronger than market expectations " but the strength is slightly misleading as inventories has accounted for 0.8 % of the rise " .
" Final domestic demand actually fell 0.4 % underscoring the deterioration in the US economy , " he added .
A separate report by ADP Employer Services showed that private sector employers added 10,000 jobs in April , slightly higher than expected .
Analysts say the central bank is still likely to announce a rate cut later .

What are these ?
Stanford professor Larry Lessig brought down the house at a net neutrality hearing Thursday , calling for the Federal Communications Commission to finally move to make sure that the internet 's architecture remain open and neutral , with the goal of having the internet become as uncomplicated as the electrical grid .
With his standard flair for stunning PowerPoint presentations , Lessig made the case that an open internet made possible the massive economic gains of the 1990s and that network operators who want to change the internet in order to create fast and slow lanes need to prove that such a ' smart ' network would actually be better than an internet where the intelligence lies at the edges .
" We are facing these problems because of a failure of FCC policy , " Lessig said , as the FCC 's five commissioners sat behind him in a Stanford auditorium .
" The FCC failed to make it clear to the network owners that if they are building the internet they need to build it neutrally . "
" The burden should be on those who would change its architecture , " Lessig continued .
Lessig hypothesized an electricity grid that would query whether a device plugged in was made by Sony or Toshiba , or was approved , saying that such a network could be built , but one would need very strong arguments to convince the world to change .
That should be the same with the internet , he argued .
Lessig derided carriers ' arguments that they need new business models in order to justify the costs of laying out new networks , referring to " coin- operated experts that populate Washington these days . "
" We should have a Missouri attitude , a show - me attitude , that competition will continue , " Lessig said .
Lessig 's message was oddly echoed by the Christian Coalition of America 's Michele Combs , who correctly pointed out that Comcast 's ongoing interruption of BitTorrent programs uses one of the same techniques the Chinese government uses to censor the internet in China — fake reset packets .
" We have seen network operators block political speech and block the most popular application on the internet – Comcast blocked people downloading the King James bible , " Combs said , referring presumably in the first case to Verizon blocking pro-choice SMS messages and in the second case to an AP story that tested out whether Comcast was interfering with BitTorrent by attempting to download a public - domain translation of the Bible .
FCC Chairman Martin noted at the opening of the scheduled seven - hour public hearing that Comcast , AT&T and Time Warner were all invited to speak , but declined to participate .
Their sole defender on the first panel was George Ou , a former network engineer and until recently , a ZDNet writer .
Ou cited traffic figures from Japan that showed that a small minority of users in Japan sucked up nearly half of the available bandwidth and argued that network traffic management has long been integral to intranets and the internet .
FCC commissioner Deborah Taylor
Tate warned against federal rules that would limit ISPs ' efforts to identify downloaded child pornography .
" Child pornography is a multi-billion dollar segment of our economy , " Tate said , without referencing her source for the statistic .
" I want to make sure that as we discuss these issues we do n't end up with unintended consequences of regulatory actions . "
She noted that ISPs spent $ 15 billion in 2007 adding capacity .
" We must remain vigilant against intrusive government action that could disrupt the process of this broadband deployment , " Tate said , though the crowd rewarded her remarks with boos when she finished .
The entertainment industry weighed in as well , with a representative of the Songwriter 's Guild calling for technology to prevent unauthorized music sharing on the internet .
Jean Prewitt , the president of the Independent Film & Television Alliance , called for non-discrimination policies as a way to let artists not aligned with major studios to find an audience and innovate .
" We need to take proactive measures so that internet does not become the closed bastion that television has become , " Prewitt said to cheers .
But perhaps the hero of the day for the audience was software engineer Robb Topolski , who first posted forensic proof of Comcast 's use of fake packets to throttle BitTorrent usage .
Topolski said he was trying to use file sharing software to distribute old recordings of barbershop quartet music he 's gotten off of old wax cylinders – material that would clearly no longer be copyrighted .
He reported his findings to the popular DSLreports.com site , and then it quickly became news in the blogs and mainstream press sites .
He also disputes Comcast 's defense that it only messes with BitTorrent when the network is congested , saying he recently suffered from insomnia and noticed that Comcast was blocking P2P protocols at 1:45 a.m. in the morning .
" I see this pretty simply as an example of jamming of authorized communications , " Topolski said , comparing the FCC 's failure to force Comcast to stop the practice to the speed with which it moves when a ham radio operator reports radio interference .
" The situation continues today , " Topolski said .
" It is happening right now . "
The hearing is continuing , and is likely to get heated when members of the public take to the microphone later this afternoon .

Just in case you might think that the curbing of free enterprise and individual rights is something new in American history , someone just sent me a headline from the New York Times dated May 30 , 1918 .
" Navy Man Indicted for Food Hoarding . "
It reads as follows :
Indictments were returned by a Federal Grand Jury here today against Medical Director Francis Smith Nash , USN and his wife , Caroline Nash , charging them with violation of Section 6 of the Food Control act in having large quantities of flour , sugar , and other foodstuffs in their possession , to the value of $ 1,923.36 .
In a statement issue by the Food Administration it was alleged that the food hoarded was sufficient to maintain the family for more than a year and hence far in excess of the requirements of thirty days , the period recognized by Food Administrator Hoover as a ' reasonable one ' for residents of cities .
Yes , right here in the good ol ' USA , 90 years ago .
And what about this Hoover ?
Is this Herbert ?
Yes , the very one that Murray Rothbard long emphasized was no free market president but central planner from way back .
Wikipedia notes : " President Woodrow Wilson appointed Hoover head of the American Food Administration , with headquarters in Washington , D.C. Hoover believed that , ' food will win the war . '
He established days to encourage people to not eat certain foods in order to save them for the soldiers : meatless Mondays , wheatless Wednesdays , and ' when in doubt , eat potatoes . ' "
The violation of liberty in this period also figures into the great novel by Garet Garrett called Satan 's Bushel .
As for rationing of goods ( oil ? ) , do n't think it can't happen here .
It can and has .

Want to know one reason that I hate the US - India nuclear deal ?
The House Committee on Foreign Affairs asked 40 questions about the US - India Nuclear Deal , to which the State Department provided unclassified answers that it refuses to release to the public .
Daryl Kimball and Sharon Squassoni , now joined by Fred McGoldrick and Henry Sokolski , have been asking the State Department to drop what described as a “ gag order ” and release the responses .
That would be offensive enough , of course , but the story got more irritating today .
Physicians for Social Responsibility and the Union of Concerned Scientists organized a panel for the 27 EU Political Counselors at the Embassy of Slovenia tomorrow with speakers from the State Department to discuss the US - India nuclear deal and the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership .
( See the full text of the invite that went out last week , below ) .
The State Department has now uninvited PSR and UCS to their own meeting — or at least the portion about India — because they will be sharing “ sensitive ” information .
I ’d really like to know what sort of “ sensitive ” information can be shared with 27 foreign nationals , but not US citizens .
Security firm Panda Labs has released ( PDF ) its malware report for the first quarter 2008 .
The report covers a number of topics and makes predictions about the types of attacks we may see in the future .
Forecasting these trends is always tricky — no one expected the Storm Worm to explode when it did — but Panda 's prediction that we may see a rise in boot sector viruses is rather surprising .
We 'll touch on malware first , however , and return to this topic shortly .
Thus far , adware , trojans , and miscellaneous " other " malware including dialers , viruses , and hacking tools have captured the lion 's share of the " market " as it were .
These three categories account for 80.55 percent of the malware Panda Labs detected over the first quarter .
Password - stealing trojans are still a growing market , and the report cautions users , as always , to be careful of their banking records ... and their World of WarCraft / Lineage II passwords .
It might be interesting to take a poll of hardcore World of WarCraft players and see which of these two categories they care more about protecting , but the results would likely make a parent weep .
One can always make more money , after all , but raiding Sunwell Plateau is serious business .
From here , Panda Labs trots through familiar territory .
The monetization of the malware market , the prevalence of JavaScript / IFrame attack vectors , and the growing number of prepackaged virus - building kits are all issues that the report raises .
We 've covered all of these before , but if you 've not been paying attention and want to catch up on general malware trends , the report is a good place to do it .
Also , just in case you missed it , social engineering - based attacks are both dangerous and effective , and social networks , particularly those based around Web 2.0 , are often tempting attack targets .
Data source : Panda Labs
Panda 's report does raise a new concern , though it comes from a surprising direction .
According to the company , boot sector viruses loaded with rootkits are poised to make a comeback .
This honestly sounds a bit odd , considering how long it has been since a boot virus has topped the malware charts , but it's at least theoretically possible .
Such viruses have a simple method of operation .
The virus copies itself into the Master Boot Record ( MBR ) of a hard drive , and rewrites the actual MBR data in a different section of the drive .
Once a rootkit is loaded into the MBR , it can use its position to obfuscate its own activity .
This is obviously rather handy when attempting to hide from rootkit - detection software , and could cause a new set of headaches for antivirus software if the threat actually materializes .
Panda Lab 's report does a good job of explaining what a boot virus is and how it can infect a system , but it says virtually nothing about why such attack vectors are a concern today .
The problem with boot viruses is that their attack vector is fairly well - guarded .
Any antivirus program worth beans will detect a suspicious attempt to modify the MBR and will alert the end user accordingly .
Running as a user rather than an administrator should also prevent such modification even if you do n't have an antivirus scanner installed .
Panda implies that this kind of exploit could be an issue in Linux , and I suppose that 's theoretically possible , but Linux always creates a user account without root access by default .
Windows Vista , for its part , recommends that you run in user mode , even though the OS does n't require it .
Even in admin mode , a virus can't just get away with this type of modification , and UAC would pick up and flag any attempt to overwrite the MBR .
Even if none of these barriers existed , there 's still the issue of BIOS - enabled boot sector protection , which exists entirely to prevent this type of attack from occurring .
If you want to catch a boot sector virus , in other words , you 'll have to work at it .
Aside from the company 's surprising conclusion regarding boot viruses , Panda Lab 's report paints the picture of illegal businesses doing business as usual .
In a way , this is actually a good thing .
AV companies currently have their collective hands full dealing with the number of variants that are still spinning off the attacks and infections from last year , and the last thing the industry needs is for the Son of Storm to make an appearance .
CIA has 7,000 documents relating to rendition , detention , torture programs , filing shows RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday April 23 , 2008

Print This Email This Documents suggest CIA stonewalled Congress The Central Intelligence Agency has acknowledged having 7,000 pages of documents pertaining to President George W. Bush 's secret rendition and detention programs , according to three international human rights groups .
Amnesty International USA , the Center for Constitutional Rights and the International Human Rights Clinic at NYU School of Law made the claim following a summary judgment motion by the agency this week to avoid a lawsuit that seeks to force the nation 's top spy outfit to make the documents public under a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit .
" Among other assertions , the CIA claimed that it did not have to release the documents because many consist of correspondence with the White House or top Bush administration officials , or because they are between parties seeking legal advice on the programs , including guidance on the legality of certain interrogation procedures , " the groups wrote in a release .
" The CIA confirmed that it requested and received legal advice from attorneys at the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel concerning these procedures . "
 For the first time , the CIA has acknowledged that extensive records exist relating to its use of enforced disappearances and secret prisons ,  Curt Goering , AIUSA senior deputy executive director , said in a statement .
 Given what we already know about documents written by Bush administration officials trying to justify torture and other human rights crimes , one does not need a fertile imagination to conclude that the real reason for refusing to disclose these documents has more to do with avoiding disclosure of criminal activity than national security .
RAW STORY was the first news outlet to identify the exact location of one of the sites in the CIA 's secret prison network , which was revealed first by the Washington Post .
Raw Story identified a prison in northeastern Poland , Stare Kiejkuty , that was used as a transit point for terror suspects .
Once a Soviet - era compound once used by German intelligence in World War II , Stare Kiejkuty is best known as having been the only Russian intelligence training school to operate outside the Soviet Union .
Its prominence in the Soviet era suggests that it may have been the facility first identified  but never named  when the Washington Posts Dana Priest revealed the existence of the CIAs secret prison network in November 2005 .
The groups say that they 're not the only ones being stonewalled .
Congress , they say , is getting the short end of the stick as well .
" Documents released to plaintiffs by the CIA demonstrate that many within the government itself have been unable to obtain accurate information from the CIA , " the groups said .
" These documents , which include letters from Members of Congress to the CIA , demonstrate a pattern of withholding information from Congress .
In a pointed bipartisan letter on Oct. 16 , 2003 , then - Chair and Ranking Member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence requested that CIA Director George Tenet provide senior level briefings on the treatment of , and information obtained by , three men known to be held in secret CIA detention , admonishing the CIA by stating that the committee was ' frustrated with the quality of the information ' provided in past briefings . "
Additional elements of the release , issued jointly by the three human rights groups , follows .
The documents in the lawsuit can be viewed here .
The CIAs admission that it possesses at least 7000 documents relating to rendition , secret detention and torture generated renewed calls by the human rights groups for transparency and accountability from the government .
 The Freedom of Information Act is one of the major checks on government criminality in this country ,  said CCR Executive Director Vincent Warren .
 The CIA has acknowledged that it has well over 7000 documents that relate to the torture and disappearance of men .
These include some of our clients , like Majid Khan , who were known to be in the program .
The public needs to know what crimes were committed in our name and how they were justified .
This has been the most secretive , least transparent administration in history , and it is well past time for accountability . 
AIUSA , CCR , and NYU IHRC have filed FOIA requests with several U.S. government agencies , including the CIA .
These FOIA requests sought information about individuals who are or have been held by the U.S. government or detained with U.S. involvement , and about whom there is no public record .
The requests also sought information about the governments legal justifications for its secret detention and extraordinary rendition program .
Comprehensive information about the identities and locations of prisoners in CIA custody as well as the conditions of their detention and the specific interrogation methods used against them has never been publicly revealed .
This lack of transparency continues to prevent scrutiny by the public or the courts and leaves detainees vulnerable to abuse and torture .
Although the CIA did release a paltry number of documents in response to the FOIA request , most were already in the public domain , such as newspaper articles and a single copy of the Fourth Geneva Convention which governs the treatment of civilians in times of war .
The limited relevant documents that were released were documents pertaining to briefings demanded by the House and Senate Intelligence Committees regarding various aspects of the overseas detention and interrogation program .
....
The CIA appears to have avoided answering detailed requests for specific information , responding instead with form letters and references to briefings .
These practices led to a forceful letter from Senator Carl Levin , Current Chairman of the Senate Committee on Armed Services , ( then the Ranking Member ) who was attempting to investigate CIA involvement in detainee deaths .
In a letter dated Oct. 24 , 2005 , Senator Levin noted that [t ] he lack of CIA cooperation with the investigations to date has left significant omissions in the record .
The CIAs failure to cooperate with members of Congress demonstrates the need for public scrutiny of the secret detention and extraordinary rendition program under FOIA .
 The CIA has employed illegal techniques such as torture , enforced disappearances , and extraordinary rendition ,  said Meg Satterthwaite , Director of the NYU IHRC .
 It can not use FOIA exemptions as a shield to hide its violations of U.S. and international law . 
In its legal filings , the CIA acknowledged that this program will continue .
Some prisoners have been transferred to prisons in other countries for proxy detention where they face the risk of torture and where they continue to be held secretly , without charge or trial .
Human rights reports indicate that the fate and whereabouts of at least 30 people believed to have been held in secret U.S. custody remain unknown .
In September 2006 , President Bush publicly acknowledged the existence of CIA - operated secret prisons .
At the same time , 14 detainees from these facilities were transferred to Guantánamo and several more have arrived since .
The administration has admitted to using so - called alternative interrogation procedures  on those held in the CIA program , including waterboarding .
The international community and the United States , in other contexts , have unequivocally deemed these techniques torture .
CHICAGO ( MarketWatch ) --
Luxury home builder Toll Brothers said Wednesday that the housing market remains weak in most areas , and Chief Executive Robert Toll said , given current poor traffic through subdivisions and a dearth of deposits on new sales , " we are not yet seeing much light at the end of the tunnel . "
Read the full story .
It 's not just that it is winter and home building hits a big seasonal slump this time of year , regardless of market conditions .
The problem for Toll Brothers TOL , - 4.51 % and all the other home builders is that the first signs of recovery in the housing market are n't going to be spotted in their industry .
For the most part , folks who buy newly constructed single - family houses are move - up buyers who already own a house and are looking to buy a bigger and better model , either because their family has grown and they need it or because their income has increased and they feel they deserve it .
But if buyers cannot sell the home they are in , they wo n't be building the homes of their dreams .
With the existing - home market slumping in many parts of the country , sellers have little guarantee they can unload their current house at a price that will let them afford their move - up accommodations -- if they can sell at all .
That 's one of the reasons why home builders are seeing so many cancellations :
New - home buyers who signed contracts expecting to trade in their existing homes are forced to back out when their listings languish .
Catering to first - time buyers is not a great alternative under current conditions , either , because tight mortgage underwriting standards have made it much more difficult to get into a house with little down payment or with a credit history that has even a smidge of trouble .
Where will the harbingers of a housing rebound first surface ?
In the existing - home market .
Until we see those sales start to creep up and , more importantly , the inventory of houses on the market declines , we 're not likely to see any significant upturn in new construction .
Watch prices , too .
They will have to show some stability before buyers will venture in force into either the existing - home or new - home market .
The fact that home builders have to cut prices to move inventory has an especially dampening effect on new - home sales , where buyers are loath to purchase a house in a subdivision where the builder may be offering big discounts on the same model a month or two -- and just a street or two -- down the road .
The thing is , right now , if you look down any other housing tunnel than the one the home builders are staring at , you still can't find a light .
None of the train wrecks has been cleared .

Mike Linksvayer , the CTO of Creative Commons , runs the numbers of Nine Inch Nails 's Creative Commons download experiment and discovers that it only took the band two days to exceed the typical net from a massive - selling traditional CD release .
The band sold $ 750,000 worth of " limited edition deluxe sets , " plus an unknowable further sum from sales of the regular CDs and merch .
The $ 300 " ultra deluxe edition " of Nine Inch Nails ' Ghosts I - IV , limited to 2500 copies , sold out in a couple days ( I believe released Sunday , no longer available this morning ) .
There are some manufacturing costs , but they do n't appear to be using any precious materials .
So if an artist typically makes $ 1.60 on a $ 15.99 CD sale , profit from sales of the limited edition already matches profit from a CD selling hundreds of thousands of copies .
Then there are non-limited sales of a $ 75 merely " deluxe edition " , $ 10 CD , and $ 5 download , and whatever other products NIN comes up with around Ghosts .

When does a quantum measurement end ?
Surprisingly , quantum physicists cannot agree .
Some say the measurement ends when you register a result on a piece of classical equipment such as a photomultiplier .
Others says the measurement ends when the information in the quantum system has irreversibly leaked into the environment .
There are still more who believe in the manyworlds interpretation of quantum mechanics and say a quantum measurement never ends but exists ad infinitum in several parallel universes .
This may sound like an ineffectual academic scrap but it actually has hugely important consequences for the quantum property of entanglement .
Entanglement is the state in which two physically separated particles share the same quantum existence , so that a measurement on one instantaneously affects the other .
Yep , that ’s instantaneously .
It ’s what Einstein described as “ spooky action at distance ” .
For some years , physicists have been measuring this “ spooky action at a distance ” in tests known as Bell experiments .
These tests depend crucially on the measurement ending quickly .
Because if it were to drag on , the particles might be able to communicate at light speed by some currently unknown mechanism .
But because nobody has actually determined when a measurement ends , all the experiments to date are potentially open to this loophole .
Perhaps there is no spooky action at a distance after all , just long quantum measurements during which the particles communicate at the speed of light in some quite ordinary way .
Now Nicolas Gisin and colleagues at the University of Geneva have closed this loophole using the ideas of the Oxford theorist Roger Penrose .
A few years ago , he suggested that the end of a quantum measurement is realted to the gravitational energy of the mass distribution of the resulting quantum superposition .
In other words , the measurement ends when a massive object receives a decent kick .
So Gisin and buddies set up a Bell experiment which involved sending entangled photons in each direction from the midpoint of an 18 km fibre .
At the ends of the fibre were piezoelectric actuators attached to small but massive mirrors .
When the photons hit , they triggered the actuators causing the mirrors to move and deflect a beam of light .
The experiment was carefully set up so that the mirrors were heavy enough to please Penrose and far enough apart that no light speed signal could travel between them in the time it took for a pair of entangled photons to “ kick ” them .
The result ?
Gisin ’s team confirmed that “ spooky action at a distance ” still governs the behaviour of the entangled photons .
If you believe Penrose , this is the first experiment to ever prove “ spooky action at a distance ” .
Impressive , huh ?
More interesting , is the idea of gravity and quantum mechanics coming under the microscope in the same experiment for the first time .
It wo n’t be the last .
There are plenty of other mysteries about gravity that quantum mechanics can probe .
It ’s about time physicists bit the bullet and started testing them .

WHY GEOCENTRICITY ?
Gerardus D. Bouw , Ph.D.
To hear tell , geocentrism , the ancient doctrine that the earth is fixed motionless at the center of the universe , died over four centuries ago .
At that time Nicolaus Copernicus ( picture below ) , a Polish canon who dabbled in astrology , claimed that the sun and not the earth was at the center of the universe .
His idea is known as heliocentrism .
It took a hundred years for heliocentrism to become the dominant opinion , and it did so with a complete lack of evidence in its favor .
Yet the victory of heliocentrism has been less than total .
Over the years geocentrism has had its spokesmen .
Among scientists who adhered to the centrality of the earth were three generations of Cassinis : a family of astronomers who dominated French astronomy from the late seventeenth to the early nineteenth centuries .
Astronomers , pastors , and educators in the Missouri Synod of the Lutheran Church maintained the geocentric truths well into the twentieth century .
They , with the reformers such as Luther , saw that the embracing of heliocentrism would weaken not only science , but also the authority of the Bible .
The second of these two concerns : how the Bible 's authority is weakened by heliocentrism ; stems from the firm manner in which the Bible teaches geocentricity .
Geocentric verses range from those with only a positional import , such as references to " up " and " down ; " through the question of just what the earth was " orbiting " the first three days while it awaited the creation of the sun ; to overt references such as Ecclesiastes 1 , verse 5 : The sun also ariseth , and the sun goeth down , and hasteth to his place where he arose .
Perhaps the strongest geocentric verse in the Bible is Joshua 10:13 :
And the sun stood still , and the moon stayed , until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies .
Is not this written in the book of Jasher ?
So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven , and hasted not to go down about a whole day .
Here the Moderator of Scripture , the Holy Ghost Himself , endorses the daily movement of the sun and moon .
After all , God could just as well have written : " And the earth stopped turning , so that the sun appeared to stand still , and the moon seemed to stay ... . "
That wording would be no more " confusing " to the reader than anything in Job chapters 38 through 41 .
There are those who would claim that the language used is phenomenological , that it was not meant to convey the truth of the matter .
They like to equate Joshua 10:13 with verses like Isaiah 55:12 where the trees are said to " clap their hands . "
The problem with that is that everyone since Adam can understand that Isaiah 55:12 is a literary device ; but there is not a clue to tell those before Copernicus that Joshua 10:13 is not to be taken literally .
About the immobility of the earth the Bible seems clear enough .
The nineteenth - century logician and mathematician Augustus de Morgan , whithout whose theorem ( de Morgan 's Theorem ) there would be no digital computers , put it quite succinctly when he wrote that those who try to get around the Bible 's wording :
... make strange reasons .
They undertake a priori , to settle Divine intentions .
The Holy Spirit did not mean to teach natural philosophy : this they know beforehand ; or else they infer it from finding that the earth does move , and the Bible says it does not .
Of course , ignorance apart , every word is truth , or the writer did not mean truth .
But this puts the whole book on its trial : for we never can find out what the writer meant , unless we otherwise find out what is true .
Those who like may , of course , declare for an inspiration over which they are to be viceroys ; but common sense will either accept the verbal meaning or deny verbal inspiration .

In other words , either God writes what he means and means what he writes , or else he passes off mere appearances as truths and ends up the liar .
The ultimate issue is one of final authority : is the final say God 's or man's ?
This is brought home again and again by humanists , such as the twentieth - century philosopher Bertrand Russell and astronomer Ivan King , who point to the church 's abandonment of geocentricity as having " freed " man from the ancient God-centered outlook on life to the modern man-centered outlook .
For complete documentation of the Biblical significance of geocentricity see G. D. Bouw 's book , Geocentricity
The Copernican Revolution , as this change of view is called , was not just a revolution in astronomy , but it also spread into politics and theology .
In particular , it set the stage for the development of Bible criticism .
After all , if God can not be taken literally when He writes of the " rising of the sun , " then how can He be taken literally in writing of the " rising of the Son ? "
The other of the two concerns over heliocentrism , as expressed by the reformers , is that the earth - centered view is better science than is heliocentrism .
Although hints of that have sporadically surfaced in physics over the last 150 years , only in the 1980s has this claim become substantial through a new discipline called geocentricity .
Whereas geocentrism was a concept which divided the universe into independent parts , geocentricity is an integrative approach , starting from the very smallest parts and integrating them into a unified view of the universe .
For being only eleven years old , geocentricity has been surprisingly successful , solving several severe problems in cosmology such as providing a single - universe solution to the parallel universes problem .
To illustrate the difference in approach between geocentricity and heliocentrism , consider the derivation of the equations which technicians use to orbit space ships .
Now some will insist that since satellites are sent up using heliocentrically - derived equations , that the space program is proof of heliocentrism .
This erroneously assumes that the geocentrically - derived equations would be different from the heliocentric ones .
That such is not the case has repeatedly been shown in scientific papers since the turn of the twentieth century .
References Back in the nineteenth century , Ernst Mach ( photo at left ) showed that if there were an essential difference between geocentricity and heliocentrism , that then all the rules of geometry would be violated .
Ever since then , geocentricity has been referred to by physicists as Mach 's Principle .
These papers show that the geocentric model is entirely compatible with phenomena such as the stationary satellite , the Foucault pendulum , the equatorial bulge , and how the distant stars can be " moving " faster than the speed of light ;
The speed of light is only a speed limit for bodies moving through the stellar universe , not for rotation .
[ Also see Barnes , T. G. , 1983 .
Physics of the Future , ( El Cajon : Institute for Creation Research ) , p. 127. ] in short , they answer every argument based on the Coriolis and centrifugal effects .
The main difference is that geocentric models must always take the existence of the universe into account whereas heliocentric models always ignore it .
Other than that , the differences between heliocentrism and geocentricity are philosophical and theological .
[ See , for example , Sir Fred Hoyle , 1975 .
Astronomy and Cosmology : A Modern Course , ( San Francisco : W. H. Freeman & Co. ) , p. 416 , where he writes : " We know that the difference between a heliocentric theory and a geocentric theory is one of relative motion only , and that such a difference has no physical significance .
Emphasis added . ]
To further illustrate the difference the geocentric theory can make in viewing the universe , consider the two rivals ' views on what space looks like on very , very small scales .
At a scale much smaller than nuclear particles , modern science describes space as " foamy . "
The size of these foamy bubbles or " grains " of space is very small , amounting to only about 0.000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,002 centimeter ( written as 2x10 - 33 cm . )
Each grain has a mass of about 0.00002 gram .
According to the heliocentrically - based view , the grains spontaneously appears out of nothing , exist for a brief instant ( 5x10 - 44 second ) , and then vanishes into the nothingness from which it came .
Strictly speaking , this violates the first law of thermodynamics which claims that energy can neither be created or destroyed by any natural process .
[ See Introduction to the Firmament . ]
The geocentric theory explains the grains of space without violating any of the laws of thermodynamics .
It takes the grains at face value , presuming them to be real .
The medium of the grains is tremendously dense ( 4x1093 gm /cm3 ) : so dense that one would have to pack 1039 universes into a cube one centimeter on a side in order to match their density .
Geocentric theory has identified the grains as making up the firmament of Genesis chapter 1 .
It is common among Creationists to assume that the firmament was a canopy of water in one form or another ; but whether there ever was a canopy before the flood , it cannot be equated with the firmament simply because Genesis 1:17 tells us that God set the stars in the firmament , not above it as would have to be the case if the canopy was meant .
Since God called the firmament " Heaven " ( Genesis 1:8 ) it must follow that the firmament is at least the size of the universe .
The firmament goes a long way towards explaining some of the mysteries of modern science .
It readily explains why more massive nuclear particles are smaller than less massive ones .
In the every - day realm it explains why , in general , mass depends on volume .
It explains why very large objects , such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies seem to be as much as 500 times more massive than is indicated by the amount of light they generate .
This phenomenon is now called " dark matter . "
In addition , the firmamental model readily accounts for such experimental results as the Sagnac effect , the Faraday disk - generator paradox , earth 's night - time electric field , and ball lightning .
All of these point to geocentricity as serious science .
Despite the testimony of all the equations , and despite the published testimonies of top scientists to the viability of geocentricity as a model of the universe , and despite the inability of experiments to establish its truth or falsity ; some will still scoff at geocentricity .
How can one ever determine which is the truth ?
Only by going outside the universe and taking a look around can one ascertain the truth of the matter .
Without that ability to " look around outside , " physics cannot resolve the debate .
However , since God does know what is beyond the universe , should His word not be taken as the final authority ?
It is the testimony of God as found in the Bible which constitutes the foundation of modern geocentricity .
May it ever be so .

Worst Financial Crisis since 1931 ?
German State - Owned Banks on Verge of Collapse
The German government has had to bail out state - owned banks with taxpayers ' money after their managements recklessly gambled away billions on subprime investments .
But if a state - owned bank were to go under , the consequences could be disastrous for the whole economy .

Taking a page out of the Hulu playbook , but awesomer , the South Park guys are streaming every single South Park episode in full at their official site , South Park Studios .
What they get right : Streams are fast and vid quality is solid ; every episode , from first to most recent is available ( with one exception ) ; and newer ones are uncensored .
Yep , you actually get to hear your favorite childrens scream " What the fuck is going on ? " in the Britney ep .
Major point of suck : ads .
Advertisement
They 're mercifully short , but you get hit with about three per episode ( marked by the little white lines in the timeline ) , though you have a limited ability to jump around the ep to sorta avoid them .
Still , they 're less intrusive than the pop-ups that assault you at AllSP.com or the like .
Which is probably a big part of why they 're doing this — the online audience for South Park is huge , with lots of sites streaming eps and major torrent traffic .
So why not get a slice of that ad revenue ?
Ads are going to be a part of any free TV online equation , unfortunately .
So are rights issues — for some reason the Britney ep is already available , but the first episode of the current season wo n't be up until April .
WTF ?
But all in all , they get it as right as an official channel can for the time being , which looks startlingly like a glimpse at the future of TV .
Update : Another reason living in Canada sucks :

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Tokyo businesses are to start offering benefits to elderly people who give up their drivers ’ licences , backing a police effort to cut back on the ballooning number of traffic accidents caused by drivers over 65 .
Among more than 30 special offers , one small bank will give higher interest rates , while Mitsukoshi department store chain plans to provide free delivery from its
Tokyo stores and a hotel will offer a 10 percent discount on meals in a program starting next month , Tokyo police said on their Web site .
“ Have the courage to give up your licence , ” the police say on the site .
“ If you have lost confidence in your driving ... if your family says they are worried about you driving ... please think about handing in your licence . ”
Japan has the largest proportion of over - 65s in the world and faces a growing problem with elderly drivers , who caused 100,000 traffic accidents last year , about twice the figure 10 years earlier , broadcaster NHK said .
Don Siegelman got out of jail today .
He had a conversation with the New York Times and he immediately and appropriately blamed Karl Rove for his legal troubles .
Rove is going to have to answer a lot of questions about this case .
And , that pompous little bastard better not claim executive privilege .
If Rove can spend hours pontificating on Fox News , he can find the time to answer some questions — under oath :
In a telephone interview shortly after he walked out of a federal prison in Oakdale , La. , Mr. Siegelman said there had been “ abuse of power ” in his case , and repeatedly cited the influence of Karl Rove , the former White House political director .
“ His fingerprints are smeared all over the case , ” Mr. Siegelman said , a day after a federal appeals court ordered him released on bond and said there were legitimate questions about his case .
Mr. Rove has strenuously denied any involvement in the conviction of the former governor , who was sentenced to serve seven years last June after being convicted in 2006 .
He could not immediately be reached for comment today .
Mr. Siegelman served nine months while his lawyers appealed a federal judge ’s refusal to release him on bond , pending the ex-governor ’s appeal of his conviction .
That refusal was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit on Thursday .
The former governor , a Democrat , said he would “ press ” to have Mr. Rove answer questions about his possible involvement in the case before Congress , which has already held a hearing on Mr. Siegelman .
On Thursday , the House Judiciary Committee signaled its intention to have Mr. Siegelman testify about the nature of his prosecution .
Another Post gem from Shankar Vedantam :
In an unusual study analyzing State of the Union addresses like the one President Bush will give tonight , psychologists found a curious pattern in the speeches delivered by 41 U.S. presidents . …
The study found that in the first three years after a new president takes office , his speeches displayed higher levels of complexity compared with addresses in the fourth year in office .
In the first three speeches , presidents were more likely to acknowledge other points of view , potential pitfalls and unintended consequences .
In the fourth year , however — as they were about to run for reelection — the complexity of their speeches plunged .
Not only that , but American presidents who showed a sharper decline in complexity were more likely to be reelected than those who continued to acknowledge that the challenges facing the nation were complex . …
So the next time you hear presidential candidates say simplistic things that people want to hear , remember that they are merely responding rationally to the incentives that voters give them .
The disturbing question is not why politicians pander , but why pandering works — and for that we need to look in the mirror .
Strange and weird but true stories from around the world .
If you ’re looking for something to help with your waist - training or working out , this is the right place for you . …
WITH Warner Brothers ' defection last month to the Blu-ray camp , Sony would appear to have won the battle with Toshiba over which format — Blu-ray or HD DVD — is to become the ultimate high - definition replacement for the venerable DVD .
Five of Hollywood 's eight big studios , which account for 70 % of the home - video market , have now opted ( or , not to put too fine a point on it , been bribed with barrow - loads of cash ) to release their high - definition prints solely on Blu-ray discs .
The move has sparked a fire - sale of discounted Toshiba HD DVD players , with an entry model going for less than $ 100 .
AFP
The hard sell begins
The movie studios have been in a state of panic since their DVD sales — which account for nearly half the industry 's $ 45 billion annual revenue — fell off a cliff last year .
They are desperate to revitalise home video sales .
Most are praying Blu-ray will do the trick .
But it can't make up the lost revenue over night .
Between them , Blu-ray and HD DVD sales account for only a tiny portion of the DVD market .
Hence the urgency to get the format war settled quickly — so the full weight of the industry 's marketing muscle can be put behind a single standard .
Pundits have applauded Warner 's move as a crucial step towards breaking the deadlock .
The thinking is that Toshiba will now go quietly into the night .
But there are good reasons why it wo n't .
The most obvious one is that nothing decisive can be resolved until the next big selling season gets underway , and that 's not until next Christmas .
A lot of things can change between now and then .
At the moment , Blu-ray discs are outselling HD DVDs by a margin of two to one .
But that 's largely because Sony included a Blu-ray player in its new PlayStation 3 ( PS3 ) game console .
Most new PS3 owners buy a couple of Blu-ray films out of curiosity .
But a PS3 costs $ 499 , not exactly cheap , and most owners have better things to do with their consoles than watch movies .
Excluding video - game machines , Toshiba has outsold the whole of the Sony camp in terms of actual players in living rooms , thanks to its lower prices .
In other words , Toshiba has a bigger installed base of committed videophiles .
Retailers love them , but would prefer that one or other of the formats would just go away .
The format war has left consumers confused over which to choose , with many resolving the issue by refusing to commit to either .
Retailers complain that over half the people who purchase HDTV ( high - definition television ) sets do n't bother to buy high - definition video players to go with them .
By all accounts , they are unlikely ever to do so .
That 's largely because the “ upscaling ” features built into today 's HDTV sets have got so much better at artificially boosting the resolution of ordinary DVDs .
Apart from sprucing up the video signal more effectively to reduce the electrical noise and optical defects , upscaling is no longer limited by the native resolution of the HDTV set itself .
A year or so ago , the best you could buy was a 720 p set , with the screen 's 1,280 columns and 720 rows of pixels being refreshed progressively ( that is , all at once at every cycle ) .
The alternative , 1080i , was a fudge that worked by having half the rows in a screen of 1,920 by 1,080 pixels refreshed in one cycle , and the other ( interlaced ) set of rows during the next cycle .
By flipping rapidly between the screen 's two alternative sets of lines , interlacing aims to trick the eye into thinking it is seeing a higher resolution than is actually present .
But the price paid is a slightly jerkier image and a flickering that can cause headaches and eyestrain .
That 's why computer monitors abandoned interlacing for progressive scanning years ago .
The native resolution of the vast majority of HDTV sets today is 1080 p .
As such , the set 's screen can now handle the highest resolution generated by its scaling electronics .
To the average viewer , an ordinary DVD played on a modern HDTV is not only a huge improvement over the picture on a standard TV , but practically indistinguishable from that produced by a Blu-ray or HD DVD disc — and all for half the disc cost and no extra piece of video gear .
Hence the lack of enthusiasm for either format .
And the longer mainstream consumers find upscaled DVDs good enough , the more likely it will be that some other technology will emerge to eclipse both Blu-ray and HD DVD .
Already a couple of alternatives are limbering up .
One candidate is the thumb drive , the non-volatile memory stick you plug into a computer 's USB port .
Their storage capacity has soared over the past few years from megabytes to gigabytes .
Industry insiders expect that , within a few years , a 32 - gigabyte USB drive capable of holding as much as a Blu-ray disc will cost about the same as the latter does today .
And it will be more portable , more rugged , easier to play and recordable to boot .
But before Moore 's Law can work its inexorable magic , the telephone companies will start pushing their own alternative .
Over the past few years , firms such as Verizon and AT&T have been laying fat optical pipes over the “ last mile ” from their local telephone stations to people 's homes .
In what they call a “ triple play ” , they aim to bundle television and broadband internet access along with telephone services in order to slow the inroads being made in their own business by the cable - television providers .
That 's only half of it .
Verizon 's FiOS ( fibre - optic service ) can deliver raw data at speeds up to 50 megabits per second .
That 's twice the as much as needed to deliver the video quality of a Blu-ray or HD DVD disc .
AT&T 's U - verse is n't far behind .
Both see high - definition video as the key to beating the cable providers , which can't match the phone companies ' ability to provide massive bandwidth to individual households .
The cable industry 's new DOCSIS 3.0 technology can transmit data at a whopping 160 megabits per second , but the bandwidth has to be shared by all the households on the same cable loop .
As a result , few cable subscribers can get more than five or six megabits per second — nowhere near enough to pump high - definition video into the home .
What has become clear is that Blu-ray and HD DVD are both interim solutions — if even that .
They are marginally better than upscaled DVDs , but neither will stand much of a chance against fibre 's ability to deliver high - definition video on demand .
Meanwhile , neither comes close to giving the kind of “ immersive reality ” that vision engineers drool over .
The human eye can discern over 500 pixels per inch horizontally and vertically ( say , 26,000 by 14,500 pixels on a 60 - inch screen ) .
To achieve true immersive reality — the “ killer app ” that consumer electronics makers see on the horizon — requires displays a dozen times sharper than today 's HDTV sets .
The Japanese have made a start .
The Ultra-HDTV technology that NHK , Japan 's public broadcasting network , is currently investigating has 16 times more pixels ( 7,680 by 4,320 ) than an HDTV set .
And that 's just the beginning .
The betting is that both Blu-ray and HD DVD will go the way of the VHS tape , as ever sharper images begin to grab our attention .
Once considered rare , mitochondrial diseases are now thought to affect as many as one person in 5,000 .
New research in this area hopes to open up more opportunities for predicting a child 's risk of developing a mitochondrial disease which can cause muscle weakness , diabetes , strokes , heart failure and epilepsy .
All human and animal cells contain many mitochondria , which are involved in energy production within the body .
Mitochondria have their own genetic information , known as mitochondrial DNA , or mtDNA , which is inherited .
A child only inherits one copy of DNA from each parent but may inherit many copies of mtDNA , which are only passed down from the mother .
Scientists have shown for the first time how this particular family of diseases are passed down from mother to child and how this can lead to the severity of the disease differing widely .
Mutations in mtDNA can affect energy production within cells and therefore lead to disease .
However , mitochondrial diseases differ both in location and severity depending on where and at what levels the mutations are distributed .
Defective mitochondria cause most damage in muscles , nerves and the brain , the parts of the body which consume the most energy .
" Inheritance of mitochondrial diseases within families has proved incredibly difficult to predict , " says Professor Patrick Chinnery , a Wellcome Trust Senior Clinical Research Fellow at Newcastle University .
" A mother can pass on a small proportion of mutant mtDNA , or a very high proportion , and this can make the difference between a child being born without disease and another having a very severe form of the disease . "
A woman ’s eggs are formed at a very early stage in her development .
As a precursor cell divides into a number of eggs , so the mitochondria from that cell are distributed randomly throughout these eggs .
Hence different eggs can contain very different amounts of mutant mtDNA , which determine the amount of mutant genetic material that is passed on to the next generation .
This difference is thought to explain the variation in the severity of the disease between siblings however the mechanism responsible for this variation was not understood for many years .
Now this research has proven that there is a “ mitochondrial genetic bottleneck ” , where only a small number of mtDNA molecules in the mother are passed on to the next generation .
" In essence , it 's a game of chance , " explains Professor Chinnery .
" If you have a mixture of red and white balls and pick handfuls at random , then some of those handfuls will contain very few red balls and other very few white ones .
We have shown this is the reason for the different amounts of mutant mtDNA in different eggs . ”
Now , in research published online today in the journal Nature Genetics , Professor Chinnery and an international team of collaborators have shown in mice that this bottleneck does in fact exist and causes the dramatic reduction in the number of mtDNA molecules in the cells that eventually form the eggs .
This leads to the wide variation in the severity of disease .
Depending on which egg is fertilised , a high proportion of abnormal mitochondria may be passed on to the child .
In this case , the child will be more severely affected than the mother .
" With conventional genetics , we 're able to say , for example , that if you carry a certain gene , your child has a one in ten chance of developing a particular disease , " he says .
" Now that we understand how different levels of abnormal mtDNA are inherited , we may soon be able to predict a child 's risk of disease and the level of severity . "
Firefox 3 vs. Safari 3
After a few weeks in the arms of Firefox 3 betas , I ’ve returned to Safari as my daily browser .
Unsurprisingly , it ’s the interface that drove me back .
But I ’m not talking about cosmetic issues — or at least not only about cosmetic issues .
The new default theme for Firefox theme looks pretty good , especially when you switch the toolbar icons to the small size .
The Safari - style “ GrApple ” Firefox themes I linked to last month makes Firefox 3 look even better , albeit mostly by mimicking Safari .
But cosmetic appeal is just the surface .
Steve Jobs , in a 2003 New York Times magazine interview , said :
“ Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like .
People think it ’s this veneer — that the designers are handed this box and told , ‘ Make it look good ! ’
That ’s not what we think design is .
It ’s not just what it looks like and feels like .
Design is how it works . ”
And that ’s just it .
Firefox 3 ’s shortcomings as a Mac app are behavioral , too .
The main issues that drove me back to Safari :
Background Window Appearance — Starting with Leopard , standard application windows follow a simple , consistent rule : the frontmost window of the current application gets a medium gray color while all other windows have a lighter , flatter look .
The idea is that with several windows visible at once , giving the active one a darker look makes it easier to pick out visually .
( One of the long - standing gripes regarding the late brushed metal theme — Christ , remember that ugly thing ? — was that its windows barely changed appearance when switching from active to inactive . )
Firefox 3 does n’t do this .
Its windows all have the darker “ active ” look even when in the background .
And I believe that its theming mechanism does not allow for it .
Text Editing Shortcuts — Firefox 3 still does n’t support certain standard Mac text editing key bindings .
For example , in a one - line text field , the Up and Down Arrow keys should move the insertion point to the beginning and end of the line , respectively .
Drives me nuts .
Dictionary — Firefox does n’t support the system - wide dictionary .
In Safari ( and most other apps ) , you can hover the mouse over any word and use Command - Control - D ( by default ) to display the definition of that word right there in the current window .
Services — Firefox does n’t support the Services menu .
Safari does , and I use this all the time for invoking text filters I ’ve made using ThisService , and for sending the current text selection to LaunchBar as input .
Tabs —
Firefox 3 does let you drag to reorder tabs within a window , and drag tabs between windows , but it does n’t let you drag a tab out of a window to create a new window with just that tab .
Safari 3 does .
Picky - picky , I know , but I use this feature in Safari every day to group related tabs together in their own window .
Location Field —
The new Firefox 3 location field , the so - called “ AwesomeBar ” , is too clever .
When I click the mouse in the middle of a URL , I just want to place the insertion point .
I do n’t want to select the entire URL .
If I wanted to select the entire URL , I ’d double - click .
Click to place , double - click to select — just like any other text field .
Auto - completion in Firefox requires the use of the Down Arrow key to select something from the list of suggestions .
In Safari you can just use Return to accept the first suggestion .
It might just be habit , but it feels to me like Safari ’s auto - completion works a little better .
Also , in Firefox , during auto - completion , the Tab key acts like Down Arrow — it selects the next suggestion in the auto - completion list .
In Safari Tab moves the focus to the Search field , as it should .
In Firefox ’s favor , its new location field does some very cool things that Safari ’s does n’t .
For example , when matching what you ’ve typed against the URLs in your bookmarks and history , it looks anywhere within the URLs , not just at the beginning as Safari does .
This means you can type “ foo ” to match the URL “ example.com / foo / ” .
You ca n’t do that in Safari .
History — I like Safari ’s hierarchical History menu .
What Safari does is list the 20 most recently loaded URLs , followed by sub-menus for each of the last seven days .
Firefox only lists the 10 most recent URLs in the History menu .
You can get more done right from the menu in Safari , whereas in Firefox you ’ve got to open the History window .
Page Load Progress Indicator —
Every time I dally with another browser , I immediately miss Safari ’s in - location - field progress meter .
Back in January 2003 when Apple released the first public beta of Safari 1.0 , I described this feature as follows : 1 Hideous .
It looks like partially - selected text .
Please scrap it .
Over time , the feature has not just grown on me , but I ’ve come to appreciate the cleverness of its design .
I was wrong , and whoever designed this for Safari was right .
The truth is that page loading is the slowest and most unpleasant aspect of using a web browser .
It ’s important to know whether a page has finished loading yet , and so a browser ’s progress indicator deserves a prominent spot .
The best spot is near the location field , because that tends to be where your eyes are when a page starts loading .
You ca n’t get any closer to the location field than being inside the location field itself .
But , once a page has loaded , there ’s no reason for a progress indicator to remain on screen .
Firefox 3 has a small spinning progress indicator in the toolbar .
It ’s too subtle , and as a simple spinner , offers no indication as to how far along the page load has progressed , only that it is still loading .
Firefox does offer a proper progress bar in the status bar footer , but ( a ) it ’s far from rather than close to the location field in the toolbar ; and ( b ) the status bar is optional — if you turn it off , the only progress indicator is the spinner .
This one ’s a total win for Safari .
New Tab Shortcut —
In Safari , Command - T always creates a new tab , even if a browser window is n’t frontmost ; it does the Right Thing and creates a new tab in the frontmost browser window and brings that window forward .
In Firefox , invoking Command - T just beeps if , say , the Downloads window is frontmost , or if there is no open browser window .
Inline PDF Viewing —
An obvious win for Safari .
AppleScript Support — Firefox 3 has almost none .
Safari ’s is pretty good .
Firefox 3 does have a lot going for it .
Yes , it ’s still in beta ( b5 at this writing ) , but even in beta it is far better , at least Mac - wise , than Firefox 2 .
It also unquestionably offers certain advantages over Safari .
For one thing , it does a far better job managing memory .
The main reason I switched from Safari to Firefox in the first place was memory consumption on my PowerBook G4 — after just a few hours of my use , Safari 3 inevitably consumes at least 300 MB , often more , of private memory .
In the same usage , Firefox 3 never seemed to use more than 90 MB , even after a few days .
On a machine like my PowerBook with “ just ” 2 GB of RAM , Safari ’s memory consumption can be a system - wide performance bottleneck .
There are few more effective ways to slow down Mac OS X than to force the system to start swapping .
But last week I switched to a new MacBook Pro with 4 GB of RAM , so while Safari still uses significantly more memory than Firefox , it does n’t lead to VM swapping on my MacBook Pro like it did on my PowerBook .
I love Firefox ’s auto-restoration of tabs and windows .
Quit Firefox , relaunch it , and your previously - open tabs and windows are restored .
Safari 3 has this feature , but makes you do it manually via the “ Reopen All Windows From Last Session ” command in the History menu .
I ’m sure most Safari users have no idea this feature even exists .
At least as a preference , Safari should offer the ability to do this automatically .
Another very cool history - related Firefox 3 feature : the History → Recently Closed Tabs sub-menu .
If you accidentally close a tab in Safari , and that tab has been open for so long that you do n’t know where it is in your history , it ’s a pain to fish it out .
With this Firefox feature , you get two histories : ( 1 ) the main , traditional one , which stores pages by when they were opened , and ( 2 ) a second one , which stores pages based on when they were closed .
Both are useful .
Firefox also has a shortcut ( Shift - Command - T ) for restoring the most recently closed tab — perfect for the common scenario of recovering from an accidental tab closure .
Firefox 3 adds a new inline toolbar for password saving , similar to the inline text search bar that both Safari and Firefox now have .
This password bar is very slick — it ’s small and non-modal , staying out of the way until after you ’ve finished logging into a site , at which point you can decide whether you want to allow Firefox to save your credentials for this site .
Safari , on the other hand , still uses a modal alert for this , demanding your attention .
Perhaps the biggest difference between Safari and Firefox is that Firefox offers an official , supported extension API .
Safari supports “ Internet plugins ” for things like QuickTime and Flash , but offers no extension API for modifying or adding features to the application itself .
Thus , anyone who seeks to modify Safari must resort to unsupported input manager hacks for things like ad - blocking , fancier search , etc . With Firefox , plugins such as these are fully supported .
It does seem to be the case that many Firefox 2 plugins do n’t yet work with Firefox 3 , but it ’s a tremendous advantage for Firefox that this extension mechanisms exists .
This is so big a part of Firefox that it ’s arguably downright criminal that I ’ve buried mention of it at the bottom of this review .
But the one I want most , FlashBlock , does n’t yet work with the latest Firefox 3 betas .

Most of my reasons for preferring Safari to Firefox are Mac- specific details .
Camino gets some of them right , but not all , and it ’s missing the best thing about Firefox — the extensions .
For users new to the Mac , who are n’t aware of these details , Firefox 3 might be as good as or better than Safari in nearly every way .
( For anyone more used to Windows than the Mac , the text editing behavior in Firefox might feel right rather than wrong , as it does to me . )

Bush snubbed at NATO summit
By Stefan Steinberg
4 April 2008
At this week ’s NATO summit in the Romanian capital of Bucharest , US President George W. Bush has faced concerted European opposition to his plans for a further eastward expansion of the alliance .
Only a last minute compromise allowed the American president to save face .
German politicians in particular were reported to be angry and disconcerted at the insistence by the American president on the speedy inclusion of Georgia and the Ukraine into the ranks of the NATO .
During a summit dinner party held on Wednesday evening German and French opposition to Bush ’s plans received additional backing from Italy , Hungary and the Benelux countries .
Even Bush ’s closest ally in Europe , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , stated it was too soon for NATO to accept the two former Soviet republics .
At the dinner , which ran for an extra two hours , Bush is reported to have finally acknowledged that he would be unable to push through his proposal .
According to a senior US administration official : “ The debate was mostly among Europeans , ” with several European allies balking at Bush ’s stance .
Evidently attempting to put the dispute in a favourable light the same official declared : “ It was quite split , but it was split in a good way . ”
Following intense deliberations on Wednesday night between German Foreign Minister Frank Walter Steinmeier and US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice a compromise was finally struck .
The formulation agreed to by the participants at the summit on Thursday pointedly failed to give any timetable for Georgian and Ukrainian membership .
It was widely regarded as a face - saving deal for the US president and a victory for German diplomacy .
In their reports of the tensions between the US and its European allies at the Bucharest conference , German newspapers openly described the American president ’s behaviour at the summit as a provocation aimed at splitting the alliance .
Writing in the Süddeutsche Zeitung , Stefan Cornelius reported that German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( Christian Democratic Union , CDU ) had made it clear to the US president a year ago that Germany was opposed to any NATO membership for Georgia and Ukraine in the short term .
In a series of video conferences with Washington held in the past months and weeks , Merkel reiterated Germany ’s unwillingness to budge on this issue .
Up until last week , German officials were confident that a diplomatic formula would be found to resolve the issue without open conflict at the summit .
This scenario was then exploded by the appearance of the US president at a number of forums this week in which he insisted on a timetable of negotiations for the rapid admission of the two countries into the NATO alliance .
On Tuesday Bush appeared alongside the Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko in Kiev to declare that the “ United States strongly supports your request ” for membership of NATO .
The immediate response to Bush ’s proposal came from Moscow .
Russia ’s Deputy Foreign Minister , Grigory Karasin , reiterated that Ukrainian membership of NATO would lead to a profound crisis in Russian - Ukrainian relations , while Russia ’s NATO envoy , Dmitry Rogozin , declared that if Ukraine and Georgia were given so - called Membership Action Plans , it would “ mark a point of no return in his country ’s relations with the Alliance . ”
Sweeping aside criticism of his plans , Bush returned to the theme of NATO expansion on Wednesday in the Romanian capital of Bucharest , raising the same theme at a meeting of 500 political and business leaders as well as at a meeting of the German Marshall Fund .
Russia ’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov immediately denounced Bush ’s proposals , calling the proposed expansion “ artificial and completely unnecessary ” and in the State Duma in Moscow warned ominously ....
” What ’s happening will not ( go ) unanswered , I assure you . ”
For his part , German Foreign Minister Frank - Walter Steinmeier ( Social Democratic Party , SPD ) , in an interview with the Leipziger Volkszeitung Tuesday , declared that there was “ broad scepticism ” in Europe regarding US support for NATO membership for Georgia and Ukraine .
Steinmeier declared that following the “ difficult decision to recognise Kosovo , it is clear that with our foreign policy we have reached Russia ’s tolerance level . ”
Both Steinmeier and Merkel argue that neither Georgia , under its authoritarian president Mikhail Saakashvili , nor Ukraine , where a large majority of the population is opposed to NATO membership , is ready to join the alliance .
In its lead article on the opening day of the summit the SZ commented : “ Bush ’s strategy of confrontation at the start of the summit was described by diplomats as unusual because it could have led to a loss of face either on the part of the president or his opponent , in this case the German chancellor .
During the period of the Cold War , the US - dominated NATO alliance was the cornerstone of western military policy in world politics .
Now , nearly two decades after the collapse of the former Soviet Union and under conditions of a growing financial and political crisis in the US itself , a number of political commentators are stressing that the opening up of a series of profound differences between Europe and the US threatens the very existence of the alliance .
In an article for the British Independent titled : “ Time to disband NATO now the Cold War is over ? ” , Adrian Hamilton lists the points of contention at the summit : “ The participants are at odds over expansion to the East , with the US , backed by the new entrants , urging Georgian and Ukrainian membership against the public doubts of Germany and the vehement opposition of Russia .
The core members are at odds over their individual contributions to the war in Afghanistan .
Even on what should be the relatively uncontentious issue of bringing Macedonia into the organisation , the Greeks are threatening to veto the move unless the new member changes its name . ”
Hamilton goes on : “ If this were a family it would compete with the Royal Tenenbaums for disfunctionality . ”
And he concludes : “ The fearful prospect at Bucharest is that , by allowing NATO to be driven in new directions without confronting the hard questions on its future , we are in danger of breaking the whole alliance on which it is founded . ”
The future of the NATO alliance is also addressed by the former Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer , who sees the growing conflict between Germany and America to be at the heart of the differences in Bucharest .
According to Fischer writing in Die Zeit on Monday : “ The future of NATO as a global alliance for intervention and security is not on the official agenda of the NATO summit from Bucharest but this is precisely the issue at stake . ”
Listing three central issues of contention at the summit — Afghanistan , NATO expansion , NATO - Russian relations —
Fischer concludes : “ It is notable that on all three decisive questions in Bucharest , the German government stands in opposition to the Bush government . ”
It is worth examining Fischer ’s comments more closely .
Unlike her predecessor , SPD leader Gerhard Schröder , Angela Merkel declared her support for the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
Had she held power at that time , it is quite likely that German troops would have been involved in the Iraq quagmire .
Since assuming power in 2004 , she has sought to overcome the breach in relations which resulted from Schröder ’s refusal to openly defend the American invasion and occupation of Iraq .
There is not the slightest doubt about Merkel ’s Atlanticist credentials .
But now , according to Fischer , despite her best efforts , the German chancellor finds herself at odds with the American president on three vital areas of foreign policy .
While Germany is certainly keen to maintain good working relations with Russia — a country on which it is heavily dependent for energy supplies — the current attempts by Washington to revive the Cold War , with Russia playing the role of the former Soviet Union , are inadequate to account for the intensity of the conflicts between Germany and its closest post war ally .
Following the Second World War , western European nations , and Germany in particular , looked to the US as a bastion of economic and political stability .
Able to rely on US economic support and its military power codified in the NATO alliance , Germany and other European countries were able to go about the business of rebuilding their economies after the devastation of the Second World War .
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 , America was regarded by leading political circles in both eastern and western Europe as a role model for economic and political development .
Now at the start of the twenty - first century , this scenario looks very different .
The first major body blow to the NATO alliance in this century was delivered by the Bush administration with its construction of a “ coalition of the willing ” to help fight its war to secure oil resources in the Middle East .
The assembling of a coalition of powers outside of the existing international structures which the US had pioneered after the Second World War was quite correctly seen by European powers as an attempt by Washington to compensate for its declining influence in the United Nations and NATO .
The debacle of the five - year - old war in Iraq is currently being matched by the mounting reverses for coalition troops in Afghanistan .
Bush has gone to Bucharest intent on drumming up more troops to fight in that ravaged land , but European leaders are aware that the war is fiercely unpopular with their electorates .
Only French president Nicholas Sarkozy has responded to Bush ’s latest appeal and agreed , above the head of the French parliament , to send 700 French troops to the east of Afghanistan .
To put this figure in proportion : the commanding general for Afghanistan Dan McNeill declared a week ago that in order to be able to effectively fight the Taliban the US - led alliance required more than 400,000 troops in the region .
After seven years of war and amidst growing indications of increased Taliban activity , McNeill presently has less than 60,000 soldiers at his disposal .
Fischer , like Merkel , is well aware of the debt owed by post - war German capitalism to America , but concludes that the Bush government is too “ weak ” and “ incompetent ” to complete the job in Afghanistan .
Germany must overcome its scruples over sending combat troops into dangerous war zones , Fischer argues , and help pull the US chestnuts out of the fire by dispatching soldiers to war - torn southern Afghanistan .
During Bush ’s last months in office , the foreign policy of the American president is assuming an increasingly unpredictable and aggressive character .
This has sounded the alarm bells in European political circles and at the same time forced European powers to take an increasingly independent stand on security and defence .
Already in the run up to the Bucharest summit , the influential German political magazine IP ran a debate on the future of NATO .
Speaking against the continuation of the alliance , a Dutch defence expert , Peter van Ham , argued : “ It seems to be just a matter of time before the EU replaces NATO as the guarantor of security and defence in Europe . ”
Ham accuses the US of debasing NATO : “ For them NATO is nothing more than a sort of security saloon where the American sheriff rustles up his posse to go hunt down the bad guys .
In drawing up its alliance the US is able to acquire the stamp of international legitimacy without having to make any major incursions on its foreign policy playing field . ”
Arguing against this position , a more experienced security expert , Professor Karl Kaiser , recalled that the original notion behind the setting up of the NATO alliance was not to combat an external threat , but in fact to prevent war amongst its constituent members .
In other words , the centrifugal pressures evident in Bucharest , which are now threatening to tear NATO apart , also create the conditions for renewed military confrontation between the major imperialist powers .
A problem which has defeated mathematicians for almost 140 years has been solved by a researcher at Imperial College London .
Professor Darren Crowdy , Chair in Applied Mathematics , has made the breakthrough in an area of mathematics known as conformal mapping , a key theoretical tool used by mathematicians , engineers and scientists to translate information from a complicated shape to a simpler circular shape so that it is easier to analyze .
This theoretical tool has a long history and has uses in a large number of fields including modelling airflow patterns over intricate wing shapes in aeronautics .
It is also currently being used in neuroscience to visualize the complicated structure of the grey matter in the human brain .
The Schwarz - Christoffel transformation can make certain Laplace boundary value problems easier to solve .
Image source : Wikipedia .
A formula , now known as the Schwarz - Christoffel formula , was developed by two mathematicians in the mid-19th century to enable them to carry out this kind of mapping .
However , for 140 years there has been a deficiency in this formula : it only worked for shapes that did not contain any holes or irregularities .
Now Professor Crowdy has made additions to the famous Schwarz - Christoffel formula which mean it can be used for these more complicated shapes .
He explains the significance of his work , saying :
" This formula is an essential piece of mathematical kit which is used the world over .
Now , with my additions to it , it can be used in far more complex scenarios than before .
In industry , for example , this mapping tool was previously inadequate if a piece of metal or other material was not uniform all over - for instance , if it contained parts of a different material , or had holes . "
Professor Crowdy 's work has overcome these obstacles and he says he hopes it will open up many new opportunities for this kind of conformal mapping to be used in diverse applications .
" With my extensions to this formula , you can take account of these differences and map them onto a simple disk shape for analysis in the same way as you can with less complex shapes without any of the holes , " he added .
Professor Crowdy 's improvements to the Schwarz - Christoffel formula were published in the Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society .

Plans to sell genetic tests over the internet so people can find out if they are at risk of developing mental illnesses have been denounced by leading UK psychiatrists .
They say the technology is still primitive and is only likely to worsen individuals ' emotional and mental problems .
The tests , which biotechnology companies will begin selling in a few months , will allow people to find out , by sending off a spittle sample , if they possess gene variants that increase their chances of suffering bipolar depression or schizophrenia .
The information will help both patients and doctors , it is claimed .
But scientists argue that selling these tests on the internet is dangerous .
The technology is still in its infancy and cannot yet help make helpful diagnoses .
' These tests will only worry , confuse and mislead the public and patients , ' said psychiatrist Professor Nick Craddock , of Cardiff University .
' There is a long way to go before we have genetic tests that may be helpful to patients .
Using tests at the moment is only likely to cause harm . '
This point was backed by Professor David Collier , of the Institute of Psychiatry , London .
' At best , these tests are clinically useless .
At worst , their results could cause serious worries for patients . '
The tests are based on recent discoveries of gene variants that can increase a person 's chance of succumbing to depression or schizophrenia .
Each variant raises a person 's risks by only a slight margin but if tests for several variants are combined , this creates a useful risk assessment for an individual , firms say .
As a result , several - including NeuroMark in Colorado , Psynomics in California , and SureGene in Kentucky - have developed tests based on these variants and are preparing to sell them for several hundred pounds a test on the internet .
For example , Psynomics has developed a test for pinpointing individuals at risk of depression .
' This is going to be initially driven by patients , ' John Kelsoe , chief executive , told Science magazine last week .
But the usefulness of such tests was disputed by Dr Cathryn Lewis , also of the Institute of Psychiatry .
' The general risk of developing bipolar depression is around one per cent .
If you possess the worst set of gene variants , then your risk rises to three per cent .
That means you are three times more likely than average to get bipolar depression .
That may seem worrying but it is still a very low risk .
It is still 97 per cent likely that you wo n't get depression .
People are not likely to realise that , however . '
Another test - to be marketed by NeuroMark , first in the US and later this year in Europe - is based on genes that predispose people to react badly to stress .
If a person inherits this gene section from both parents , he or she has an increased chance of suffering from severe depression after stressful situations .
' About 20 per cent of people have this combination , ' said Kim Bechthold , chief executive of the biotechnology company .
' It is useful information to know . '
But if a person proves positive , what action can they take to avoid risk and counter the risk they face ?
' We suggest joining a choir , eating chocolate or buying a puppy , ' said Bechthold .
These ideas were dismissed by Craddock .
' Life is stressful .
You can not avoid it .
It is extremely unhelpful to tell people that they face a risk like that .'
In addition , scientists have found only a small number of risk gene variants for psychiatric disorders .
Many more await detection , it is thought .
' The trouble is that if someone takes a test which suggests they face no risk , they could easily think they can then do what they want , ' added Craddock .
' They might start taking recreational drugs again , which would pose problems if they are prone to depression .
Other risk gene variants might later be discovered and new tests developed .
Then we will find these people actually have an inherent proneness to depression after all .
It will be too late by then , however . '

EVER since the emperor bought new clothes , there have been few instances of self - delusion quite as stark as that of cavalier British bankers at the start of 2008 .
Just as rivals in America and other parts of Europe were writing down billions on their investments in dodgy mortgage loans and frantically raising money , the bosses of Britain 's biggest banks were instead blithely increasing their dividends in a blustery display of financial strength .
Just how hollow it was became apparent on Friday April 18th when it emerged that Royal Bank of Scotland , the country 's second biggest bank , might have to raise money to satisfy bank regulators .
The amount will not be trivial , nor will be its impact on shareholders .
Analysts reckon that Royal Bank may have to raise between £ 10 billion ( $ 19.9 billion ) and £ 13 billion , about a third of its current market value of £ 37 billion .
It is expected to do so through a share sale which will probably be announced at its annual shareholders ' meeting on April 23rd .
At issue is Royal Bank's “ core capital ” — a cushion composed mainly of shareholders ' money that regulators insist banks hold against bad times — which stands at about 4.5 % of risk - weighted assets .
This is the lowest of any big British bank and well below the 6 % that most banks consider a reasonable minimum level .
For Sir Fred Goodwin , the chief executive of Royal Bank , the prospect of having to go cap in hand to shareholders for a bailout would be a deep humiliation and many believe that Sir Fred 's head may well be the price that shareholders demand in exchange for supporting a share issue that may dilute their existing holdings by as much as 50 % .
If that is the case it would mark the end of a career that was marked by both brilliance and hubris .
Sir Fred made his name at Royal Bank after its hostile takeover of NatWest , another British bank in 2000 .
Although he was not the main architect of the deal , he was responsible for making it work .
He did so skilfully and ruthlessly , in the process earning the moniker “ Fred the shred ” when he cut some 18,000 jobs .
His reign at Royal Bank was characterised by a curious mix of authoritarianism and prickliness .
( He once started to sue a big newspaper for libel after it joked in a column that he had wanted a private road built from his bank 's headquarters to the airport and had been denied membership of a swanky golf course .
He denied the suggestions entirely . )
More important is that in recent years Sir Fred has alienated shareholders with a spate of contentious acquisitions abroad that , although vastly expanding the empire he manages , has served mainly to depress his company 's share price .
The most recent of these was his bank 's participation last year in the € 72 billion ( $ 101 billion ) takeover of ABN AMRO , a Dutch bank , by a group that also included Spain 's Santander and Fortis , a Belgian - Dutch bank .
This deal , which was paid for mostly in cash , is the main reason that Royal Bank 's balance sheet is so stretched ( although writedowns on the value of credit derivatives have not helped ) .
And , although analysts have speculated for months that the bank would need to raise new capital , he has brusquely brushed aside their concerns .
On February 28th when he presented the bank 's annual results , he unequivocally told analysts that he had “ no plans for any inorganic capital raisings or anything of the sort . ”
Rival bankers , however , are advised to keep their Schadenfreude in check .
On Friday Citigroup posted a $ 5.1 billion loss for the first quarter and said it plans to cut 9,000 more jobs .
And in Britain , analysts expect other banks to follow in Royal Bank 's footsteps in beating a path to shareholders ' doors .
Analysts at JPMorgan Chase , an investment bank , reckon British banks need to raise about £ 37 billion .
Among the worst affected are HBOS , which they reckon may need to raise as much as £ 11 billion , and Barclays , which could be short of about £ 8 billion .
Self delusion may be dying hard among Britain 's banks , yet the sooner they face facts , the sooner they can move on .

A . The question of " What do you and your design team do ? " is pretty hard to answer without resorting to a tremendous amount of off - putting and , frankly , loopy jargon .
I 'm going to try , but forgive me in advance if I lapse back into it .
When most people hear " design " and " NYTimes.com " together , they usually think of the wonderful interactive graphics or multimedia storytelling done by our colleagues on the graphics and multimedia teams .
( In fact , Steve Duenes , the graphics director , offered lots of insight into much of this work in his own Talk to the Newsroom session some weeks ago . )
Though we do work with these teams in a support capacity , it 's not the core of what we do .
If you think of their work as design for the content that appears on our site , then you can think of the work that my team does as design for the framework for that content .
Which is to say , we create the underlying platform on top of which the content sits .
Even setting aside the vast amounts of original reporting that we publish every day , our site is still under more or less continuous revision , so that framework is constantly being tended to .
We 're always looking at ways to improve various sections of the site , tweaking our templates , adding new features and tools and removing impediments to people 's consumption and use of the news .
As the design director , my responsibility is to oversee the creative aspects of these continual improvements .
Each one is a project of its own with some range in scope , from very short and discrete to long and drawn out over many months .
And each project requires one or more of the members on my team : information architects ( who are charged with organizing the features and the flow of information so that people can make use of them most intuitively ) , design technologists ( who do the actual coding of many of these sites , using HTML , CSS , JavaScript , Flash , etc. ) and / or visual designers ( who handle the overall look and feel , including layout , typography , color , proportion , etc. ) .
You could say that all put together , the final product of our efforts is the user experience , or the sum total of the content and the framework as it's used by visitors to the site .
Of course , it 's not true that my design group is the only team responsible for creating this experience ; it 's really the result of contributions across the board , from editors and reporters to project managers and software engineers and many more .
Finally , my job does n't involve as much hands - on design work as it would in an ideal world .
The majority of my day is spent either in a supervisory capacity , reviewing and discussing work done by my staff , or sitting in meetings , planning for upcoming enhancements to the site and how design can make them happen .
The way I usually put it is that my job as design director is n't actually to do great design , but rather to help create and sustain the conditions under which great design can happen .
Canadian study : Oil prices to double by 2012
The price of oil is likely to hit 150 dollars ( Canadian , US ) a barrel by 2010 and soar to 225 dollars a barrel by 2012 as supply becomes increasingly tight , a Canadian bank said Thursday .
The CIBC report says the International Energy Agency 's current oil production estimates overstate supply by about nine percent , since it wrongly counts natural gas liquids -- which are not viable for transportation fuel -- in its numbers .
Analyst Jeff Rubin in his report noted accelerating depletion rates in many of the world 's largest and most mature oil fields .
He estimates oil production will hardly grow at all , with average daily production between now and 2012 rising by barely a million barrels per day .
" Whether we have already seen the peak in world oil production remains to be seen , but it is increasingly clear that the outlook for oil supply signals a period of unprecedented scarcity , " said Rubin .
" Despite the recent record jump in oil prices , oil prices will continue to rise steadily over the next five years , almost doubling from current levels . "
The CIBC report also notes that while production increases are at a virtual standstill , global demand continues to grow .
An expected drop in demand in the United States due to higher prices and a weak economy will be more than offset by demand growth in developing nations , it says .
Rubin cites , for example , the recent launch of Tata 's 2,500 - dollar car that will allow millions of households in India to soon own automobiles .
He also notes that car sales last year were up 60 percent in Russia , up 30 percent in Brazil and up 20 percent in China .
Transport fuel now accounts for half of the world 's oil usage .
Although US oil consumption is likely to fall by over two million barrels a day over the next five years as pump prices rise , he says , more drivers on the road in Russia , China and India will surely pick up the slack in demand .
I typically try to avoid tool - driven approaches , but this slide show caught my eye because it organizes the tools by what you can accomplish .
It 's for teaching and learning and it made wonder what a slide show called " The Top 50 Tools For Nonprofits To Pick Low Hanging Fruit " might look like .
Starving mice for a few days before chemotherapy treatments protected their healthy cells from damaging side effects , offering a possible way to shield cancer patients from the debilitating hair loss , nausea and anemia that now plagues the treatments , researchers reported Tuesday .
The study , published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , could also allow the use of more potent chemotherapy doses without endangering patients .
Valter Longo of USC , who led the research , said healthy cells deprived of nourishment stop dividing and become more resistant to stress .
That makes them less vulnerable to chemotherapy , which targets cells that are dividing .
Because cancer cells do not respond to their environment in a normal way , starvation does not protect them from the drugs , said Longo , who conducted the research with scientists at USC and Giannina Gaslini Institute in Genoa , Italy .

The experiment looked at how healthy and cancerous cells reacted when they were exposed to toxins after being denied glucose , a simple sugar .
Healthy yeast cells , for example , were 1,000 times as resistant to chemotherapy damage as yeast cells containing a tumor gene .
An experiment in mice confirmed the protective effects of fasting .
Of the 28 mice that received only water for 48 to 60 hours before chemotherapy , one died .
By contrast , 20 of the 37 mice that did not fast died from treatment .
All mice were given an amount of the cancer drug etoposide equivalent to three times the maximum human dose .
Fasting mice that survived treatment had no visible side effects , researchers said , compared with the second group of mice , which became sluggish and developed ruffled hair because of the drug .
Longo said colleagues at USC / Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center are planning a clinical trial to study the benefits of fasting in cancer patients taking chemotherapy drugs .
The trial is expected to begin this year , he said .

People with cancer should not fast before treatment without consulting their doctor because forgoing food could be harmful to some patients , Longo warned .

China repairs 400 - year - old Tibetan Buddhist monastery Xinhua , April 18 , 2008 XINING , China -- Repair work on Taer Monastery , one of the six best known monasteries of the Yellow Sect of Tibetan Buddhism , was launched on Thursday , the third initiative since 1992 .
Maintenance and restoration of two major buildings in the 400 - year - old monastery in the northwestern province of Qinghai would be completed next year .
However , when to kick off the second stage to repair two other key constructions will depend on the current work progress , according to the project administration office .
China conducted a four - year large - scale repair in the monastery in 1992 at a cost of 37 million yuan ( 5.3 million U.S. dollars ) .
The second project was launched in 2001 on a main palace , involving more than 30 million yuan .
The new repair has received 25 million yuan from the central government .
" On behalf of all living buddhas and buddhists , I want to express gratitude to the efforts that the government have made in protecting religion and national cultural heritages , " said Zungkang , the Lama in charge of the monastery 's administration .
Construction of the monastery , 27 kilometers south of the provincial capital Xining , began in 1560 to honor Tson - Khapa , founder of the Yellow Sect of Tibetan Buddhism , and also the mentor of the 1st Panchan Lama and Dalai Lama .
It is noted for the architectural brilliance of its halls and rooms and about 20,000 religious paintings , appliques and yak butter sculptures .
The monastery has undergone various damage in fires , earthquakes , landslides and foundation subsidence in the past four centuries .
Sen .
John McCain might end up being elected president in November because many antiwar independents believe he ’s the best person to handle that famous phone call at 3 am .
He ’s obviously the most experienced and probably the most courageous of the remaining contenders .
But he lacks temperament , philosophy , and judgment .
Which means he would be the worst person to make a snap decision in a complicated international crisis .
Foreign policy is the most important reason to vote against John McCain in November , irrespective of the Democratic nominee ’s identity .
Independents long ago turned against the Iraq war , but they broke for McCain in every Republican primary in which they could vote .
He took almost half of the antiwar independents in New Hampshire , for instance .
McCain has the image of a maverick , but he earned it by sipping deeply of liberal nostrums , pushing campaign finance reform ( trampling the First Amendment in the process ) and criticizing the Bush tax cuts ( for favoring the rich who , of course , pay the most in income taxes ) .
Moreover , even though the majority of the American people believe the Iraq war was unnecessary and badly botched by President George W. Bush , 46 percent declared in a recent Zogby poll that McCain would be the best candidate to handle Iraq .
The number rose to 49 percent on the issue of terrorism .
When it came to that 3 am phone call , McCain took 55 percent against Hillary Clinton and 56 percent against Barack Obama .
Hunh ?
John McCain is a man of experience , courage , and honor , but they are overshadowed by his vices , such as his angry temperament , his tendency to go postal against his Senate colleagues , questioning their intelligence and principles when they disagree with him .
We should expect better of someone entrusted with control of the strongest military on earth .
McCain ’s sanctimonious certainty is another problem .
In one of the Republican debates he declared " I ’m the expert " on Iraq .
Yet on his most recent trip to Iraq he confused Iraq and Iran , denouncing the latter , a Shi’ite state , for training al - Qaeda , made up of Sunnis , and had to be corrected by Sen.
Joseph Lieberman , who was standing nearby at the obligatory press conference on the " nonpolitical " trip .
Will Sen. Lieberman move into the White House along with the McCains to hover near the phone at 3am ?
McCain similarly appears to share George Bush ’s simplistic view of the world .
Both see America threatened by numerous enemies who are all alike  al - Qaeda members , secular dictators , Palestinian terrorists , Baathist insurgents , Shia nationalists , Hezbollah fighters , Taliban fundamentalists , Hamas activists .
McCain told an audience at the Virginia Military Institute last year :
The Iraq war " is part of a broader struggle in the Arab and Muslim world , the struggle between violent extremists and the forces of modernity and moderation . "
The extremists , he adds , " wish to return the world to the 7th century . "
Actually , most Iraqi insurgents want to drive America out of their country .
Most al - Qaeda terrorists want to punish the U.S. government for appearing to wage war on Muslims  in Iraq , the Palestinian territories , Saudi Arabia , and elsewhere .
Most Hamas and Hezbollah fighters want to defend their respective homelands from Israeli intervention , backed by America .
Lots of other people simply want the U.S. to stop interfering in their affairs .
" They " all hate America , but for very different reasons .
Perhaps McCain sees no need to sweat the small stuff , like the facts .
After all , he assures the American people , " the war will be over soon . "
Rather like Vice President Richard Cheney ’s claim  three years ago  that the insurgency is " in the last throes . "
However , the biggest problem with McCain is his philosophy .
Sen .
McCain once was a reluctant warrior , balking at intervention in Lebanon , Somalia , Haiti , Bosnia , and even Iraq the first time .
Today he is the most belligerent of the original 2008 presidential contenders , except , perhaps , for Rudy Giuliani .
If there is a war in the world , McCain can be counted on to join it .
And if one does n’t exist , he is determined to start it .
Indeed , like almost every uber - hawk , McCain rolls out the Hitler analogy against anyone who opposes his latest war .
In criticizing Rep. Ron Paul , the sole Iraq critic among the GOP presidential contenders , McCain argued " that that kind of isolationism , sir , is what caused World War II . "
He added that " we , " apparently meaning Americans , who had nothing to do with the Nazis ’ political rise , " allowed Hitler to come to power with that kind of attitude of isolationism and appeasement . "
Every opponent of the U.S. government becomes Hitler resurrected 
Ho Chi Minh , Slobodan Milosevic , Saddam Hussein , Mahmoud Ahmandinejad , fill - in - the - blank .
Yet again , an American politician has demonstrated that a little historical knowledge is extraordinarily dangerous .
McCain has made Iraq his signature issue .
In an unusually truthful moment , before quickly retracting his comments , he acknowledged that if he does n’t convince the American people that U.S. policy is succeeding , " then I lose .
I lose . "
He should lose .
In his view , America was right to invade , is winning , and should stay 100 years : " It ’s not a matter of how long we ’re in Iraq , it ’s if we succeed or not , " he told CNN ’s Larry King .
McCain ’s failure to grasp the difference between the presence of U.S. troops in Germany , Japan , and South Korea , and in Iraq , is stupefying .
In the former , no one was attempting to kill Americans .
Nor were upwards of 1.3 billion people angered by America ’s policy , creating more terrorists .
McCain also is ignoring the ever - worsening strain on the U.S. military .
American service personnel sacrifice much for their country , but soldiers and Marines who face multiple tours and reservists who are treated like active duty forces will eventually hit the limit .
The armed services have been having trouble recruiting new accessions and retaining officers  keeping the ranks filled only by lowering standards .
The longer the war goes on , the more difficult the task of attracting and keeping quality personnel .
But assume away these complications .
What does McCain define as success ?
It is now widely acknowledged that Iraq was an unnecessary war of choice .
The Saddam Hussein regime was not involved in 9/11 and had no operational relationship with al - Qaeda , which actually attacked the U.S. Iraq did not possess any weapons of mass destruction , was contained and constrained by its neighbors , most notably Iran , and , like Stalin ’s Soviet Union and Mao ’s China , was deterred by superior American military power .
Indeed , Washington ’s threat to use nuclear weapons in response to a chemical attack in the first Gulf War had kept then - existing Iraqi WMDs in their warehouses .
Moreover , the war and ensuing occupation have turned out to be as inhumane , and perhaps much more so , than Saddam Hussein ’s depredations .
Millions of Iraqis are worse off today than in 2003 .
Thus , Iraq cannot be counted as a success based on the administration ’s formal reasons for going to war .
Does the success of the surge retroactively justify the invasion ?
Violence is down  to the unacceptably high levels of 2005 .
But as violence has started to tick back upwards , the Bush administration is holding off on expected troop withdrawals .
Yet the Pentagon lacks the manpower to sustain the surge for long .
Moreover , much of the administration ’s success is artificial .
One reason fewer Iraqis are dying is that Baghdad has been ethnically cleansed : in most neighborhoods there are few religious minorities left to be killed .
Shia activist Muqtada al - Sadr ’s decision to observe a truce also has been instrumental in Washington ’s " success , " but predicting al - Sadr ’s future course is impossible .
Moreover , the U.S. has helped buy peace by paying and arming the Sunni tribes , who may eventually turn their weapons on the Shia - dominated central government .
Or on American forces , since neither Shiites nor Sunnis want the U.S. to stay long , let alone 100 years .
The central government remains non-functional .
Services , whether electricity , water , or health care , are largely nonexistent .
Billions on development projects have been wasted .
Reconciliation is minimal : leading Sunnis refused to attend the much - ballyhooed reconciliation conference .
The likelihood that an Iraq in McCain ’s image  a unitary state with liberal democracy allied militarily with the U.S. , joining in new crusades against Iran , Syria , and any other American enemy of the month  will emerge in the near future is about the same as Osama bin Laden converting to Christianity and asking for forgiveness for his terrorist attacks .
Unfortunately , Americans continue to pay a high price for John McCain ’s vision of success .
The U.S. death toll is approaching 4,000 , with tens of thousands wounded , many of them maimed for life .
At least 100,000 have been treated for a mental health condition .
Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have died .
Four to five million have been turned into refugees .
The U.S. is spending $ 12 billion a month on the war , with $ 600 billion already wasted .
Total costs , especially counting decades of care for thousands of soldiers and Marines injured in Iraq , will run $ 1 - 2 trillion , and perhaps as much as $ 4 trillion , according to Nobel laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz .
Moreover , those who hoped to bolster American influence have left the U.S. hated and alone .
American power and credibility have been squandered even as Iran and North Korea have moved forward with nuclear weapons programs , China and Russia have begun cooperating against America , and Europe has distanced itself from U.S. policies .
The Mideast is even more unstable than usual , Iran ’s influence has grown , and America ’s reputation in the region is at a recent nadir .
As Andrew Bacevich of Boston University puts it , " The neoconservatives brazenly ignore or minimize all that we have flung away in lives , dollars , political influence , moral standing , and lost opportunities .
They have to : once acknowledged , those costs make the folly of the entire neoconservative project apparent . "
Yet after five years , these costs continue .
No matter to those convinced that the U.S. simply has n’t killed enough people , bombed enough cities , or invaded enough cities .
Alas , writes Bacevich , " Only the truly demented will imagine that simply trying harder will produce different results . "
And even if the U.S. succeeds , whatever that means , the cost will be far too high .
McCain is left to argue that never mind what happened , we should focus on the future .
However , he does not deserve a free pass on his monumental mistakes and Panglossian fantasies about America ’s ability to engage in global social engineering .
Indeed , McCain ’s misjudgments do not stop with the decision to go to war .
He was one of Ahmed Chalabi ’s many hapless dupes , believing the tales spun by the émigré fraudster who hoped to ride American tanks to Baghdad ’s presidential palace .
McCain said of Chalabi , " He ’s a patriot who has the best interest of his country at heart . "
Yet Chalabi ’s organization , the Iraqi National Congress , collected tens of millions of dollars from the U.S. government in return for providing fictitious intelligence from supposed defectors , misinformation which helped induce the Bush administration to go to war .
No surprise , reports Chalabi biographer Aram Roston , the ambitious émigré favored McCain in 2000 : " Chalabi knew that he would be able to free up the $ 97 million in military aid plus millions pushed through in Congress and earmarked for Chalabi ’s exile group , the Iraqi National Congress . "
Sen .
McCain also makes much of his supposed prescience in criticizing the administration ’s extraordinary incompetence in Iraq .
Yet while military officers and outside analysts criticized the Bush administration ’s manifestly inadequate pre-war planning , McCain stayed silent .
Chicago Tribune columnist Steve Chapman points out that " McCain did n’t declare  no confidence ’ in [ Donald Rumsfeld ] until a year and a half after the invasion . "
McCain even lauded the former defense secretary after he was dumped by President Bush .
McCain has yet to get anything right .
John Judis summarizes McCain ’s record : " He was wrong about Chalabi , he was wrong about Iraq ’s ties to al - Qaeda and WMD , he was wrong about the reaction of Iraqis to the invasion , and he was wrong about the effects on the wider Muslim world . "
But assume the past is past .
Given how wrong McCain has been from the beginning , why credit his argument that withdrawal will lead to catastrophe ?
He warns of chaos , but what does he think we ’ve had over the last five years ?
McCain also cites the prospect of " genocide , " but that ’s highly unlikely to occur in Iraq , given the sectarian cleansing already underway .
An American withdrawal might lead to a bitter civil war , but America ’s presence also fosters conflict .
Better a civil war without than with the U.S .
Indeed , with both sides opposed to a long - term occupation , Washington is likely to find itself under increasing pressure from both sides .
An American withdrawal would force Iraqis and their neighbors to confront the possibility of civil war , rather than expecting Washington to resolve the conflict .
They might not rise to the challenge , but as John Podesta , Ray Takeyh , and Lawrence Korb observed in the Washington Post : " Iraq today belongs to Iraqis ; it is an ancient civilization with its own norms and tendencies .
It is entirely possible that in the absence of a cumbersome and clumsy American occupation , Iraqis will make their own bargains and compacts , heading off the genocide that many seem to anticipate . "
Oh , but if we leave " we ’ll be back , because al - Qaeda will then succeed , " claims McCain .
In making this argument John McCain demonstrates that he is no expert on Iraq .
The faction most likely to fail in Iraq is al - Qaeda , since it is hated by everyone else , including its former Sunni allies .
Even dispossessed Baathist insurgents want to regain power , not end Iraqi civilization .
With al - Qaeda rather than the U.S. as the center of Iraqi dissatisfaction , the group ’s end would come quickly .
But McCain apparently believes that if al - Qaeda loses in Iraq , its members will invade America .
He claimed that " If we leave Iraq , they are going to follow us home . "
Again , the unspecified " they . "
Baathists upset at losing power and Shiites busy " cleansing " their neighborhoods of Sunnis will immediately jump on al - Qaeda troop ships  or maybe Saddam Hussein ’s vaunted unmanned aerial vehicles which the Bush administration never located  and head to America .
Actually , it ’s a lot easier for angry young Arabic - speaking Middle Eastern men to get to Iraq and wreak havoc than to set up shop in the U.S. Anyway , most desire to get away from Americans , not visit America .
Finally , McCain warns of the hit against Washington ’s reputation if the U.S. withdraws and " al - Qaeda tells the world they defeated the United States of America . "
Actually , that ’s the least of our worries .
As noted earlier , Al - Qaeda is losing in Iraq because the Shia and Kurds hate the terrorist group and even Sunni opponents of the Shiite - dominated central government have turned against it .
Any al - Qaeda victory claim would be short - lived as the group was eradicated in any ensuing civil or sectarian conflict .
Washington ’s reputation would still suffer , but that prospect offers additional evidence , as if additional evidence was necessary , that the U.S. should not put its reputation at risk needlessly .
" No more Iraqs " would be a more sensible response to the Bush debacle than " In Iraq forever . "
In short , McCain ’s position on Iraq alone should disqualify him from the presidency .
Americans cannot afford to elect as president someone so divorced from reality with such a foolishly aggressive philosophy .
But John McCain is not just for war in Iraq .
" There ’s going to be other wars , " he explained .
On Good Morning America he declared that he was prepared to send U.S. troops " anywhere . "
He did n’t bother to specify where he thinks these wars are most likely to occur , but his rhetoric suggests that he is planning at least one war on every continent .
Well , not yet in North America or Antarctica .
But give him time .
John McCain has turned his vaunted expertise on Iran , declaring that Iran ’s Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is " evil "  a perfectly truthful but utterly unhelpful statement .
After all , scores of heads of government around the world are " evil . "
Nor does Ahmadinejad ’s moral character matter much , since he does not control the nuclear program or security forces .
McCain also denounces Iran for sponsoring " Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations . "
Of course , Iran might respond that Washington should stop supporting Israel as it wreaks death and destruction in Palestinian territories and Lebanon .
Worthy of derision is McCain ’s concern " about the Iranian influence in Iraq and in the region . "
He even warns that after an American withdrawal from Iraq " then obviously the Iranian influence is dramatically increased . "
Does n’t he remember why this has happened ?
Because Washington overthrew Iran ’s chief enemy in the region .
Naturally , McCain finds the prospect of Iran possessing nuclear weapons to pose " an unacceptable risk . "
Tehran then might " sponsor terrorist attacks against any perceived enemy , " a curious charge to make against a nation currently denounced for supporting terrorists .
Anyway , Russia ’s and China ’s possession of nuclear weapons did not turn them into irresponsible , risk - taking , terrorism - generating nations .
Rather , deterrence caused both sides to be more cautious .
McCain worries that Tehran would pass nuclear materials on to terrorists , but why would the regime give away weapons and technology so dearly bought to groups that it can never completely control ?
Actually , American ally Pakistan poses the greatest risk of proliferation , having operated a Nukes - R - Us for years .
Perhaps McCain should suggest flattening Islamabad .
Finally , McCain argues that " Coupled with its ballistic missile arsenal , an Iranian nuclear capability would pose an immediate and existential threat to the State of Israel . "
But is n’t that why Israel has constructed 200 or more nuclear weapons ?
Iran ’s mullahs are evil , not stupid .
The evidence suggests that they are pragmatic politicians , not suicidal demagogues .
Even Osama bin Laden sends others to die ; he never sacrifices himself .
Israel is well able to defend itself .
Still , an Iran nuclear weapon would create , shall we say , " unpleasant " possibilities .
McCain advocates working with Europe to impose a " broad range of sanctions and punishments " on Tehran to " convince them that their activities , particularly development of nuclear weapons , is not a beneficial goal to seek . "
And if that does n’t work ?
McCain says that " every option must remain on the table " and that military action " remains , as it always must , the last option . "
Moreover , he asserts , " At the end of the day , we cannot afford having a nuclear - armed Iran . "
Similarly , he declared in a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference , " we will not permit a government that espouses the destruction of the State of Israel as its fondest wish and pledges undying enmity to the United States to possess the weapons to advance their malevolent ambitions . "
Indeed , he insists , " it is a simple operation of reality that there is only one thing worse than a military solution , and that , my friends , is a nuclear armed Iran . "
McCain vastly underplays the consequences of military action , just as he similarly underestimated the cost of the Iraq war .
The long - term consequences of the destruction of Iran ’s democracy movement , retaliation against Israel , deadly attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq , increased terrorism elsewhere , and widespread unrest throughout the Arab and Muslim worlds , would be enormous .
Moreover , any U.S. attack would convince the Iranians  and other states on the outs with Washington  of the necessity of developing nuclear weapons as the only means to avoid future American attacks .
None of this worries Sen. McCain .
Who could miss the rock star wannabe singing " Bomb , bomb , bomb , bomb , bomb Iran " to the tune of the Beach Boys ’ Barbara Ann .
For most people war is no laughing matter , but Sen .
McCain literally giggles at the possibility of unleashing death and destruction on the people of Iran .
Perhaps his seeming sangfroid reflects the fact there seems to be little he would n’t do for Israel .
This March he made the obligatory election - year visit .
Top of his rhetorical list was backing Jerusalem as Israel ’s capital .
McCain said he was on a " fact - finding " trip , but facts have never been relevant to his foreign policy .
He obviously does n’t understand the difference between backing Israel ’s right of survival and Israel ’s colonization of the West Bank and Gaza , despite the presence of four million Palestinians .
" Just as there will always be a proud , strong Israel , so too will there always be a close and enduring U.S. - Israel relationship , " he said , which in practice means doing whatever the most hawkish Israeli politicians demand .
Last summer McCain explained : " When it comes to the defense of Israel , we simply cannot compromise .
In view of the increased threats to Israel ’s security , American support for Israel should intensify  to include providing needed military equipment and technology and ensuring that Israel maintains its qualitative military edge . "
Since when is Israel ’s edge at risk ?
Israel is the regional superpower .
No country threatens its existence , even a nuclear Iran , which would face ruinous retaliation .
McCain also points to Hamas and Hezbollah , but the former has no military , and the latter has no offensive capability , other than missiles which it has used only as retaliation for Israeli action .
The real threat comes from an ever - growing Palestinian population under occupation .
Israel cannot be simultaneously Jewish and democratic if it rules over millions of Palestinians .
Yet Randy Scheunemann , McCain ’s chief foreign policy aide , says McCain " would never pressure Israel into making concessions that endanger its national security , " commonly understood to mean pressing Israel to withdraw its settlers from occupied lands .
Yet the settlements ensure continuing conflict .
McCain also has enthusiastically talked of war in Asia .
In January 2003 he claimed that North Korea was more dangerous than Iraq .
All that has been missing from McCain ’s approach is a fevered rendition of " Bomb , bomb , bomb , bomb , bomb North Korea . "
No one wants North Korea to have nuclear weapons , but McCain is completely wrong when he claims that " North Korea ’s pursuit of a nuclear arsenal directly threatens the security of the American people . "
That ’s nonsense .
Kim Jong
Il wants his virgins today , not in the hereafter .
Absent the presence of American troops in South Korea  of no security value , since the South vastly outranges Pyongyang on virtually every measure of national power  the North has no way of striking America .
In any case , North Korea is easily deterred by Washington ’s vast nuclear arsenal .
McCain backs sanctions against Pyongyang while refusing to talk to the Kim regime ( a position which even the Bush administration finally realized was counterproductive ) .
Moreover , he has threatened North Korea with " extinction . "
McCain also wrote : " The use of military force to defend vital American security interests must always be a last resort , as it is in this crisis .
But if we fail to achieve the international cooperation necessary to end this threat , then the countries in the region should know with certainty that while they may risk their own populations , the United States will do whatever it must to guarantee the security of the American people . "
Never mind that unleashing war on the Korean peninsula likely would destroy Seoul , whose metropolitan area contains 23 million people , half South Korea ’s population .
Explained McCain : " spare us the usual lectures about American unilateralism .
We would prefer the company of North Korea ’s neighbors , but we will make do without it if we must . "
McCain also was an enthusiastic backer of the war against Serbia over Kosovo , a conflict in which America had no stake .
The world is filled with nasty civil wars and our allies , the Kosovo Liberation Army , had previously been termed terrorists by a U.S. diplomat and later kicked out a quarter of a million Serbs , Roma , and others from Kosovo .
Yet McCain wanted not just a war , but a ground war .
He was the chief supporter of a congressional resolution authorizing the Clinton administration to use force against Serbia , and denounced President Clinton for not sending in ground forces .
Said McCain : " The president does n’t want the power he possesses by law because the risks inherent in its exercise have paralyzed him . "
He deployed the usual arguments  not to win would lose America respect by friends and enemies alike .
Since then , McCain has benefited from substantial campaign support from Albanian - Americans .
Lobbyist Joe DioGuardi declared earlier this year that McCain " did everything that we asked of him , including arming the KLA . "
Naturally , McCain has endorsed Kosovo ’s recent declaration of independence , which is sending tremors across the Balkans and well beyond , as would - be nations from the Republic of Srpska in Bosnia to Abkhazia and Ossetia in Georgia to the Palestinian territories to Taiwan consider making similar declarations .
The key question McCain will face as president : will he use American troops to compel minority Serbs in the north of Kosovo to remain part of a new country they do not recognize instead of being allowed to exercise their own right of self - determination to stay with Serbia ?
Sen .
McCain missed getting his Kosovo ground war in 1999 , but President McCain might have his chance next year .
McCain wants NATO to keep expanding .
He currently is lobbying to include Albania , Croatia , and Macedonia , and to approve Georgia and Ukraine for the so - called " Membership Action Plan , " which would put them on track for eventual NATO membership .
The first three countries never have been relevant to America ’s security and remain entangled in multiple controversies with their neighbors .
Offering to defend the latter two is even more dangerous , since they have unresolved conflicts with Russia .
It ’s not even obvious how America would intervene in the event of a showdown , absent threatening to use nuclear weapons .
Is the security of Kiev and Tbilisi worth risking Washington , D.C. and New York City ?
One would hope that it never came to that , but it is foolish to assume the U.S. can rely on bluster and threats to deter other nations from defending what they view as vital interests .
America would not so easily cave in .
Neither will America ’s potential adversaries .
But McCain does n’t believe Europe should be the only location of European wars .
In 2006 McCain called on NATO to evolve " from a territorial defense mission to an expeditionary alliance . "
Last month he advocated that NATO " be as international in scope  partnering with willing democracies all over the world  as the challenges we confront . "
McCain also has advocated creation of a league of democracies to " act when the UN fails , " including imposing sanctions and possibly using force , though McCain has n’t been entirely clear on the latter point .
( What does relieving " human suffering in places such as Darfur " mean in practice ? )
He seems determined to drag America ’s allies into new wars around the globe .
Is there no country which he would not attempt to micromanage ?
Alas , it is not just in the Mideast , Asia , and Europe where John McCain sees his " many wars " being fought .
Biographer Matt Welch warns : " the most militaristic presidential candidate since Ulysses S. Grant has provided a clear answer [ to questions over Washington ’s use of force ] :
If you think George W. Bush had an itchy trigger finger , you ai n’t seen nothing yet . "
No wonder Teddy Roosevelt is an idol of McCain ’s  Roosevelt , a racist imperialist , variously favored war against Germany , Great Britain , and Spain , as well as " uncivilized " peoples around the world .
McCain says that he looks " back at America ’s failure to act to prevent genocide in Rwanda with shame . "
He explained in 2000 that Washington should intervene " If Rwanda again became a scene of horrible genocide , if there was a way that the U.S. could stop . "
But the only way to have prevented that tragedy would have been an invasion  yet another war in which Americans had nothing directly at stake .
Twelve years ago he advocated military intervention , through the United Nations and NATO , which would have meant the U.S. in practice , to " rescue " Darfur .
Last year he announced in Foreign Affairs : " Africa continues to offer the most compelling case for humanitarian intervention .
With respect to the Darfur region of Sudan , I fear that the United States is once again repeating the mistakes it made in Bosnia and Rwanda .
In Bosnia , we acted late but eventually saved countless lives .
In Rwanda , we stood by and watched the slaughter and later pledged that we could not do so again .
The genocide in Darfur demands U.S. leadership .
My administration will consider the use of all elements of American power to stop the outrageous acts of human destruction that have unfolded there . "
Even where war is not in the offing , all McCain can think of is confrontation .
He has pushed for " rogue state rollback " by supporting opposition groups  think Iraqi National Congress  to oust governments that threaten not just America ’s interests but also " values . "
Libya , which ultimately reached a peaceful accommodation with the U.S. , was on his enemies list in 2000 , along with Iraq and North Korea .
He declared that " I would arm , train , equip , both from without and from within , forces that would eventually overthrow the governments . "
He is outraged at the thought of even talking with the new Cuban leadership , let along lifting sanctions , which he voted to tighten .
Never mind that the half - century - old embargo has failed to improve the lot of the Cuban people .
In fact , he believes , the U.S. should indict Fidel and Raúl Castro while preparing for a democratic transition in Cuba  just as Washington has been breathlessly preparing for such a transition for decades .
Moreover , McCain writes , Venezuela threatens " the security and prosperity of the Americas " and must be marginalized , whatever that means .
He contends that the U.S. should have applied sanctions against Russia over the war in Chechnya .
Moscow also should be kicked out of the G - 8 , replaced by nations such as Brazil and India .
And NATO " should make clear that the solidarity of NATO , from the Baltic to the Black Sea , is indivisible . "
McCain even traveled to the disputed territory of South Ossetia in Georgia to denounce South Ossetians who desired independence and Moscow for backing them .
Moreover , as Washington prepared to spend more money ( adjusted for inflation ) on the military than at any time since World War II , he challenged China over its decision to spend about a quarter as much money on defense .
After all , Beijing ’s development of a force capable of deterring American attacks constitutes " provocative acts . "
Further , the U.S. should " react " to Chinese threats against Taiwan , aid to " pariah states , " and attempts to exclude America from " regional forums and economic arrangements . "
Although McCain talks endlessly about democracy , he rejected calls for Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf ’s resignation after Pakistani voters repudiated Musharraf ’s party .
McCain said that Musharraf was " legitimately elected , " even though the latter relied on a state of an emergency to toss out any judges unlikely to rule in his favor .
Never mind what the Pakistani people think .
Nor does the end of a war , any war , reduce McCain ’s commitment to fight another war .
South Korea and Japan have grown up and can defend themselves .
The Europeans have a larger economy and population than America .
But we must stay everywhere , apparently forever .
Explains McCain : " I have an open - ended commitment in Asia .
I have an open - ended commitment in South Korea .
I have an open - ended commitment in Bosnia .
I have an open - ended commitment in Europe . "
Perhaps McCain ’s willingness to irritate , anger , enrage , and threaten countries all over the world reflects his myopic view that " the transcendent challenge of the 21st century is radical Islamic extremists . "
Terrorism is nasty , but poses no existential threat akin to war with Nazi Germany , the Soviet Union , or the China of the future .
Apparently McCain confuses a loose collection of transnational terrorists , which has been strengthened by America ’s invasion of Iraq , with industrialized and militarized nation states .
It ’s a nonsensical comparison .
Likely to be far more important than attacks by al - Qaeda in the future , and far more decisive in shaping our world , are ongoing disagreements with Russia , impending challenges from China , likely controversies involving emerging powers from Brazil and India , and endless complications arising from a kaleidoscope of nations being transformed in the new globalized world order .
Apparently even McCain realizes that fighting all of his wars and maintaining all of his open - ended commitments wo n’t be easy .
It means a major military build - up , including an extra 70,000 soldiers for the Army and 25,000 Marines .
It means better training .
It means additional equipment .
It means more money , and spending money more wisely .
( We all know how unlikely the latter is ! )
But never mind the expense since , McCain notes , the defense budget " currently consumes less than four cents of every dollar that our economy generates  far less than what we spent during the Cold War . "
Of course , since the economy is much larger today , that percentage generates far more money at a time when the threats are far less dangerous .
McCain , in contrast to George W. Bush and Richard Cheney , among many other ivory tower faux warriors , actually was willing to fight and risk death .
But like the neocons , he is still far too ready to risk the lives of other Americans for causes not vital to our nation ’s security .
Indeed , he has harshly attacked those who advocate that America return to a traditional republican foreign policy .
The election in November should come down to foreign policy .
John McCain lacks the temperament , knowledge , and philosophy necessary to be a wise military commander - in - chief .
He is the last person who should be answering any 3 am phone calls at the White House .
A federal judge ruled Wednesday that the government cannot use mismatched Social Security data to root out illegal immigrants from the workforce , declaring that such enforcement actions would do “ irreparable harm to innocent workers and employers . ”
In a major defeat for the Bush administration , U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer issued a preliminary injunction temporarily preventing the Department of Homeland Security from beginning a program to punish companies that do not clear up discrepancies between their workers ’ names and Social Security numbers .
The decision comes after labor , civil liberties and immigrants ’ rights groups filed a lawsuit to stop the department from using Social Security “ no - match ” letters for immigration enforcement .
“ The government ’s proposal to disseminate no - match letters affecting more than 8 million workers will , under the mandated timeline , result in the termination of employment to lawfully employed workers , ” Breyer wrote in a 22 - page ruling .

Business groups hailed the decision .
“ It ’s a signal to the government that they ca n’t do anything they want simply by calling it enforcement , ” said Randel Johnson , a vice president with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .
“ The Department of Homeland Security overstepped its bounds on this one . ”
Administration officials , groups that oppose illegal immigration and some members of Congress were critical of the ruling .
Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said he would consider mounting a legal challenge or issuing a modified rule that addressed the judge ’s concerns .
He said his department would continue to pursue other forms of employer enforcement , including criminal prosecution .

“ This is only one arrow in a whole quiver full of strategies that we are undertaking to continue to increase enforcement efforts directed at employers who hire illegals , ” Chertoff said .
“ Our commitment to enforcement is not going to be frustrated or diminished because we have hit a bump on this one particular element of the strategy . ”
The injunction will remain in place until it is either overturned on appeal or the judge makes a final ruling after trial , which could be months away , attorneys said .
For years , the Social Security Administration has sent no -match letters to employers with workers whose names did not match their numbers on file , but the letters had never been used to sanction employers that may have hired illegal workers .
To get jobs , undocumented immigrants often use false or stolen Social Security numbers .
Under the new regulation , Chertoff had warned companies that they could face criminal or civil liability if they received a letter and did not clear up the discrepancies within 90 days .

After Congress failed to agree on an overhaul of the nation ’s immigration rules this summer , the administration announced a number of measures -- including the no-match regulation -- designed to toughen enforcement by administrative means .
Beginning in September , the Social Security agency had planned to mail 140,000 letters to businesses that have at least 10 employees with discrepancies .
But before the letters could be sent , the coalition filed its suit against the Homeland Security Department and the Social Security Administration , and a judge issued a temporary restraining order .
The groups , which included the AFL - CIO , the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Immigration Law Center , argued that the enforcement would have led to the firings of U.S. citizens and documented workers .
They presented their case to Breyer during a hearing in San Francisco last week and hailed Wednesday ’s decision as a victory .
“ The administration showed a callous disregard for legal workers and citizens by adopting a rule that punishes innocent workers and employers under the guise of so - called immigration enforcement , ” said Lucas Guttentag , director of the ACLU Immigrants ’
Rights Project and one of the attorneys on the case .
“ The court ’s decision exposed the new rule ’s fatal flaw by recognizing that no-match letters are based on error - filled Social Security records . ”

An attorney for the AFL - CIO said the department ’s rule also would have led to discrimination against foreign - born employees and retaliation against those who tried to organize .
“ This is a particularly important day for the labor movement because the Social Security no -match letters have long been used to defeat worker organizing , ” said Ana Avendano .
“ Today Judge Breyer sent a clear statement that these letters are not to be used in that way . ”
Members of Congress who favored stiffer workplace enforcement criticized the ruling .
“ What part of ‘ illegal ’ does Judge Breyer not understand ? ” Rep. Brian P. Bilbray ( R - Solano Beach ) said in a statement .
“ Using a Social Security number that does not belong to you is a felony .
Judge Breyer is compromising the rule of law principles that he took an oath to uphold . ”

Rick Oltman of Californians for Population Stabilization called employers that received no - match letters and did not clarify their workers ’ status irresponsible .
The DHS rule would have helped to ensure that employees were authorized to work in the United States , he said .
“ This is just another step to make sure that people are eligible for those jobs , which we all agree is the No. 1 magnet attracting people to this country , ” he said .
But Larry Rohlfes , assistant executive director of the California Landscape Contractors Assn. , said the rule would have been tough on employers .
Employers would have faced the choice of complying or going out of business , he said .
Advertisement
Businesses and immigrants ’ rights groups said the judge ’s ruling underscored the need for comprehensive immigration reform .
In his ruling , Breyer wrote that the scope of the rule was “ staggering ” and the effects of its implementation “ severe . ”
The 90 - day deadline would have imposed a burden on employers , prompting them to develop costly personnel systems and fire workers who may be legally employed , he wrote .
“ There is a strong likelihood that employers may simply fire employees who are unable to resolve the discrepancy within 90 days , even if the employees are actually authorized to work . ”
Breyer also ruled that the government did not follow mandated requirements before changing its policy on how to use no -match letters .
Although mismatched Social Security data could be evidence that someone is unauthorized to work , it also could be caused by a typo or name change , he wrote .

Tom Nassif , president and chief executive of Irvine - based Western Growers , an agricultural trade association , said employers were not trying to avoid their responsibility to employ authorized workers .
“ The question is much more complex than , ‘ Are they legal or are they illegal ? ’
The question is whether we have the time to investigate and come to a correct conclusion as to whether or not they ’re truly here legally . ”

HOW did UBS , a Swiss bank whose core business is the staid one of wealth management , manage to lose $ 38 billion betting on American mortgage - backed assets , battering its core capital and share price in the process ?
Shareholders , out in force at the bank 's annual meeting on Wednesday April 23rd in Basel , asked just that question .
The mystery is being resolved .
On Monday the bank released a summary of an internal investigation into the causes of the write - downs that had been demanded by the Swiss Federal Banking Commission .
The 400 - page report is now being chewed over by the regulator .
Rivals should read it too .
The report gives three broad explanations for the bank 's woes .
The investment - banking arm 's preoccupation with growth , the reliance of the control team on flawed measures of risk and the culture of the bank .
Start with those growth plans .
Many had assumed that Dillon Read Capital Management ( DRCM ) , a hedge fund set up by UBS in 2005 and closed in 2007 , was the primary culprit for the write - downs ; in fact its contribution was modest .
The more pernicious effect of DRCM was to deprive UBS of some of its most experienced people and to distract its senior management at a time when the investment bank was pursuing a strategy of rapid expansion .
The growth was focused on fixed income , an area where UBS particularly lagged competitors .
The goal was to drive itself up the league tables by expanding in areas such as structured credit and commodities .
The effect , says the report , was to grow too fast and emphasise revenue at the expense of risk .
The end result : a desk that numbered just 35 - 40 people at its peak was responsible for write - downs of some $ 12 billion in 2007 , two - thirds of the total .
If the bank 's risk takers overlooked risk , its risk controllers miscalculated it .
Probing questions could and should have revealed the scale of the risks that UBS was taking .
Concerns were raised at various times in 2006 and 2007 .
The bank 's top executives were sufficiently attuned to the deterioration in the American housing market to have raised it in September 2006 .
But the report says that they were fobbed off by assurances from executives at the investment bank that all was well .
The investment bank 's bosses only realised the depth of the hole they were in by late July by which time it was too late to do much about it .
There is no suggestion that anything untoward was going on .
Assurances that risks were being properly managed were given in good faith , says Rupert Jolley , who led the investigation .
But there was also a clear incentive to set aside any doubts so long as revenues were rising .
The report only deals with write - downs up to the end of last year .
Nonetheless it asks some awkward questions of the bank now .
If the culture of the bank was at fault , then can an insider such as Peter Kurer , plucked from the position of general counsel to replace Marcel Ospel , the former chairman , fix it ?
One large shareholder describes the combination of Mr Kurer and Marcel Rohner , the chief executive , as “ terrifyingly weak ” .
The report also notes that the issue of subprime exposures jostled unsuccessfully with several other items on the agenda of group - level meetings ( leveraged finance got plenty of attention , by contrast ) : that will reinforce the doubts of those who think that the bank has become too complicated to manage .
Perhaps most worrying of all for battered shareholders is the implication of the investigation 's findings for UBS 's sizeable remaining exposures to the American housing market , including $ 16 billion - worth of Alt - A positions that were still on the balance sheet at the end of March .
There is scant reason to assume that these positions were researched or hedged more effectively than their subprime sisters .
The rest of the industry can hardly rest easy either .
UBS got more things wrong than most but the traps it fell into will be familiar to its peers .
Lots of other investment banks measure their status via league tables and seek to bulk up where they are weakest .
Compensation and funding structures that fail to distinguish “ alpha ” , or skill , from simple carry trades are widespread .
The flaws in measuring risk , and the emphasis on net rather than notional exposures , are also known hazards .
The investigation found no evidence to suggest that regulators criticised the way UBS managed its risks .
The banking commission sits in judgement now ; it might usefully have done so earlier .
No one has ever proposed helping real estate speculators .
And the senator ’s language obscures the reality that most troubled homeowners did not get into trouble by themselves .
Lenders , aided and abetted by bankers and do - nothing regulators , lured many borrowers into overly complex , ultimately unaffordable loans .
Mr. McCain also failed to grasp that the foreclosure problem has gone far beyond the issue of the deserving and undeserving .
What is on the line now is the health of the economy , including the viability of the financial system :
Helping troubled borrowers stay in their homes would help the banks by reducing defaults and foreclosures .
The question now is not whether the government should intervene , but how .
The two Democratic candidates clearly understand that better than the White House or Senator McCain .
Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama have called for a bigger role for the Federal Housing Administration that would allow it to restructure or refinance more troubled loans .
Both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama have endorsed the best idea currently on the table to prevent foreclosure : amending the law so that troubled borrowers can have their mortgages modified in bankruptcy court .
That would give lenders a big incentive to work with borrowers — reducing interest or lowering principal balances — before they opted for bankruptcy protection .
Mrs. Clinton also has called for $ 30 billion in federal funds to bolster state and local foreclosure - prevention efforts and has proposed a 90 - day moratorium on foreclosures and a rate freeze on subprime adjustable mortgages .
Those measures also could help , but as the crisis has developed , the problem has become less one of resetting interest rates and more one of borrowers owing more than their homes are worth .
Bankruptcy reform is a better way to deal with that problem .
The country , of course , cannot wait for the next president to be inaugurated to seriously address the foreclosure problem  although we fear that Mr. Bush still does n’t see the urgency or the full dangers of inaction .
The candidates ’ prescriptions for the mortgage mess are an important guide to what sort of leader he or she would be .
After eight years of Mr. Bush ’s serial failures , what the country needs is a president who is willing to recognize when the government ’s help is essential  and who is ready to use government power wisely .

The Urgent vs. the Important In Our Lives
photo credit : Film Colourist
While visiting friends a few weeks ago , I noticed a change that I was n’t too thrilled about .
Technology was beginning to take over their lives .
Literally .
Over the last six months , technology had changed the way my friends socialized .
Before , you could hold a lengthy and meaningful conversation with them without any distractions .
Now , you ca n’t go 90 seconds without checking the latest text message on their phone .
But the worst part is that you could be in mid-sentence and hear a little “ ding ! ” and either friend would instantly whip out their phone and start texting a reply .
Sometimes they ’d try to fake acting interested in your conversation with a nod and a “ uh huh ” , proving yet again that multi- tasking never works .
Other times they ’d politely interrupt and say , “ Sorry , one minute .
My friend texted me . ”
Even though there was an apology , what I heard was “ One sec… you ’re not as important as my other friend ” .
Does this sound familiar to anyone ?
This is a perfect example of how we ’ve started to let our lives be overrun by the urgent , not the important .
Instead of talking to the person in front of them , they were willing to interrupt a conversation for a more urgent input : their cellphone .
The Urgent
It ’s incredibly interesting what we ’ll do when an urgent stimuli ( the “ ding ! ” of a text message , for example ) rears it ’s ugly head .
Text messages are the worst offender .
We ’ll hear the text go off , and even while trying to concentrate , the only thing we can think about is the text message .
Why ?
Because it ’s an urgent prompt .
It ’s begging for your attention .
Other forms of urgent inputs :
Cell phones / text messages
IM
Twitter ( it ’s true ! )
Email ( especially with pop-ups )
The Important
So what are the things that we should be worried about , the “ important ” things in our lives ?
Easy .
The things that last and provide value .
Friends / Family –
There ’s nothing more important in life than friends and family .
They are directly linked to our happiness and well - being .
– There ’s nothing more important in life than friends and family .
They are directly linked to our happiness and well - being .
Life Goals – Goals that we ’ve set that want to be accomplished eventually .
– Goals that we ’ve set that want to be accomplished eventually .
Projects due / commitments –
These are n’t necessarily related to work .
– These are n’t necessarily related to work .
Health– Taking care of our bodies is incredibly important .
Personal health is something that greatly adds to our level of happiness ( believe it or not ) .
Unfortunately , focusing on the urgent ensures that we ’ll never get to the important .
In order to make sure we ’re doing what ’s important , we need to find a way to ignore the urgent and focus on the important with steely resolve .
I struggle with this daily .
( As I write this I ’ve had 2 text messages and the doorbell rang ! )
As a person who makes his bread working on a computer , I find that it ’s quite easy to get distracted .
The web is a beautiful and social place , but not one well - suited for productivity .
Eliminating urgent inputs is something that is going to continue to grow in importance , especially with the widespread adoption of iphones and the like .
Our world is continually becoming more connected .
As a result , it ’s going to be much harder to filter out the urgent stimuli .
How about you ?
Are there any methods that you use to really combat these urgent messages in our everyday lives ?
OQO Talk
While greeted with heaps of initial skepticism , forum jockeys over atnow seem convinced that a junior member by the name of TRF has successfully hacked the OQO to run OS X Leopard .
Adding a video filmed by Mr. Blurry Cam did n't hurt the cause .
TRF 's OQO is setup in a dual - boot Vista / OS X mode which boots Leopard in about 2 minutes and 30 seconds .
WiFi , sound , power management and Bluetooth ... it's all there with applications popping with serious snap .
The only thing missing at the moment is WWAN access which TRF is now testing .
While not yet a " plug and play " hack , it 's " definitely doable , " he says .
Perhaps , but we 'll need more details to say the least .

The cornerstone of science - based medicine is , of course , scientific research .
The integrity and quality of biomedical research is therefore of critical importance and to be thoughtfully and jealously guarded , if we care about maintaining an optimal standard of care .
There are many threats and hazards to the institutions of medical research – mostly ideological .
One that has not been discussed much on this blog but has been in the news recently is that of conflict of interest .
Upon close examination this is a more complex issue than it may at first appear .
The most recent controversy over conflicts of interest were sparked by an article published in JAMA in which the authors allege that published studies that downplayed the risks of Vioxx ( A Cox - 2 inhibitor marketed as a pain killer that was removed from the market for increased cardiac risk ) were in fact ghost - written by employees of Merck , the manufacturer of Vioxx .
The names of two academic researchers were then attached to the studies to give them legitimacy .
If true this is a damning episode , and no one would reasonably disagree with the contention that companies writing research on their own products represents an unacceptable conflict of interest .
For the record , both Merk and the one surviving academic deny the accusations completely .
Many other forms of potential conflict of interest have also been raised in the discussion of medical research .
Journals now require that authors disclose any financial ties to the subject of their research .
Some of these conflicts are clear , for example – owning stock in the company who manufactures or sells the object of research , or holding a patent in the drug or technology .
In any situation in which the outcome of research will affect the value of a researcher ’s stock or patent there is a clear and unambiguous conflict .
Other conflicts that are fairly clear include researchers or academics who receive large sums of money for consulting fees or similar from a company that they then conduct research for .
If a substantial portion of one ’s income could be threatened by an unfavorable outcome of one ’s research , a conflict is clear .
Regarding regulatory agencies , it is clear that regulators should not be rendering decisions regarding companies from whom they are accepting consulting fees or for whom they expect to work .
Then there are more subtle or questionable forms of conflict , and this is where there is great controversy .
Minor ties to companies are common for academics .
For example , small speaking fees are often given to experts with reputations in their field .
Recognized experts are also frequently consulted for their expertise .
Experts , for example , are often consulted to help decide fruitful avenues of future research , or to design clinical trials .
In response to the recent attention given to cases of conflict of interest or the appearance of such conflict , many institutions now require full disclosure on the part of their faculty .
Typically a threshold of significance – – $ 5,000 - $ 10,000 for example – is often used .
This is in addition to the requirements of most journals from their authors .
Research consortia may also have their own disclosure requirements .
In response to worry over the appearance of conflict , many academics are simply not supplementing their earnings with the occasional lecture or consultation .
It is simply easier to avoid future conflict and accusations .
Not everyone agrees that this trend toward avoiding any appearance of conflict is an unalloyed boon to medical research .
Elizabeth Whelan , writing in the Washington Times , points out that frivolous accusations of conflict has a “ chilling ” effect on the conduct of industry research .
We all benefit from a productive a collaborative relationship between industry and the best minds in medical academia .
Scaring off these experts from the most minor relationship with industry could hurt the quality of research .
There is also a growing trend to use the accusation of conflict , even when it is slight and questionable , to dismiss the findings of research inconvenient to ones own interests or ideology .
For example , those who claim , falsely , that there is an association between vaccines and autism have used the slightest appearance of conflict to dismiss the evidence against any role of vaccines in autism .
There also seems to be an unfair asymmetry .
While mainstream medicine is wrangling with this thorny issue , those on the fringe may ignore their own conflicts .
For example , Andrew Wakefield is accused of receiving consulting fees from attorneys who were suing for vaccine injuries while he was conducting research supporting such a connection .
Conclusion
The issue of conflict of interest in medical research is a serious one .
The medical profession needs to resist the urge to “ circle the wagons ” while taking a serious and open look at this issue .
I think they have largely done so , but more work is to be done .
However , we should not go so far as to stigmatize even minor connections to industry or allow the weeding out of genuine conflicts turn into a thoughtless witch hunt .
We should further be critical of those who use the accusation of conflict where one does not genuinely exist as a weapon against research the results of which they dislike .
As in many things , a proper balance is optimal .
I think we are evolving toward a reasonable balance .
Academics and experts should be able to provide their experience and expertise to industry and be appropriately compensated for their time and efforts .
But industry should be prevented from putting their thumb on the scale of medical research , to gain the outcomes they desire by the application of funding and fees .
This should not be an intractable problem as long as we are thoughtful , consider all sides of the equation , and do n’t allow bias and ideology to rule over reason .
JACKSON , Mississippi ( CNN ) --
Girls as young as 13 say they were shackled for weeks at a time in Mississippi .
Erica was 16 when she was forced to wear leg shackles at a Mississippi detention center , she said .
A Texas teen was allegedly offered birthday cake in exchange for sex .
A guard drove his knee into the neck of a frail suicidal Ohio boy after the youth was wrestled to the ground and held down by other guards who stripped him and covered his face with a smock , a state report said .
More than two dozen girls at an Indiana lock - up describe " networking " -- their term for sneaking into each other 's cells to have sex , with no interference from guards .
This is a glimpse into what America 's juvenile jails look like , according to lawsuits , criminal cases and experts who have spent years delving into what they call a broken system .
" It 's a nationwide crisis that has been going on for years , one the public has never been told the extent of , " said psychiatric social worker Jerome Miller , the co-founder of the National Center on Institutions and Alternatives , who has evaluated and helped reform juvenile jails for more than three decades .
This summer , Mississippi plans to close Columbia Training School , a juvenile facility that houses mostly minor offenders .
They are often runaways from abusive homes .
Listen to stories of Mississippi's teen lock - ups »
Erica was 16 when she was sentenced to Columbia after running away , a probation violation of an earlier marijuana conviction .
She admits she was a girl quick to sass her parents , full of anger about the death of a relative that happened around the same time Katrina wrecked her family 's Bay St. Louis , Mississippi , home .
Nervously touching a sparkly barrette in her red hair , she cries as she describes how guards forced her legs into tight metal shackles .
She said she was cuffed and chained when she ate and used the bathroom -- and was even forced to play soccer that way against other girls .
Guards called her " Chain Gang , " she said .
" I will always remember them things around my ankles , the way they cut into me , " she said , pulling up her pant leg to show slash - mark scars on her ankles and heels .
" They made you feel like you were nothing . "
Watch teen explain suicide attempt was cry for help »
Represented by attorneys with the Southern Poverty Law Center , Erica and nine other girls housed at Columbia are suing the state , claiming they endured a range of sexual and physical abuse , including shackling .
Don Desper , a licensed therapist and former employee at Columbia who opposed the practice , told CNN it was used to prevent the teens from escaping .
In a handwritten affidavit , a 15 - year - old girl described a male guard molesting her .
She wrote : " He came inside my cell half way half of his body and he started touching me and he tryed ( sic ) to kiss me and then he left he came back with my snack in his hand and he opened my cell again and he started grabbing me around my waist and he tryed ( sic ) to stick his hands in my pants and I started crying . "
When the lawsuit was filed in 2007 , a U.S. Justice Department monitor was making periodic inspections at Columbia as part of a 2005 settlement with Mississippi in a previous case .
The Justice investigation that led to that settlement found Columbia youths were hog-tied , forced to strip and eat their own vomit and were held in isolation in what was called the " Dark Room , " a windowless room with a hole in the floor used as a toilet .
Read the Justice Department report that describes girls being shackled to poles
Hundreds of youths have allegedly suffered similar abuse at juvenile detention centers across the United States , according to experts interviewed by CNN and court records checked for this story .
Feds sue 11 jurisdictions Arkansas
Georgia
Hawaii
Indiana
Maryland
Mississippi
New Jersey
Oklahoma
Texas
Puerto Rico
Northern Mariana Islands
The U.S. Justice Department has sued nine states and two territories alleging abuse , inadequate mental and medical care and potentially dangerous methods like the use of restraints .
The department does n't have the power to shut down facilities -- states do -- but through litigation it can force a state to improve its detention centers and protect the civil rights of jailed youths .
Another facility under Justice scrutiny is Oakley Training School near Jackson , Mississippi , which was sued by the department at the same time as Columbia .
Gov. Haley Barbour recently announced Columbia 's inmates would be transferred this summer to Oakley when Columbia is closed .
But the Justice Department said Oakley has satisfied barely a fraction of requirements the department set for it years ago .
According to a March 2008 Justice report , there is an " enormous amount of work " needed to make Oakley a safe and productive place to rehabilitate troubled teens .
Barbour would not respond to questions for this report .
The Mississippi Department of Human Services , which runs Columbia and Oakley , refused to answer most of a CNN public records request citing pending litigation and also declined to be interviewed .
The U.S. Justice Department could not talk specifically about ongoing cases , but Lisa Krigsten , civil rights division principal deputy assistant attorney general , noted the department is going after double the number of juvenile jails for civil rights violations during the Bush administration than in any previous administration .
" We take this seriously and are committed to protecting the vulnerable children who are in these places , " she said .
A CNN check of other juvenile facilities shows that , despite years of court wrangling , serious problems persist .
In Ohio , a dozen employees at the Scioto Juvenile Correctional Facility have been indicted since 2003 on charges relating to physical and sexual abuse of youth , according to a May 2007 Justice report .
Five were convicted of various charges , including sexual battery and assault ; six cases were dismissed and a jury found one employee not guilty .
In January , a state - hired consultant blamed a " culture of violence " in Ohio 's juvenile jails for numerous abuses .
The expert 's report details examples of " egregious use of force " by guards and included a video he viewed of a 2007 incident in which a " frail " boy who was threatening to harm himself was restrained by guards .
The boy was wrestled to the ground , cuffed and stripped , with one guard seen putting his full body weight on the boy 's back while driving his knee into the boy 's neck .
A so - called " Suicide Smock " was placed " over his airways , " the report said .
" The youth actually screams that he can't breathe . "
In response to the report , the Ohio Department of Youth Services , which oversees detention facilities , has installed more surveillance cameras and beefed up its mental health care staff , spokeswoman Andrea Kruse said .
" We 're doing everything we can to improve , " she said .
On Thursday , Ohio announced settlement of a suit brought by Children 's Law Center of Kentucky .
It will add up to $ 30 million annually to its juvenile justice budget and hire more guards , psychologists and teachers for its system .
Accusations similar to those made in Ohio were made at a Florida boot camp in 2006 .
Martin Lee Anderson , 14 , was seen on surveillance tape being beaten and restrained by guards .
Anderson later died .
Seven guards and a nurse were acquitted of manslaughter in October .
Since then , the NAACP 's Florida chapter has called for an investigation of the state 's teen jails , noting at least seven youths have died at lock - ups since 2000 , including 17 - year - old Omar Paisley , who died at a Miami detention center of a ruptured appendix after begging for help during three days that he was in pain .
A grand jury found that two nurses repeatedly failed to help Paisley .
They are charged with third degree murder and manslaughter , have pleaded not guilty and are scheduled for trial in July .
Florida issued a report in January asking for more than 50 changes to its system and a partnership with the Department of Education to attack problems before kids drop out of school .
Overall , the report calls for treating troubled kids with therapy as an alternative to jail .
Texas is grappling with the fallout from reports of long - term sexual abuse at its facilities , where , since 2000 , more than 90 Texas Youth Commission employees -- roughly one a month -- have been sanctioned or fired for sexual misconduct with adolescents , commission spokesman Jim Hurley told CNN .
Texas granted early release in February to a 16 - year - old girl who attempted suicide after she was allegedly molested repeatedly by a male guard .
The guard was indicted in December on four counts of molesting the girl .
He was previously charged with raping four other female inmates , but those charges were dropped , said Hurley , after witnesses retracted their accounts .
This spring , two administrators at a west Texas youth facility are scheduled to stand trial on charges they were having sex with juvenile inmates , one allegedly enticing a teen to perform sex acts for birthday cake .
The men resigned in 2005 , Hurley said .
Texas recently has added hundreds more surveillance cameras and personnel to its facilities to avoid more problems , he said .
" Girls are sexually abused in these institutions more often than the public would believe , " said Paul DeMuro , a delinquency expert who in 2002 inspected Columbia for the Justice Department and is now a consultant for the Southern Poverty Law Center .
Nationwide , the Justice Department has said 2,821 allegations of sex abuse were made in 2004 , the most recent data on the topic available .
An Indiana juvenile judge said there 's another dimension of sexual misconduct happening at Indianapolis Juvenile Correctional Facility -- inmate on inmate sex .
State Judge Peter Nemeth is refusing to send female offenders to the lock - up after a team of delinquency experts interviewed a total of 31 girls at the facility .
The girls described " networking , " or sneaking into each other 's cells for sex .
Members of the team told CNN that locks on cells were not working , allowing the young women to leave and enter their cells whenever they wish .
One girl interviewed said a guard had participated in the sex .
" It 's a dangerous place , " said Nemeth , who is sending youths to two other facilities at more than twice the cost to taxpayers .
" It seems like chaos to me , very little discipline .
The girls say they are running the place . "
In March , the Indiana Department of Correction said it is transferring boys at the facility to another lock - up , which Nemeth hopes will allow more staffers to oversee the girls section .
" It may be a step in the right direction , " he said , but wo n't necessarily solve the problem of girls frequently having sex with other girls .
Before March , the judge detailed his concerns in two letters to Gov. Mitch Daniels , whose office referred all questions for this story to Indiana Department of Correction spokesman Doug Garrison .
" We disagree with the judge 's characterization , " Garrison said , adding that no investigation at the facility has substantiated the girls ' claims .
When Erica was held at Columbia , she said she did n't think anyone would believe her accounts of abuse .
It 's taken months of therapy , including some counseling at a YMCA , which she found in her small Mississippi hometown .
Erica talks about wanting to be an attorney .
It 's the first time in her life she is considering her future .
She tries not to think about Columbia , but smiles when she talks about the facility closing .
" I 'm happy , real happy , " said Erica .
" That means nobody is going to get hurt there again . "

Cell phones .
You just ca n’t seem to get away from them nowadays .
It seems that just about everyone in America has a cell phone .
In fact , my wife and I use cell phones and Skype as our main form of communication .
We just do n’t have the need for a land line , and not having one saves us about $ 20 per month .
But cell phone bills can be confusing to understand , and often times cost way more than they should !
These tips can help you reduce your cell phone bill so you have more money to do the important things in life .
Top 15 Ways to Reduce Your Cell Phone Bill
1. Mind Your Data Limit
Choose the lowest Data option available for your carrier and make sure to stay within your limits .
You can do this by keeping your phone on a Wi - fi service at home , work and in public settings that offer free wi-fi connection .
Most businesses offer free Wi - fi while you are shopping or eating , you just have to check your available connections .
Now if you are on your phone constantly for work , then I would recommend opting into the unlimited data package , as that would be more cost effective than accidentally going over your data usage for the month and racking up overage fees .
So keep up with your data usage for a month or two and see how you would do with lowering your plan .
You can still get an unlimited data plan through T - Mobile and Sprint .
2. To Text , Or Not To Text … That Is The Question
Most people send or receive at least a few text messages per month .
At $ 0.10 – $ 0.15 per text , it can add up quickly .
Most cell phone companies offer unlimited text plans for anywhere from $ 5 – $ 10 per month .
Look at your last few cell phone bills .
If the number of texts you send or receive covers the cost of unlimited texts , then pay for unlimited texts .
Otherwise , drop unlimited texts and pay as you go or request the cell phone company block texts messages to your cell phone to avoid paying for any text messages .
3. Drop the Insurance
If you have a new smartphone or other expensive phone , insurance may be worth it – but probably only for a few months to a year .
After that , you can easily replace the phone by signing a new contract and buying a new phone at a discounted price .
So after that time frame , drop the insurance , at $ 3 - 5 per month , it adds up quickly !
Over the course of your contract , you probably paid enough in insurance costs to buy a new phone .
4. Drop Roadside Assistance
Here ’s another $ 3 - 5 per month that you can get away without paying .
Many auto insurance plans offer it for less than cell phone companies do , or you may even already have it in your plan .
Why pay for something twice ?
5. Consider Using a Prepaid Cell Phone
I had a pay as you go cell phone when I lived in England .
For me , it was the best option .
Now , I have a smart phone and data plan , and a prepaid phone just would n’t cut it .
But for many people , it is a great option .
If you only make occasional calls from your cell phone , then you could end up saving yourself a good bit of money each month going Prepaid , so you should definitely consider changing your cell phone plan .
One great benefit to a prepaid plan is NO CONTRACT !
Along with other benefits of course such as more flexibility and lower costs .
Virgin Mobile and Cricket Wireless are great for those using on average about 2 - 3 GB of data monthly .
You can also check out T - Mobile ’s Pay As You Go Plan , AT&T GoPhones or pay as you go plans with TracFone .
6. Combine or Drop Lines
Family plans are a great way to save money on your cell phone bill .
You can often get an add - on line for about $ 10 per line for shared minutes .
This is much less expensive than paying full price for a new line .
You can even share a family plan among friends if you are willing to agree to a contract and have a strong enough friendship to deal with any contract or payment issues that may pop up .
Consider dropping unnecessary lines as well .
7. Take Advantage of Employee Discounts
All of the major carriers offer discounts to the employees of companies that take out corporate accounts .
The corporate account will have to have a minimum number of lines to get the employee discount ( usually five ) , but the threshold is very low with all the carriers .
The larger the corporate account , the better the discount the employees will receive .
These discounts are often available to any member of the company , regardless of whether or not your company picks up the tab and whether or not you are full time .
Expect to save anywhere from 5 % – 30 % off your total cell phone bill .
It never hurts to ask around for those discounts !
8. Double Check Your Invoice !
Cell phone invoices can be confusing , but it is important to understand them and what each charge is .
Some of the charges are not required by the government , even though they have “ official ” sounding names .
Some of these include regulatory cost recovery , Federal Universal Service , E - 9 - 1 - 1 , or number portability .
These are put in place by the cell phone companies to recover their costs .
A great way to double check your invoice is to use Validas , which analyzes your invoice for errors or ways to reduce your bill .
The Validas service will make recommendations based on your plan and usage that can take care of several of the tips in this article in one fell swoop .
Validas is also currently offering a free trial of their service .
9. Use Free Directory Assistance
Calling 411 information service from your cell phone can cost a dollar or more .
So why not get the same info for free ?
Try using Free411 by calling 1-800 - free411 .
10 . Avoid Costly Extras
Ringtones , games , mP3’s , GPS service , and streaming videos are not only unnecessary , they are extremely costly as well .
$ 1.99 does n’t seem like much until you add about 20 of those together .
Some of the ringtone and text services cost $ 10 or more per month .
Your best bet is to stay away !
11 . Use a Land Line for Local Calls
If you are near a land line , pick up the phone extension instead of using your mobile phone .
It will save you a few of your plan ’s minutes .
I would n’t recommend doing this from work because some companies have policies against personal phone use .
Just a note …
I only have a cell phone , so whenever someone calls me long distance from a landline , I always call them right back .
My long distance is unlimited and I never use all my minutes .
Hopefully I can save them a few bucks ! 🙂
12 . Utilize In - Network Calling
Mobile to mobile , in - network , Favorites , or whatever your carrier calls it this week , they all have one thing in common – the ability to save you money !
If the majority of your friends and family are on one network , consider changing cell providers to their network – it will save all of you minutes and money !
If you need to change carriers , there are ways to cancel your cell phone bill without paying fees , or transfer your cell phone contract without fees .
13 . Roaming Charges & Data Roaming Charges
Beware of roaming charges !
These can add up quickly !
Double check your service plan and be familiar with your local area .
If you have a nationwide plan ( which is the only way to go in my opinion ! ) , you still might receive roaming charges if you frequently use your cell phone where your provider does n’t have any towers .
It ’s best to be aware of your situation to avoid these charges !
14 . Out of Contract ?
Negotiate a Lower Rate or Shop For a New Plan
Cell phone companies love it when you are in a contract because you are basically at their mercy .
Once you are out of your contract you are free to go to another carrier .
So shop around .
If you find a better deal but prefer your current carrier , negotiate a lower rate .
You may have to enter into a new contract , but you may be able to save a few bucks every month .
You may also be able to get a great deal on a new cell phone .
T - Mobile is currently offering some great deals on their individual and family cell phone plans , and here are special AT&T Wireless offers .
15 . Get Out of Your Cellphone Contract Without Paying Fees
This is the ultimate in lowering your cell phone bill – get rid of it altogether !
Here are tips on how to cancel your cell phone contract without paying early termination fees and how to transfer your cell phone contract without paying fees .
These are only good options if you are looking to drop your cell phone coverage or find a cheaper plan .
10 Minutes Can Save You Money Every Month
None of these tips are difficult to pull off , and in most cases will take about 10 minutes or less .
And the savings you achieve should make it well worth your time .
So start looking over your cell phone usage today and save yourself some money each month !

A 14 - year - old student opened fire in the hallways of SuccessTech Academy high school in downtown Cleveland Wednesday afternoon ( October 10 ) , injuring five people .
The student — who has been identified as Asa H. Coon , according to The Associated Press — then shot and killed himself .
Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson spoke to the media several hours after the incident , saying two teachers — a 57 - year - old man who was later identified as David Kachadourian , and a yet - unidentified 42 - year - old — were shot and injured in the incident , but that they were in stable condition .
He also said that an 18 - year - old male , Darnell Rodgers , was treated for a gunshot wound to the elbow and released , and that a 14 - year - old male was in stable condition with a gunshot wound to the side .
A fifth person , a 14 - year - old female student , was also injured when she hurt her knee in the aftermath ; she was treated and released .
Dr. Eugene Sanders , CEO of Cleveland 's metropolitan school district , said classes would be canceled for the entire district on Thursday and that an already - scheduled day off on Friday would be used to speak to teachers about the incident and come up with strategies to avoid similar situations in the future .
Coon , who had been suspended earlier this week for fighting , entered the school with two handguns and began opening fire in the early afternoon , hitting several students on at least two floors of the school , according to CNN .
While Coon was running through the halls , the principal called out a " code blue " alert , telling students to get to a safe space , with some hiding in closets or on the floors of their classrooms .
Police responded to the incident within two minutes and quickly secured the building .
A police spokesperson said Coon took his own life before police arrived at the school .
SuccessTech Academy , which only has 250 students and 30 teachers , was founded five years ago with help from a large grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation as a high - tech academy where every student was given access to their own computer and has been described as a select , " best and brightest " - style institution .
One parent told CNN that the school had no metal detectors and that there was overcrowding in the classrooms .
Another parent described the school as a close - knit community .
Sanders said he could not recall the request from parents for metal detectors or more security at the school .
Rodgers , one of the victims , spoke to reporters after being released from the hospital .
" It took me a couple minutes to realize I was actually shot , " he said .
" When my arm started burning , that 's when I realized I was actually shot . "
Coon appeared to be aiming for someone else , Rodgers said , and that the bullet " probably deflected off something " and hit him in the elbow .
Rodgers also expressed concern about his other classmates and teachers and said he hoped the school would implement tighter security .
Seventeen - year - old Antonio Deberry , also a student at SuccessTech Academy , said he ducked beneath a laboratory table and saw Coon walk through the hallway .
" I saw him walking past .
He did n't see us , we saw him , " said Deberry , adding that Coon swore and shot multiple times .
Doneisha LeVert also hid , in a closet with other students , after the " code blue " alert was issued .
She said students and teachers saw Coon making threats last week .
" He 's crazy , " she said .
" He threatened to blow up our school .
He threatened to stab everybody .
We did n't think nothing of it . "
A friend of Coon 's told CNN that the 14 - year - old often talked about how he " worshiped the devil " and said if he shot up the school he would let the young man and another friend go .
Fox News reported that he had a criminal and domestic - violence history .
Another student said , " I knew that dude was crazy , man .
He always wore a trench coat . "
He also said the student wore a visible pistol belt around his leg ( with no gun in it ) to school on several occasions and that at least one teacher was aware of it and saw the gun belt but took no action .
A parent who is the president of the parents ' association said the classrooms went from having 15 to 30 students , with overcrowding creating tensions among students .
He also said there was only one security guard on duty in the building and that that person worked only the first - floor administrative level and did not walk the floors of the school , which had classrooms on the third , fourth and fifth floor .
" We 've been fighting to get security back for the past two or three years and they denied it , " the parent told CNN .
" Tension was high in the school , it was just too crowded . "
The police spokesperson said it was too early to tell if Coon had any connection to the victims or if the shooting was random .
It was also unclear at press time how Coon , who was not supposed to be in school on Wednesday because of the suspension , was able to gain access to the building and how he was able to bring in two handguns with him .

If the Democratic presidential race were a poker game , by now you ’d have to suspect that Barack Obama ’s campaign is dealing from the bottom of the deck :
Rarely a day goes by when it does n’t slap another ace down on the table .
The aces in this ( possibly strained ) metaphor are endorsements , and it often seems as if the Obama operation has an inexhaustible supply at its disposal .
In the past week alone , it has announced the support of congressmen from North Carolina and Indiana ; the Utah state party chair ; the Oklahoma state party ’s chief fundraiser ; 25 South Dakota state legislators ; the owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers ; and , not least , The Boss .
Some of these endorsers are superdelegates , and thus of no small consequence to the outcome of the race .
Others are simply window - dressing , deployed to create a sense of ineluctable momentum in Obama ’s direction .
But none have the particular resonance of the endorsement that ’s coming — unbeknownst to the campaign — a little later today .
The endorsement in question is that of Robert Reich , Bill Clinton ’s first Secretary of Labor and a friend of both the former president and his wife for four decades .
Around 1 p.m. EST , Reich informs me , he intends formally to declare his support for Obama on his blog .
Now , in one sense , the Reich endorsement comes as no great surprise .
For some time , it ’s been clear to anyone paying attention that Reich favors Obama .
Back in December , in a blog post titled “ Why is HRC Stooping So Low ? , ” Reich loudly and sharply criticized Clinton ’s conduct in Iowa and defended Obama ’s proposals for health - care and Social Security reform .
Two days before the race - charged South Carolina primary , he assailed Bill Clinton ’s “ ill - tempered and ill - founded attacks ” on Obama , arguing that they were “ doing no credit to the former president , his legacy , or his wife ’s campaign . ”
And all throughout the primary season , he has spoken and written of Obama ’s candidacy with evident admiration and enthusiasm .
But Reich insists that the endorsement does indeed come as a surprise — to him .
As we chatted in Washington , where Reich had come from Berkeley , where he teaches , to give a speech and meet with some Democrats on Capitol Hill , he explained that , despite the criticisms he ’s made of the Clintons ( “ I call it as I see it ” ) , he had planned to refrain from offering an official backing for Obama out of respect for Hillary .
“ She ’s an old friend , ” Reich said .
“ I ’ve known her 40 years .
I was absolutely dead set against getting into the whole endorsement thing .
I ’ve struggled with it .
I ’ve not wanted to do it .
Out of loyalty to her , I just felt it would be inappropriate . ”
So what ’s changed ?
I asked Reich .
“ I saw the ads ” — the negative man-on - street commercials that the Clinton campaign put up in Pennsylvania in the wake of Obama ’s bitter / cling comments a week ago — “ and I was appalled , frankly .
I thought it represented the nadir of mean - spirited , negative politics .
And also of the politics of distraction , of gotcha politics .
It ’s the worst of all worlds .
We have three terrible traditions that we ’ve developed in American campaigns .
One is outright meanness and negativity .
The second is taking out of context something your opponent said , maybe inartfully , and blowing it up into something your opponent does n’t possibly believe and does n’t possibly represent .
And third is a kind of tradition of distraction , of getting off the big subject with sideshows that have nothing to do with what matters .
And these three aspects of the old politics I ’ve seen growing in Hillary ’s campaign .
And I ’ve come to the point , after seeing those ads , where I ca n’t in good conscience not say out loud what I believe about who should be president .
Those ads are nothing but Republicanism .
They ’re lending legitimacy to a Republican message that ’s wrong to begin with , and they harken back to the past twenty years of demagoguery on guns and religion .
It ’s old politics at its worst — and old Republican politics , not even old Democratic politics .
It ’s just so deeply cynical . ”
The Clinton campaign will , no doubt , shrug off the Reich endorsement of Obama .
( And hey , who knows , maybe James Carville will get into the act and declare Reich a Benedict Arnold ! )
They will say that it ’s unlikely to move any votes , and that , since Reich is not a superdelegate , it does nothing tangible to move Obama even one inch closer to the nomination .
All of which is true enough , as far as it goes .
But beyond the bald fact of Reich ’s support for Obama , the Clinton campaign should pay heed to the reasoning behind it .
In his disgust with Hillary ’s increasingly harsh tactics , Reich is hardly alone .
Indeed , the feeling seems to be spreading more broadly in the party with every passing day .
It ’s been clear for some time that Hillary ’s attacks on Obama were driving up her negatives .
You could certainly argue this might be a price worth paying if those attacks were amping up doubts about him .
But it ’s hard to see any logic — or even sanity — in the tactic if the result is to drive even people who once regarded Hillary dearly into Obama ’s arms .

No matter how legendary an actor ’s career is , some roles will always follow them around long after the sets have been torn away .
And when an actor is as legendary as the Dude himself , Mr. Jeff Bridges , they ’re likely to have more than a few such parts in the rolodex .
Among those for Bridges , the character of Kevin Flynn and his godlike importance in those trippy Tron movies remains high on the list , probably in no small part due to that ever elusive Tron 3 .
While Disney has demurred on plans to make another sequel to the groundbreaking Tron ( 1982 ) and the cult - followed Tron : Legacy ( 2010 ) — wherein Bridges starred as two wildly different versions of the creator of a digital video game landscape filled with out - there artificial intelligence , including creatures called “ ISOs ” — many fans keep the flame of “ Flynn Lives ” going , including Bridges himself .
This past summer , Bridges revealed he and Tron : Legacy director Joseph Kosinski are keen on doing another Tron movie entirely for the virtual reality market , and when Den of Geek sat down to chat with Bridges this past weekend , he elaborated that he wants Olivia Wilde back as Quorra too .
“ Yeah , absolutely ! ” Bridges hums with that familiar SoCal enthusiasm when asked if he and Kosinski want to revisit Flynn ’s relationship with Wilde ’s Quorra in a potential VR film .
“ All those things you mentioned , we talked about .
And there ’s no certainty with any of it , but I ’m hoping it comes down .
It ’d be wild , and you know virtual reality would really lend itself to that medium . ”
Bridges then adds that he “ imagines ” Kosinski has already talked to Wilde about reprising her own very popular Tron role .
“ Olivia ’s really great , huh ?
My little ISO is really doing some wonderful work these days , both in and out of the movies . ”

Insist upon yourself .
Be original .
— Ralph Waldo Emerson
Original ideas are like UFOs :
They attract attention , the pilots are often assumed to be from another planet , and they usually have rounded corners .
An original idea is just a thought expressed in a way that no one has expressed it before .
There is no such thing as an idea made from scratch , but there is plenty of room for using existing concepts as a foundation for creating new pathways through reality .
The value of an original idea is in its ability to allow us to experience things in a different way .
Steve Pavlina ’s idea of 30 - day trials , for example , totally altered my path to personal growth .
There are a much wider range of commitments I ’m willing to make for a month than , say , forever .
This technique has been such a catalyst for change in my own life that I even decided to create a website around it and document my adventures .
The chemical compound formed by a unique thought mixed with purposeful action is highly explosive .
When you ’re building to change the world , that ’s the kind of energy you need .
There ’s just one problem :
How do you think what no man has thought before ?
Always Be Reading
Like gourmet food , original ideas are the product of good ingredients .
The more ideas you consume , the more you have to cook with .
I consider reading a top - level priority .
It ’s so important to me that if I have one hour left in my day and have n’t yet done any reading , I ’ll choose a book over anything else , if possible .
I commute with public transport and taxis , so I usually use that time for reading too .
The most important things to me for extracting useful ideas from what I read are :
Choose the best sources .
Consciously choose the best content you can find on subject matter that interests you .
Consciously choose the best content you can find on subject matter that interests you .
Take notes .
I usually carry around a journal with me that ’s small enough to fit in a handbag .
When reading non-fiction , I jot down everything I want to retain .
I have n’t yet tried this with fiction , but I ’d imagine it could be useful for noting key events , character descriptions , and other plot cookies .
I usually carry around a journal with me that ’s small enough to fit in a handbag .
When reading non-fiction , I jot down everything I want to retain .
I have n’t yet tried this with fiction , but I ’d imagine it could be useful for noting key events , character descriptions , and other plot cookies .
Do what you read , as you read it .
Every good non-fiction book I read alters my external world in measurable ways .
I prefer to walk the walk as soon as I start learning new ideas .
I find it much easier to retain them this way .
Plug and Play
They say the key to generating cool ideas is to spot links between things that no one else sees .
I use an even simpler formula :
Pick two endpoints and connect them .
Describe that relationship .
I do this all the time to connect the dots between software development and personal growth .
It ’s not that I have a keen eye for spotting relationships between two seemingly disparate ideas .
It ’s that I create the link and then try to figure out if it can make sense .
I ’ve used this algorithm to unearth some interesting concepts .
For example , it ’s how I came up with the concept of beliefs as an API for personal growth .
Build a Better Model
Approach anxiety is a big problem for someone trying to practice talking to strangers .
I ’d done a fair amount of reading on this subject to learn to deal with it .
The best answers I found involved focussing on “ qualifying ” a girl , instead of worrying about her being interested in you .
But I still found this model was n’t enough .
It made me think about talking to girls as a linear process :
First you approach , then you open , then you qualify …
I did n’t want to do anything .
I wanted a model that would let me profit from authenticity .
The more I talked to people and the more I thought about what was going on , the more I saw ways in which I could mold the existing models into the shape I wanted .
This is how I came up with social polarity .
I felt this model better explained the instant attraction or instant revulsion you tend to experience when you approach strangers .
It also suggests that authenticity is the best policy .
And it requires no effort to implement .
This new model was a perfect fit for me .
Because models are abstractions , they ’re lossy .
This makes them ripe territory to be remapped .
Create Hooks
Talking to strangers is a timeless concept .
But “ social skydiving ” was a hook that stuck in people ’s minds .
Different words trigger different emotions .
A new label gave it new life .
Finding a distinct way to express an old idea can make it seem original all over again .
Anyone who reads personal growth literature knows that sometimes you need to hear something said in the right way for it to really click .
There ’s no magic potion I use to create catchy .
I just spend a lot of time wrestling to express myself with words that people will remember .
Invert Your Beliefs
Here ’s another little formula I use for idea generation :
Take one of your existing beliefs or opinions .
Completely reverse your position .
Try to justify this point of view .
You can also apply this formula to public opinion .
A good example of this is DHH ’s recent post Fire the workaholics .
It ’s hard not to want to read that .
But this is n’t just a way to generate blog article ideas .
The guys at 37 signals have built an entire business around doing the opposite of what most small development shops do , including four - day workweeks , business credit cards for employees , even giving them personal expense accounts to fund their passions .
Sometimes the smaller your operation , the more you ’ll have to flex your creative muscles to stay alive .
The good news is that inspiration and originality need n’t cost a lot of money ; they ’re a natural byproduct of directed thinking and deliberate effort .
A three - year - old boy has developed leukaemia as a result of gene therapy , Great Ormond Street children 's hospital in London said yesterday .
The boy , who was born without an immune system , was given gene therapy as a baby to save his life .
Children with X - linked severe combined immunodeficiency , a rare condition that affects only males and is sometimes referred to as " baby in the bubble syndrome " , die within their first year without treatment .
The unidentified child is the first in the UK , but the fifth in Europe , to get leukaemia as a result of the treatment .
Four out of 11 boys on similar gene therapy in Paris developed the disease and one died .
Doctors at Great Ormond Street knew of the risk of leukaemia when the boy started their gene therapy trial in 2005 .
But Professor Bobby Gaspar , a consultant immunologist working on the programme , said the benefits for such children outweighed the risks .
The only other option is a bone marrow transplant , and unless a relative is a perfect match , they have to undergo chemotherapy , which kills up to 20 % of such babies .
Gaspar said : " We knew that this would be a possible side - effect ...
We have been very careful in counselling our families before they enter the programme .
These risks had to be balanced against the risks of conventional treatment which contain significant hazards . "
The doctors believe a vector - a modified virus introduced to the bone marrow cells to deliver a working copy of the defective gene - is the cause of the problem .
They are unable to control where it ends up , and believe that if it lands next to an oncogene ( a cancer gene ) it can switch it on , causing cancer .
They are planning another trial using a vector that has been modified so that even if it lands next to an oncogene it will not switch it on .
Professor Martin Gore , chairman of the Gene Therapy Advisory Committee , said he had sympathy for the child and his family , and for the nurses , doctors and researchers at Great Ormond Street , who were " utterly dedicated " to helping children with life - threatening diseases .
He ’s never going to shake her off .
Not all by himself .
The very fact that he ca n’t shake her off has become her best argument against him .
“ Why ca n ’t he close the deal ? ” Hillary taunted at a polling place on Tuesday .
She ’s been running ads about it , suggesting he does n’t have “ what it takes ” to run the country .
Her message is unapologetically emasculating :
If he does not have the gumption to put me in my place , when superdelegates are deserting me , money is drying up , he ’s outspending me 2 - to - 1 on TV ads , my husband ’s going crackers and party leaders are sick of me , how can he be trusted to totally obliterate Iran and stop Osama ?
Now that Hillary has won Pennsylvania , it will take a village to help Obama escape from the suffocating embrace of his rival .
Certainly Howard Dean will be of no use steering her to the exit .
It ’s like Micronesia telling Russia to denuke .
“ You know , some people counted me out and said to drop out , ” said a glowing Hillary at her Philadelphia victory party , with Bill and Chelsea by her side .
“ Well , the American people do n’t quit .
And they deserve a president who does n’t quit , either . ”
Overclocking The NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT
The NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT is built upon the new G92 GPU , a refresh of the ground - breaking NVIDIA G80 GPU which gave us graphics cards like the GeForce 8800 GTX and the GeForce 8800 Ultra .
Like those graphics cards , the new NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT features a massively - parallel unified architecture , as well as support for DirectX 10 .
The new G92 GPU , however , features a new VP2 video processor and support for PCI Express 2.0 .
It is also fabricated on a smaller , cooler 65 nm process technology .
For more details on the actual architecture of the new G92 GPU , do take a look at our NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT Tech Report .
When we first reviewed the GeForce 8800 GT , we were most impressed with its performance .
For a mid-range enthusiast - grade graphics card , it offered a tremendous boost in performance over its predecessors .
In fact , it was just a little slower than the very , very expensive GeForce 8800 GTX !
Best of all , it was reasonably - priced .
That made it an extremely compelling card for gamers on a budget .
Recently , we had the opportunity to give the GeForce 8800 GT a thorough retest which compared it against its bigger brother - the NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTS 512MB , also based on the same G92 GPU .
It showed that while the GeForce 8800 GT offered a great price - performance ratio , it was significantly slower than the GeForce 8800 GTS 512MB .
Granted , the GeForce 8800 GTS 512MB is significantly more expensive , but it made us wonder - would it be possible to overclock the GeForce 8800 GT to match or beat the GeForce 8800 GTS 512MB in performance ?
That would give gamers who cannot afford the GeForce 8800 GTS the opportunity to enjoy the same level of performance .
However , we did not want this to be an example of extreme overclocking , where you need to resort to third - party coolers .
With that method , you can achieve an incredible degree of overclocking , but it would come at a significant cost .
We wanted this attempt to come at " no cost " to the user .
That meant overclocking the GeForce 8800 GT card using its standard cooler .
Let 's take a look at the cooler .
The GeForce 8800 GT Cooler
The GeForce 8800 GT 's cooler uses a cast aluminium heatsink with a copper insert .
This allows for a better thermal transfer to the heatsink and yet keep the cost and weight low .
With the shroud in place , the air is directed through 33 aluminium fins .
To improve the heatsink 's performance , NVIDIA used three copper heatpipes to quickly transfer the heat away from the copper insert to the aluminium fins .
The cooler is powered by an Everflow B127515 BU blower fan placed to the right side of the cooler .
The Everflow B127515 BU is a high - speed 12 V fan with a current draw of 0.80 A , delivering a power output of 9.6 W.
It is capable of delivering a maximum air flow of 11.83 CFM .
It has two ball - bearings which not only delivers greater reliability and lifespan but also quieter operation .
It 's rated for a noise level of just 51 dBA .
It 's the right response to this :
“ The quotations in The New Republic article are not mine and do not represent what I believe or have ever believed .
I have never uttered such words and denounce such small - minded thoughts .
In fact , I have always agreed with Martin Luther King , Jr. that we should only be concerned with the content of a person 's character , not the color of their skin .
As I stated on the floor of the U.S. House on April 20 , 1999 :  I rise in great respect for the courage and high ideals of Rosa Parks who stood steadfastly for the rights of individuals against unjust laws and oppressive governmental policies . ’
This story is old news and has been rehashed for over a decade .
It 's once again being resurrected for obvious political reasons on the day of the New Hampshire primary .
When I was out of Congress and practicing medicine full - time , a newsletter was published under my name that I did not edit .
Several writers contributed to the product .
For over a decade , I have publicly taken moral responsibility for not paying closer attention to what went out under my name . ”
I 'm very glad to hear it .
Taking moral responsibility is the right thing to do .
But I should say I think less of Ron Paul after reading this article than I did before .
Much less .
I am not persuaded he is a bigot ( like Jamie , apparently ) , and I remain impressed by the message and spirit of the campaign he has waged .
My take on the newsletters here .

An image of one of the last Tasmanian tigers in captivity .
Wildlife scientists have re-opened the cryptic case of a carnivore that resembled a striped coyote and vanished from its Australian haunt nearly 80 years ago .
While the scientists think chances are slim that the so - called Tasmanian tiger ( Thylacinus cynocephalus ) still roams the island off the coast of Australia , they ca n’t help but turn over every possible leaf to look for evidence of the elusive animal .
The last wild Tasmanian tiger was killed between 1910 and 1920 , and the last captive one died in 1936 at the Hobart Zoo in Tasmania , Australia .
In 1986 , the creature was declared extinct .
The extinction marked the demise of the only member of its family , Thylacinidae , and the world ’s largest marsupial ( pouched ) carnivore .
It weighed about 65 pounds and had a nose - to - tail length of six feet .
However , rumored sightings of the creature continue to emerge from the island 's ancient forests .
Now zoologist Jeremy Austin of the Australian Center for Ancient DNA and his colleagues are examining DNA from animal droppings found in Tasmania in the late 1950s and 1960s , which have been preserved in the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery .
Eric Guiler , a thylacine expert who found the scats , said he thought the droppings probably came from the Tasmanian tiger rather than a dog , Tasmanian devil or a quoll , according to Austin .
“ If we find thylacine DNA from the 1950s scats it will be significant , ” Austin said .
“ This would prove that either the thylacine produced the scat or a [ Tasmanian ] devil ate a thylacine and dropped the scat .
Either way that is proof that the thylacine was there at the time . ”
If they were to find evidence the Tasmanian tiger was alive between its last sightings in the wild ( between 1910 and 1920 ) , that would mean the beast was hidden from humans for 40 to 50 years .
“ If they could survive this long with no real physical proof , then it does add a little more hope to the possibility that they could survive another 50 years without ever being caught , killed [ or ] hit by a car , ” Austin told LiveScience .
“ This chance is of course not great , but the glimmer of hope is ever so slightly brighter . ”

A satirical response to a feminist publication at Colorado College has landed the college and two of its students in the middle of a fierce debate over freedom of speech .
Chris Robinson and another student at the Colorado Springs institution decided to print “ The Monthly Bag ” after seeing copies of a feminist and gender studies newsletter , “ The Monthly Rag , ” in restrooms around campus .
The edition of “ The Monthly Rag ” that prompted action included an announcement for a talk on feminist pornography , information on gender - bending practices , and a tidbit about a myth involving male castration .
According to Robinson , it was representative of what appears every month .
In response , Robinson and a friend created their flier , which provided tips on chainsaw etiquette , detailed a sexual position from Men ’s Health magazine and provided trivia about a sniper rifle — what Robinson called information for the stereotypical macho man .
Staff members removed The Bag within hours of receiving complaints that the publication was threatening .
“ It was a serious concern that this thing was posted anonymously and included in bold print the performance characteristics of a sniper rifle , ” president Richard Celeste said .
“ I had to take that as a threat . ”
The authors appeared before a conduct committee in March and were found guilty of violating the campus conduct code .
In lieu of punishment , they were ordered to host a public forum on the issues raised in the incident .
A letter from Mike Edmonds , vice president for student life at Colorado College , to Robinson on March 25 called the problem “ the juxtaposition of weaponry and sexuality . ”
The case gained national attention when the students filed a complaint with the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education , a non-profit organization that works to protect individual rights like free speech on college campuses across the nation .
“ We quickly determined this was one of the worst cases of the year , ” said Adam Kissel , director of FIRE , because the parody publication was singled out .
“ It ’s such an obvious double standard .
The fact that ‘ The Monthly Rag ’ mentions male castration alongside an announcement for a feminist porn activist provides the same juxtaposition they ’re claiming for Robinson of violence and sexuality . ”
Tomi-Ann Roberts , director of the feminist and gender studies program that publishes “ The Monthly Rag , ” said participants in her program were surprised when this situation arose .
“ We were like ‘ whoa … wow … wait . ’
Obviously , there are some men here on this campus who are very angry at our flier , ” Roberts said .
The feminist and gender studies program has been publishing The Monthly Rag for about three years .
At the conduct hearing in March , Robinson and other students raised concerns about the offensiveness of The Monthly Rag .
Roberts dismissed those complaints .
“ There ’s a difference between material that is ‘ offensive ’ … versus material that demonizes or threatens or belittles groups of people , ” Roberts said .
According to the letter from Edmonds , Robinson and the other student were found guilty of violating the school ’s code of conduct , but no sanctions or punishment were implemented .
An appeal from the students is in process .
“ If we were n’t punished what would we have to appeal ? ” Robinson said .
“ The whole process was a punishment .
I was subjected to an ideological witch hunt and interrogated about my political beliefs beyond what was in the satire . ”
As a private institution , Colorado College is not bound by the same limitations for controlling speech that public institutions are , Kissel said .
However , they have a contractual obligation because they include free speech as a value in the student handbook .
“ I have been a staunch defender of free speech on this campus since the day I arrived here , ” Celeste wrote in a blog published last week .
“ And I will continue to defend it .
But first and foremost , I will do what I can to maintain the safety of this campus . ”

If you ’ve got a USB Pen Drive , you can use it for a variety of things , that includes adding portable apps and lots more .
But , your Pen Drive can serve some interesting purposes as well – some you would n’t have imagined about .
Put it to some good use , here ’s a quick list of what you can do with it :
1. Install a Linux Distro
Pen Drive Linux guides you through procedures on loading your USB Drive with a Linux Distro .
If you ’re a geek , you ’ll love this setup .
If you ’re just a normal user , this may come to your use in a variety of situations – you go to a friend ’s computer , which is infected with pesky viruses .
You need not worry , boot with your Linux - loaded pen drive and do your job , safe and secure .
2. Install MojoPac
I usually do n’t recommend software that you ’ll have to pay for using , but this one is something I ca n’t resist myself from recommending to you dear readers .
Yes , this is a wonderful app that ’ll install itself into a pen drive , and run on top of Windows .
You can run your favourite Windows apps , most of them run perfect on this MojoPac layer .
The advantage is that none of the modified settings affect the original Windows over which your MojoPac is running on .
Quite cool , is n’t it ?
3. Automatic Backups
You ’re probably using your USB Pen Drive as a backup device to hold your important documents , but why not make the process easier ?
Install Allway Sync or Microsoft SyncToy .
Both can let you sync files on your computer with your USB Pen Drive with ease .
You do n’t have to do manual copy & paste files – just insert , click and you ’re done .
4. Additional Memory
Vista can use your USB Flash Drive just like your RAM – such a capability is integrated into the OS .
Windows XP just ca n’t use it as additional memory – your flash drive is just a flash drive .
Not anymore if you have eBoostr installed .
This software program aids XP in using your Flash Drive as a memory device .
You might want to give this a try if your computer is hungry on resources and needs some speed boost .
5. Perfect for Gifts
Indeed , these funky USB Drives are perfect for gifts .
There are lots of creative things you could do with it , and then present it to your loved one .
If your friend is a businessman / freelancer who has to work with multiple computers , a USB Pen Drive can serve as a perfect gift for the person will have files to carry around .
In case your close friend is just a casual user , you could load it with some photos and gift it to that person .
Get a pen drive , put your photos in , let them autorun as a surprise when the thumb drive is put in .
6. Exhibit your Skills
Are you a computer / web based worker ?
Chances are you want to exhibit your skills – what you ’ve done in the past .
Why not load them on to your USB Drive ?
For instance , if you ’re a graphic designer – you could use it to present your skills , stuff that you ’ve worked on in the past and show it off to your clients .
Probably , they might hire you right away 😉 ( Thanks Skellie )
7. Enjoy Music , hassle free
If you ’re a serious audiophile , and still got to work in multiple computers , accessing your music collection can be painful .
But there ’s Winamp to the rescue .
You can use Winamp to put your music collection in your USB thumb drive , all still organized and easily accessible .
Winamp Portable Edition makes your media library portable , and organized for hassle free listening .

Since JavaScript does n't include a trim method natively , it 's included by countless JavaScript libraries – usually as a global function or appended to String .
prototype .
However , I 've never seen an implementation which performs as well as it could , probably because most programmers do n't deeply understand or care about regex efficiency issues .
After seeing a particularly bad trim implementation , I decided to do a little research towards finding the most efficient approach .
Before getting into the analysis , here are the results :
Method Firefox 2 IE 6 trim1 15 ms < 0.5 ms trim2 31ms < 0.5 ms trim3 46 ms 31 ms trim4 47ms 46 ms trim5 156ms 1656 ms trim6 172ms 2406 ms trim7 172ms 1640 ms trim8 281ms < 0.5 ms trim9 125ms 78 ms trim10 < 0.5 ms < 0.5 ms trim11 < 0.5 ms < 0.5ms
Note 1 : The comparison is based on trimming the Magna Carta ( over 27,600 characters ) with a bit of leading and trailing whitespace 20 times on my personal system .
However , the data you 're trimming can have a major impact on performance , which is detailed below .
Note 2 : trim4 and trim6 are the most commonly found in JavaScript libraries today .
Note 3 : The aforementioned bad implementation is not included in the comparison , but is shown later .
The analysis
Although there are 11 rows in the table above , they are only the most notable ( for various reasons ) of about 20 versions I wrote and benchmarked against various types of strings .
The following analysis is based on testing in Firefox 2.0.0.4 , although I have noted where there are major differences in IE6 .
return str.replace(/^\s\s*/ , '' ) .replace(/\s\s*$ / , '' ) ;
All things considered , this is probably the best all - around approach .
Its speed advantage is most notable with long strings — when efficiency matters .
The speed is largely due to a number of optimizations internal to JavaScript regex interpreters which the two discrete regexes here trigger .
Specifically , the pre-check of required character and start of string anchor optimizations , possibly among others .
return str.replace (/^\s+/ , '' ) .replace(/\s+$ / , '' ) ;
Very similar to trim1 ( above ) , but a little slower since it does n't trigger all of the same optimizations .
return str.substring (Math.max(str.search(/\S/ ) , 0 ) , str.search (/\S\s*$ / ) + 1 ) ;
This is often faster than the following methods , but slower than the above two .
Its speed comes from its use of simple , character - index lookups .
return str.replace(/^\s+|\s+$/g , '' ) ;
This commonly thought up approach is easily the most frequently used in JavaScript libraries today .
It is generally the fastest implementation of the bunch only when working with short strings which do n't include leading or trailing whitespace .
This minor advantage is due in part to the initial - character discrimination optimization it triggers .
While this is a relatively decent performer , it 's slower than the three methods above when working with longer strings , because the top - level alternation prevents a number of optimizations which could otherwise kick in .
str = str.match (/\S+(?:\s+\S+ )*/) ;
return str ? str[ 0 ] : '';
This is generally the fastest method when working with empty or whitespace - only strings , due to the pre-check of required character optimization it triggers .
Note :
In IE6 , this can be quite slow when working with longer strings .
return str.replace (/^\s*( \S*( \s+\S+ ) *) \s*$ / , ' $ 1 ' ) ;
This is a relatively common approach , popularized in part by some leading JavaScripters .
It 's similar in approach ( but inferior ) to trim8 .
There 's no good reason to use this in JavaScript , especially since it can be very slow in IE6 .
return str.replace (/^\s*( \S*(?:\s+\S+ ) *) \s*$ / , ' $ 1 ' ) ;
The same as trim6 , but a bit faster due to the use of a non-capturing group ( which does n't work in IE 5.0 and lower ) .
Again , this can be slow in IE6 .
return str.replace (/^\s*((?:[ \ S\s ] *\S ) ? ) \s*$ / , ' $ 1 ' ) ;
This uses a simple , single - pass , greedy approach .
In IE6 , this is crazy fast !
The performance difference indicates that IE has superior optimization for quantification of " any character " tokens .
return str.replace (/^\s*([ \S\s ] *? ) \s*$ / , ' $ 1 ' ) ;
This is generally the fastest with very short strings which contain both non-space characters and edge whitespace .
This minor advantage is due to the simple , single - pass , lazy approach it uses .
Like trim8 , this is significantly faster in IE6 than Firefox 2 .
Since I 've seen the following additional implementation in one library , I 'll include it here as a warning :
return str.replace (/^\s*( [ \S\s ] *) \b\s*$ / , ' $ 1 ' ) ;
Although the above is sometimes the fastest method when working with short strings which contain both non-space characters and edge whitespace , it performs very poorly with long strings which contain numerous word boundaries , and it 's terrible (! ) with long strings comprised of nothing but whitespace , since that triggers an exponentially increasing amount of backtracking .
Do not use .
A different endgame
There are two methods in the table at the top of this post which have n't been covered yet .
For those , I 've used a non-regex and hybrid approach .
After comparing and analyzing all of the above , I wondered how an implementation which used no regular expressions would perform .
Here 's what I tried :
function trim10 ( str ) { var whitespace = '
\r\t\f\x0b\xa0\u2000\u2001\u2002\u2003\u2004\u2005\u2006\u2007\u2008\u2009\u200a\u200b\u2028\u2029\u3000 ' ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < str.length ; i++) { if ( whitespace.indexOf(str.charAt( i ) ) === - 1 ) { str = str.substring ( i ) ; break ; } } for ( i = str.length - 1 ; i >= 0 ; i--) { if ( whitespace.indexOf(str.charAt( i ) ) === - 1 ) { str = str.substring ( 0 , i + 1 ) ; break ; } } return whitespace.indexOf(str.charAt(0 ) ) === - 1 ? str : ''; }
How does that perform ?
Well , with long strings which do not contain excessive leading or trailing whitespace , it blows away the competition ( except against trim1 / 2 / 8 in IE , which are already insanely fast there ) .
Does that mean regular expressions are slow in Firefox ?
No , not at all .
The issue here is that although regexes are very well suited for trimming leading whitespace , apart from the .NET library ( which offers a somewhat - mysterious " backwards matching " mode ) , they do n't really provide a method to jump to the end of a string without even considering previous characters .
However , the non-regex - reliant trim10 function does just that , with the second loop working backwards from the end of the string until it finds a non-whitespace character .
Knowing that , what if we created a hybrid implementation which combined a regex 's universal efficiency at trimming leading whitespace with the alternative method 's speed at removing trailing characters ?
function trim11 ( str ) { str = str.replace ( /^\s+/ , '' ) ; for ( var i = str.length - 1 ; i >= 0 ; i--) { if ( /\S/.test(str.charAt( i ) ) ) { str = str.substring ( 0 , i + 1 ) ; break ; } } return str ; }
Although the above is a bit slower than trim10 with some strings , it uses significantly less code and is still lightning fast .
Plus , with strings which contain a lot of leading whitespace ( which includes strings comprised of nothing but whitespace ) , it 's much faster than trim10 .
In conclusion …
Since the differences between the implementations cross - browser and when used with different data are both complex and nuanced ( none of them are faster than all the others with any data you can throw at it ) , here are my general recommendations for a trim method :
Use trim1 if you want a general - purpose implementation which is fast cross -browser .
if you want a general - purpose implementation which is fast cross - browser .
Use trim11 if you want to handle long strings exceptionally fast in all browsers .
To test all of the above implementations for yourself , try my very rudimentary benchmarking page .
Background processing can cause the results to be severely skewed , so run the test a number of times ( regardless of how many iterations you specify ) and only consider the fastest results ( since averaging the cost of background interference is not very enlightening ) .
As a final note , although some people like to cache regular expressions ( e.g. using global variables ) so they can be used repeatedly without recompilation , IMO this does not make much sense for a trim method .
All of the above regexes are so simple that they typically take no more than a nanosecond to compile .
Additionally , some browsers automatically cache the most recently used regexes , so a typical loop which uses trim and does n't contain a bunch of other regexes might not encounter recompilation anyway .
Edit ( 2008-02-04 ) : Shortly after posting this I realized trim10 / 11 could be better written .
Several people have also posted improved versions in the comments .
Here 's what I use now , which takes the trim11 - style hybrid approach :
function trim12 ( str ) { var str = str.replace (/ ^\s\s */ , '' ) , ws = /\s/ , i = str.length ; while ( ws.test(str.charAt ( - - i ) ) ) ; return str.slice ( 0 , i + 1 ) ; }
After decades , bill to regulate tobacco as a ' drug ' may become law RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday April 1 , 2008
|
Print This Email This The Food and Drug Administration may finally bring tobacco into its fold .
A long - stalled bill vehemently opposed by the tobacco industry is set to move forward in Congress , which would grant the FDA power to regulate cigarette additives .
It would not , however , allow the FDA to ban nicotine .
" This week , the bill is likely to pass the House Energy and Commerce Committee , " the Wall Street Journal reveals Tuesday .
" Supporters hope for a vote by the full House later this spring .
The bill could still run into barriers in the Senate , and the FDA commissioner , a Bush administration appointee , has raised concerns about it . "
" The bill 's progress could position tobacco regulation as an election - year issue for supporters in both parties eager to capitalize on the industry 's unpopularity .
If the bill passes Congress , Democrats would be able to flag it as a significant legislative accomplishment after more than a decade of efforts to grant the FDA sway over tobacco , " they added .
" If Republicans stop the bill , either in the Senate or through a presidential veto , that could also play well for Democrats on the campaign trail eager to burnish their health - care and regulatory credentials .
All three presidential candidates -- Democratic Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and Republican Sen. John McCain -- are co-sponsors of the Senate version of the FDA bill .
" The bill would lead to sweeping changes in both the FDA and the tobacco industry , " the Journal adds .
" It would put into law ideas that former FDA Commissioner David Kessler pushed in the 1990s , before his effort was struck down by the Supreme Court .
Among other powers , the bill would allow the FDA to set product standards , which could include limiting certain ingredients in cigarettes .
Tobacco makers , whose products have been largely unregulated , would have to turn over to the agency extensive information and win FDA approval for claims that products carry reduced health risks .
The agency would get the ability to regulate advertising of tobacco products . "

If you have just blown the budget on a new high - definition TV , look away now .
Japanese broadcasters and the BBC are working on a system 33 times more detailed than the best sets on the market .
The BBC plans to use the technology , named Super Hi-Vision by its Japanese makers , to screen coverage of the 2012 Olympics on big screens in city centres across Britain .
Today 's high - definition television is still in its embryonic stages in the UK .
But most of the larger , flat screens sets on sale today are HD - ready and the BBC has launched a permanent high - definition channel available on cable and satellite .
Satellite TV giant Sky and cable operator Virgin offer high - definition services to subscribers with the requisite set - top boxes and compatible televisions .
But researchers in Tokyo and Surrey are already working on better , sharper pictures .
Within seven years , the Japanese public broadcaster NHK hopes to begin test broadcasts of its Super Hi-Vision system , with full - time public broadcasts scheduled for 2025 .
Some doubt whether the enhancements of ultra-high definition are discernible , but Nobuyuki Hiruma , associate director at NHK 's laboratories in Tokyo , is sure they are .
" Super Hi-Vision TV is necessary to cover the ability of human vision .
It is based on research into human vision . "
At present , Super Hi-Vision exists only at NHK's Broadcasting Centre in Tokyo , where it is projected on to a 10 metre by 5.5 metre screen , accompanied by 22 multi- layered speakers capable of replicating the sound of a concert hall .
Only 20 minutes of footage can be recorded at any one time and it has to be edited frame by frame .
Even then , making a back - up takes the engineers an entire night , and after a week they have only enough material for one hour of Super Hi-Vision TV .
Sitting just three metres from a 450 - inch screen , viewers often have an instant reaction to the picture .
" Sometimes we suffer motion sickness , " says Masaru Kanazawa , research engineer on the SHV project .
These large screens would not fit in most living rooms , but Kanazawa thinks they soon might .
Hiroyuki Ohira , general manager of Pioneer 's plasma development centre in Yamanashi , is in charge of the same team that , in the 1990s , invented the first high - definition plasma screens .
" We are trying to develop a Super Hi-Vision panel to help NHK realise its broadcast plans , " he said .
The two broadcasters often collaborate on programme production , most recently on the David Attenborough - narrated documentary Planet Earth which was filmed in high definition and introduced a number of new techniques .
Last November NHK had its high definition television cameras strapped to a Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency lunar probe to film an " Earth rise " over the moon in stunning detail .
The problem of how to transmit huge amounts of data remains .
But NHK is using Dirac video compression technology for its Super Hi-Vision testing - a technology invented by the BBC .
Through Participate , an EU - funded project promoting public interaction with new technology , BBC engineers are getting involved in events using large outdoor screens .
" Super Hi-Vision feeds nicely into that and it's definitely a long - term ambition , " said Andy Bower , interim controller of the BBC Research and Innovation Centre .

As if on cue , the kind of oppositional tactics used by radical environmentalists at a few Earth Day 1970 events that I just wrote about , emerged on Earth Day 2008 when Thomas Friedman took a pie in the face at Brown University [ jump to video ] .
Friedman , of the New York Times and author of the bestselling The World is Flat , was ambushed just as his Earth Day talk on the politics and economics of global energy use had begun .
The action , as well as the ensuing discussions over at the blogs It ’s Getting Hot in Here , and the Huffington Post , underscore the longstanding divide within the environmental movement between those who believe we should work within the system to address our most pressing environmental issues , and those who believe that the system itself is the cause of the environmental problems .
From the Brown Daily Herald :
“ A female audience member ran on stage last night and threw a green pie at New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman , who had just begun a lecture on environmentalism in Salomon 101 .
The woman had been sitting in the south side of the auditorium ’s front row when she pulled the pie out of a Brown Bookstore plastic bag that had been tucked in a red backpack and leapt out of her seat .
At the same time the woman threw the pie , a male accomplice seated a few rows back ran down the aisle and onto the stage , throwing small pamphlets explaining the actions into the crowd .
… The pamphlets thrown by the male accomplice identified the pair as the “ Greenwash Guerillas , ” who wrote that they were acting “ on behalf of the earth ( sic ) and all true environmentalists . ”
One side of the pamphlet contains an excerpt from a September 2006 review of Friedman ’s book , “ The World is Flat , ” written by Raymond Lotta for the journal “ Revolution , ” which styles itself as the “ Voice of the Revolutionary Communist Party , USA . ”
The review is highly critical of Friedman , who the review claims cannot see his own errors while “ seated in the business class of his analytical jetliner . ”
The other side contains five bullet - points explaining why “ Thomas Friedman deserves a pie in the face , ” which include reasons like “ his sickeningly cheery applaud for free market capitalism ’s conquest of the planet , ” and “ for helping turn environmentalism into a fake plastic consumer product for the privileged . ”
The pamphlet declares “ Thomas Friedman ’s ‘ Green ’ as fake and toxic to human and planetary health as the cool - whip ( sic ) covering his face . ”
Personally , I think it was a pretty bush - league maneuver .
And watching the video , I feel bad for Friedman as a human being , regardless of how I feel about his politics .
Running time is 1:39 .
[ kml_flashembed movie= ” http://www.youtube.com/v/sv6nvMUq10U” width= ” 425 ″ height = ” 350 ″ wmode= ” transparent ” /]
I found one comment at It ’s Getting Hot in Here particularly poignant , it reads :
“ Had you stayed and listened to the speech , you would have learned that Friedman has one of the most comprehensive characterizations of the challenge than I ’ve heard in a long time .
He spoke about the scale of climate change , global justice and petro- dictatorships , biodiversity loss , energy poverty ( i.e. global inequality ) , and the need for conservation .
In fact , he directly addressed most of your complaints , making you come off as reactionary and uninformed .
Of course Friedman has major flaws , but if your intention was to start discussion about them , you failed .
Instead , you ’ve started a discussion on the inappropriateness of your tactics , and left everyone confused as to what you were trying to say . ”

Reader Carl about ten days ago had sent me a link to a Federal Reserve data series “ Aggregate Reserves of Depositary Institutions Adjusted for Reserve Requirements . ”
The series goes back to 1975 .
What caught Carl ’s attention was that the “ ” non - borrowed reserves ” column , under the “ not seasonally adjusted ” heading , to the right , shows negative values for the last two weeks in January .
While the seasonally adjusted non borrowed reserves figures posted are positive , they are so weakly positive as to also be troubling .
This table is cumbersome to read because it contains over 30 years of data and the headings are only at the very top , so I am providing the headers and the most recent data ( as of Jan. 24 ) for December and January to date .
Click on them to enlarge .
However , you might find it easier to view them at the source .
I would have made noise about it at the time , but I do n’t normally look at this series , and although the lack of apparent reserves looks quite alarming , it appears to be the result of the operation of the Term Action Facility , which allows banks to post collateral with the Fed and borrow funds for a month ( the rate is determined via auction , hence the name ) .
Although some readers quibble with my characterization , I view it as a discount window without the stigma ( the participants remain anonymous ) .
There might have been some technical reason for the numbers looking as bad as they did ( and still do ) so I was ( contrary to usual form ) reluctant to stick my neck out .
However , if you take the data at face value .
the implication is that banks are leaning heavily on the Fed , and if this is n’t opportunistic , this would appear to be a very bad sign .
For a frame of reference , just go to the data series and quickly scroll back .
There is nothing like this result anywhere in history , not during the Volcker credit crunch , the 1987 crash , the emerging markets and later LTCM crisis , or 9/11 .
The negative reserves have no historical parallel , nor do the adjusted reserves dropping so close to zero .
Note also there was a very big ratchet down the two weeks before the big fall in the last two weeks .
The seasonally adjusted reserves fell to less than a quarter of their former level , and again , the absolute value being that low in unprecedented .
Michael Shedlock ( hat tip reader Owen ) jumped on this today , via a chart from the St. Louis Fed :
The problem is I am not certain how much of this is due to real stress as opposed to banks taking advantage of a free lunch , since the TAF is giving out one - month loans at 3.123 %. at the Jan. 29 auction .
That ’s less than interbank rates , and you get to post terrible collateral too .
Everyone with an operating brain cell should be taking as much of this dough as they can , and they clearly are .
But having now created dependence on unduly cheap money , and getting an unprecedented and ( at least to me , Shedlock , and concerned readers ) scary chart , how is the Fed going to wean the banks off the TAF ?
And if we have another credit seize up despite the TAF , one can only expect the Fed will crank up the level of funding on offer .
The non -borrowed reserves dropping in the last two weeks seems inconsistent with the pace of the credit crisis .
Recall that the the TED spread , the gap between short - term bank borrowing rates and Treasuries rose sharply and by November had hit levels that were troubling , indicative of banks ’ reluctance to lend to each other .
An initial joint operation by central bankers did not break the logjam ; a big liquidity operation by the ECB , plus the TAF , did .
The factor making the tightness in bank funding markets worse was that liquidity routinely goes way down at year end ( banks cut down on trading to tidy up their books ) .
That pattern was kicking in even earlier than usual in an already - tight credit market .
So you would have expected to see the negative reserves pattern ( if ever ) prior to year end , when the funding needs would be acute and the TAF would be a particularly important source of funding .
Why are we seeing this change now , in later January ?
For those who want to ponder this matter further , Shedlock was also good enough to provide a backgrounder on borrowed reserves from the book Investing Public Funds by Girard Miller :
Another useful indicator of the Federal Reserve ’s relative monetary policies can be found weekly in the Federal Reserve data .
A key statistic is the net free reserves or net borrowed reserves line item .
This statistic measures the degree to which depository institutions have found it necessary to obtain funds in the Fed Funds market and through the Fed discount window in order to obtain required reserves .
During periods of central bank credit - tightening operations , the depository sector might find it necessary to borrow funds to meet reserve requirements .
This practice results in net borrowed reserves , which shows as a negative number .
Conversely , if ample funds are available through the banking system to meet reserve requirements , banks can become net lenders of reserves through the Fed Funds markets .
Rational agents respond to incentives , and the incentive is to take all the TAF dough you can .
But the fact that total reserves also dropped during this period also lends credence to the idea that this dramatic drop in non-borrowed reserves is decidely Not a Good Thing .
History is being made in the Israel Air Force .
A female Arab soldier has joined the IAF ’s elite Airborne Combat Search and Rescue Unit 669 , for the very first time in this illustrious unit ’s history .
The soldier currently serves as a medic with the unit , and is also expected to soon receive training to become an airborne medic .
Taking Off A first : 40 haredim join Air Force Yossi Yehoshua Group of Orthodox men who dropped out of yeshiva studies receive training in aircraft maintenance , mechanics in framework of project ' Blue Dawn ' A first : 40 haredim join Air Force
Seeing as the unit is typically involved in sensitive , and highly classified , IDF operations , soldiers serving in this unit require an extremely high security classification .
A Muslim soldier has consequently never served in this unit in either an administrative or combat capacity , that is until the aforementioned Muslim medic managed to circumvent this barrier as well .
The female soldier in question , a resident of an Arab village in northern Israel , volunteered to serve in the IDF , though not obligated to do so .
She completed her medic training course with top honors , and was immediately placed with unit 669 .
The unit was stunned to learn of her Muslim origins , and an investigation later revealed that an error was made concerning her security classification .
In spite of this error , the unit ’s commander insisted that the medic remain with the unit because of her truly exceptional skills .
The soldier will even attend training to become an airborne medic this July .
She could very well make history by becoming the first Muslim airborne medic in IDF history .
The story of “ soldier C. ” , first published in Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth two years ago , clearly illustrates just how incredible the feat achieved by the unit 669 medic actually is .
“ Soldier C ” , a Muslim Arab from northern Israel , had finished high school with top honors , and was certified as a civilian pilot before enlisting in the IDF .
He aspired to join the IAF and attend a pilot training course , his lifelong dream .
“ My dream and ultimate ambition is to become a fighter pilot .
I know I have the potential and ability to fulfill my dream and serve as a combat pilot with the IAF , ” he wrote .
“ If deemed physically and mentally fit , I ask that I be able to serve in all of the elite units of the IDF , which are open to all other enlisted personnel . ”
The aspiring pilot ’s plea was unheeded by the IDF , however , in spite of a letter of recommendation given to him by his flight instructor , a former major and combat pilot in the IAF .
He currently serves with another unit in the IDF .

Richard Ebright , a Rutgers University microbiologist and biodefense critic said today the power loss last month at the CDC 's new high - security research lab in Atlanta could have exposed researchers to dangerous diseases .
The $ 214 million Building 18 , opened two years ago , houses labs for
Biosafety Level 2 , 3 and 4 research .
Among the pathogens studied in
BSL - 3 are anthrax and the SARS virus .
BSL - 4 labs are designed to handle the most lethal organisms known to man , including the Ebola and Marburg viruses .
No cure exists for BSL - 4 diseases ; fortunately , the BSL - 4
space at Building 18 is n't yet operational .
The others , however , are .
Ebright said :
In BSL - 2 , one works in an air - filtered biocontaiment cabinet .
If the power goes out , the filter fails .
In BSL - 3 , one works inside a cabinet inside a room with negative air pressure .
Both cease when power fails .
If there had been BSL - 4 in effect , they would have lost the negative air pressure in that as well .
The CDC is n't saying what they 're working with , it but probably includes the 1918 influenza virus , H5N1 avian influenza , and certainly anthrax and plague .
It would have gotten more play anywhere else , but the agency responsible for investigating was CDC itself .
It 's too early to know if there were infections .
This would count as exposure ....
This would n't be acceptable at a small company or university lab , and was astonishing for lab working with 1918 influenza .
In this in this Atlanta Journal Constitution story , CDC officials downplayed the importance of the outage , caused by a lightning strike that overloaded a circuit breaker in the lab .
The building was n't equipped with its own backup generator , instead relying on what is now an obviously imperfect connection to backups on the CDC 's research campus .
Wired Science recently covered the CDC 's decision to halt biodefense research at Texas A&M University , where carelessness led to worker infections that were subsequently covered .
With biodefense research booming around the nation , the danger of accidental infections and outbreaks is significant – yet only guidelines , rather than formal laws , dictate how labs should be built and research conducted .
That , said Ebright , needs to be fixed – quickly .

Modern life is loud .
The jolting buzz of an alarm clock awakens the ears to a daily din of trucks idling , sirens blaring , televisions droning , computers pinging and phones ringing  not to mention refrigerators humming and air - conditioners thrumming .
But for the 12 million Americans who suffer from severe tinnitus , the phantom tones inside their head are louder than anything else .
Often caused by prolonged or sudden exposure to loud noises , tinnitus ( pronounced tin- NIGHT - us or TIN - nit - us ) is becoming an increasingly common complaint , particularly among soldiers returning from combat , users of portable music players , and aging baby boomers reared on rock ’ n ’ roll .
( Other causes include stress , some kinds of chemotherapy , head and neck trauma , sinus infections , and multiple sclerosis . )
Although there is no cure , researchers say they have never had a better understanding of the cascade of physiological and psychological mechanisms responsible for tinnitus .
As a result , new treatments under investigation  some of them already on the market  show promise in helping patients manage the ringing , pinging and hissing that otherwise drives them to distraction .
The most promising therapies , experts say , are based on discoveries made in the last five years about the brain activity of people with tinnitus .
With brain - scanning equipment like functional magnetic resonance imaging , researchers in the United States and Europe have independently discovered that the brain areas responsible for interpreting sound and producing fearful emotions are exceptionally active in people who complain of tinnitus .

But that also means that from the Capitol you also have a clear view of the glass facade of the Newseum , which is part of the point .
This museum is determined to be noticed .

RJ Reynolds CEO
Steven Goldstone told the National Press Club on April 8 , 1998 , that Joe Camel had been officially deemed dangerous for the American public . *
Photo : AP / Marquette * 1998 : A tobacco company executive admits for the first time , under oath , that nicotine is addictive and poses a health risk .
He stops short of saying it can kill you .
Testifying before the House Commerce Committee , Steven Goldstone , then the CEO of RJR Nabisco ( " RJR " originating with longtime cigarette - maker RJ Reynolds ) , agreed that nicotine is addictive , " under the way that people use the term today . "
Goldstone 's testimony came before the same committee where , only four years earlier , seven tobacco industry execs denied , with straight faces , that nicotine was addictive .
What changed in four years ?
A slew of lawsuits , resulting in a $ 368 billion judgment against the tobacco industry , is what changed in four years .
In June 1997 , as a result of several states filing suit against the " big six " tobacco companies , a group of state attorneys general drafted a comprehensive national tobacco plan .
Among its settlement provisions was the fine , to be leveled against the industry as a whole , intended to resolve the claims for smoking - related health costs made by the 40 plaintiff states .
Although $ 368 billion is a lot of money , the industry was potentially facing the loss of a lot more as lawsuits mounted .
Tobacco execs were inclined to accept the deal , which called for a one - time payout , over 25 years , in exchange for future immunity .
The proposed settlement was endorsed by both the American Medical Association and , eventually , the Clinton administration .
It was sent to Congress for approval .
With intransigence no longer an option , the tobacco boys began some serious backpedaling .
Within days of the announcement of the plan , RJR dropped its controversial Joe Camel ad campaign .
Philip Morris was pressured into killing off the Marlboro Man ( altogether fitting , seeing as how two of the actors who portrayed the Marlboro Man died of lung cancer ) .
So the mood in Washington was tense when Goldstone appeared before the Commerce Committee to try and convince Congress to approve the deal , and perhaps reduce the penalty award .
It was there , under oath , that Goldstone finally admitted what only small children and the retarded did n't already know : Nicotine is addictive and poses a serious health threat in a variety of ways .
Of course , he also took the opportunity to posit a doomsday scenario of collapsing corporations and rampant unemployment , should immunity be withheld and the industry inundated with lawsuits .
Congress deadlocked , and the national tobacco plan eventually withered and died .
In fact , sensing that an even tougher anti-smoking bill drafted by Sen .
John McCain was going nowhere , the tobacco companies , now emboldened , stopped negotiating altogether .
RJR Nabisco , with Goldstone leading the charge , even resurrected its aggressive advertising campaign .
In the end , Big Tobacco coughed up only $ 200 billion to ride off into the sunset .

Nanotech Moves Closer to Cure

RECENTLY , the House Judiciary Committee ’s antitrust task force invited me to be the lead witness for its hearing on “ net neutrality . ”
I ’ve collaborated with the Future of Music Coalition , and my band , OK Go , has been among the first to find real success on the Internet  our songs and videos have been streamed and downloaded hundreds of millions of times ( orders of magnitude above our CD sales )  so the committee thought I ’d make a decent spokesman for up - and - coming musicians in this new era of digital pandemonium .
I ’m flattered , of course , but it makes you wonder if Nancy Pelosi and John Boehner sit around arguing who was listening to Vampire Weekend first .
If you have n’t been following the debate on net neutrality , you ’re not alone .
The details of the issue can lead into realms where only tech geeks and policy wonks dare to tread , but at root there ’s a pretty simple question :
How much control should network operators be allowed to have over the information on their lines ?
Most people assume that the Internet is a democratic free - for - all by nature  that it could be no other way .
But the openness of the Internet as we know it is a byproduct of the fact that the network was started on phone lines .
The phone system is subject to “ common carriage ” laws , which require phone companies to treat all calls and customers equally .
They ca n’t offer tiered service in which higher - paying customers get their calls through faster or clearer , or calls originating on a competitor ’s network are blocked or slowed .
It may not be for all people , but I am betting 90 % of the readers of this site and 100 % of the writers would buy this car ; active suspension , six - wheel drive with independent steering for each wheel , no doors , no windows , no seats and the only color available is gold .
And no passenger seat .
Pure off - roading heaven .
But NASA 's latest concept vehicle is meant to go way off - road , as in 240,000 miles from the nearest pavement , and drive on the moon .
NASA is working to send astronauts to the moon by 2020 to set up a lunar outpost , where they will do scientific research and prepare for journeys to more distant destinations .
While designing the lunar truck , JSC engineers threw out some traditional assumptions on what a vehicle needs -- for instance , doors and seats -- and added interesting new capabilities such as active suspension , six - wheel drive with independent steering for each wheel .
Credit : NASA
Built at NASA 's Johnson Space Center , Houston , the new design is one concept for a future lunar truck .
The vehicle provides an idea of what the transportation possibilities may be when astronauts start exploring the moon .
Other than a few basic requirements , the primary instruction given to the designers was to throw away assumptions made on NASA 's previous rovers and come up with new ideas .
" To be honest with you , it was scary when we started , " said Lucien Junkin , a Johnson robotics engineer and the design lead for the prototype rover .
" They tasked us last October to build the next generation rover and challenge the conventional wisdom .
The idea is that , in the future , NASA can put this side - by - side with alternate designs and start to pick their features . "
One of the first standards to go was the traditional expectation that a vehicle should have four wheels .
Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity , still cruising around the Red Planet , have already proved the value of a couple of extra wheels .
When one of the six wheels became inoperable , the rovers had no problem rolling on using the remaining five .
With the number of wheels decided , the next question was how those wheels should turn .
On a car , the front wheels turn a few inches in either direction , and both wheels point in the same direction .
On this rover , all six wheels can pivot individually in any direction , regardless of where any other wheel points .
To parallel park , a driver could pull up next to the parking place , turn all the wheels to the right and slide right in .
Of course , astronauts will not have trouble finding a parking space on the moon .
But the feature , called crab steering , has advantages for a vehicle designed to drive into the craters of the moon .
If a slope is too steep to drive down safely , the vehicle could drive sideways instead - no backing up or three - point turns required .
The all - wheels , all - ways steering also could come in handy when unloading and docking payloads or plugging into a habitat for recharging .
Introducing crab steering drove the concept in several other ways .
If the rover 's wheels turn to drive in a different direction , the driver needs to be able to do the same .
The driver stands at the steering mechanism because sitting in a spacesuit is not comfortable or practical .
The astronaut 's perch - steering mechanism , driver and all - can pivot 360 degrees .
" The Apollo astronauts could n't back up at all because they could n't see where they were going in reverse , " said Rob Ambrose , assistant chief of the Automation , Robotics and Simulation Division at Johnson .
" If you have a payload on the back or are plugging into something , it could be really important to keep your eyes directly on it . "
The vehicle also can be the ultimate low - rider .
It can lower its belly to the ground , making it easier for astronauts in spacesuits to climb on and off .
Individual wheels or sections can be raised and lowered to keep the vehicle level when driving on uneven ground .
Some , all or none of these features may be selected for the design of a rover that eventually goes to the moon .
NASA 's lunar architects currently envision pressurized rovers that would travel in pairs , with two astronauts in each rover .
The new prototype vehicle is meant to provide ideas as those future designs are developed .
" This rover concept changed the whole paradigm , " said Diane Hope , program element manager for NASA 's Exploration Technology Development Program at NASA 's Langley Research Center in Hampton , Va. , which sponsored the vehicle 's development .
" It 's not something I would have expected .
It provides an alternative approach . "

# 2 The Flounder Award
Category : Worst HR Motivation
Many organizations are using “ The Fish Principles ” in an attempt to reinvigorate departments and follow what some companies have known for years , if your employees are happy they will be more productive .
Be There
Play
Make Their Day
Choose Your Attitude
If the company can somehow refrain from becoming an Initech clone with the motivational banners , additional meetings and scripted playtime so much the better .
– The Flounder Award –
But what if your employees start to generate ideas in this new environment , always a dangerous prospect .
Enter The Flounder Award ( yes it ’s real ) , the Fish Principles bastard stepchild .
Though not associated with the actual principles , one organization in the pharmaceutical industry with which I have an acquaintance , introduced it as a way to motivate employees to not screw up .
The way it works : employees police each other for embarrassing moments .
Then during the quarterly department meeting nominations are made and votes are tallied .
Whomever wins , must walk to the front of the room , accept the award and keep it displayed on their desk as a symbol of their failure until the next quarterly meeting .
Following is an excerpt from a recent email reminder :
Flounder Award
( Name omitted ) has been nominated for this award every month since this was put into place .
Jot down those moments you see your peers embarrass themselves so you are prepared for the meeting .
This proves two things , not only does the award exist , but apparently it is n’t very motivating since the same person is nominated over and over .
So what is with this person ?
Does n’t she understand the concept ?
Perhaps 5 minutes in the shark tank will give her the motivation she needs !

The mixtape is gone for most intents and purposes , but the idea of assembling a few tunes for one 's friends is very much a thing of the present .
Muxtape is the latest service we 've seen that lets users assemble mixtape - like playlists online , and it might be our favorite .
It does n't get any easier than this .
Register with your email address ( no confirmation required ) , upload up to twelve MP3s , and that 's it .
An online mixtape containing your songs will appear at the URL " username.muxtape.com " ( their example .
The only setting to deal with , at this point anyway , is the color of the text , which you specify via hexadecimal code .
Apparently , you 're not supposed to upload " multiple songs from thesame album or artist or songs [ you ] do not have permission to letMuxtape use , " but in our test
( a smattering of lesser - heard My Bloody Valentine tracks ) , copyrightedmaterial was not filtered out by audio fingerprint as it is with someother services .
" Accounts not meeting these restrictions are subject to terminationwithout notice , " but if you want to throw together a few songs in thespirit of the mixtapes of yesteryear , Muxtape is an excellent way to doso , from what we 've seen so far – aside from the fact that songsappear in the wrong order ( the last song you upload ends up at the topof the list ) .
I put together a little My Bloody Valentine mix in honor of this summer 's upcoming reunion tour , consisting of tracks from Is n't Anything and various EPs .
If all goes well , I 'll be reporting from one of their Glasgow shows this summer , which can not come soon enough .

A cool new display in Germany currently provides a colorfully visual sample of the adjacent ongoing traffic .
7 separate light meters with each consisting of 110,00 LEDs react to the highway ’s presence .
As cars pass the meters , they display the amount by their colorful characteristics .
When many vehicles are driving at one time , the wave at the lower part of the meter gets larger and filled .
In addition , with every new car passing , a flash is presented at the top area of the meter .
With more traffic and movement , the visual presentation accelerates and comes to life .
Designed by Markus Lerner for a lighting company OSRAM , the meters are positioned at the Mittlerer ring in Munich , right in front of the company ’s headquarters .
The video below show these meters in action .
I believe these are a great reactionary public display , and make me think of the Volumen – the giant light meter that reacts to the outside noise .
I wonder what other designs are being created that use meters to illustrate to us just how we are living our daily lives .

Wind power is breaking new records in Spain , accounting for just over 40 percent of all electricity consumed during a brief period last weekend .
As heavy winds lashed Spain on Saturday evening wind parks generated 9,862 megawatts of power which translated to 40.8 percent of total consumption .
Between Friday and Sunday wind power accounted for an average of 28 percent of all electricity demand in Spain .
Spainâ€™s wind power generation equaled that of hydropower for the first time in 2007 .
In July the government approved legislation that will allow offshore wind parks to be set up along the nationâ€™s vast coastline in an effort to boost the use of renewable energy sources .

A few years ago , a parenting magazine asked me to write an article about the dangers that children face when they go online .
As it turns out , I was the wrong author for the article they had in mind .
The editor was deeply disappointed by my initial draft .
Its chief message was this : “ Sure , there are dangers .
But they ’re hugely overhyped by the media .
The tales of pedophiles luring children out of their homes are like plane crashes : they happen extremely rarely , but when they do , they make headlines everywhere .
The Internet is just another facet of socialization for the new generation ; as always , common sense and a level head are the best safeguards . ”
My editor , however , was looking for something more sensational .
He asked , for example , if I could dig up an opening anecdote about , say , an eight - year - old getting killed by a chat - room stalker .
But after days of research — and yes , I actually looked at the Google results past the first page — I could not find a single example of a preteen getting abducted and murdered by an Internet predator .
So the editor sent me the contact information for several parents of young children with Internet horror stories , and suggested that I interview them .
One woman , for example , told me that she became hysterical when her eight - year - old stumbled onto a pornographic photo .
She told me that she literally dove for the computer , crashing over a chair , yanking out the power cord and then rushing her daughter outside .
President Bush yesterday took as harsh a one - two beatdown as he has endured in the entire seven cynical , corrupt years of his doomed presidency .
First Silvestre Reyes , Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , sent him a damning letter on his stubborn and hypocritical position on FISA .
The letter not only outlines the facts of the law and the circumstances surrounding it for those who might only be familiar with the overt lie that Bush has been pandering to the American public , it concludes with a statement of intent that every single Member of Congress would do well to adopt :
I , for one , do not intend to back down â€ “ not to the terrorists and not to anyone , including a President , who wants Americans to cower in fear .
We are a strong nation .
We cannot allow ourselves to be scared into suspending the Constitution .
If we do that , we might as well call the terrorists and tell them that they have won .
Hear , hear .
Later , in another of his fire - breathing special comments , MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann looked Mr. Bush in the eye and said “ you ’re a fascist . ”
Then it got worse , as he administered a nard - stomping that transcended all other special comments in its honesty and clarity .
Seriously , you have to see this one for yourself :
I ’m not sure what went into Tom Petty ’s decision - making as he pondered his set for the Super Bowl halftime show , but I ’m glad he settled on “ I Wo n’t Back Down . ”
No , the song was n’t written about this administration , but it was appropriate fare for a national audience that has done nothing but back down for the past seven years .
We talk , with an excess of Rambo - esque bravado , about how brave and tough we are as a nation , but what kind of moral courage is really involved in trying to spread “ democracy ” around the world when we ’re not even willing to fight for it at home ?
And what kind of leader uses massive force to inflict “ freedom ” on others when he systematically attacks the liberty of his own people ?
So today , tomorrow , and from here on out , in the halls of Congress and on the streets of our cities and towns , if I might ask one simple thing of my fellow citizens , it ’s this : more show , less tell .

Transfer RNA is an ancient molecule , central to every task a cell performs and thus essential to all life .
A new study from the University of Illinois indicates that it is also a great historian , preserving some of the earliest and most profound events of the evolutionary past in its structure .
Of the thousands of RNAs so far identified , transfer RNA ( tRNA ) is the most direct intermediary between genes and proteins .
Like many other RNAs ( ribonucleic acids ) , tRNA aids in translating genes into the chains of amino acids that make up proteins .
With the help of a highly targeted enzyme , each tRNA molecule recognizes and latches onto a specific amino acid , which it carries into the protein - building machinery .
In order to successfully add its amino acid to the end of a growing protein , tRNA must also accurately read a coded segment of messenger RNA , which gives instructions for the exact sequence of amino acids in the protein .
All tRNAs assemble themselves into a shape that , if flattened , resembles a cloverleaf .
Patterns in these structures give clues to early evolutionary history .
The red areas of the molecule pictured above are the most ancient .

The fact that tRNA is so central to the task of building proteins probably means that it has been around for a long time , Caetano - Anollés said .
His inquiry began with a hunch that understanding the structural properties of tRNA would shed light on how organisms and viruses evolved .
“ Perhaps in evolution there are things that are so fundamental that they are kept , held onto , for millions or even billions of years , ” Caetano - Anollés said .
“ Those are the fossils , the molecular fossils , that tell us about the past .
Therefore , studying these molecules can address fundamental questions in biology and evolution . ”
All tRNAs assemble themselves into a shape that , if flattened , resembles a cloverleaf .
The team began by looking for patterns in this cloverleaf structure , using detailed data from hundreds of molecules representing viruses and each of the three superkingdoms of life : archaea , bacteria and eukarya .
The researchers converted all distinguishing features of the individual tRNA cloverleaf structures into coded characters , a process that allowed a computerized search for the most “ parsimonious ” ( that is , the simplest , most probable ) tRNA family tree .
They conducted the same analysis on the tRNAs of each of the superkingdoms , to see how far these groupings diverged from the overall tree .
This comparison allowed them to determine the order in which viruses and each of the superkingdoms diverged .
The new analysis supports an earlier study that suggested that the archaea were the first to arise as an evolutionarily distinguishable group .
Archaea are microbes that can survive in boiling acid , near sulfurous ocean vents or in other extreme environments .
The earlier study , also led by Caetano - Anollés , analyzed the vast catalog of protein folds – those precisely configured regions in proteins that give them their functionality – as a guidebook to evolutionary history .
“ The transfer RNA data matches our earlier data , ” Caetano - Anollés said .
“ This is important because two lines of independent evidence are supporting each other . ”
The new analysis also indicates that viruses emerged not long after the archaea , with the superkingdoms eukarya and bacteria following much later – and in that order .
This finding may influence the ongoing debate over whether viruses existed prior to , or after , the emergence of living cells , Caetano - Anollés said .
“ This supports the idea that viruses arose from the cellular domain , ” he said .

The Economics of Obesity : A Q&A With the Author of The Fattening of America
We ’ve blogged about obesity at length here at Freakonomics .
The health economist Eric Finkelstein has been studying the subject for years , and , along with co-author Laurie Zuckerman , has just published a book , The Fattening of America , which analyzes the causes and consequences of obesity in the U.S. Finkelstein agreed to answer our questions about the book .
Q : You state that the factors contributing to the dramatic rise in American ( and worldwide ) obesity , from air conditioning to restaurant portions to modern medications , are all fundamentally economic issues .
What are the most significant ways modern society has made it easier to be obese ?
A : Modern society is giving Americans many more incentives to gain weight than to lose it .
We are , in fact , victims of our success as a nation .
The two most obvious factors are : 1 ) the abundance of cheap , tasty foods ; and 2 ) the new technologies that allow us to be increasingly more productive at work and at home while burning fewer calories .
For example , between 1980 and 2005 , the price of food fell 14 percent relative to non-food items , so it is thus not surprising that we are eating more food .
And what kind of foods are we eating ?
Well , consider the French fry .
Fries , if made from scratch , take about 40 minutes to prepare , complete with peeling , slicing , and messy , splattering oil .
Frozen French fries ?
Ready to eat in under 14 minutes .
And that ’s still a lot of work compared to just stopping at a drive - through on the way home from work .
To an economist , then , it is no shocker that the average American now consumes almost 60 pounds of frozen potato products per year , more than triple the amount consumed per person in 1965 .
And at the same time , we ’re burning less calories .
No surprise here .
We all know that we are spending more time watching TV , but there are also less obvious culprits that are keeping us ensconced in our chairs .
One example is that I recently had an inexpensive printer installed in my office .
So now I do n’t even have to walk the 100 steps to the community printer down the hall a few times a day .
But technology has n’t just made our jobs and our lives easier ; we can also pop some pills or get out clogged arteries cleaned out with relative ease , thus lowering the health costs of obesity .
In fact , research by the Center for Disease Control reveals that today ’s obese population has better blood pressure and cholesterol values than normal - weight adults did 30 years ago .
As any economist worth his weight will tell you , if the costs of being obese go down , and there are people who like to eat and do n’t like to exercise , we are bound to see obesity rates go up .
Q : Is obesity really an “ epidemic ” ?
If we were to let the current obesity rates continue unchecked , what would the outcome be ?
A : Over the past three decades , the number of obese Americans has more than doubled .
But whether or not we call obesity an “ epidemic ” largely depends on how the word is defined .
If one defines an epidemic as the rapid increase in the occurrence of something , then yes , obesity is an epidemic .
Of course , we also have an epidemic of flat panel TVs .
My family was recently afflicted with one of those .
If an epidemic requires the spreading of a disease from person to person in a locality where the disease is not permanently prevalent , as Dictionary.com defines it , then I would say no , obesity does not qualify as an epidemic .
The reality is that no matter how we label it , as long as there is a demand for labor saving devices and cheap , tasty food , there will be a significant obesity problem .
The United States has the most advanced economy in the world , so we saw the obesity spike first , but other nations are quickly catching up .
Of course , even in this obesity - inducing environment , many people are finding ways to stay thin and , given the large profit motive , companies are working hard to help people do so .
As a result , I find it hard to believe that obesity rates could ever reach the dire levels that some have predicted .
In fact , recent evidence suggests that obesity rates may be slowing among adults .
Q : From an economic standpoint , should we be diverting so many resources , public and private , to fighting obesity ?
Would it make more sense to let obesity rates keep rising , and focus instead on treating and preventing the medical conditions ( heart disease , diabetes , etc. ) to which obesity contributes ?
A : This is the $ 93 billion question .
That is how much obesity is costing the nation every year .
When it comes to the private sector , the market should be allowed to freely determine the optimal amount of resources to invest in obesity prevention and treatment .
As noted above , there is a huge demand for products and services aimed at reducing rates of obesity .
I am not just talking about drugs and devices , I ’m also talking about cool new technologies such as Dance Dance Revolution and the Wii , which use technology to re-engineer physical activity back into our lives .
I just bought these for my family .
In The Fattening of America , I make the argument that the government should revisit past policies that may have inadvertently helped promote the rise in obesity rates .
I point not only to our agricultural subsidy policies for farmers , but also to zoning laws that discourage pedestrian transportation , subsidies to employers for providing health insurance , and even the existence of the Medicare program .
All of these in some way blunt the incentives to invest in prevention , be it for obesity or other conditions .
I do want to point out that the government ’s primary motivation is not to reduce costs to Medicare and Medicaid .
If it were , they could just stop funding these programs altogether .
There may be good reasons to invest in preventive care , but there is little evidence to date that document any long - term savings associated with obesity prevention efforts .
If the government funds these and they do not work , they only serve to raise our taxes even more .
Q : A recent Dutch study found that it costs more to provide medical care for healthy people than the obese or smokers , who tend to live shorter lives .
What do you make of these results ?
Are they different from , or similar to studies you address in your book ?
A : I am familiar with that analysis .
It is well known that smokers tend to subsidize non-smokers because the former pay so much in taxes and die before they can collect their due in social security and Medicare benefits .
The researchers ’ finding that obese people also cost less is new , and probably not correct for a U.S. population .
It is well established in the U.S. that obese individuals cost more than normal weight individuals at each age of life .
I have published several papers showing that result .
Recent studies by Fontaine and Flegal also show a relatively small impact of obesity on mortality for BMIs less than 35 ( about 70 pounds overweight ) .
As a result , higher age - specific costs and only a slightly shorter life expectancy suggest that the lifetime costs of obesity are indeed positive for most obese adults .
The same goes for overweight adults , as they do not seem to have any shorter life expectancy .
So I doubt their results for obesity are accurate for the U.S. population .
But let ’s suppose they were .
Should we give away free Krispy Kreme donuts because obesity saves money ?
My son would love that , but sorry son , the answer is no .
I argue in my book that high costs should motivate employers to address obesity rates , but saving money is not an appropriate reason for government intervention .
If it were , then the government should be giving away free cigarettes .
Moreover , when it comes to obesity , any effort by the government to encourage people to lose weight , unless it saves more money than it costs , will only raise our taxes even more , regardless of whether or not the measure is effective at getting people to lose weight .
Unfortunately , cost - saving obesity interventions have yet to be identified .
So until they do , obesity may be taking two significant bites out of the government coffers .
Q : How much should the government really legislate obesity ?
What programs / efforts would be the most beneficial ?
Who should they target ( e.g. , children , low - income adults ) ?
A : In my book , I talk a lot about my Uncle Al , a smart and successful attorney who also happens , not by accident , to be very overweight .
In fact , he ’s overweight because instead of spending his time dieting and exercising , he has spent his time building a very successful law firm .
I see no reason why the government should get Uncle Al to change his behavior if he does not want to .
Even for low - income individuals , any effort to force people to change their behavior will only serve to make them worse off ( even if they do become thinner ) .
So no , for adults , I do not think the government can , or even should , legislate obesity away .
In sharp contrast , children are unable to make rational choices , unlike Uncle Al .
I think that the government ( and parents ) have a critical role to minimize the possibility of children growing up to regret the diet and exercise choices they may have made as uninformed youths .
Most government interventions are focused on schools , which makes sense given that the food the lunch ladies serve up is too often not that different from the birthday fare my son receives at Chuck E. Cheese .
And then , of course , there ’s the school vending machines .
In my book , we discuss what ’s happening in America ’s school cafeterias , gymnasiums , and classrooms , and what can be done to help tomorrow ’s adults make informed diet and exercise choices .
Q : Can the current obesity trend be summed up as an issue of “ personal and immediate benefits ” versus “ longterm and widespread social costs ” ?
Why or why not ?
A : People often like to compare the current obesity “ epidemic ” with smoking .
I think the two are very different .
Smokers , by virtue of second - hand smoke , impact non-smokers .
As a result , the government has a clear justification for attempting to limit exposure to second - hand smoke ( although , in my opinion , some of their policies have gone well beyond resolving market failures ) .
I see more similarities between obesity and motorcycle helmet laws .
If someone wants to ride a motorcycle without a helmet , and take the risk of getting into an accident that would almost surely result in a major trauma , why do we really care ?
I think the answer is that we do n’t want our hard - earned tax dollars to pay for this individual ’s “ poor ” choice .
It really boils down to money , and the fact that we live in a society that would not allow this person to bleed out in spite of the fact that he or she knowingly made a choice that made a major injury far more likely .
So , to solve this problem , and because those who ride motorcycles are in the minority , we pass mandatory motorcycle helmet laws .
With respect to obesity among adults , I think the issue is one in the same .
Nobody wants to pay for my Uncle Al ’s excess weight .
The primary difference is that with overweight and obese individuals representing two - thirds of the population , passing laws that limit choice , such as we did with the motorcycle helmets , is unlikely to happen any time soon .
Q : Dubner and Levitt recently discussed the unintended consequences that can result from government legislation intended to change behavior or help certain groups — what are the most likely unintended consequences of obesity - prevention legislation ?
A : It is very difficult for the government to pass legislation without having unintended consequences .
For example , some have suggested that No Child Left Behind may be a factor in rising obesity rates , by helping to eliminate gym class from schools and forcing kids to study harder .
Truth or fiction — you get the point .
When it comes to obesity legislation , there is no such thing as a free lunch .
Getting junky foods out of schools , for example , will not only hurt food companies , but also reduce the revenue for schools to fund other activities .
At the end of the day , the choice will be to weigh the costs and benefits to see whether the legislation is better than the status quo .
Q : Is the rise in obesity rates the result of market failures ?
A : No . I would say it is just the opposite .
The rise in obesity rates is resulting from market forces that are bringing us low - cost products and services that make us more productive at work and at home , and that provide us with highly valued leisure time activities .
For example , consider the microwave .
While only 8 percent of American homes had microwaves in 1978 , 95 percent currently have them .
They make it quick and easy to get food on the table .
Then take carbonated beverages .
They make up 7 percent of all calories consumed .
They would be more expensive without heavy farm subsidies , but not that much more .
Also , how many cars today require manually “ rolling up ” the windows ?
That term should n’t even exist any more .
Car windows , along with countless other things , are now automated .
These are a few of the thousands of examples of new products and services that allow us to save a few calories here and there , or consume a few extra calories for not much time or money .
In my book , I compare our modern lifestyle to that of the Amish .
We could all eschew technology and choose to live like the Amish , but who would want to ?
That ’s a pretty high price to pay to be thin .
In my opinion , obesity is more the result of the success — not the failure — of the market .
This is not to say that market failures do not exist , or should not be addressed .
My only point is that were we to address them all , obesity rates would still be dramatically higher ( although perhaps not quite as high ) today than they were a few decades back .
But on net , we are still better off .
Q : Is being obese more , less , or equally costly for individuals now than it was twenty years ago ?
A : We ’ve already discussed how it ’s cheaper and easier to be overweight today than it was a few decades back .
In addition , thanks to advances in medical technology , the health costs of obesity continue to decline .
Among today ’s obese population , the prevalence of high cholesterol and high blood pressure are now 21 and 18 percentage points lower , respectively , than they were among obese individuals 30 to 40 years ago .
In fact , obese individuals today have better cardiovascular disease risk factor profiles than normal - weight individuals had 30 years ago .
What is driving this surge in improved health profiles for obese individuals ?
The answer , as you might have guessed , is a dramatic improvement in drugs and devices .
Many drugs have been introduced over the past 40 years that effectively treat cholesterol , blood pressure , and other risk factors and diseases that obesity promotes .
One million operations were performed in the U.S. last year to unclog clogged arteries .
In the past , diet , exercise , and weight loss might have been the primary treatment to help control risk factors resulting from excess weight ; today , one has the option of taking a pill or having surgery .
Many individuals , including my Uncle Al , feel that diet and exercise are consequently optional .
If there is one job that many software analysts and programmers cannot stand , it is testing software on the path to launch .
The grinding concentration and repetitive nature of the tasks serve to drive many techies around the bend .
Testing — due in no small part to the resistance it meets in some cubicles — is often treated as an afterthought at immature IT organizations , says HBS professor Robert Austin .
Yet this attitude is unwise , because the sooner bugs are caught , the easier and cheaper they are to correct .
But who is best suited to control and manage the tests ?
The surprising answer may be found in a group of people previously thought to have a crippling condition : autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) .
In a new case coauthored by Austin , " Specialisterne : Sense & Details , " an innovative consultancy in Denmark has turned testing into its own specialty .
While its 50 or so part - time consultants are considered best - in - class — they are paid industry - competitive wages , and customers include LEGO , Microsoft , and Oracle — 75 percent of them live with what others might consider a handicap :
They have Asperger syndrome or some form of ASD .
Austin first learned about Specialisterne from Jonathan Wareham of ESADE Business School ; the two cowrote the case with Javier Busquets , also of ESADE .
As detailed in the case , these software consultants enjoy their work and are great at it .
The testing process — checking and rechecking outcomes , documenting test plans , and maintaining follow - through — makes use of the high intelligence , precision - oriented skills , deep concentration , and patience that can be positive features sometimes accompanying ASD .
" These are useful distinctions for CIOs when thinking about talent management . "
Says Austin , " This case is about delivering IT services .
IT managers typically find themselves with diverse talents .
People in IT are idiosyncratically talented .
This case is about putting talent where it is most effective . "
Companies with in - house talent tend to focus on the more creative tasks of writing and installing software , and dreaming up innovative solutions to unique problems .
Analysts and programmers may also underestimate their own capacity to make mistakes .
Testing , for its part , calls for a whole different set of skills .
Testers must pay strict attention to detail as they scrutinize the functionality of menus , navigation , and applications .
Regression testing should be done well if software is not to revert to an earlier state .
The kind of testing that takes place varies according to the needs of applications and end users .
It may include but is not limited to component or unit testing , component integration testing , system testing , and system integration testing .
Personal Motivation
Specialisterne 's founder , Thorkil Sonne , launched the company in 2004 following a high - level career in telecommunications IT .
( Specialisterne is Danish for " the Specialists . " )
Sonne was already deeply familiar with the challenges facing people with ASD :
When his son was about three years old , the boy ’s development of speech and social skills seemed delayed .
The Sonnes reached out to pedagogues and psychologists in an attempt to understand what was happening .
As Sonne says in the case , " When we were told that our son had autism spectrum disorder , a lifelong handicap with no cure or treatment , we knew that all our plans needed to change .
We needed to accept that . "
" The business model is tricky for a CEO . "
ASD is not a single condition but rather a spectrum of neurodevelopmental impairments .
It is part of the same family of impairments as classic autism and Asperger syndrome .
While psychological and medical experts do not agree on its precise contours , nor on how common it is in the general population , they recognize that people affected by ASD typically experience difficulty with social relationships , with communicating verbally as well as reading gestures , and with using their imagination .
Many ASD sufferers prefer routine to novelty , and exhibit steady focus and repetitive behavior patterns .
If employed , they frequently face obstacles when workplaces do n’t recognize their particular skills and needs .
People with ASD may also have little preparation or capacity for the common social interactions required on a daily basis at work .
As Sonne and his family adapted to life raising their son , the nature of Sonne 's career made him increasingly aware of the testing gap in IT .
He saw an opportunity and need for entrepreneurship .
This family background — and the potential for addressing an industry niche , along with his commitment to raising the profile of hidden talents of individuals with ASD — led him to found Specialisterne .
Specialisterne now has two offices in Denmark , another under construction in Scotland , and branches being planned in Sweden and India .
Its niche , according to the case , is testing when the cost of establishing automated testing is too expensive and complex .
In March 2008 Sonne was honored with Denmark 's IT Award for outstanding contributions to IT development .
In a statement read at the ceremony , the award was bestowed to Sonne of Specialisterne because " these highly gifted people require special support to get on in society — but via their particular logical skills and sense for precision , they can contribute massively . "
A company like Specialisterne seems uniquely suited to the kind of consulting work that requires tremendous powers of concentration .
Not all software testing lends itself to offshoring .
Certainly , some testing may be automated , but other elements cannot when the work requires a lot of iteration and close proximity to the client , particularly during a time crunch .
As the case states , " Sonne knew from experience that for some applications , especially financial and others that executed mission - critical functionality , co-location of testers and developers remained essential .
Some testing , Sonne suspected , would not move offshore , even in the long run . "
" These are useful distinctions for CIOs when thinking about talent management , " says Austin .
" An IT organization needs all kinds of talent — skilled workers in security and databases , and architects for putting lots of complex things together . "
Potential consultants for Specialisterne undergo a five - month training process that familiarizes them with the intricacies of LEGO Mindstorms technology .
According to the case , " There was a natural fit between LEGO robot kits , called Mindstorms , the inclinations of ASD consultants , and the work they might do for Specialisterne . "
A Winning Model
The case also brings to the fore the potential of like - minded companies to build a business model around qualities in employees that at least in the past were considered handicaps .
Given that human capital is the core of Specialisterne , with a heightened need for supervisors , could the company find itself needing to charge customers more than they could pay ?
How should it handle issues — one at the center of the case — when a client might want to cut costs by trying to negotiate lower fees for consultants than their skills merit ?
Adds Austin , " The business model is tricky for a CEO .
No one wants to be perceived as taking advantage of someone with ASD .
It is a fairness issue that most companies do n't have . "
Although the company has emerged from Denmark , Austin adds , there is nothing uniquely Danish about it .
" It could be anywhere . "
So far the specialists , and the high quality of their work , are making a good impression on clients in need of focused testing .
The specialists ' ability to catch critical flaws in software serves to highlight the value of testing — and their individual value as well , as professionals who play a crucial role in bringing about first - rate IT .

This is the sixth installment of our weekly column entitled Ask a Shiite .
Our resident Shiite and United Arab Emirates citizen will be fielding questions of a philosophical , physical , and political nature in regards to Shiite Islamic belief and Middle East perception .
Interested in asking a question ?
Send an email to alec .
Question :
What are the thoughts in the UAE and in the Muslim world in general about American media and celebrity culture ( form example Paris Hilton , Lindsay Lohan , etc. ) ?
How are Western entertainment and culture , specifically movies and music , regarded ?
Are there laws that restrict access to these forms of media ?
How do religious leaders view their influence ?
Answer : The Muslim world in general has lots of different ideologies and different people .
There are those who think that this entertainment culture is bringing corruption and immodesty in their people .
There are also those who think that it is perfectly normal .
In the UAE , most of the people think it is normal .
But there are also those who say it is bringing corruption and destroying culture .
To tell the truth this western culture is influencing people everywhere so much that I would n’t really say that the attitude in the Muslim world is much different from the attitudes in the west or anywhere in the world .
People from the subcontinent are spread around almost everywhere and are quite influential .
For them , there is the Bollywood , which also has a very similar culture as Hollywood in general .
There are n’t any laws in the UAE stopping people from accessing Western movies , culture , and general media .
They do however censor some very explicit parts from being shown at the theaters .
I am not sure about the rest of the Muslim world but I do n’t think there is any restriction .
Iran does have some restrictions as I have been told .
They do n’t allow nudity .
Many people hold the opinion that this entertainment industry is in reality controlled by freemasons and is used to mind control and guide people in the direction they want ( evil ) .
Of course ‘ detecting ’ this is very hard .
They use this tool very cleverly in ways which normal individuals wont realize and will find enjoyable to experience .
To counter this , Iran has its own film industry that seems to be growing and quite good .
It can be seen that today people around the world in general are getting more and more ‘ westernized ’ in the wrong sense .
Ideas that are against religion are being seen as normal .
Day by day , more and more people are accepting Western ideas towards media and this culture as normal to varying extents .

The Inspector General 's Office of the United States Department of Energy recently released the results ( PDF ) of a 15 - month audit of the DoE 's security practices as they apply to publicly available web sites and services .
Unfortunately , the publicly available version of the report removes all details of the vulnerabilities discussed therein , making it impossible for Ars to discuss the severity of any particular flaw .
The overall assessment of the report is mixed .
While there are specific departments and laboratories within the DoE that have implemented strong security practices , there are also a number of areas where the department needs significant improvement .
For instance , visitors to US DoE web sites probably should n't be redirected to pornography , but this is exactly what happened last year after an attack on the Brookhaven National Laboratory briefly turned that site into a porn redirector .
According to the report , DoE websites and / or data being are compromised to the tune of nearly 20 incidents a year , totaling 60 security incidents over the past three years .
Some of these have resulted in malicious defacement , while others appear to have been allowed by internal mistakes .
The audit refers to eight incidents over the past two years which improperly exposed the personally identifiable information of individuals , but the information was available due to user error rather than malicious theft or a hack .
But as the report makes clear , whether it 's the result of a hack , or just poorly guarded data , it 's all stemming from lax security policies and reviews .
Many of the security flaws uncovered during the 15 - month audit lead back to one of two root causes .
First , many of the web servers in question had not been formally authorized for operation via a process defined as certification and accreditation ( C&A ) .
Oftentimes , such servers were not fully compliant with federal security guidelines and rules , and presented potential attack vectors to the public that should have been closed .
The audit singled out one site in particular for allowing public users to transfer sensitive data anonymously to 14 separate public web servers .
This is precisely the sort of situation that should have been caught by the site 's cybersecurity team , but a general policy of decentralization has left site owners responsible for server security .
This decentralization has created other problems for the DoE , as discussed below .
The second issue is one of web site asset management .
The report states : " the Department was unable to provide us with an inventory of active public web sites despite an E - Government Act requirement for organizations to maintain that information . "
Website management , in general , also appears to be unnecessarily decentralized , and the report recommends that this trend be reversed , noting that " inconsistent and weak management and control over web servers may result in improperly configured servers , increasing the risk of defacement or compromise of sensitive information . "
The DoE 's various web servers are quite fragmented ; the report cites the example of one ( unidentified ) site where over 140 web servers were collectively managed by 30 separate departments .
In the grand scheme of things , the Department of Energy 's problems are n't all that massive — they certainly do n't compare to the kinds of personal data theft we 've seen in the past — but the Inspector General 's audit clearly indicates that the DoE has more work to do in several areas .
The conclusion to the report states that the audit 's conclusions were well - received , and further meetings are scheduled to put the report 's recommendations into place .
Update :
One of our readers pointed out the following page , where the OakRidge National Laboratory reports that visitor personal information may have been acquired , and informs readers that anyone visiting the site between 1990 and 2004 may have had their PII stolen .
The report above does not mention this incident , nor give any details on the severity of the breach .
Oklahoma State University
Researchers at Oklahoma State University are working with DARPA to deliver a sophisticated , unmanned aircraft small enough to fit into a soldier 's pocket , reports the Daily O'Collegian .
A state - of - the - art propulsion system , one that uses plasma thrusters with no moving parts , could provide power for micro and nano unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAV . ) This class of airplane can measure anywhere from a foot to less than 6 inches long .
" What we want the infantrymen to be able to do is pull a pack of six or so out of their pocket and have them ready for use , " Jamey Jacob , an associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering told the Daily .
The new line of aircraft would take over some of the duties performed by today 's UAV fleet , mainly surveillance of hostile areas , and would be a significant improvement over the UAV equipment available to soldiers today , according to Jacob .
OSU students are working on another DARPA project , an aircraft that can stay aloft for five years at a stretch .
1979 : Nuclear leak causes alarm in America Radioactive steam has leaked into the atmosphere in Pennsylvania , USA .
Radioactive steam has leaked into the atmosphere in Pennsylvania , USA .
The accident happened when a water pump broke down at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant , 10 miles ( 16 km ) south - east of the state capital Harrisburg .
There are fears some of the plant 's 500 workers have been contaminated .
The authorities have declared a " general emergency " but did not inform the public until five hours after the gas escaped at 0400 local time .
There 's a hell of a lot of radiation
Joe Fouchard , USNRC spokesman
Director of the County Civil Defence Organisation ( CCDO )
Les Jackson said they had drawn up an evacuation plan , but nearby residents have not been moved yet .
He described the scene at the large power station in the Susquehanna River as " a madhouse " .
Spokesman for the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( USNRC ) Joe Fouchard said : " There 's a hell of a lot of radiation in the reactor building . "
A spokesman for Metropolitan Edison - one of the companies that runs Three Mile Island - said the nuclear reactor automatically shut down after the malfunction , but not before the leak .
According to a US Government report radiation has been detected a mile away , but the calm weather has helped contain the spread of the noxious fumes .
One of the nuclear engineer at the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection , William Dornsife , said : " There was very little wind this morning , so the radioactivity should n't have gone very far . "
" What small release there was will be confined to the local vicinity , " he continued .
The emergency status will remain until there has been a thorough investigation by teams in anti-radiation suits .
The nuclear industry has been under increasing scrutiny in the US recently .
Five plants were closed down there just two weeks ago over fears of the effects of earthquakes on cooling towers .
E-mail this story to a friend
In Context Concern mounted in the days following the accident as investigations showed serious damage to the nuclear fuel rods , which threatened melt - down of the plant .
The authorities recommended pregnant women and children under school age living within five miles of the site should be evacuated .
And Pennsylvania Governor Dick Thornburgh gave a warning that the four counties surrounding Three - Mile Island might have to be cleared of people too .
The accident was caused by a combination of human error and equipment failure and the plant was partially shut down .
Three Mile Island remains the largest nuclear incident in US history .
It has attracted enormous public attention , although nobody died as a direct result of the accident and subsequent radioactive fall - out .
Research released in 2002 showed incidences of cancer in the area were not significantly higher than elsewhere .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Prescott Prince is a small - town lawyer who has never taken a death penalty case to trial .
Yet he finds himself involved in one of the biggest capital punishment cases this century :
He 's defending the alleged mastermind of the September 11 terror attacks , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
Prescott Prince says the suspected 9/11 mastermind deserves a fair trial .
He readily acknowledges how his client is perceived as " one of the most reviled people " in the world .
But he says it 's imperative that America give Mohammed a fair trial , just like anyone else accused of a crime .
No civilian court , he says , would accept confessions obtained after a defendant was mistreated .
But the CIA admits Mohammed was waterboarded , a controversial interrogation technique that involves simulated drowning .
" I take the position that this is mock execution .
...
Colloquially speaking , at least it 's torture , " Prince said .
The fact that whatever Mohammed said during such duress could be used at trial is alarming to Prince .
" That 's not the rule of law .
That 's just insanity . "
Watch waterboarding is " mock execution " »
A Navy reservist who has been called to active duty , Prince , 53 , rejects the suggestion that he is less than patriotic for representing an accused terrorist .
" I had friends who were at the Pentagon the day it was attacked , so I do n't accept the concept of ' gee , I do n't know what it 's like . ' "
Prince is currently visiting the detention center at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba to meet his client .
He was denied a meeting with Mohammed on Wednesday due to procedural problems ; he will try again today .
Before Prince headed to Guantanamo , he said he had no idea whether Mohammed will accept him as his lawyer .
He says he 's gone over what he 's going to say " about a hundred times a day . "
He 's been reading the Quran and has met with psychologists and other lawyers who have represented accused terrorists .
" This would not be the first time I 've met with a client who initially did not want , if you will , court - appointed counsel , " he said .
" I 've had clients call me almost any name in the book .
I 've had them refuse to come see me . "
Meet the attorney defending suspected 9/11 mastermind »
Still , Prince realizes that this is different .
Very different .
Mohammed has been in custody since he was caught in Rawalpindi , Pakistan , in 2003 .
He was transferred from a secret location to Guantanamo in 2006 .
The government says he confessed to his involvement in the September 11 attacks and many other terrorist plots .
The government said in February that six terror suspects , including Mohammed , would go before military commissions and could face the death penalty if it is judged they were involved in the September 11 attacks .
The proceedings are governed by the Military Commissions Act , which Congress passed to handle arrestees in the war on terror .
See the terror suspects who could face the death penalty »
The act requires detainees have access to lawyers as well as to any evidence presented against them .
They also will have the right to appeal a guilty verdict , potentially through a civilian appeals court and perhaps the U.S. Supreme Court , according to the act .
Watch general describe charges against al Qaeda suspects »
In the case of Mohammed , the government acknowledged that he was subjected to waterboarding , a harsh interrogation technique that many experts believe violates the Geneva Conventions ' ban on torture .
Waterboarding involves strapping a person to a surface , covering the face with cloth and pouring water over the cloth to imitate the sensation of drowning .
Prince finds that extremely troubling because , he says , a civilian court would never admit evidence gained through a coerced statement .
The government says Mohammed has confessed to September 11 and other terror plots .
" Even the greenest deputy sheriff or rookie police officer in Skunk Hollow County knows that if you rough up a defendant , anything he says after that is not going to be admitted into court , " Prince said .
" The officer might not like those rules , but he understands them and will abide by them . "
But a judge in a military commission could have it entered into evidence .
" We have created a system under the military commissions that says , in essence , 'if he was roughed up but what he says still seems reliable , we 'll accept it any way . '
And that 's just wrong . "
Prince says there are other complications .
He may not have the chance to cross-examine Mohammed 's accusers and may not see all the evidence to be put forward in court .

Prince does n't believe that Mohammed can get a fair trial and says the country risks trashing " our constitutional values when it becomes convenient to do so . "
" I do n't want to impugn anyone 's character , but this is where Ronald Reagan 's term ' trust but verify ' will come into play , " he said .
The military has assigned him a three - person team consisting of another lawyer , an intelligence analyst and a paralegal .
The American Civil Liberties Union and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers have also teamed up to find volunteers to help Prince and the other lawyers defending accused terrorists at Guantanamo Bay .
Norman Reimer , the executive director of the NACDL , explained the daunting task this way :
" It 's going to require all of the ingenuity and resources , not just to defend the accused but to defend the American system of justice and what we stand for in the world .
That 's what this is about . "
Two lawyers from Boise , Idaho , have agreed to help Prince .
No strangers to terrorism cases , David Nevin and Scott McKay won an acquittal for a Saudi man who faced terror charges .
Prince for years ran a small practice in Richmond , Virginia .
But last year , the reservist was called to active duty and spent six months in Iraq .
He never thought this would be his next assignment .
" I could have said , ' No , ' " he said before adding , " I do n't think I would have been doing honor to myself or honor to my calling . "

All About Guantanamo Bay • September 11 Attacks
Almost nothing Misha Defonseca wrote about herself or her horrific childhood during the Holocaust was true .
She did n't live with a pack of wolves to escape the Nazis .
She did n't trek 1,900 miles across Europe in search of her deported parents , nor kill a German soldier in self - defense .
She 's not even Jewish .
Defonseca , a Belgian writer now living in Massachusetts , admitted through her lawyers this week that her best - selling book , " Misha : A Memoire of the Holocaust Years , " was an elaborate fantasy she kept repeating , even as the book was translated into 18 languages and made into a feature film in France .
" This story is mine .
It is not actually reality , but my reality , my way of surviving , " Defonseca said in a statement given by her lawyers to The Associated Press .
" I ask forgiveness to all who felt betrayed .
I beg you to put yourself in my place , of a 4 - year - old girl who was very lost , " the statement said .
Defonseca , 71 , has an unlisted number in Dudley , about 50 miles southwest of Boston .
Her husband , Maurice , told The Boston Globe on Thursday that she would not comment .
Defonseca wrote in her book that Nazis seized her parents when she was a child , forcing her to wander the forests and villages of Europe alone for four years .
She claimed she found herself trapped in the Warsaw ghetto and was adopted by a pack of wolves that protected her .
Her two Brussels - based lawyers said the author acknowledged her story was not autobiographical .
In the statement , Defonseca said she never fled her home in Brussels during the war to find her parents .
Defonseca says her real name is Monique De Wael and that her parents were arrested and killed by Nazis as Belgian resistance fighters .
The statement said her parents were arrested when she was 4 and she was taken care of by her grandfather and uncle .
She said she was poorly treated by her adopted family , called a " daughter of a traitor " because of her parents ' role in the resistance , which she said led her to " feel Jewish . "
She said there were moments when she " found it difficult to differentiate between what was real and what was part of my imagination . "
Pressure on the author to defend the accuracy of her book had grown in recent weeks , after the release of evidence found by Sharon Sergeant , a genealogical researcher in Waltham .
Sergeant said she found clues in the unpublished U.S. version of the book , including Defonseca 's maiden name " De Wael " – which was changed in the French version – and photos .
After a few months of research , she found Defonseca 's Belgium baptismal certificate and school record , as well as information that showed her parents were members of the Belgian resistance .
" Each piece was plausible , but the difficulty was when you put it all together , " Sergeant said .
Others also had doubts .
" I 'm not an expert on relations between humans and wolves , but I am a specialist of the persecution of Jews , and they ( Defonseca 's family ) can't be found in the archives , " Belgian historian Maxime Steinberg told RTL television .
" The De Wael family is not Jewish nor were they registered as Jewish . "
Multimillion dollar legal battle
Defonseca 's attorneys , siblings Nathalie and Marc Uyttendaele , contacted the author last weekend to show her evidence published in the Belgian daily Le Soir , which also questioned her story .
" We gave her this information and it was very difficult .
She was confronted with a reality that is different from what she has been living for 70 years , " Nathalie Uyttendaele said .
Defonseca 's admission is just the latest controversy surrounding her 1997 book , which also spawned a multimillion dollar legal battle between the woman , her co-author and the book 's US publisher .
Defonseca had been asked to write the book by publisher Jane Daniel in the 1990s , after Daniel heard the writer tell the story in a Massachusetts synagogue .
Daniel and Defonseca fell out over profits received from the best - selling book , which led to a lawsuit .
In 2005 , a Boston court ordered Daniel to pay Defonseca and her ghost writer Vera Lee $ 22.5 million .
Defonseca 's lawyers said Daniel has not yet paid the court - ordered sum .
Daniel said Friday she felt vindicated by Defonseca 's admission and would try to get the judgment overturned .
She said she could not fully research Defonseca 's story before it was published because the woman claimed she did not know her parents ' names , her birthday or where she was born .
" There was nothing to go on to research , " she said .
Lee , of Newton , muttered " Oh my God " when told Defonseca made up her childhood and was not Jewish .
She said she always believed the stories the woman told her as they prepared to write the book , and no research she did gave her a reason not to .
" She always maintained that this was truth as she recalled it , and I trusted that that was the case , " Lee said .
" I was just totally bowled over by the news . "
BAGHDAD  American - trained Iraqi security forces failed for a third straight day to oust Shiite militias from the southern city of Basra on Thursday , even as President Bush hailed the operation as a sign of the growing strength of Iraq ’s federal government .
The fighting in Basra against the Mahdi Army , the armed wing of the political movement led by the radical Shiite cleric Moktada al - Sadr , set off clashes in cities throughout Iraq .
Major demonstrations were staged in a number of Shiite areas of Baghdad , including Sadr City , the huge neighborhood that is Mr. Sadr ’s base of power .
Although Mr. Bush praised the Iraqi government for leading the fighting , it also appeared that the Iraqi government was pursuing its own agenda , calling the battles a fight against “ criminal ” elements but seeking to marginalize the Mahdi Army .
The Americans share the Iraqi government ’s hostility toward what they call rogue elements of the Mahdi Army but will also be faced with the consequences if the battles among Shiite factions erupt into more widespread unrest .
They say ...
1. That Hell is just beneath you , less than twenty miles away .
According to Pastor James Melton " the sphere of Hell is a round , hollowed - out place in the Earth 's core ... Scientists say that the Earth 's outer crust is less than twenty miles thick , and that beyond that point , there [ is ] ... a lake of fire .
[ At ] this very moment your eternal soul may be less than twenty miles from the burning fires of Hell ! "
Pastor Melton 's not alone .
According to Dial - the - Truth Ministries , hell is unquestionably inside of the Earth .
" The great pit [ of ] hell would only need to be about 100 miles or less in diameter to contain , with much room to spare , all the forty billion or so people who have ever lived , assuming their spiritual bodies are the same size as their physical bodies . "
2 . That the earth is stationary ; the universe in fact orbits the Earth .

According to the Fair Education Foundation , the universe , " the stars , every 23 hours and 56 minutes ... go around a stationary Earth . "
The Association for Biblical Astronomy believes similarly .

Gary Null ’s Goons Threaten to Sue MeandChallenge Me to Debate
Lee Phillips
Recap
Recently I heard some bad - sounding medical advice offered by someone called Gary Null on his WPFW ( DC area ) radio show .
I took a quick look on the web to find out about this guy , and it was n’t pretty .
I wrote a letter to the station .
Response from Gary Null
So far , WPFW has not responded to me directly .
However , it appears that they forwarded my email to someone within Gary Null & Associates , and got a reply from someone named Doug , which they forwarded to me .
It ’s clear that there is a history of communication between people at WPFW , notably the program director , and Doug concerning the recent reduction in airtime for Gary Null ’s show , and Doug ’s response is in that context .
It was n’t hard to find out who Doug is , as I show later .
For now I ’ll display the response from Doug in full .
I ’ve resisted the temptation to litter the text with [ sic ] s , but have just copied and pasted the whole thing , leaving all the spelling , punctuation , and grammar mistakes as they are in the original .
I think the quality of the correspondence originating from Gary Null ’s organization reveals something .
Here it is :
Dear Bobby :
For every one of these letters , I can produce 100 touting the efficacy of Gary ’s nutritional / lifestyle counseling .
This has the distinctive handwriting of one of the Quackbuster groups ’ plants .
And by the way , we will be suing these phonies in the not - too - distant future .
I have been intimately involved in the action and am thus intimately familiar with their coded language .
I would love the good doctor to come onto Gary ’s show and debate him on the merits of taking vitamin C in the dosages Gary suggests .
Gary took the high road by requesting that his audience not call into your station .
Had he not done so , your station would have been inundated with mail and phone calls .
I know because irate listeners called and emailed me , wanting the head of those who canceled Gary ’s show .
I wo n’t waste anymore time dealing with Phillips ’ gibberish , but I will extend an open invitation to the good doctor to come on Gary ’s show and openly debate him on the vitamin C issue , Gary ’s Ph.D. , or anything else he would like to debate him on .
It ’s easy to hide in the bushes and throw rocks .
So , if he can take his tail from between his legs long enough to debate , he is more than welcome .
And by the way , one might accuse him of medical malpractice for not keeping up with the scientific literature - not produced by Gary - but by the world ’s best medical universities and colleges .
Their research supports virtually everything Gary does .
But there is a disconnect in orthodoxy between the researchers and the doctors like the good doctor Phillips .
And do you know who pays the price ?
Look in the cemeteries , the wards of hospitals , the mental institutions , etc .
Phillips , undoubtedly sees no correlation between vaccines and autism .
Why does n’t he tell that to the children victimized by this archaic way of thinking ?
Or better yet , why does n’t he cure children of autism as Gary has done .
Why does n’t he cure his patients of AIDS , as Gary has ?
Why does n’t he cure them of cancer , as Gary has ?
Rather than being upset that he sent this biased letter to me ( I could n’t fathom why , since we called of the horses who would have flooded your station with letters of support for Gary .
Did you do it to show there was support for your action ? )
Well , it does n’t much matter .
The dye is cast .
By the way , should the good doctor accept this challenge , i would like to see his curriculum vitae in advance .
And do you really thing he accidentally came across Gary ’s show ?
Very Truly Yours ,
Doug
I thought it was amusing that Doug was threatening to sue me while also challenging me to come on the show to debate .
Ever the glutton for punishment , I replied .
Um Saad , a middle - aged woman living in the Sunni district of Khadra in west Baghdad , blames the Americans for the death of her husband and two of her sons and threatens revenge .
" They are monsters and devils wearing human clothes , " she exclaims vehemently .
" One day I will put on an explosive belt under my clothes and then blow myself up among the Americans .
I will get revenge against them for my husband and sons and I will go to paradise . "
Just as the White House and the Pentagon were trumpeting the success of " the surge " – the dispatch of extra American troops to Iraq last year – and the wire services ' claim that the country has enjoyed " months of relative calm " , Um Saad saw Saif , her second son , shot dead as he opened the door of her house .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Iraq is still convulsed by violence and security has only improved compared to the height of the sectarian civil war in 2006 and early 2007 when 65 Iraqis were being killed every day .
By this February the number of dead had fallen to 26 a day though this has risen to 39 in March so far .
The misery of people like Um Saad is the cumulative result of years of war .
Dressed in dark robes , sitting in the bare sitting room of her modest house in al - Khadra , this 49 - year - old woman tells how her family was slowly destroyed .
" I am not educated and I only went to primary school , " she says .
" I married an air force pilot called Latif and we had three sons and one daughter . "
Latif was stationed at Bakr airforce base at Balad , north of Baghdad , during the 1990 - 91 Gulf War and was killed in an American bombing attack .
" I did n't get support from our uncles and aunts so we lived on his pension and we sold a car , a Chevrolet Malibu , he had been given by the government because he was a pilot , " says Um Saad .
Her eldest son , Saad , wanted to enter the military academy just like his father .
Um Saad said she did not want to lose him and instead he went to the police academy and had graduated as a police lieutenant when Saddam Hussein was overthrown in April 2003 .
She wanted him to resign .
" After the fall of Iraq the police were the second target [ of Sunni guerrillas ] after the Americans . "
Saad equivocated over resigning since he held the Americans responsible for killing his father , but the family needed his salary .
He finally decided to leave the police , but before he could do so , on 25 October 2003 , his police station at Khadra was hit by a large car bomb .
He was uninjured by the blast but , as he ran with his pistol drawn to help a friend , American soldiers at the scene thought he was attacking them .
" They shot him dead with six bullets in the head and many more in the body , " says his mother .
Um Saad says it was at this point she began to hate the Americans : " I do not look on them as human beings . "
Her priority was to try to save her three surviving children .
She was particularly worried about Saif , 17 and in his fifth year in secondary school , because many of his friends had joined al - Qa'ida in Iraq .
Um Saad thought it would be safest if Saif went to Syria and she enticed him to go there at the end of 2006 by telling him that his cousin Mariam , whose family had already fled there , was in love with him and wanted to marry him .
Saif came back to Baghdad in October last year when Syria changed its visa and residency requirements .
Um Saad was " desperately worried because the security situation was bad " .
It was at this time that the US forces in Khadra had set up al - Sahwa , the Awakening Council , as a Sunni anti-al - Qa'ida force .
" I was so stupid , " says Um Saad bitterly .
" I thought the danger was that Saif would join al - Qa'ida because the Americans had killed his father and brother . "
In fact he secretly joined al - Sahwa and was expecting to earn $ 400 a month .
On the night of 15 February as the family were having their supper there was knock on the door .
Saif answered it and Um Saad heard shots .
" I was too late , " she says .
" He was lying dead on the doorstep and on his chest was a piece of paper saying : ' Death to al - Sahwa and all enemies of al - Qa'ida ' . "
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
Three U.S. soldiers were killed and 31 others wounded in two rocket attacks Sunday afternoon in Baghdad , the U.S. military said .
Mehdi Army militiamen celebrate after attacking an Iraqi Army vehicle in Baghdad 's Sadr City on Sunday .
Earlier Sunday , fighting between U.S. troops and the Mehdi Army militia loyal to Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr left at least 20 dead and 52 wounded in Baghdad 's Sadr City , according to an Iraqi Interior Ministry official .
The U.S. military said it had no information about the Sadr City fighting .
Sunday 's violence came as Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki demanded al - Sadr disband his Mehdi Army and threatened to bar al - Sadr 's followers from the political process if the cleric refused .
Watch a report from the front line in Sadr City »
" A decision was taken yesterday that they no longer have a right to participate in the political process or take part in the upcoming elections unless they end the Mehdi Army , " al - Maliki said .
Sunday 's American fatalities bring the death toll of U.S. troops in the Iraq war to 4,022 ; that toll includes eight civilian contractors working for the Pentagon .
Nearly 30,000 others have been wounded in action .
An attack involving a " couple of rounds " of fire on the International Zone , also known as the Green Zone , killed two soldiers and wounded 17 others about 3:30 p.m. , a military official said , declining to give the specific location of the attack for security reasons .
A separate attack about 30 minutes earlier killed one soldier and wounded 14 at a U.S. military outpost in Rustamiya in southeastern Baghdad , the military said .
Responding to al - Maliki 's comments , a spokesman for al - Sadr , Sheikh Salah al - Obeidi , said that any effort to bar Sadrists from participation in politics would be unconstitutional -- and that any decision to disband the Mehdi Army is not the government 's to make .
" It is up to the side that established it , " he said .
Al - Maliki spoke in an exclusive interview with CNN after a weeklong military offensive against what Iraqi officials called gangs and militia members in the southern Iraqi city of Basra .
Hundreds were killed or wounded in the fighting across Iraq , which reportedly ended when Iranian and Iraqi Shiite officials held talks in Iran with al - Sadr .
Asked about Iran 's role in ending the Basra conflict , al - Maliki attributed the cease - fire to the work of his security forces .
Haidar al - Abadi , an Iraqi lawmaker who belongs to al - Maliki's Dawa Party , said last week that Iranian officials participated in the discussions , and another source close to the talks said the Iranians pressured al - Sadr to craft an agreement .
" I am not aware of such an attempt , " al - Maliki said Sunday .
" What happened on the ground and the breakdown in the structure of this militia is what made Muqtada al - Sadr issue his statement to withdraw his militants from the streets .
What happened was something to save Muqtada , not to help us . "
Watch al - Maliki talk about issues that concern Iraq »
In northern Iraq , security forces detained a suspect Sunday and were searching for others in connection with the kidnapping of 42 college students , authorities said .
Gunmen seized the male students in northern Iraq before releasing them several hours later , according to a military spokesman and police in Nineveh province .
None was harmed , according to the U.S. military .
Gunmen stopped two buses loaded with students who were on their way to college , but one bus managed to escape , police said .
Four students on the bus that escaped were wounded by gunfire , police said .
Students on the other bus were released Sunday afternoon after coalition military forces spotted the bus during an air patrol on the western outskirts of Mosul , according to a U.S. military news release .
The kidnappers fled the vehicle after it was stopped , according to a military press release .

Merseyrail wants to target persistent offenders
A train operator is banning passengers who put their feet on the seats .
Merseyrail , which runs local services from Liverpool out to Cheshire , Wirral and West Lancashire , is also cracking down on people who fail to buy tickets .
The company brought in a zero tolerance policy to passengers putting their feet on seats last February .
Repeat offenders whose bad behaviour annoys and intimidates other passengers may now also be banned from using the Merseyrail network .
The rail network said highly - visible enforcement officers with head cameras had been travelling on its trains as part of the crackdown .
Hundreds prosecuted
A spokesman for the network said : " An exclusion letter will be served to such an offender only after prior written warning and when they next appear in a magistrates court after having committed a further offence .
" The exclusion will apply for a set period and for all of or parts of the Merseyrail network , depending on individual circumstances . "
Merseyrail is the only train operator in the country to prosecute passengers for putting their feet on seats .
More than 500 train passengers have been prosecuted by the company since it began enforcement in February , including a student who was taken to court after being caught with her feet on a seat in June .
She was given an absolute discharge by Chester magistrates .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. gasoline supplies should start the summer driving season at their highest level since 1999 , helping to temper a surge in pump prices linked to the soaring cost of crude oil .

The outlook for high inventories comes amid shrinking American demand for the motor fuel and robust imports from Europe -- factors that will keep stockpiles plump despite low production from domestic refiners , analysts said .
“ We ’ll continue to have above - average gasoline inventories heading into summer and , if it were n’t for the high cost of crude , the price prospects for gasoline would be weaker than they ’ve been for years , ” said Tim Evans , energy analyst at Citigroup Futures Research in New York .
U.S. gasoline stockpiles hit a 14 - year high of 236 million barrels in March even as surging oil costs pulled pump prices to record levels over $ 3.20 per gallon .
Stockpiles have eased back since then as refiners slowed output due to seasonal maintenance and weak profit margins , and further declines are expected in the coming weeks .
But the U.S. government ’s Energy Information Administration said it still expects inventories remain over 219 million barrels by the end of May -- the traditional start to the summer vacation season -- putting them at their highest level for that time of the year since 1999 .
“ For the consumer , this is a good thing because it is keeping gasoline prices from going completely crazy , ” said Sander Cohan , oil market analyst at Energy Security Analysis Inc in Boston .
COOLING DEMAND
The two main factors protecting gasoline inventories from a sharp decline before driving season , experts said , are soft consumption and robust import levels .
The EIA expects this year ’s summer gasoline demand in the United States -- a country known for its resilient love for road travel -- to shrink for the first time since 1991 under the weight of an economic slowdown .
“ We agree with the government that summer gasoline demand will shrink this year , which will be a key factor keeping stockpile levels relatively high , ” said Eric Wittenauer , analyst at Wachovia Securities in New York .
Meanwhile , imports from Europe are likely to continue to push into the U.S. market .
Europe increasingly favors diesel as a motor fuel , leaving it with an oversupply of gasoline from its refineries that typically sails west across the Atlantic .
“ There ’s an overall European surplus of gasoline , ” said ESAI ’s Cohan .
“ Certainly European imports will provide some of the balance . ”
The expected robust stockpile levels at the start of the summer driving season , which runs from Memorial Day weekend in May to Labor Day weekend in early September , will come despite below - normal output levels from domestic refiners .
“ We ’re anticipating that refiners will wait as long as possible to start producing more gasoline , ” said Cohan .
“ Until they can get a more favorable crude price or until they absolutely have to because of low stockpiles , they wo n’t . ”
Valero Energy Corp VLO.N , Tesoro Corp TSO.N and ConocoPhillips COP.N have each said they have reduced production from their U.S. refineries due to poor profit margins -- adding to output losses from maintenance shutdowns .
U.S. refinery utilization rates dropped in late March to the lowest level since 2005 , when two major hurricanes had flooded plants along the Gulf Coast , and they ’ve climbed back only slightly since then , according to government data .
SEOUL , South Korea ( CNN ) -- North Korea cut off dialogue with South Korea on Thursday , claiming the peninsula was on the brink of another war .
North Korea is taking aim at South Korea , claiming the peninsula is on the brink of another war .
North Korea also accused South Korea of driving their relationship to " confrontation and catastrophe . "
The country said it was stopping dialogue after South Korea failed to apologize for remarks one of its generals made this week .
The general said South Korea would attack suspected nuclear weapons sites in North Korea if the North tried to attack the South with atomic bombs .
The communist nation said it would take unspecified " military actions " to punish South Korea .
The news comes as South Korean President Lee Myung - bak called for dialogue in the midst of escalating tensions between the two nations .
" What we want is a straightforward talk with North Korea , " Lee said , according to South Korea 's Yonhap news agency .
" We want the North to come to the dialogue table with a more sincere attitude . "
North Korea has bristled in response to Lee 's promised tougher stance toward the North .
He took office in late February .
For its part , North Korea has accused Seoul of taking on pro-U.S. policies .
" South Korea 's conservative regime is driving the north - south relations to confrontation and catastrophe , blatantly swimming against the trend of the era of independence , reunification , peace and prosperity , " an unidentified spokesman for the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland said in a statement broadcast by state - run media in North Korea .
The group sometimes serves as a mouthpiece for the government .
Two days earlier , the communist nation called Lee " a traitor . "
On March 27 , North Korea expelled 11 South Korean officials from a joint industrial park in Kaesong , North Korea .
That move came after South Korea 's unification minister said it would be hard to expand the park without North Korean progress on de-nuclearization .
The next day , North Korea fired a barrage of short - range missiles of its western coast .
Then state - run television in North Korea warned that it would turn parts of South Korean into " ashes " in the event of a pre-emptive South Korean strike on its nuclear sites .
Watch the war of words escalate among the two Koreas »
That threat came in apparent response to comments from a senior South Korean military official that South Korea would attack suspected nuclear weapons sites in North Korea if the north tried to attack the South with atomic bombs .
Lee called North Korea 's threats " undesirable " on Thursday during a meeting of the country 's ranking generals , Yonhap reported .
" Since my inauguration , North Korea has intensified tension across the border , " Lee said .
" But I do n't expect the situation to deteriorate further . "
The two countries have technically remained in a state of war since the Korean War ended in 1953 , although relations have warmed somewhat in the last eight years .
The Korean conflict ended in a truce , but no formal peace treaty was ever signed .
Leaders of the two nations held an historic summit in 2000 , paving the way for the reunification of some families who were separated during the war .
A second summit followed in October 2007 , but concerns over North Korea 's nuclear program have loomed over interactions between the two countries .
North Korea agreed last year to dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for economic aid and better relations with the United States .
North Korea still must finish the nuclear disablement process for the first phase of the agreement .
Last week , U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said North Korea has made an " incredible amount of progress " on disablement , but still must complete the process .

Sally Field won an Emmy last night and said dumb things :
“ At the heart of [ her character ] Nora Walker , she is a mother , ” Field said .
“ May they be seen , may their work be valued and raised , and to especially the mothers who stand with an open heart and wait – wait for their children to come home for from danger , from harm ’s way and from war .
I ’m not finished .
I have to finish talking … if the mothers ruled the world there would be no goddamn wars in the first place . ”
When she said “ goddamn ” onstage , however , Fox censors apparently took the opportunity to bleep the rest of her comments .
“ I wanted to say something about the mothers who wait for their military children to come home from harm ’s way , ” she said backstage .
“ I said at the end that if mothers ruled the world , there would be no wars . ”
When asked if she minded that her comments may have been cut off , she said , “ Oh well . ”
“ I ’ve been there before , ” she added .
“ If [ mothers ] ruled the world we would n’t be sending our children off to be slaughtered .
I should n’t have said the ‘ god ’ before the damn . ”
Jesus H. Christ .
I remember the first time I encountered this sort of opinion – that if women were in charge , humanity would live in peace .
I was 11 or 12 years old and read it in a book , and I swear to god , I actually laughed out loud .
I remember thinking , this fool has obviously never met any females .
It starts in about 4th grade , when girls start engaging in what can only be called a war of attrition via emotional abuse .
They form evil little cliques and set about utterly destroying each other ’s self - esteem and pride .
I got glasses when I was 11 , and the first dozen people to call me “ four - eyes ” were girls .
When I did n’t start growing boobies as early as some of the others , it was the girls who snickered at me on the playground and called me President of the Itty - Bitty Titty Committee .
There was a fat girl in my neighborhood back then , and guess who shunned her and called her “ pig ” and “ lardbutt ” on the bus ?
Not the boys .
( Granted , they just ignored her .
But which is really worse ? )
Then you move on to the nightmare - scape called junior high school , where the females carefully hone their craft and the sabotage is raised to a whole new level of hate .
During my soul - ripping years there , I had one boy who “ bullied ” me but there about five girls who did , and they were ten times meaner about it .
Sneaky and manipulative .
At least when boys pick on you , it ’s all out in the open .
Girls ?
Oh god no .
They use subterfuge and reconnaissance .
Girls will pretend to be your best friend just to discover your weaknesses , which they ’ll then employ to bring you down .
Like the bitches in my 7th grade homeroom class .
For reasons known only to Satan , a group of them decided they hated a girl named Cassie , who lived near me and was actually a really sweet kid .
These girls befriended her for a while , let her into their “ friend ” ship ring of evil , and then suddenly one day when she walked in , they completely ignored her .
I remember her crying later at lunchtime , and I heard that she ’d told them that her stepdad drank beer in the evenings and now those little snots were telling the whole school he was an alcoholic .
That rumor never died .
But that ’s nothing .
Wait until high school , when the competition for boys gets serious and the rumor - mongering takes on apocalyptic proportions .
This is when the girls start calling each other sluts just because they like the same guys .
There was a cheerleader at my high school who got pregnant in 11th grade and she went from being the one all of us envied to the one we all called dirty , dirty names .
The boys never really said anything but the girls , oh sweet Jesus , we were brutal .
On the bathroom wall , someone wrote in lipstick , “ Tiffany is the WHOREleader !
Keep your legs closed SLUT . ”
Sugar and spice , my ass .
Then we grow up and start having babies , becoming those sainted “ mothers ” Sally is talking about .
You know , like Britney .
Or more seriously , like this woman or this woman or this woman .
I ’m not trying to say men are any better , because they ’re not .
They commit most of the murder and mayhem on this planet but frankly , I think that ’s just because they have more time on their hands .
It ’s absurd to think that putting women in control of the world would make any difference ; women have just as much hate , spite , and pure evil in them as men do .
We simply express it differently most of the time , but not always .
There have been times when mothers held vast power , and did they bring peace to all lands ?
Ask Cleopatra .
Anyway .
I know I ’m opening up a big nasty can of political incorrectness , but what bugs me the most about the idea that “ there would n’t be any goddamn wars in the first place ” if mothers were in charge is that it ignores the fact that there probably would n’t be any goddamn technology , either .
Or modern medicine or modern cities or most all the shit we take for granted , 99.9 % of which was invented , built , and maintained by men .
I wonder if people like Sally Field would have mothers “ in charge ” but still let the men do all the dirty hard work .
Not that we ’d still be living in caves necessarily but really , it deserves some thought .
The exact same testosterone - fueled drive that makes men fight wars also makes them build bridges and tall buildings and computers .
Made them hunt animals to feed the tribe , made them relentlessly experiment with domestication of animals and crops , made them invent metallurgy , made them invent the fucking wheel .
There is no doubt that women are intellectually capable of all of these things , but the fact is that we did not do them on any kind of meaningful scale throughout all of human history .
And it ’s not just because we ’ve been too busy making babies for 150,000 years .
It ’s because we do n’t have as much testosterone , and therefore we are n’t as big , as strong , as daring , or as experimental as men .
And this really is okay to admit .
Who knows what would happen if women did n’t have to carry pregnancies and raise children and so had more time on their hands ; I ’m sure it could be a piquant debate .
But if you want my personal opinion , I ’m gonna have to go with : it would n’t be much different than it has been .
Nor would it be different if “ mothers ” were suddenly put in charge .
I feel vicarious resentment of that claim because if I were a man with children , I ’d really like to know just what in the hell makes Sally Field think women love their children more than men do .
Human nature is what it is , and we will fight over shit until we go extinct .
Even if the best mother EVER was Queen of the Planet , someone somewhere would still need to have their ass kicked , and she ’d have to send somebody ’s child to do it .
Science & Exploration Titan ’s surface organics surpass oil reserves on Earth 13/02/2008 8179 views 7 likes
Saturn ’s orange moon Titan has hundreds of times more liquid hydrocarbons than all the known oil and natural gas reserves on Earth , according to new Cassini data .
The hydrocarbons rain from the sky , collecting in vast deposits that form lakes and dunes .
The new findings from the study led by Ralph Lorenz , Cassini radar team member from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory , USA , are reported in the 29 January 2008 issue of the Geophysical Research Letters .
" Titan is just covered in carbon - bearing material — it ’s a giant factory of organic chemicals , " said Lorenz .
“ This vast carbon inventory is an important window into the geology and climate history of Titan . ”
At a balmy minus 179 º C , Titan is a far cry from Earth .
Instead of water , liquid hydrocarbons in the form of methane and ethane are present on the moon 's surface , and tholins probably make up its dunes .
The term ‘ tholins ’ was coined by Carl Sagan in 1979 to describe the complex organic molecules at the heart of prebiotic chemistry .
Cassini has mapped about 20 % of Titan 's surface with radar .
Several hundred lakes and seas have been observed , with each of several dozen estimated to contain more hydrocarbon liquid than Earth 's oil and gas reserves .
The dark dunes that run along the equator contain a volume of organics several hundred times larger than Earth 's coal reserves .
Radar Shows Evidence of Seas on Titan Proven reserves of natural gas on Earth total 130 thousand million tons , enough to provide 300 times the amount of energy the entire United States uses annually for residential heating , cooling and lighting .
Dozens of Titan 's lakes individually have the equivalent of at least this much energy in the form of methane and ethane .
" This global estimate is based mostly on views of the lakes in the northern polar regions .
We have assumed the south might be similar , but we really do n’t yet know how much liquid is there , " said Lorenz .
Cassini 's radar has observed the south polar region only once , and only two small lakes were visible .
Future observations of that area are planned during Cassini ’s proposed extended mission .
Scientists estimated Titan 's lake depth by making some general assumptions based on lakes on Earth .
They took the average area and depth of lakes on Earth , taking into account the nearby surroundings , like mountains .
On Earth , the lake depth is often 10 times less than the height of nearby terrain .
" We also know that some lakes are more than 10 m or so deep because they appear literally pitch - black to the radar .
If they were shallow we'd see the bottom , and we don't , " said Lorenz .
Seas on Titan
The question of how much liquid is on the surface is an important one because methane is a strong greenhouse gas on Titan as well as on Earth , but there is much more of it on Titan .
If all the observed liquid on Titan is methane , it would only last a few million years , because as methane escapes into Titan 's atmosphere , it breaks down and escapes into space .
If the methane were to run out , Titan could become much colder .
Scientists believe that methane might be supplied to the atmosphere by venting from the interior in cryovolcanic eruptions .
If so , the amount of methane , and the temperature on Titan , may have fluctuated dramatically in Titan ’s past .
“ We are carbon - based life , and understanding how far along the chain of complexity towards life that chemistry can go in an environment like Titan will be important in understanding the origins of life throughout the universe , ” added Lorenz .
Cassini's next radar flyby of Titan is on 22 February 2008 , when the radar instrument will observe the landing site of ESA ’s Huygens probe .

More than 100 construction companies have been accused of conspiring to rig thousands of public sector contracts worth billions of pounds .
The Office Of Fair Trading today formally named 112 companies that it says colluded to inflate the cost of a wide range of contracts , including tenders for schools , universities and hospitals .
The list includes several publicly listed companies , including Balfour Beatty and Carillion .
About 80 of the firms have already admitted participating in some form of bid-rigging , or have applied for leniency in return for assisting the OFT .
The Liberal Democrats said the scale of the allegations was " shocking " and that taxpayers had been ripped off by avaricious builders .
The four - year investigation - one of the OFT 's biggest - centred on a practice known as cover pricing , in which construction firms secretly agreed the prices they would submit during a tender process .
A firm that did not want to win the contract would submit a price that was much too high .
In some cases , the eventual successful bidder would then reward them with a secret payment .
Cover pricing means that the tendering authority , which could be a local council or other customer , is given a false impression of the level of competition and could end up paying inflated prices .
According to the OFT , this bid rigging often involved false invoices .
" Cartel activity of the type alleged today harms the economy by distorting competition and keeping prices artificially high , " said John Fingleton , the OFT chief executive .
The local government association , which represents councils in England , said companies who were found guilty of price - rigging should be made to repay their victims .
" It will come as a shock to residents that some construction companies have rigged bids for contracts at the taxpayers ' cost .
Local authorities strive to ensure that any new building which they pay for is delivered at the best value for the taxpayer , but it appears that some firms have failed to abide by the law , " said Sir Simon Milton , who chairs the association .
" Greedy building barons " blamed
The OFT inquiry began in the east Midlands in 2004 , but quickly spread to Yorkshire , Humberside and then across the UK .
Its officials raided 57 companies during the course of the probe .
The statement of objections has now been sent to the 112 companies , who must respond within a few months .
Under competition law , they could be fined up to 10 % of their global turnover , although those that cooperate will receive a lower penalty .
Balfour Beatty said it was cooperating fully with the OFT .
In return , it has been granted leniency over any future fine .
Sarah Teather , the Liberal Democrat shadow business secretary , said the OFT should " throw the book " at price fixers who have pushed up the cost of houses , schools and hospitals .
" The current select committee inquiry into the construction industry could n't come at a better time - I look forward to these greedy building barons explaining themselves to MPs , " she said .
The Construction Confederation , which represents many of the UK's building and civil engineering contractors , explained that one cause of cover pricing is that busy companies overbid for contracts in order to avoid winning the work but at the same time keeping their names on tender lists .
The confederation said high bids were not illegal but acknowledged that if such bids were discussed with rival bidders - to confirm , for example , the bid was too high to win - then competition law had been broken .
It called on the OFT to deliver a " sensible and proportionate response " to the findings of its investigation .
It warned that in an industry where margins were traditionally about 2.5- 3.5 % , fines of up to 10 % of turnover would threaten the viability of companies as would removing them from public tender lists .
It argued such action could cut the number of contractors able to tender for future work - reducing competition .
The confederation 's chief executive , Stephen Ratcliffe , said : " Let 's be clear what we are dealing with in cover pricing - there was no intention to make a single penny at the taxpayers ' expense , just an attempt by busy contractors not to win work without upsetting the client . "
One report this morning claimed the alleged collusion meant local authorities overpaid by about 10 % .
However , the OFT declined to say what the impact had been .
Europe 's new space freighter prepares for maiden voyage
BY STEPHEN CLARK
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : March 5 , 2008
Lauded as the most advanced spaceship ever built by Europeans , a robotic orbital freighter named Jules Verne will blast off from the Atlantic coast of South America this weekend to begin a three - week chase of the international space station .

Liftoff of Jules Verne at the tip of a beefed up Ariane 5 rocket is set for 0403:04 GMT Sunday ( 11:03:04 p.m. EST Saturday ) from the European - controlled spaceport in Kourou , French Guiana .
The launch is timed for the instant Earth 's rotation brings the ELA - 3 launch pad into the space station 's orbital path .
Senior leaders representing the European Space Agency , Arianespace , contractors , and other international partners met Wednesday in a launch readiness review to clear the mission for flight .
" We are very pleased to smoothly pass this milestone four days before launch as scheduled , " said John Ellwood , ESA ATV project manager .
" Now we really feel to be ready , and our Russian and NASA partners have expressed the same confidence . "
The 17 - story rocket will be rolled from its assembly building to the ELA - 3 launch pad in Kourou on Friday .
Once the Ariane 5 completes the 1.7 - mile trip , workers will connect electrical and fluid lines between the launcher and ground systems in preparation for the final countdown , which will kick off around midday Saturday .
See our detailed countdown timeline here .
Tipping the scales at 42,700 pounds , Jules Verne is more than two times heavier than any other spacecraft put into orbit by Europe .
The first of five Automated Transfer Vehicles , the ship will deliver more than five tons of cargo to the station after going through a shakedown to make sure it is ready to approach the station .
The Ariane 5 rocket , a vehicle typically used to loft commercial communications satellites for launch provider Arianespace , was strengthened to handle the hefty mass .
Engineers also had to make a few software changes because of the huge payload , and the launch will use an extended 56 - foot payload fairing to house Jules Verne during the early minutes of flight .

The rocket and its prized payload will have two opportunities to get off the ground Sunday and Monday mornings , European time .
Under an agreement with NASA , the Ariane 5 will stand down Tuesday to give the shuttle Endeavour a chance to launch .
If Endeavour lifts off Tuesday , the Ariane 5 will try again beginning Wednesday morning , according to Kirk Shireman , NASA deputy station program manager .
The shuttle and the ATV can't launch on the same day because both vehicles use S - band communications through NASA 's Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System , Shireman said .
Riding nearly three million pounds of thrust , the Ariane 5 will fly northeast from the Guiana Space Center after liftoff , jettisoning its twin solid rocket boosters less than two - and - a - half minutes later and exhausting its first stage about nine minutes into the launch .
Its storable propellant upper stage will fire twice before Jules Verne is cast free from the launcher .
See our detailed launch timeline here .
Jules Verne will be deployed in a 162 - mile - high orbit inclined 51.6 degrees to the equator .
After separation , mission responsibility will switch from Kourou to the ATV control center in Toulouse , France .

The upper stage will conduct a final burn about 90 minutes later to set a course for destruction as the spent rocket body plummets into the Earth 's atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean .
Jules Verne will begin its activation sequence moments after the Ariane 5 unleashes the spacecraft , turning on its electrical system , unfurling a communications antenna boom , and preparing for orbital operations .
" The ATV is switched on and the propulsion system is primed , the solar arrays are deployed , and we start the GPS , which provides the navigation in the first phase , " said Bob Chesson , head of ESA 's human spaceflight and exploration operations .
Waiting for station traffic to clear
Once controllers finish turning the ATV into a fully functional spaceship , attention will turn to its pursuit of the international space station .
The first orbital " phasing " maneuver is scheduled for less than 12 hours after launch , beginning a three - week process to bring Jules Verne to the station 's vicinity .
See our detailed mission timeline here .
The craft will spend its first ten days in space gradually shifting its orbit higher as ground controllers put the craft through a rigorous series of tests to confirm it is ready to approach the space station .
" The phasing period allows us to catch up with the space station and get it within our sights , " Chesson said .
The comprehensive checkout will include an attitude control experiment , navigation tests using the ATV's GPS system , and the demonstration of a critical emergency thruster firing to be used if something goes awry during the final rendezvous .
The collision avoidance maneuver is an engine burn to push the ATV away from the station at a relative velocity of 11 miles per hour .
That test is scheduled for approximately 0800 GMT ( 4:00 a.m. EDT ) March 12 .
Jules Verne will eventually arrive at a point about 1,200 miles in front of the space station by about March 19 .
The craft will hold in that orbit to wait out the shuttle Endeavour 's visit to the station , which is scheduled to wrap up with an undocking on March 24 .

The station 's international partners agreed to flight rules dictating that visiting spacecraft are not permitted to dock with the orbiting outpost while a shuttle is present .
Despite the conflict of Endeavour 's mission , station managers opted to give the go - ahead for the ATV 's launch .
" We 'll launch as soon as ATV is ready , the launcher is ready , and the ground segment is ready , " Ellwood said .
" We then go to the space station and we have the option of immediately docking to the space station if the conditions are right , or we could loiter close to the space station . "
The loitering philosophy will burn roughly 50 pounds of propellant per day , giving officials several options in their mission planning .
" We 're actually more flexible in space than we are on the ground , " said Alan Thirkettle , ESA space station program manager .
Demo
Days pave way for docking Once Endeavour departs the station , ESA controllers will resume putting Jules Verne through a checklist of pre-docking activities .
The freighter will begin its push toward the station early on March 27 , setting up for the first two " demo days " to showcase the craft 's ability to autonomously fly in close proximity to the outpost .
" In each of those , we demonstrate various aspects of the ATV and prove that those features are working properly to ensure the safety of the vehicle and the station , " Chesson said .
With ground controllers looking over the shoulder of Jules Verne , the craft will automatically fly toward the station through waypoints positioned at various distances from the complex .
The ground team will give the " go " for the ATV to begin different phases of the rendezvous , but the ship 's navigation and flight path will be generated on - board .
" The ATV control center monitors it all the time and we are able , if things go wrong , to interrupt in quite a significant way .
If we spot a problem , for instance , we can initiate an escape maneuver and go off and do a thorough checkout of the spacecraft and even patch the software if necessary to allow us to make another attempt at rendezvous .
There is a lot that the control center can do , " Chesson said .
Initially positioned at an " interface point " 24 miles behind and three miles below the space station , Jules Verne will close within 2.2 miles during the first day of demonstrations , currently set for March 29 .
The ATV ground control center will then command the engines to fire in an escape maneuver to take the spacecraft to a safe orbit , wrapping up the nearly four - hour flight test .
The first demo day will test the long - and medium - range rendezvous navigation system , which relies on GPS antennas affixed to both the station and Jules Verne to produce accurate and timely range and closing rate information .
The data is fed into the ATV 's computers to plot a course toward the craft 's next holding point .
The first Demo Day is planned for March 29 .

Engineers will analyze telemetry streaming back to Earth from Jules Verne and brief the space station mission management team on March 30 .
The team will approve the next step in the mission if the spacecraft behaved as expected , Chesson said .
A docking dress rehearsal is penciled in for March 31 , assuming everything goes as planned on demo day one .
Starting again from the interface point 24 miles behind and three miles below the space station , Jules Verne will move to a distance of 817 feet from the complex using GPS navigation .
At that point , the ATV's high - tech navigation system will begin using data from a suite of eye - like optical sensors attached to the forward end of the ship .
Two videometers , working simultaneously with one in standby mode , will fire pulses of laser light toward the station one - to - ten times per second .
Acting as space mirrors , 26 reflectors positioned on the back end of the station 's Zvezda service module will beam the laser beams back to the sensors on Jules Verne , creating unique light patterns captured on the ATV 's cameras .
The patterns will allow the ATV to autonomously determine its orientation , closing rate and distance from the space station .
Two other sensors known as telegoniometers will serve as watchdogs during the final rendezvous , Ellwood said .
The telegoniometers , similar to police radar guns , will also emit laser light at a different wavelength up to 10,000 times per second toward the reflectors .
The light 's travel time between Jules Verne and the station will determine range , while the direction of the station will be given by the angles of two built - in mirrors rotating to aim the laser at its target .
" We 're the first vehicle which will completely automatically , using optical sensors , dock with the space station , " Ellwood said .
The ATV 's optical navigation system underwent a slate of tests on the ground to give engineers confidence the complicated sensors would work in space .
ESA tested the system using a mobile platform inside a nearly 2,000 - foot - long building in France .
The reflectors were attached to the platform and the ATV 's optical sensors were placed on a robotic arm to imitate the spacecraft 's movement .
" We did this very interesting and unique test of actually doing a real docking on the ground , " Ellwood said .
The second Demo Day is planned for March 31 .

ESA designed extra redundancy in the ATV 's navigation system to mitigate the chances for a guidance failure close to the station , officials said .
" This is a unique technology that we 've developed in Europe , " Ellwood said .
" We 're really looking forward to seeing how it works . "
The ATV is also fitted with Russia 's Kurs rendezvous radar , a venerable system used to guide Soyuz and Progress capsules to automated dockings .
During the docking dress rehearsal , Jules Verne will follow a series of commands to demonstrate its ability to operate in tight quarters with the station .
" We will demonstrate the capability of ATV to hold , resume and retreat , " Chesson said .
" These are maneuvers that we could require if things do n't go correctly during the rendezvous . "
The ship will fly to a distance of less than 40 feet from the Zvezda docking port before pulling back to a point more than 60 feet away .
Finally , the station 's crew will give an escape command from inside the outpost to confirm they have the capability to abort a botched rendezvous .
In addition to the ground control center and astronauts aboard the station , the ATV 's flight computers can also order an escape maneuver if they sense the rendezvous is going badly .
By the end of demo day two , officials expect the ATV to have proven all key features of its design , including GPS navigation and optical navigation , holds and retreats , ground - and crew - commanded escapes , and fine attitude control , Chesson said .
Engineers will also evaluate the performance of flight monitoring software overseeing the ATV 's approach to the station .
The system has the ability to abort operations if things go wrong .
The station mission management team will meet again on April 2 to give a formal " go " for docking if the ATV 's demonstrations are successful .
" This will be a very exciting time , but we 've really got to be sure that the vehicle is behaving exactly as we want , " Ellwood said .
Officials expect to be able to remove the demonstrations from future ATV missions , reducing the launch - to - docking time to about 8 days , according to ESA .
Linking up with the station " What we are doing actually amounts to a controlled collision with the space station - a very soft one , " Chesson said .
Tentatively set for about 1420 GMT ( 10:20 a.m. EDT ) April 3 , Jules Verne 's docking with the international space station must occur during a tight window stretching between March 30 and April 5 .
Docking is scheduled for April 3 .
Credit : NASA /ESA
The docking window is constrained by unfavorable solar angles that could hinder the ship 's rendezvous .
The sun 's light might interfere with a camera mounted on the Zvezda docking port looking back toward the approaching ATV .
Engineers are also concerned that the light could confuse Jules Verne 's intricate sensors that rely on clear visual cues between the craft and reflectors on the space station .
A Soyuz spacecraft is scheduled to launch to the station with the Expedition 17 crew on April 8 .
The ATV will also be precluded from docking during the week - long crew handover , which is expected to end in mid-April .
Officials want to squeeze Jules Verne 's docking before the Soyuz to avoid waiting up to two more weeks for the next rendezvous opportunity .
The shuttle must also undock from the station early enough to allow the ATV to spend a week near the station for its rendezvous demonstrations .
" If the shuttle launches on the 11th or 12th ( of March ) , we still have a shot at those demo days , " Shireman said .
" If the shuttle does n't get off by the 12th , then what happens is the ATV will still launch , but it will wait until after the Soyuz joint mission is complete , and we 'll do the demo days there . "
Threading the needle between narrow docking windows will become even more common as the station continues to grow .
At least five types of visiting vehicles could be flying to the station by the end of next year .
" There 's quite a traffic flow going to the ISS .
We 're thinking about launching an air traffic controller here soon , " Shireman joked .
Much like demo day two , the docking sequence will begin at the interface point before flying through the 2.2 - mile hold point and arriving at the 817 - foot mark behind the station , where navigation control will transition from GPS to optical instruments .
The Toulouse control center will evaluate the ATV 's progress and issue " go " commands for the spacecraft to automatically move to hold points at roughly 65 feet and 30 feet , before giving approval for final approach and docking .

The ATV will aim for a narrow corridor just one - half inch wide at the station 's rear docking port .
The diameter is roughly the size of a Euro coin or a U.S. dime .
" We do a sort of dance with the space station .
They 're under their own control system .
We 're under our control system .
We 're like a pair dancing on the floor .
We come in very , very slowly so that we do not collide , " Ellwood said .
Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko and NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson will monitor the rendezvous from a control station inside Zvezda .
Although station crews can take over manual control if the automatic docking system fails on Russian spacecraft , no such course of action exists for the ATV .
" All they can do is actually press a red button and send us away if they feel it would be unsafe , " Ellwood said .
The station 's crew will follow the approach through a network of video cameras and a live radio link beaming data from the ATV to their console in Zvezda .
Whitson and Malenchenko trained two weeks in Germany to prepare for Jules Verne 's mission .
Multiple failures must occur before the crew would be asked to intervene during docking , said Jean - Francois Clervoy , an ESA astronaut advising the ATV project .
Malenchenko , the prime crew member in charge of ATV docking operations , can order an abort until the ATV reaches three feet from the Zvezda rear port .
After that point , an emergency maneuver could do more harm than good , according to Chesson .
Engine plumes from Jules Verne 's thrusters could damage the station when they are fired at close range .
The abort cutoff point also takes into account the crew 's reaction time , Chesson said .
Jules Verne 's Russian - built docking probe will contact the station at a closing speed of one - sixth of a mile per hour , engaging Zvezda 's cone and forming a loose connection between the two craft .
The ATV 's extended docking probe will retract a few minutes later to bring the two craft together .
Electrical and fluid connectors will be mated , and eight latches will lock to create an airtight seal .
Delivering its cargo After Jules Verne is firmly connected to Zvezda and controllers finish pressure checks in the docking system , the crew will enter the ship .
The cargo carrier hatch , measuring about 31 inches in diameter , will be opened for the crew to access the craft 's cache of supplies .
" This is when the ATV mission in support of the international space station really starts , " Chesson said .

The crew will offload more than 2,500 pounds of dry cargo aboard Jules Verne , including 1,100 pounds of food , 300 pounds of spare parts for the newly - delivered Columbus module , and storage support hardware for the Russian segment .
The station residents will also receive about 176 pounds of fresh clothing , according to ESA .
The ATV will also carry two 19th century manuscripts of Jules Verne novels for a commemorative ceremony on the station .
After removing the dry cargo , the crew will begin stuffing Jules Verne 's logistics carrier with waste material .
" We 'll be using it a bit like the cupboard , " Ellwood said .
The crew will hook up lines to transfer nearly 600 pounds of water for drinking , cleaning and food rehydration .
Astronauts must also manually open valves to move 46 pounds of oxygen into the station 's air supply , according to an EADS fact sheet .
Once fresh water is pumped inside the station , the crew can transfer liquid waste back into the water tanks .
About 1,900 pounds of hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide housed inside Jules Verne 's refueling tanks will flow into Zvezda .
The propellant will be used for the station 's primary propulsion system on the Russian segment of the complex .
The ATV will exhaust about 60 percent of its own 12,900 - pound fuel supply during its flight to the station , leaving about 5,000 pounds of propellant to raise the station 's altitude , steer the complex clear of orbital debris , and provide attitude control when the outpost 's gyroscopes are down .
Jules
Verne must also keep a fuel reserve for the craft 's suicidal de-orbit burn at the end of the mission .
Engineers on the ground will control refueling and re-boost operations .
All told , Jules Verne carries about 10,100 pounds of supplies for the station , including dry cargo and fluids .
After spending about four months at the international space station , Jules Verne will back away from the complex in the first week of August .
The ATV is designed to stay at the station for up to six months , and officials could decide to extend the mission until October , according to an ESA spokesperson .
ATV 's mission ends with a plunge into the atmosphere .

Two engine firings slow the ship 's speed enough to slip into the atmosphere , destroying the craft and up to 14,000 pounds of the station 's discarded waste over the South Pacific .
" That fiery end of the ATV mission really concludes the operations of Jules Verne , " Chesson said .
The risks of automated dockings ESA officials say they have worked incessantly to decrease the mission 's potential risk to the station and its crew , especially since Jules Verne is a first - of - a - kind spacecraft flying to such an important destination .
Similar to technology used on NASA 's DART satellite and the Pentagon 's Orbital Express mission , the optical sensors on the ATV are the ship 's prime source of navigation information during the final approach sequence to the station .
DART 's 2005 mission , designed to operate without any input from the ground , ended in failure due to a cascading list of consequences stemming from a late change in the craft 's software .
The computer improperly processed navigation data from DART 's GPS and optical sensors , causing the spacecraft to lose its orientation and go off course .
" It was n't looked at across the entire system to see the effect of that change across the entire system , " Suffredini said .
" It 's a lesson for us all to keep in mind whenever we are dealing with complicated spacecraft like this . "
The U.S. military 's Orbital Express mission successfully demonstrated autonomous rendezvous and docking using a visual guidance sensor last year , but like the ATV , controllers were actively keyed into the process through each step .
" DART was a totally automated vehicle .
We turned it on and sent it on its way , and sure enough it had an interesting life .
That is not the case with the ATV , " Suffredini said .
" It is automated , so it knows what it 's supposed to do , but along the way , particularly on this flight , it 's going to take certain steps and stop .
We 're going to look at the data , ensure it is acting the way we expect it to act and we can implement an abort and have it fly away from the space station while we figure out whatever issue that we were worried about at the time , " Suffredini said .
Suffredini said all station partners were consulted regarding ATV safety issues .
The partners all signed off on the mission 's risk , and control centers in Houston and Moscow will track the rendezvous , he said .
" It is a first time , but I think with all of the work that 's been done on the ground and with the demonstration that 's being done on orbit , and the fact that in the end we 're using the docking mechanism of the Russian segment , so the final thing is a proven system .
The combination of all of those things gives us a sufficient feeling of confidence that this is a working vehicle , " Thirkettle said .
Suffredini , Thirkettle 's NASA counterpart , agreed : " We talked a long time early in the program about whether or not we needed to try to create a target for the ATV to dock to , and we agreed with this approach to ensuring that we will fully understand what the spacecraft is actually going to do in orbit , and that we practice these specific aborts or escape scenarios to ensure that they would work , that approaching the ISS on its first flight was a safe thing to do . "
" We 'll have a bigger smile on our face when it 's actually achieved , of course , " Thirkettle said .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Patients with heart failure are especially vulnerable to influenza and most doctors recommend they get flu shots , but a study suggests these annual jabs may not offer them full protection , U.S. researchers said on Saturday .

They found heart failure patients in a study had lower immune responses to the vaccine compared with healthy people of similar ages , leaving them more vulnerable to infection .
“ What we theorize is that heart failure as a condition leads to impaired immune function , which renders these patients less able to respond to the vaccine , ” said Orly Vardeny of the University of Wisconsin , who presented the study at the American College of Cardiology meeting in Chicago .
Vardeny and her team studied 29 patients with heart failure , a condition in which a heart damaged by heart attack or other causes gradually loses its pumping power .
More than 5 million Americans have heart failure .
The researchers compared the heart failure group to 17 healthy people .
Both groups had blood tests done before and after their flu shots to assess their immune responses .
The flu vaccine each year contains three strains of flu virus and is reformulated each year to protect patients from the circulating flu strains .
The vaccine works by causing people to develop antibodies to the strains in the vaccine , which will protect them when they are exposed to the flu .
In the study , healthy patients had stronger antibody responses than the heart failure patients .
Those with heart failure were less able to develop an immune response to the newest strain of flu in the vaccine .
“ Patients with heart failure had a reduced response to the newest virus introduced to the vaccine , meaning they had an impaired immune response compared with healthy individuals , ” Vardeny told reporters at a press briefing .
She said it is n’t clear what mechanism in heart failure is impairing this immune response .
“ We ’re not saying that patients with heart failure should not get immunized , ” Vardeny said .
“ But maybe more preventive measures should be taken , ” like booster shots and frequent hand washing to decrease the transmission of germs .
Influenza causes 36,000 deaths and more than 200,000 hospitalizations in the United States each year , according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
After infiltrating one of the biggest and most abusive known botnets , security researchers are wrestling with a thorny ethical dilemma : should they exorcise tens of thousands of possessed machines or simply leave them be ?
Pedram Amini and Cody Pierce , of security provider TippingPoint , reverse engineered the executable behind the notorious Kraken botnet , a feat that allowed them to build a fake server that receives connections from zombie machines looking for instructions about who and what to spam .
Over the course of a week , an estimated 25,000 machines , most belonging to home broadband users , reported for duty .
That 's as much as 14 percent of the entire Kraken population , according to some estimates .
" This is where we entered into a moral dilemma and ethical discussion , " Amini wrote in an entry on the TippingPoint DVLabs blog .
" We have the ability to successfully redirect infected systems .
We have the ability to provide an ' update ' through the existing Kraken protocol that can simply remove the Kraken zombie .
Is it wrong to do so ? "
For the moment , there appears to be an internal difference of opinion at TippingPoint .
Amini and Pierce are both in favor of removing the bots , a move that in a single keystroke would likely make the machines run better and , more importantly , would rid the internet of 25,000 spam - barfing machines .
But TippingPoint boss Dave Endler sees things differently .
What if the deed has the unintended consequence of bringing down a machine , and what if said machine is responsible for someone 's life support ?
The hypothetical is a bit extreme ( is anyone foolhardy enough to rely on a Windows PC for life support ? ) , but it still captures the essence of why intervention may not be a good idea .
No matter how good their intention , the researchers could find themselves in trouble should anything go wrong .
So for the time being , the company , which provides intrusion prevention products for large companies , will simply allow these demonic machines to go about their business .
That 's a shame , because as we reported earlier , the Kraken architects have gone to great lengths to cloak infected machines and make them hard to disinfect .
Now that they 've learned that their brainchild has been reverse engineered , who knows when such a chance will come around again ? ®
A rocket - propelled grenade whooshes down a New York street , leaving a twirling vapour trail in its wake .
Its target is a speedily incoming police car , its source is … you .
Grand Theft Auto is back , and if you did n't queue outside your local game shop to get your hands on it tonight you probably know someone who did – it's just that they might not have told you .
Or , indeed , anyone .
While many saw the release of the fair - minded Byron Report as a benchmark moment in the relationship between violent videogames and mainstream moral thought , this is the real litmus test .
This is where we find out how far games have crossed into the mass consciousness .
You see , while the latest title in Rockstar 's gangster adventure series is forecast to make $ 400 m in its opening week , it 's still amazing how few people seem to understand what the games are about – or how slyly clever they are .
And that goes not just for the tabloids and their readers , but for the industry itself .
Following the huge success and cultural impact of GTA Vice City in 2002 , almost every major videogame publisher hastily commissioned their own ' gangsta ' series .
At the E3 exhibition in 2005 there were almost a dozen on show with names like True Crime : New York , Crime Life : Gang Wars , Fear and Respect and Final Fight : Street Wise .
True Crime : clones failed to understand GTA 's subtler touch
None of the titles caught on to the subtleties of the GTA franchise .
Beneath the ramrod violence this is a deeply satirical series , lampooning machismo brutality more than celebrating it .
In GTA IV , for example , you 're not dealing with criminal masterminds or cool gangland alpha males , you 're sloshing around in the cesspit of low - level criminal culture .
One of the most exciting early missions is a bank heist with three Irish brothers who bicker incessantly throughout the build - up and into the disastrous robbery itself .
There are suggestions at least one has IRA affiliations but the script hints at the truth – it's all bluster and self - mythologising .
You 'll also need to carry out a hit for a character named Brucie , a tracksuit wearing medallion man who runs a garage and fantasies about performing the assassination himself .
His tough guy demeanor is quickly spiked in a funny cut - scene where he attempts to play wrestle with Niko and is humiliated when the lead character blocks his moves and forces him to his knees .
The game continually jabs at macho posturing – " war is where the young and stupid are manipulated into killing each other by the old and bitter " , says one character when he learns of Niko 's military past - a sly dig at the prevalent culture of celebratory shooters like Call of Duty and Medal of Honor .
Videogame scripts do n't often as a rule , hint at anything , let alone the vacuity of heroism .
Not just enemies
GTA IV also has new things to say about kinship in videogames .
In other gangster titles , you 'll need to build an army of faceless hoods to perform your drive - by bidding .
Here , you must forge and maintain friendships – no missions are earned from strangers , and everyone you work for is personally introduced by a colleague .
Your progress through the game is dictated not just by your actions with a machine gun , but through a spider 's web of poisonous associations .
Whenever you meet a character , their name goes into the contacts book of your in - game mobile phone .
When you feel like it you can take your handset out and call someone , anyone , and invite them to a pool hall , to a comedy club or strip bar – whatever you reckon takes their fancy .
In this way , slowly , but surely , you earn their trust and their friendship ; get it right and they 'll do favours for you , providing everything from free cabs to new weapons .
But there are moments you 'll let them down ; a friend in need may call while you 're in the middle of a tricky mission and so you ignore it , only to find out they 've been kidnapped … or worse .
Of course , the examination of touching relationships within the criminal fold is nothing new to TV or film , but its odd indeed for a videogame to reference Donny Brasco and The Wire rather than the latest high concept shoot fest or sci-fi SFX blow - out .
Niko : a Vito Corleone for the 21st century
At the heart of it all , there is a modern interpretation of the American Dream as immigrant experience .
Lead character Niko Bellic is a Serbian national with a violent military past who arrives in Liberty City via a rusted container ship .
He is the archetypal outsider , striving to start a new life in the Land of the Free ; a Vito Corleone for the 21st century .
There are also themes of ethnicity , race and identity in contemporary America , of heritage and culture , of the struggle to fit in .
When Niko arrives , he 's quickly forced to assimilate into an Eastern European criminal underworld .
For him , there is no escape from the old life , the old country .
Of course , all this stuff lurks in the background and does n't have to interfere with the anarchic action .
Plenty of people might play the game without ever realising its true complexity - but it might give you something to think about the next time you launch an RPG down a crowded Liberty City street .
Just when you thought war cheerleaders could n't get any more deluded , Fred Kagan comes through in the clutch .

Prix du kWh Total Directe Energie
Prix du kWh Total Direct Energie
Total Direct Energie est le premier fournisseur d’énergie alternatif .
Lancé depuis 2007 , ce fournisseur propose des prix attractifs par rapport aux tarifs réglementés .
Mais le prix du kWh chez Total Direct Energie dépend de l’offre choisie par chacun .
Les avis Total Direct Energie permettent de se faire un avis sur le fournisseur
Quel est le prix du kWh chez Total Direct Energie ?
Le prix du kWh chez Total Direct Energie diffère d’une offre à une autre .
En tout cas , par rapport aux concurrents , il se veut proposer des offres adaptées au budget des consommateurs et à leur mode de consommation .
Pour les offres Online , le fournisseur propose une remise de 10 % sur le prix du kWh que ce soit pour l’option tarifaire de base ou pour l’option tarifaire Heure Pleines et Heures Creuse .
Pour l’offre Classique , il propose une réduction de 5 % sur le prix du kWh .
Enfin , pour l’offre électricité verte , Total Direct Energie propose une remise de 2 % .
Pour exemple , le prix du kWh pour une puissance 3 kVA est de 0.1496 €.
Comment calculer les KW en euros ?
Pour calculer la consommation d’électricité , on fait une conversion des Kw en KWh .
On divise alors la puissance de l’appareil qui est en Kw par 1000 puis , on multiplie la somme au nombre d’heure d’utilisation par jour et au nombre de jours d’utilisation au cours d’une année .
Ensuite , si on souhaite calculer les kWh en euros , on doit alors obtenir une somme hors taxe sur de la quantité d’électricité consommée notamment sur une période donnée .
On va par la suite multiplier la consommation d’électricité en kWh par le prix du kWh HT du fournisseur d’énergie .
Notons que ce calcul est important afin de connaître le montant de sa facture d’électricité .
Ainsi , on aura alors la possibilité de réduire sa consommation d’électricité ou du moins la gérer .
Mais cela évitera aussi des mauvaises surprises en cas d’erreur sur l’index de consommation .

Mr. Obama was 6 at the time , and like many of his admirers , he has only read about the violence that traumatized the nation .
But those recollections and images are often invoked by older voters , who watch his candidacy with fascination , as well as an uneasy air of apprehension , as Democrats inch closer to selecting their nominee .
Mr. Obama has had Secret Service agents surrounding him since May 3 , the earliest a candidate has ever been provided protection .
( He reluctantly gave in to the insistent urging of Senator Richard J. Durbin , Democrat of Illinois , and others in Congress . )
As his rallies have swelled in size , his security has increased , coming close to rivaling that given to a sitting president .
His wife , Michelle Obama , voiced concerns about his safety before he was elected to the Senate .
Three years ago , she said she dreaded the day her husband received Secret Service protection , because it would mean serious threats had been made against him .
Among friends and advisers , danger is something Mr. Obama rarely mentions .
“ It ’s not something that I ’m spending time thinking about day to day , ” said Mr. Obama , who has been given the Secret Service nickname Renegade , a way for agents to quickly identify him .
“ I made a decision to get into this race .
I think anybody who decides to run for president recognizes that there are some risks involved , just like there are risks in anything . ”
Not long ago , his advisers worried that some black voters might not support his candidacy out of a fierce desire to protect him .
It was a particular concern in South Carolina , but Mr. Obama said he believed the worry was also rooted in “ a fear of failure . ”

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Police investigating the discovery of a woman ’s severed head and a hand on a Scottish beach said on Wednesday said they had recovered a second hand .
The gruesome find was first made by two young children playing on the foreshore at Arbroath on Tuesday .
The head had been concealed in a plastic bag and the first hand was found shortly after by police .
A wider search of the area will continue on Wednesday .
Tayside Police said the dead woman did not match anyone reported missing in its area .
“ This investigation is in its infancy and it will take several days before we have forensic test results that could shed further light on the enquiry , ” said Detective Chief Inspector Graham McMillan .
A post mortem on the body parts will be conducted later .
For busy , multi-tasking , ADHD afflicted geeks , even porn is too time consuming .
The industry tried breaking the videos down into 5 minute segments , but even that could n't hold the average geeks ' full attention .
Cue the latest innovation : dual - video porn , which pits two YouTube - style videos head to head , giving each your partial , divided attention .
We 're not kidding : Pornhorneo ( NSFW ) takes the " adult YouTube " concept pioneered by YouPorn and Pornotube , and puts two videos on the screen , rather than one .
This has been done for loftier purposes already - like comparing political policies on HeadtoHead08 - but these days the adult industry is n't as cutting edge as it used to be , and there are even reports that social networking is now a more popular use of the web .
Pornhorneo lets you vote for your favorite , or course , and embed clips elsewhere .
The content is user generated and submitted via an upload form , the unnamed founders told us in an email .
I 'm glad that adult content is now said to be losing popularity - for too long , it was easy for non-techies to dismiss the web as a hub for pornography , gambling and child predators .
It 's still a massive business , of course , and you'd be remiss to ignore it completely , whether or not you think it 's socially acceptable .
All right .
I could not resist a cathartic vent , especially when being invited - no , encouraged to - participate .
You wanna know what I hate ?
Do you really wanna know ?
First and foremost , I hate assholes .
Hey , being original was n't one of the rules in this quest , right ?
Anyway , I hate people who have a general disrespect for those around them ( Dennis Leary did a whole song about them ) , people who move about their lives and do n't care about what effect what they do or say will have on the people around them .
People who piss all over the public toilet seats ( as Leary pointed out ) , people like this guy I almost ran into a few years ago who cut me off entering the roadway and sped into the nearby convenient store and parked right in a handicapped spot .
( I had originally written about this guy in a node called " Asshole in its worst form " or something but it was almost immediately eaten . )
But I do n't want to go on and on about assholes in general .
The real focus of this Hatequest write up is my hatred , my absolute detesting of bullies and bullying .
Back in school , grade school and middle , I was a little odd , a little different .
I daydreamed a lot , walked a little strangely ( some said effeminately ) , and had a different outlook on life than most given the fact that I am a creative person and we all tend to be a little on the strange side .
Anyway , a number of classmates took exception to this and decided that it'd be a hoot to make my school life hell .
One of their favorite things was to endlessly call me a " faggot . "
They get low points for originality , especially after Year Five of that .
( You 'd think at some point they would get a bit more creative with their taunting ? )
I guess it is representative of the rampant homophobia in schools , especially with the adolescents .
You know it 's bad when they 're using that insult with somebody who is not even gay !
There was one in particular that I hate .
That I loathe with every fiber of my being -- still , to this day .
If murder was legal I would eviscerate him , strangle him with his own intestines ...... and then maybe set him on fire .
This guy was a cruel , sadistic bastard who found much delight in the pain of others .
I would seriously love to be there the day that somebody ends his pathetic life hopefully in a very gruesome way .
He never wasted any opportunity to put me down , trip me , kick me , hit me , or any other type of quick abuse so he did n't get caught doing it .
And this was nearly on a daily basis .
And he did it to others .
He was a fucking punk that I think I 'd like to bash his head repeatedly into a concrete column until I saw brains .
Just so you know , there is not anther human being on the planet I 'd like to do that to .
To that guy , and all other kids / people out there like that : FUCK YOU , and I hope that you meet an untimely and spectacularly fatal end you low - life pieces of shit .
The desire to keep me from getting into trouble ( I was a good lad ) and the fact that I do n't do well with confrontation kept me from going psycho on him .
I did try to impart some advice from my fist on him once on the bus , but for some reason I did n't make a very good fist and he dodged and ... well , all I did was put a pretty good scratch on his face .
The bus driver , this stupid old woman , starting doing assigned seating one day and I just knew ... knew ... that because she was such a fucking bitch that she 'd put him and I in the same seat before it happened .
I was ready .
I told myself that if he touched me I would open up a can of whoopass on him .
Well , he tapped me on the shoulder or something and that 's when I scratched him .
This segues into something else I hate .
I hate it that , with rare exception , every single one of the school teachers , bus drivers , and administrators , seemingly could give a shit less about the bullying going on .
Bullying was rarely discouraged .
In fact , it was almost encouraged .
Incessant teasing , cruel mental torture , and the occasional physical jab goes unpunished - or barely punished - but if you retaliate , watch out , you 're in trouble , Mister !
You 're treated no differently when you 're in the principal 's office .
I hate all the teachers out there that I had and that others have had that do n't care if their students are subjected to a daily dose of torture .
Fuck you .
Turn in your teaching licenses and go work for the US military over in the Middle East if you like to watch people being tortured .
I loathe the " boys will be boys " attitude , that sick notion that it 's perfectly OK , that it is just a part of school , we all have to go through it .
Is it really such a badge of honor ?
Does it really make us who we are ?
If I was not picked on and tortured in school would I really not be the great person I am now ?
Not to inflict some sci - fi philosophy on you , but if I were to go back into time and prevent much or all of that shit from happening to me somehow , would it really have a shitty butterfly effect on my life ?
I do n't think so .
Let me tell you what I have because of all of that .
Searing , white hot hate , that 's what .
Whoo hoo .
Yeah , that 's wonderful that I have that inside of me , is n't it ?
A deeply - buried murderous rage .
Thanks , guys !
Any teacher or school administrator that sees bullying going on and does n't do anything about it should be FIRED .
PERIOD .
I still lie awake at night occasionally , not able to get to sleep because something gets my mind on the subject and I think back to school ... and fantasize about taking a baseball bat after softball on P.E. and going postal , bashing the brains out of any and all the students who did me wrong , especially the asshole I was referring to earlier .
God that would have been great .
If I was only 11 or 12 I probably would have only done some time in juvey , right ?
Well I hope you 've enjoyed this inspiring , uplifting Hatequest entry .
Now let 's all have tea and cakes and play in the sun !

MANY nasty words begin with the letter D : death , disease , depression , debt ( when you drown in it ) and deflation .
“ Decoupling ” , on the other hand , has a nicer ring to it , even if it is the source of a great deal of controversy .
Economists continue to argue about whether or not emerging economies will follow America into recession .
The most pessimistic claim that “ it makes no sense to talk about decoupling in an era of globalisation ” : economies have become more intertwined through trade and finance , which should make business cycles more synchronised , not less .
The slide in emerging stockmarkets on Wall Street 's coat - tails appears to endorse their view .
Yet recent data suggest decoupling is no myth .
Indeed , it may yet save the world economy .
Decoupling does not mean that an American recession will have no impact on developing countries .
That would be daft .
Such countries have become more integrated into the world economy ( their exports have increased from just over 25 % of their GDP in 1990 to almost 50 % today ) .
Sales to America will obviously weaken .
The point is that their GDP - growth rates will slow by much less than in previous American downturns .
Most enjoyed strong growth during the fourth quarter of last year , and some speeded up , even as America 's economy ground to a virtual halt and its non-oil imports fell .
One reason is that while exports to America have stumbled , those to other emerging economies have surged ( see chart 1 ) .
China 's growth in exports to America slowed to only 5 % ( in dollar terms ) in the year to January , but exports to Brazil , India and Russia were up by more than 60 % , and those to oil exporters by 45 % .
Half of China 's exports now go to other emerging economies .
Likewise , South Korea 's exports to the United States tumbled by 20 % in the year to February , but its total exports rose by 20 % , thanks to trade with other developing nations .
A second supporting factor is that in many emerging markets domestic consumption and investment quickened during 2007 .
Their consumer spending rose almost three times as fast as in the developed world .
Investment seems to be holding up even better : according to HSBC , real capital spending rose by a staggering 17 % in emerging economies last year , compared with only 1.2 % in rich economies .
Sceptics argue that much of this investment , especially in China , is in the export sector and so will collapse as sales to America weaken .
But less than 15 % of China 's investment is linked to exports .
Over half is in infrastructure and property .
It is not just China that is building power plants , roads and railways ; a large chunk of the Gulf 's petrodollars are also being spent on gleaming skyscrapers and new airports — not to mention ski-domes in the desert .
Mexico , Brazil and Russia have also launched big infrastructure projects that will take years to complete .
The four biggest emerging economies , which accounted for two - fifths of global GDP growth last year , are the least dependent on the United States : exports to America account for just 8 % of China 's GDP , 4 % of India 's , 3 % of Brazil 's and 1 % of Russia's .
Over 95 % of China 's growth of 11.2 % in the year to the fourth quarter came from domestic demand .
China 's growth is widely expected to slow this year — it needs to , since even Wen Jiabao , the prime minister , warned this week of overheating — but to a still boisterous 9 - 10 % .
Smaller economies in Asia look more vulnerable .
For example , Malaysia 's exports to America amount to 22 % of its GDP , and they fell by 18 % in the year to December .
Yet its annual GDP growth jumped to 7.3 % in the fourth quarter , thanks to consumer spending and a jump in government infrastructure investment .
Mexico's exports to America are an even larger 27 % of its GDP .
Real GDP growth held steady at 3.8 % in the year to the fourth quarter , but manufacturing jobs are falling and workers ' remittances from abroad are falling .
Retail sales grew by only 1 % in the year to December .
Yet the economy is holding up better than during previous American downturns , partly because high oil revenues have enabled the government to increase investment by around 50 % over the past year .
American downturns have often caused the prices of oil and other raw materials to slump , but this time China 's surging demand is propping up prices and fuelling booms in Brazil , Russia and the Middle East .
Brazil 's exports jumped by 26 % in the year to February .
In turn , if prices stay strong , so will China 's exports to commodity - producing countries .
A sharp slowdown in China would hurt them more than an American recession will .
Act global , think local
A recent IMF study * by Cigdem Akin and Ayhan Kose offers some support for the idea that you can have both decoupling and globalisation at the same time .
They divide 106 countries into three groups — developed , emerging , and low - income developing countries ( which are less integrated into the world economy ) — and then measure how the correlation between economies has changed over time as cross - border flows have expanded .
They find that growth has indeed become more synchronised among developed economies and also among emerging economies .
But , surprisingly , economic activity in emerging economies has diverged ( or decoupled ) from that of developed economies over the past two decades .
The impact of rich economies on emerging economies ' growth has fallen sharply .
The popular argument is that business cycles should become more synchronised because in a globalised world everyone is in the same boat .
But this rests on an out - dated impression that poor countries mainly export to rich ones .
Instead , emerging economies ' trade with each other has risen faster and now accounts for over half of their total exports .
Emerging markets as a group now export more to China than to the United States ( see chart 2 ) .
Some contend that this mainly reflects imports of intermediate goods into China for assembly ; the finished goods are then exported to America and so will be hurt by slower growth .
There is some truth to this .
However , an analysis by BCA Research , a financial research firm , finds that Asian exports to China are increasingly driven by China 's own domestic demand .
A growing share of emerging economies ' exports are also commodities sold to China .
Another reason why globalisation and decoupling can co-exist is that opening up economies has not only boosted poor countries ' trade , it has also spurred their productivity growth and hence domestic incomes and spending .
In 2007 emerging economies ' real domestic demand grew by an average of 8 % , almost four times as fast as in the developed world .
A severe recession in America could still have a nasty impact on the developing world if commodity prices collapsed and if it caused stockmarkets to fall more steeply , depressing global consumer and business confidence .
A sharper fall in the dollar could also further squeeze emerging economies ' exports .
But for perhaps the first time ever , developing countries would be able to make full use of monetary and fiscal policy to cushion their economies .
In the past , when they were net foreign borrowers , capital inflows tended to dry up during global downturns as foreign investors shunned risky assets .
This forced governments to raise interest rates and tighten fiscal policy .
Economies with large external deficits , such as South Africa , Turkey and Hungary , are still vulnerable .
But most emerging economies now have a current - account surplus and large foreign reserves ; many have a budget surplus or are close to balance , leaving ample room for a fiscal stimulus if necessary .
Perhaps the best support for decoupling comes from America itself .
Fourth - quarter profits of big companies , such as Coca - Cola , IBM and DuPont , were better than expected as strong sales growth in emerging markets offset a sharp slowdown at home .
In other words , bits of American business are rising above their own economy .
With luck , the world economy can rise above America's .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China will tolerate experiment failures by its scientists to ease pressure , encourage innovation and cut the chances of fraud , a top official said on Thursday .

Worried about being left behind in global technological advances , China has launched a campaign to pour more resources into scientific research to boost “ home - grown innovation ” .
Several high - profile cases of cheating in state - paid research programs have shocked the country in recent years , tarnishing the image of a sector already plagued by scandals of plagiarism and corruption .
Minister of Science and Technology Wan Gang blamed the fraud cases partly on mounting pressure to succeed in a “ high - risk ” area that cannot guarantee 100 percent positive results .
“ If you press every project to succeed , it will inevitably lead to fabrication ( of results ) , ” Wan told a news conference on the sidelines of parliament , currently meeting in Beijing .
“ In many cases , the experience from failures in scientific exploration is more precious than that from successes , ” said Wan , who became China ’s first non-communist cabinet minister in more than three decades last year .
Wan cited the Law on Science and Technology Progress that was revised in December to allow scientists to report failures freely without losing face or affecting future funding .
The amended law will take effect in July .
While likening the new tolerance to “ dredging a channel ” , Wan said it was also necessary to “ build a dam ” by beefing up preventive measures against academic fraud .
Wan said many lessons had been learnt from fraud cases .
Last year , 13 academics were blacklisted for falsifying scientific data , fabricating applications and plagiarism .
In 2006 , Chen Jin , a U.S. - educated dean at Shanghai ’s elite Jiaotong University , was sacked for falsely claiming to have invented a new type of computer chip .
The chip was hailed by the government and media as a technological breakthrough before the scandal broke .
China spent 1.49 percent of its GDP on research and development in 2007 , a higher rate than in previous years , but its top - down management of academic institutions and scientists is faulted by many for exerting too much administrative control and discouraging originality .
If you 're like us , you yearn for a time when fondue , tennis and cognac ruled the social scene and the women were bra-less and easy .
We 're not talking about last Wednesday at Burt Reynolds ' windowless Malibu chateau - we 're talking about the 1970s .
Not surprisingly , the women of that carefree , mustache - accepting decade were notably more attractive .
Why ?
Maybe it was the fact that their breasts were made of playfully droopy fat deposits rather than sacks of plastic , and their faces were n't stretched out and injected with horse semen ( that 's what Botox is , right ? ) .
Or maybe it 's just the simple fact that cocaine had n't really caught on yet .
Either way , we conducted some scientific - ish research and proved indisputably that the women of the 1970s are tits and ass above the women of today .

TODAY : Lindsay Lohan THE '70s : Bo Derek
During the 1970s , Bo Derek sent a strong , womanly message to men under 40 : " Hey , why do n't you jack off while you look at me ? "
And jack off they did .
With four - inch - long nipples and the face of a sexy , whorish angel , Derek became a shower companion to men nationwide .
Lohan , however , fluctuates between 47 and 182 pounds , and her daily breakfast is usually a surprisingly accurate recreation of the last scene from Scarface .
Oddly enough , she was a lot hotter back when she was 15 .
Yeah , we 'd much rather bang the 15 year - old Lin-what ?
Nothing .
Oh yeah - we were going to say that she also appears to be African - American from the waist down , and that 's just weird .

TODAY : Jessica Simpson THE '70s : Barbara Bach
Admittedly , Simpson has perhaps the best body on the entire planet besides Las Vegas ' Dean Cain .
But that 's a whole different article that also involves a long talk with mom and dad .
Bach , on the other hand , has a noticeably les ample bosom and hair that looks like it has n't been washed for seven to eight weeks .
That said , the most striking difference is their overall expression .
Simpson 's body language seems to say , " You come one step closer and I 'll throw a shit - fit that concludes with my personal security director , Reginald , shoving half of the General Lee up your pee-hole . "
Bach 's , in contrast , seems to say , " If you show me your penis , I will do literally anything you want me to do to it .
And your pal Reginald can join in for an extra 10 - spot . "

Now , you 're probably saying to yourself , " Fast Times at Ridgemont High , the movie that skyrocketed Cates to T&A immortality , was released in 1982 .
That 's not during the ' 70s ! "
Well , if you 're a giant tool you 're saying that .
The point is , although the movie was indeed released in August of 1982 , we 're pretty sure that Cates ' tits were just as fantastic 20 months earlier while it was still technically the '70s .
Hell , they were probably better .

Questions about the underlying structure of America ’s monetary policy are becoming increasingly important on the national stage after what economists are calling “ wild ” rate cuts by the Fed .
Jim " Mad Money " Cramer , a financial guru with a television show on CNBC , called for an investigation of the Fed during an interview with Wall Street Confidential .
He criticized the institution for allegedly causing every " boom and bust business - cycle , " for the recent interest cuts , and more .
He was also severely critical of the new chairman , Ben Bernanke .
" The Federal Reserve created the stock bubble with low margin rates and it created the housing bubble with low mortgage rates , yet I never hear about anyone talking about investigating the Fed , " he said on his show .
" It ’s a creature of Congress , why do n’t we do it ? "
He featured Republican Presidential candidate , Rep. Ron Paul , who said the Federal Reserve is more secretive than the C.I.A. , and that it should at least be audited by Congress , if not totally abolished .
Paul went on to discuss the problems associated with the idea of a central bank engaging in " central - planning . "
" If you believe in free - enterprise and capitalism , you should have the market forces determining interest rates , " he said .
" It ’s the distortion of interest rates by manipulating the money supply that causes these bubbles to form . "
The current chairman of the House Banking Committee is taking an interest in these matters and is better than past leadership , Paul also noted .
Congressman Paul ’s comments echo a common argument made by economists critical of the Fed ; manipulations in interest rates and the supply of money by the Fed cause bad investments .
They argue that interest rates should be determined by the market .
In fact , the idea of a strong central bank with control over credit can be found among Marx ’s 10 Planks , along with a progressive tax on income and a state - run education system .
In a society based truly on free - enterprise , interest rates would be set by the market .
The Fed ’s recent cuts , three - quarters of a percentage point , lowered interest rates to 3.5 percent .
Critics say this is simply going to cause more inflation , which is already out of control , leading to an even further depreciation dollar .
This is likely to be exacerbated by other Fed actions as well , such as the planned injection of $ 60 billion into the economy through an auction this month .
According to the AFP news service , the Fed plans to " conduct biweekly auctions for as long as necessary to provide short - term liquidity to banks . "
The recent rate cuts came after economic planners at the Fed , already supposedly scared of a recession in the U.S. , realized there was trouble in Asian and European markets .
It turns out one of the central causes of these market problems was a rogue trader at a large French bank who made some terrible , enormous investments .
He is now being prosecuted for fraud , but the point is that the Fed claims they did n’t have knowledge of this when they became alarmed and reduced rates .
The Fed , even if we assume it is acting in the best interests of the American economy , will never be able to replace market forces in determining appropriate rates .
Another question now entering the debate is the Constitutionality of the Fed .
Article I , Section 8 is clear when it gives Congress the authority to coin money and regulate the value thereof .
The Constitution also states that no State shall make anything but gold or silver legal tender .
Congress created the Fed in 1913 , the same year America was saddled with the income tax .
The legislation that created it was written during secret meetings between the elite of the banking world on Jekyll Island .
The museum that stands there today , now a Georgia State Park , names the conspirators in attendance .
Now , this privately held , virtually unregulated institution has the power to create money out of nothing , backed by the IRS and your wages , and charge interest on top of it .
A bill in Congress , H.R. 2755 , would change this by abolishing the Federal Reserve .

Today is a big day for translations of OpenTTD !
Translators are now organised as teams of our GitHub organisation .
That means :
You no longer need an OpenTTD - specific account to become a translator : you can use GitHub accounts for most OpenTTD things now .
( bug tracker , BaNaNaS , translations , development , …)
Becoming a translator is now super easy : you just click a few buttons to become a member of the team .
There is one team for each language , which allows the translators to get to know each other , and have group conversations within the team .
There is only one downside :
Everyone who was a translator before needs to reapply .
While this is good news for all translators , this is also a great step forward for our infrastructure : after migrating the source code and bug tracker in 2019 , this year we could migrate BaNaNaS and the WebTranslator .
This only leaves the Wiki as the last service that still needs an OpenTTD - specific account .
( guess what task is next ? )
While the GitHub folks have produced their own github - gem that provides some useful command - line tools for GitHub users , the library they have written is n’t your traditional API wrapper since it ’s focused around using GitHub rather than getting information from GitHub .
I ’ve thrown together a small library called ruby - github that provides that kind of functionality .
It ’s extremely simple and works with all of the currently available API but that only comes down to three read - only calls at this point .
Use like so :
user = GitHub:: API.user ( ' mbleigh ') user.name # => " Michael Bleigh " user.
repositories # => array of repositories user.repositories.last.name # => " ruby - github " user.repositories.last.url # => " http://github.com/mbleigh/ruby-github " user.repositories.last.commits # => array of commits ( see below ) commits = GitHub:: API.commits ( ' mbleigh ' , 'ruby - github ' ) commits.first.message # => " Moved github.rb to ruby - github.rb ... " commits.first.id # => " 1d8c21062e11bb1ecd51ab840aa13d906993f3f7 " commit = GitHub:: API.commit( ' mbleigh ' , 'ruby - github ' , '1d8c21062e11bb1ecd51ab840aa13d906993f3f7 ' ) commit.message # =>
" Moved github.rb to ruby - github.rb ... " commit.added.collect{|c| c.filename} # => [ " init.rb " , " lib/ruby - github.rb " ] 1 user = GitHub :: API . user ( ' mbleigh ' ) user .
name # => " Michael Bleigh " user.
repositories # => array of repositories user.repositories.last.name # => " ruby - github " user.repositories.last.url # => " http://github.com/mbleigh/ruby-github " user.repositories.last.commits # => array of commits ( see below ) commits = GitHub:: API.commits ( ' mbleigh ' , 'ruby - github ' ) commits.first.message # => " Moved github.rb to ruby - github.rb ... " commits.first.id # => " 1d8c21062e11bb1ecd51ab840aa13d906993f3f7 " commit = GitHub:: API.commit( ' mbleigh ' , 'ruby - github ' , '1d8c21062e11bb1ecd51ab840aa13d906993f3f7 ' ) commit.message # =>
" Moved github.rb to ruby - github.rb ... " commit.added.collect{|c| c.filename} # => [ " init.rb " , " lib/ruby - github.rb " ]
Installation
The easiest way to install ruby - github is as a gem :
gem install ruby - github 1 gem install ruby - github
You can also install it as a Rails plugin if that ’s your thing :
git clone git://github.com/mbleigh/ruby-github.git vendor/plugins/ruby-github
1 git clone git : //github.com/mbleigh/ruby-github.git vendor/plugins/ruby-github
Update 4/12/2008 : Version 0.0.2 of the gem has been released and I have revised this post to adhere to the new gem ’s requirements .

LOVED ones of addicts often make the same complaint : the worst thing is the deception .
By hiding their habit from the world , sufferers hurt their families ; more to the point , secrecy sets back their chances of seeking treatment and recovering .
So it is with drugs policy .
In July the Home Office released a suspiciously cheery analysis of its work , as part of the preparations for a big overhaul of its long - term drugs strategy that is due to be unveiled this month .
The evidence was so glowing that the Statistics Commission , an official watchdog , complained that it read “ more like a briefing document ” than a balanced presentation .
There were more hints of manipulation this week when the home secretary , Jacqui Smith , had to write to her drugs - advisory council to reassure its members that she would not ignore their views on cannabis , against which she seems determined to stiffen sanctions .
Now , new evidence has emerged of the gulf between the government 's public pronouncements on drugs and its private findings .
An internal report by the Treasury , seen by The Economist , gives a plain - spoken account of how the drugs strategy was working in 2001 .
Parts of the document , recently obtained by Transform , a drugs - policy think - tank , are encouraging , and some of its criticisms may have been met since then .
But some still stick — and the government 's reluctance to make it public sooner raises questions about its willingness to deal fairly with the facts now .
The report is kindest about treatment for drug-users , which gets five stars ( the top mark ) for effectiveness ; three stars go to education programmes and the referral of arrested addicts .
But on law enforcement , the most expensive plank of the anti-drugs strategy , things fall apart .
Police - intelligence work scores two out of five , as does that of customs officers .
At street level it gets worse : cracking down on drug - dealing and drug - related crime rates only one star , whereas action on “ soft ” drugs such as cannabis scores none at all .
The Home Office now says that it has upped its game , revamping the national serious - crime squad and referring more offenders for treatment .
But it is still spouting some arguments that the 2001 report privately debunked .
On intercepted imports , for example , the Treasury noted that although seizures had increased , the ever - falling price of drugs in Britain suggested that “ in large measure rising totals [ of seized drugs ] reflect rising volumes of drug imports . ”
Despite this , the analysis the government gave the public last year presented increasing drug seizures as evidence of diminishing availability .
Much of the 35 - page Treasury report criticised the lack of rigorous analysis as to what worked .
Evaluations were “ process rather than output focused ” .
On the issue of tackling the supply of drugs , it found “ little evidence on the cost effectiveness of [ criminal - justice ] activities ” , and “ that little we have does not offer strong support . ”
This might have been of interest to the voters whose money was being spent on such untested schemes .
Steve Rolles of Transform says the Home Office is still sitting on two reports from last year that it deems too sensitive for release .
Yet evidence has seldom been more in demand .
Though the government is unlikely to shift its stance on prohibiting most drugs whatever the evidence , its policy on treatment for drug-users , so far a relative strength , may be up for change .
At a drop - in centre in Hounslow , an unglamorous suburb in west London , clients ( as the addicts are respectfully known ) are relaxing with candle - lit acupuncture .
Downstairs they can pick up syringes ( in different colours , to avoid accidental sharing ) and other paraphernalia to smoke or shoot up more safely .
A centre over the road prescribes and dispenses methadone , an oral substitute for heroin addicts .
“ Harm - reduction ” facilities such as these have become more common under Labour , which has more than doubled since 1998 the number of drug - takers who go to them .
Partly because of this , British heroin addicts are less likely to be HIV - positive than those in many countries .
Yet there are hints that such thinking is falling out of favour .
After it emerged last year that as few as 3 % of those in treatment actually shake their habit , the Conservatives vowed “ to solve addiction , not manage it ” through residential courses where addicts get off drugs altogether .
( As such courses cost roughly ten times more than a year of methadone , however , it is unlikely that most would have access to them . )
Mike Ashton of DrugScope , a charity , cautions that the relative success of residential programmes may be due to the fact that only the best candidates are chosen for them .
A different strategy is to go farther down the harm - reduction route .
One service that the clients in Hounslow are denied is a safe place in which to take their drugs ; the lavatories even have locks on them to prevent illicit use .
Providing “ shooting galleries ” where drug-users can inject themselves has been tried in some countries , to mixed reviews so far .
And prescribing heroin rather than methadone might attract more drug - takers to safe surroundings , though it is dearer to procure and supervise since it tends to be injected .
It is hard to make such choices because , despite the Treasury 's warnings seven years ago , much evidence is still limited to processes rather than results .
That is , as far as we know : after all , the Home Office is still sitting on some of it .
Perhaps the government should come clean .
As the Hounslow clients are told daily , denial is not a healthy option .
In June one single person in the Senate blocked passage of the Renewable Energy Standards bill that would have mandated a 15 % renewable energy requirement by the year 2022 .
A modest and achievable target .
According to a report by the Union of Concerned Scientists , a 20 percent by 2020 Renewable Energy Standard ( RES ) would bring New Mexico : $ 2.21 billion in new capital investment , $ 390 million in consumer energy bill savings by 2030 , and 2,860 new jobs .
It is strange then that New Mexico Senator Pete Domenici is leading the way to block that bill .
Sen .
Domenici betrayed an agreement with his energy committee colleague , Jeff Bingaman , introduced a “ poison pill ” amendment , threatened a filibuster , and single - handedly orchestrated the effective shutdown of legislative operations on the floor of the Senate .
Mr. Domenici succeeded in keeping the RES provision out of the Senate ’s energy bill .
But the RES was passed by the House of Representatives on August 4 and will be forwarded this fall to a House - Senate Conference for consolidation in a new energy bill .
Domenici ’s argument is that some states are not able to produce renewable energy , and thus rules requiring its production would unfairly penalize some states .
This on its face is absurd , as every single state in the union has either sun , wind , wave , geothermal , tidal , small scale hydro , or other renewable energy resources .
His argument seems strange considering that his own state of New Mexico has abundant solar resources .
He seems to be fighting against the interests of his own citizens .
Domenici has proposed a “ clean energy ” alternative that would allow states to include power generated from sources like nuclear or coal - to - liquid .
In fact he has a history of proposing a series of big carbon friendly legislation .
Sen . Domenici ’s Top Contributing Industries ( career ) : 1 . $ 611,147 Oil & Gas
2. $ 419,673 Electric Utilities Top Individual Contributors Since 2001 ( electric utilities in italics ) : 1 . $ 25,600 Southern Co .
2. $ 24,850 Intel Corp .
3. $ 24,000 FirstEnergy Corp .
4. $ 23,915 PNM Resources
Senate Democrats are n’t buying it .
They ’re bolstered by the hearty support of the public at large , and environmental groups .
They think they can have a 60 vote strong filibuster proof renewable energy standard ready sometime this year .
Feel like letting Domenici know that you do n’t want him to further block renewable energy standards ?
Click here to send a message to Domenici , and let him know that he is holding back vital progress towards moving towards a green energy future .

Last year she and her boyfriend bought an old house in the Silverlake section of Los Angeles with a 6,500 - square - foot lot .
Much of it is concrete , but she has taken advantage of the available space to plant a lime tree , two apple trees ( an Arkansas Black and a Fuji ) , a plum , two peaches , a nectarine and a Cara Cara orange .
A Meyer lemon is growing in a pot .
“ Right now it ’s covered in buds and I ’m so excited , ” Ms. Hall said .
“ I put the pot outside my bedroom window so the smell will waft in . ”
The backyard orchard makes sense , given the growing popularity of the local - food movement .
Nothing is more local than the backyard , after all , and home orcharding , as the practice is sometimes called , guarantees freshness and cuts the energy costs for transportation to nil .
Anxieties about food safety  sparked by events like last year ’s E. coli outbreak in spinach  may also be contributing to the trend .
Ed Laivo , the Dave Wilson Nusery ’s sales director , is a longtime advocate of dense tree planting , and wrote a how - to pamphlet called “ Backyard Orchard Culture ” in the early 1990s .
He advises customers to choose varieties that will ripen at different times to spread out the harvest , a strategy increasingly being adopted by those wanting to eat fresh .
“ People are planting so that they have apples for four or five months straight , ” he said , “ rather than having one tree dump on them in September and then have to quickly make their pies and sauces . ”
With a little planning , he added , you can eat fresh apples for months , in California from the beginning of July until December .
In many other parts of the country , he said , you could , if you planted carefully , extend the harvest season late into the fall .

Small - scale home orchards were common before World War II , according to Karen Tillou , who manages the demonstration orchard of the Home Orchard Society , a group in Portland , Ore. , that promotes growing fruit at home .
“ If you drive around the old , historically ethnic areas of Portland , especially Italian neighborhoods , there are old plum , fig and quince trees on every block , ” Ms. Tillou said .
“ But then there was a postwar generation gap where people said , oh , my , we can buy fruit from supermarkets . ”
Ms. Tillou said that when she joined the society ’s staff five years ago , she mainly fielded questions from retirees or “ people with large rural lots who had the time and money to putter as a hobby . ”
But she is now beginning to hear from young urbanites turning away from frozen and shipped produce .
“ I see it most in my peer group  early 30s , young couples with their first home and kids , in tune with the concept of eating more locally , ” she said .
Not long ago , she got a call from one such couple in Portland , who bought a house with six old fruit trees in the backyard .
“ It was one of the draws of the property for them , ” Ms. Tillou said , “ but they did n’t know how to take care of the trees . ”
That 's what I was going to say .
Static does n't just build up on a carpet and jump ...
IT 'S AN INSULATOR !
Your console would have to be dragged across the carpet to attract stray electrons if it were to built up any charge ... the carpet itself has none .
Glass , rubber , they all work the same way against carpet in the generation ( collection ) of static electricity .
Going INSIDE electronics requires you to be grounded because of YOUR static charge .
That static charge can be built up by dragging your socks or rubber - soled shoes on carpet on a dry winter day , but it does n't just some off of your carpet and zap electronics .
Electronics are some of the most sensitive and fragile consumer products available , so it is cruscial that they be engineered for worst - case scenarios , like being placed on carpet , plugged into bad power , or placed near a source of vibration .
Regardless , people " in - the - know " shared knowledge that they could extend the life of their equipment by not subjecting it to those conditions , but as soon as one begins failing when you so much as breathe on it , everyone begins to act like this common knowledge was some sort of requirement .
Living rooms have carpet .
Outlets are close to the floor .
The product MUST be designed to operate in this scenario .
They are only stressing these extra care techniques to customers to limit their already staggering losses to poor reliability , but pretending that it's " stupid " to not follow them is to pretend that it is common knowledge to all , when it simply is n't .

Cars drive on a city highway in Berlin March 10 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Fabrizio Bensch
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Police in Germany were shocked to find a man running down a major highway pulling a three - wheeled trailer -- but even more surprised to learn he was a Polish pilgrim on a 3,000 km ( 1,800 mile ) trek .
Motorists near Coburg in Bavaria saw the man towing a load with a rod attached to his back and called police .
“ Officers ’ initial astonishment quickly turned into admiration , ” a police statement said on Tuesday .
After questioning the man , police discovered he was a devout Roman Catholic Pole on his way home from a European pilgrimage that had taken him as far as Portugal .
Inside a converted roof luggage box , which also served as a bivouac , the 35 - year - old was carrying all he needed for the journey , police said .
After inspecting the vehicle , officers declared it roadworthy and sent him on his way .

Maybe it ’s just me , but I tend to think this observation might resonate with voters : John McCain could be denied coverage under John McCain ’s healthcare plan .
It ’s a point Elizabeth Edwards drove home very well .
Elizabeth Edwards , the wife of former Democratic presidential contender John Edwards , said she and John McCain have one thing in common : “ Neither one of us would be covered by his health policy . ”
Edwards lodged her criticism of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee ’s proposal Saturday at the annual meeting of the Assn. of Health Care Journalists .
Under McCain ’s plan , insurance companies “ would n’t have to cover preexisting conditions like melanoma and breast cancer , ” she said .
McCain has been treated for melanoma , the most serious type of skin malignancy .
Edwards in 2004 was diagnosed with breast cancer , and announced a year ago that it had returned and spread into her bones , meaning it no longer could be cured .
McCain ’s plan focuses on offering new tax breaks for individuals who buy their own health insurance .
But critics say the Arizona senator ’s proposal avoids giving insurers requirements on whom they must cover and how much they may charge .
At the risk of sounding picky , “ critics say ” McCain ’s plan avoids requirements for insurance companies because McCain ’s plan avoids requirements for insurance companies .
It ’s an objective fact , not a point of contention .
Indeed , it points to an ideological problem underpinning the debate .
McCain seems to realize that his plan leaves millions of vulnerable Americans behind , but he also realize that the alternative is government regulation — specifically , telling insurers that they ca n’t exclude people with pre-existing conditions , and ca n’t price these people out of coverage .
Given a choice between a large gap of uninsured and government - imposed safeguards for Americans , McCain prefers the prior .
A while back , I reported on James Clar ’s cool 3D cubes which could display images using a grid of about 1000 LEDs connected to a computerized controller .
While Clar ’s cubes are simply amazing , they can only display monochrome images .
Now , a company in China has taken the same concept and created a multi-color version .
Created by Chinese display manufacturer Seekway , this prototype 3D LED display cube was created using a 16x16x16 grid of interconnected color LEDs ( that ’s a whopping 4096 individual diodes ) .
The system is capable of displaying animations at up to 30 frames per second and each dot can be individually addressed for both color and intensity .
Now that the prototype is complete , Seekway is gearing up to produce versions with grids as large as 48x48x48 , which will require more than 110,000 LEDs .
Wow .
OROVILLE , Wash . --
A string of new , ' 50s - style cottages with cheerfully shaded shingles line the southeast shore of Osoyoos Lake , a long finger lake straddling the U.S. - Canada border .
The vacation village brings to mind nostalgic days of beachside leisure .
Even the screen doors slam .
The cottages have all been sold , and more are being built to meet demand from Canadians , who are snapping up vacation homes in the U.S. as Americans watch their wallets and sell their second homes amid a housing crunch .
For Oroville , a sleepy border town that has n't experienced growth like this in decades , the development means big changes ahead .
Longtime residents wondering what the future holds worry they need only look to Canada 's side of the lake for a clue : crowded condominiums , sprawling resorts and a wine region touted as Canada 's only desert hotspot .
" Probably 80 percent of the inquiries I get are Canadian , " said city planner Chris Branch , who previously split his time between two rural north - central Washington towns but has gone full - time to accommodate Oroville 's growth in the second - home market .
The city has seen an 80 percent increase in construction in the past 10 years .
Probably 80 percent of that construction is by Canadian developers , Branch said .
And the developers say upward of 80 percent of the home buyers are Canadian .
" The Canadians are just running out of space , and affordable space at that , so it 's driving them across the border , " he said .
Last fall , the " loonie " reached parity with the U.S. dollar for the first time since 1976 .
The falling dollar has put all foreign buyers at a significant advantage , giving them a discount of about 30 percent on U.S. property , said Walter Molony , spokesman for National Association of Realtors .
And in terms of vacation property , " sites that are on the water command the best price . "
Even if they are in rural sagebrush with warm days and cool nights .
Oroville started out as a service point for area miners , then evolved into a heavy agriculture town surrounded by acres of apple orchards .
Many of those fields have since been pulled out , though , as the apple industry wilted .
Six of the 11 fruit warehouses now sit empty .
City officials have been trying to recruit businesses to an industrial park for years , with only limited success .
While the population of 1,600 has remained steady for 20 years , it 's likely to decline if more businesses and jobs are n't drawn to the area , said Chuck Spieth , mayor for eight years .
" It 's not like these are high paying jobs , but it 's better than nothing .
We 've been stagnant for too long , " he said .
" I want to see the growth .
I definitely do .
We need that to survive .
But we need to really step back and make sure it's for the longer term . "
Not everyone is thrilled to see Oroville become a tourist town .
City Councilman Jon Neal , born and raised in Oroville , fears local residents will be priced out of their homes .
Property prices around the lake have skyrocketed -- from just $ 200,000 for a single - family home several years ago to $ 1 million today .
Real estate offices are booming .
Osoyoos , Canada 's resort town , also goes from a ghost town in the winter , with about 3,500 year - round residents , to more than 20,000 people in the busy summer season .
" Which is one of the things I do n't want to see Oroville do , " he said .
" Change is inevitable .
It 's the nature of things .
" But you do n't have to like it , " he said with a laugh .
Jim Bankson , who handles rental sales for the new resort Veranda Beach , said he does n't hear much resistance thanks to the windfall many residents saw by selling property .
" The tourism industry is the one saving grace for Oroville , " Bankson said .
" It 's pretty much been proven that people are pulling out orchards because they can't make money growing apples here . "
And despite the detractors , he said , some residents have seen opportunity in the growth .
One man started a landscaping business and has garnered the resort 's business .
In town , some women started a grocery shopping service , stocking cupboards and refrigerators for vacationers who are renting houses for only a week or two .
The lone remaining apple co-op that entered the wine business in 2000 , hoping to capitalize on the 50 - plus wineries in Canada 's Okanagan Valley just 5 miles to the north , now enjoys competition on the U.S. side .
Recently , three new wineries opened .
" We 'd love to see more wineries .
Who wants to drive all this way for one tasting ? " said Mike Buckmiller , winemaker for Okanogan Estate and Vineyards .
( The Americans spell Okanogan with an 'o ' ) .
Acidity in the region 's soil , so perfect for tomatoes grown for a local canning plant decades ago , also lends itself well to wine grapes , Buckmiller said .
And even as local grape growers experiment with new varieties , wineries to the north have n't been shy to share advice .
" They were wide open with information and how to get it .
My hat 's off to them , because they never tried to keep anything under their belts , " he said .
" And I do n't think there 's anything wrong with riding on their shirttails . "
Spieth , the mayor , said the trick will be attracting businesses and jobs that last year - round , not just in the warm summer months .
" It 's an exciting time for our little area , " he said .
" We share the same lake , the same opportunities , the same climate .
We should benefit , too .
As to whether Oroville wants to be a tourist town , he said , " I do n't think we have a choice at this point . "
Intel 's low - power Atom processor ( codenamed Silverthorne ) launched today in a frequency range from the 800MHz Z500 ( $ 45 ) to the 1.86GHz Z540 ( $ 160 ) .
Processor prices also include the cost of the Poulsbo chipset , and together , these two chips form the basis of the mobile Menlow platform .
Details on the chips are shown below — all Silverthorne / Atom processors currently available have 512 K of onboard L2 cache .
Silverthorne was designed to be power efficient above all else , and it shows in the core 's low TDP rates .
TDP on the Z500 is 0.65W , the Z510 , 520 , and 530 share a TDP of 2W , and the Z540 draws a maximum of 2.4W .
These numbers , however , are much higher than what Intel expects the CPUs to draw under standard usage .
Average power for the Z500 is 160 mW , with an idle power of just 80 mW .
The only other x86 processor on the market that even approaches Silverthorne 's TDP is AMD 's Geode LX family , and the Geode , at heart , is a glorified 486 processor .
Clock speed MHz FSB speed MHz SMT Avg power Idle power TDP Price Atom Z500 800 400 No 160 mW 80 mW 0.65 W $ 45 Atom Z510 1100 400 No 220 mW 100 mW 2W $ 45 Atom Z520 1333 533 Yes 220 mW 100 mW 2W $ 65 Atom Z530 1600 533 Yes 220 mW 100 mW 2W $ 95 Atom Z540 1860 533 Yes 220 mW 100 mW 2.4W $ 160
As for Poulsbo , it 's designed as an integrated northbridge - southbridge and supports a number of features normally found on a standard desktop , including an ATA - 100 interface , multiple USB ports , two PCIe x1 channels , and integrated audio and video capabilities .
Poulsbo supports a single DDR - 2 channel at 400MHz or 533MHz .
The mobile Internet device ( MID ) products that Menlow is intended for are meant to offer users audio , video , and Internet experiences that more closely approach what one would see on a laptop as opposed to a smartphone .
To that end , Intel has integrated both an HD audio system and a graphics card it says is capable of offloading the entire HD video decoding process .
Atom never was a smartphone chip
Both Tech Report and Anandtech have really long , slide - filled articles on Atom , and our own Jon Stokes is working on more detailed coverage of both Atom and Nehalem .
But if you want a general , one - page lowdown on the Silverthorne architecture and its prospects then you should read Jon 's coverage of the Silverthorne unveiling at the recent International Solid State Circuits Conference .
In a nutshell , Atom is n't even close in terms of performance / watt to ARM's Cortex line , and as a platform , even the more highly integrated Moorestown revision that will come out next year wo n't put Intel into smartphone territory .
No , Silverthorne and its immediate successor are aimed at larger form factors than the smartphone , and in that respect they 're only Intel 's first , slightly awkward steps into embedded territory .
Where Atom and its immediate derivatives will shine is in the Eee PC and OLPC form factors , as well as in very low - cost desktops .
Intel claims that Atom offers slightly better performance than the Dothan flavor of the Pentium M ( we 'll have to see that for ourselves to believe it ; and if it 's true , it 's true only for specific workloads ) , so it will be a good fit for these two device categories .
But as a true embedded RISC competitor , Intel still has a long way to go .

The Canadian House of Commons is currently considering a Conservative motion to extend Canada 's combat role in Afghanistan .
Here 's a better one !
Whereas Canada has a proud , 50 - year tradition as peacekeepers under the auspices of the United Nations , and as an “ honest broker ” on the world scene ;
● whereas Canada mistakenly provided combat support for the illegal and unjust war and occupation of Afghanistan , in violation of international law and the UN charter , as the war was not in self - defence and did not have Security Council authorization ;
● whereas Canada was guilty of timid acquiescence to America ’s manipulation of NATO ’s treaty and mandate , which organization does not have UN authority to wage war in Afghanistan in perpetuity ;
● whereas Canada has been guilty of , complicit in or turned a blind eye to other , almost - certain war crimes , including the use of depleted uranium and cluster bombs and other weapons of mass destruction , the unnecessary killing and maiming of tens of thousands of civilians , the kidnapping and torture of prisoners without 800 year - old habeus corpus rights , the destruction of non-military targets and war - profiteering ;
● whereas the war has caused the unnecessary deaths of 79 Canadians and hundreds more to be maimed for life ;
● whereas the war has cost Canada several billion dollars that could have been put to caring and peaceful uses , in Afghanistan and other destitute countries ;
● whereas the war is unwinnable in five or fifty more years , as there is a never - ending supply of Taliban and Pashtun fighters , indigenous and foreign jihadists , guerillas and others who are willing to give up their lives to fight “ Western ” occupation until we leave ;
● whereas the wars against Afghanistan , Iraq and terrorism generally have been disasters from the beginning , resulting in unconscionable attacks on our rights and freedoms and increasing , not decreasing , the threat of terrorist attacks , at home and abroad ; and
● whereas the Americans and the British are our best friends and closest allies , and Canada can help bring them back into the multilateral fold ;
Be it resolved that Canada take immediate steps to restore its international reputation as an independent voice for collective security and as peacekeepers , dedicated to the sovereignty of nations , the rule of law , democracy and human rights .
These steps include that :
● Canada confirm it will meet its NATO commitments but otherwise announce a halt to all offensive activities in Afghanistan , and the complete withdrawal of all offensive fighters and equipment by February , 2009 ;
● Canada immediately engage its NATO allies to re-examine the alliance ’s support for this war , as Afghanistan did n’t attack any member country , and poses no threat ;
● Canada work with NATO , Muslim and other nations to present a credible peace and development plan to the UN , including :
 the unilateral cessation of all offensive military activity by NATO and American forces ,
 replacement by a truly UN - authorized peacekeeping force , mainly comprising Muslim forces , supported by neighbouring nations and with Canadian assistance , if requested ,
 a truce , reasonable amnesty , national reconciliation and peace talks among all Afghan parties , leading to agreement on human rights , the distribution of spending and truly free and fair elections ,
 recognition that Western - style , secular democracy cannot be forced on any country , especially Muslim nations ,
 reparations where it can be proven that any NATO member violated international laws and conventions to which they are signatories , and
 measures to ensure Afghanistan police and military forces have the mandate , numbers , training and equipment to capture any remaining members of al Qaeda and to protect against future terrorist activity ;
● Canada be forceful in its diplomatic efforts to achieve meaningful peace , and be generous with its aid , such as amounts equal to what it has wasted on combat operations ;
● Canada also review and cancel a litany of Canadian military arrangements with the Americans that amount to blatant and also secret support of their Iraq war , as Iraq did n’t attack us either ;
● in the interests of accountability , the Chief of Defence Staff , General Hillier , be replaced , as he pushed for this unnecessary war , in his own haunting words , to “ kill scumbags ; ”
● Canada immediately undertake a review of its security agencies and arrangements relating to American - imposed requirements that violate Canadians ' rights and freedoms ; and
● Canada ensure all soldiers and others who served in Afghanistan on its behalf , and their families , receive proper , lifelong care .

Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff speaks about computer security at the RSA Conference on information security in San Francisco , Tuesday , April 8 , 2008 .
AP Photo / Paul SakumaSAN FRANCISCO – Gangs of thousands of zombie home computers grinding out spam , committing fraud and overpowering websites are the most vexing net threat today , according to law enforcement and security professionals .
Today 's botnet herders have hundreds of thousands of computers at their command and use technically sophisticated ways to hide their headquarters , making it easy for them to make millions from spam and credit card theft .
They can also be used to direct floods of fake traffic at a targeted website in order to bring down a rival , extract protection money or less frequently , used to make a political point in the case of attacks on Estonia and the Church of Scientology .
Security pros and government officials are now describing the latter attacks , known as Distributed Denial of Service attacks , as serious threats to national security – turning packet floods against public websites into the latest face of " cyberwar " hysteria .
Hence , the appearance Tuesday of a panel discussion at the RSA 2008 security conference entitled " Protecting the Homeland : Winning the Botnet Battle , " which was marked by a mix of resignation , indignation and post - 9/11 rhetoric .
Ronald Teixeira , the executive director of the non-profit National Cyber Security Alliance and the panel 's moderator , began the discussion by describing botnets as " one of the largest threats we face on the internet today , and they can be used to attack critical infrastructure . "
The Department of Homeland Security 's representative Jordana Siegel , who works on public awareness at the National Cyber Security Division , echoed the line that botnets were a imminent threat to the nation 's security .
Citing the attacks on Estonia last year by Russian nationalist hackers , Siegel said botnets can " disrupt an internet - reliant society , " saying that the temporary takedown of Estonian newspaper and government websites " nearly crippled the country 's cyber infrastructure . "
Earlier in the day , Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff leaned on Estonia as evidence of the need for a federal government " Manhattan Project " for computer security .
Siegel said the DHS is working at fighting the problem , citing the annual October National Cyber Security Awareness month , which she said helped Americans learn that " all users need to practice safe online behavior . "
McAfee's Joe Telafici , a vice president in their security lab , lamented the ease with which botnet herders can abuse domain registration services and the low cost of e-mail , which make the economics of online crime very attractive .
" We are seeing a model that is so economically viable that trying to tell the kids it is a bad thing to do is bound to fail , " Telafici said , suggesting that botnet herders outnumber the 15,000 or so attendees at RSA .
" Even if you do n't have a computer , you are paying money to someone for the cost of dealing with the security ramifications . "
FBI agent Matthew Fine cited two recent takedowns of U.S. - based botnets , operations dubbed Bot Roast , as an example of how the FBI is dealing with botnets .
Fine declined to speculate , however , on whether the arrests actually put a dent in overall online criminality .
" I get paid to put bad guys in jail , " the flat - topped Fine said , but he noted that as soon as one botnet herder was prosecuted another takes his place .
" It is a boulder coming down the hill and I am trying to keep it from getting to the bottom , " Fine said .
Fine hopes Congress will step in with tougher criminal penalties for botnet runners , but noted that judges were now handing out substantial sentences of four to five years in cases brought to them by the feds .
Ira Winkler , a security consultant known for his outspoken ways , countered that this was all just caterwauling and that if the country thought that botnets were a real problem , ISPs and individual users would be held responsible for zombie machines .
" The problem is no one is doing anything , " Winkler said , proposing that users be fined or blocked if their computer is infected .
" Guess what ?
If your system has a bot on it , you do n't get on the internet , " Winkler said , summarizing his proposal .
" We need to hold people responsible when they present an imminent threat to other people , " Winkler said to wide applause from the audience .
He contrasted the lack of computer regulation to laws preventing unsafe cars from taking the road .
Sparing no target , Winkler went on to ridicule DHS 's awareness efforts as useless , and argued that the highest levels of government do n't care about computer crime , citing the ability of a Russian cyber- criminal group known as the Russian Business Network to remain free .
" When they start putting the RBN in jail , then I will be impressed , " Winkler said , noting that would require the feds to put pressure on the Russian government to stop protecting the gang – not an easy task .
Still , Winkler argues , that 's doable with political will .
" When the U.S. government wants to get things done , they know how to put people in jail . "
So what really is the threat to the so - called Homeland from zombie computer armies ?
When asked by Threat Level , the panel came to a split decision .
" Terrorism with botnets is overrated , " McAfee 's Telafici said .
" But if you are looking at the economic burden of botnets , we could probably do without it . "
Winkler suggests that botnets could be used in tactical small attacks , including , perhaps , inflicting minor power outages .
DHS 's Siegel defended the use of overheated rhetoric , saying that temporarily unavailable government or financial websites would erode public confidence .
Missing from the panel discussion was any in depth talk about real solutions .
For instance , ISPs can easily learn or be told which of their customers has an infected computer , but due to the customer support costs of cutting off a zombified user – angry phone calls , confusion – they tend to do little .
Also not talked about are changes in internet governance that punish known domain sellers and ISPs that favored by online criminals for their lax policies .

The Arab coins reveal where they were minted and the date Swedish archaeologists have discovered a rare hoard of Viking - age silver Arab coins near Stockholm 's Arlanda airport .
About 470 coins were found on 1 April at an early Iron Age burial site .
They date from the 7th to 9th Century , when Viking traders travelled widely .
There has been no similar find in that part of Sweden since the 1880s .
Most of the coins were minted in Baghdad and Damascus , but some came from Persia and North Africa , said archaeologist Karin Beckman - Thoor .
The team from the Swedish National Heritage Board had just started removing a stone cairn at the site " when we suddenly found one coin and could n't understand why it was there " , she told the BBC News website .
" We continued digging and found more coins and realised it was a Viking - age hoard . "
The coins were left there in about AD850 , she said .
Such Viking hoards usually come from Gotland - a large Swedish island in the Baltic Sea , she explained .
" No Viking was buried at this site - the grave is older .
Maybe the Vikings thought the hoard would be protected by ancestors , " Ms Beckman - Thoor added .
Vikings had settled in a village nearby .
The Vikings travelled widely in their longships in the Baltic region and Russia from the late 8th to the 11th Century .
They are known to have travelled as far as North Africa and Constantinople ( now Istanbul ) .

Voters will have to wait until at least Friday lunchtime for their results , however .
The result of the London mayoral vote is not expected until Friday evening .
It will be decided by a system under which electors name their first and second choices for mayor .
The city has 5.5 million registered voters and there are 10 candidates in all .
These include Labour incumbent Ken Livingstone , Conservative Boris Johnson and Liberal Democrat Brian Paddick .
Tory leader David Cameron and wife Samantha cast their votes in London

He was joined by his wife Samantha .
Nick Clegg , the leader of the Liberal Democrats , cast his vote at a leisure centre in Putney in south - west London .
Meanwhile about 10 polling stations in the north London borough of Barnet did not receive ballot papers until " some minutes " after the election began at 0700 BST .
In a statement , Barnet Council said it " sincerely apologised " to those voters affected but stressed all of the polling stations had opened on time .
Your comments :
At my Barnet polling station we were told that the ballot papers did not arrive on time due to " a problem at the printers " .
Um ... how long have we known about this election ?!
Surely the ballot papers must have been printed weeks ago to be sent out to postal voters ?
And it was obvious when they did arrive that the officers had never had any training as they spent time sorting out the different forms .
You could n't make it up ...
Suzy , London
My son , a major in the army , serving in Northern Ireland , receives a postal vote .
He has voted and returned his ballot paper .
At home we have received his poll card , so obviously he has another vote too .
Little wonder there is so much ballot fraud .
C Tolley , Worcestershire I was first to my polling station this morning at 0645 and voted alone at 0700 .
I was a bit shocked really to see not an election metal box secured with padlock to take the votes but a cardboard box tied up with string .
Anne , Feltham , London
It seemed quite busy there , although people were having problems understanding the rules .
Someone was folding up their ballot papers and had to be told not to do it .
I do n't see why there 's all the confusion - it 's only ticking boxes !
Billy , London I have just heard on the news about voting numbers being written on the voting slip .
This has always happened at our polling station and when my husband questioned it he was told that was the way it was done .
This obviously makes your vote public knowledge and we will certainly be questioning it again if it happens tonight .
Amanda , Cheam , Surrey
My polling station in Southwark has refused to let me put an X on the ballot paper with a pen .
For the last nine years they always make people use a pencil .
I fear Harare - style corruption .
James , London
The gate on one of the access routes to my local polling station in Walthamstow was n't open this morning when I arrived at 0725 , leaving me to climb over the gate to get to the polling station

As per the unofficial timeline , Windows XP Service Pack 3 ( SP3 ) has been uploaded to Microsoft 's servers .
Currently , the final build is only available on the download .
windowsupdate domain in the following languages : Chinese ( Hong Kong ) , Czech , English , French , German ( Deutsch ) , Hebrew , Japanese , Polish , Russian , Simplified ( Chinese ) , Spanish , and Traditional Chinese .
According to Microsoft TechNet , the 300MB + x86 standalone installer ( build 5512 ) will not be available today on the Microsoft Download Center nor on Windows Update .
There will be no x64 version of SP3 released ; Windows XP x64 will be updated at the same time Windows Server 2003 is updated , since it is derived from the codebase of the latter .
Although Microsoft has still to confirm the date , SP3 should be rolled out via Automatic Updates on June 10 , 2008 .
The service pack contains all previously - released Windows XP updates , including security updates , out - of - band releases , and hotfixes released since Windows XP SP2 hit Microsoft 's servers back in August 2004 .
There are reportedly 1,073 fixes in SP3 , as well as various performance improvements .
Every service pack Microsoft releases is cumulative , meaning it is possible to install ( or slipstream ) SP3 onto Windows XP SP1 / SP2 .
Windows Internet Explorer 7 is not included as part of SP3 and still must be downloaded and installed separately ( unless it is already installed ) .
With SP3 , Microsoft has back - ported four Vista features to XP , including Network Access Protection ( NAP ) in order " to help organizations that use Windows XP to take advantage of new features in the Windows Server 2008 operating system . "
The four features that are no longer Vista - specific are as follows :
NAP is a policy enforcement platform meant for enterprise use

whatever security criteria the corporation has in place .

The new Product Activation module allows users to install XP without entering a product key at installation .
Just over a month after the release of Vista SP1 , XP SP3 hit RTM on April 21 , 2008 , as the rumors predicted .
Up until then , Microsoft continued to stubbornly say that SP3 would go final in the " first half of 2008 . "
The last beta build Microsoft released to the public was XP SP3 RC2 Refresh , available in English , German , and Japanese .
MSDN and TechNet subscribers received the final English 544.86MB ISO image a few days ago .
As with Vista SP1 , however , subscribers had to fight to get the final build before it hit RTW .
MSDN and TechNet subscribers were supposed to get SP3 on May 2 , 2008 , or three days after it was available publicly .
With the release of SP3 , XP will be found on consumers '
PCs for years and years to come .
On the other hand , with Windows 7 a couple of years out , and with the recent broad release of Vista SP1 , Windows XP 's life as market leader is slowly coming to an end .
The keyword here is " slowly . "
Microsoft has extended the life of XP Home until at least June 2010 for budget laptops , and even Apple is supporting XP SP3 .
Furthermore , although Microsoft has plans to stop selling XP to most manufacturers and system builders on June 30 , 2008 , OEMs are fighting back .
Manufacturers have found a loophole to bypass the deadline : when purchasing a computer with Windows Vista Ultimate or Business editions , Microsoft has given consumers the option to downgrade to XP Professional .
Companies such as Dell and Lenovo are using Microsoft 's " Downgrade Rights " to offer XP Professional for as long as possible .
Microsoft is unlikely to be worried since consumers still have to purchase Vista and always have the option to upgrade to the company 's flagship OS whenever they choose to .
Although Vista SP1 was a very critical release for the software giant , XP SP3 is still extremely important .
The company is quite aware that many businesses have made the decision to stay with XP and has more than once extended support for the now six - year - old operating system .
The company will of course continue to release updates , but it is not clear whether there will be an SP4 .
Would you rather have Microsoft focus on Vista SP2 and Windows 7 , or would you say XP SP4 is a must - have ?
With Vista SP1 and XP SP3 both out the door , will you sticking with your current primary operating system ?
Update
What originally looked like it was going to be a less complicated release than Vista SP1 has turned into a maelstrom of confusion for end -users .
It 's time to set the record straight : Windows XP SP3 is available for download from Microsoft , but it has not officially hit the Release to Web ( RTW ) milestone as was originally planned for today .
The delay only recently became evident when Microsoft spokesperson posted the following message on Microsoft TechNet : " In the last few days , we have uncovered a compatibility issue between Microsoft Dynamics Retail Management System ( RMS ) and both Windows XP SP3 and Windows Vista Service Pack 1 ( SP1 ) .
In order to make sure customers have the best possible experience , we have decided to delay releasing Windows XP Service Pack 3 ( SP3 ) to the web . "
Having said that , if you are not running Microsoft Dynamics RMS , it is perfectly safe to install XP SP3 or Vista SP1 ( which has also been pulled from automatic updates ) .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. officials in Baghdad fear a new outbreak of “ ethnic cleansing ” between Sunnis and Shi’ites next year after the U.S. security crackdown ends , a government watchdog said on Thursday .

The Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction warned in a report that lower levels of sectarian violence attributed to the President George W. Bush ’s troop build - up have not produced lasting political reconciliation in Baghdad and its neighboring Diyala province .
“ Some of ( the ) districts and neighborhoods remain too ‘ hot ’ for reconciliation to take place , ” said the report , which included a review of a U.S. initiative to stabilize Iraq with provincial reconstruction teams consisting of U.S. civilian and military officials .
“ In areas that included mixed Sunni - Shia populations , we were told , the departure of U.S. forces would produce open battlegrounds of ethnic cleansing , ” the report said .
There has been no end to the relentless violence in Iraq , but attacks in Baghdad and surrounding areas have fallen off since Bush sent an extra 30,000 troops as part of a strategy to stabilize the Iraqi capital in hopes of fostering political reconciliation .
There are currently 171,000 U.S. troops in the country .
But analysts say the fractured Iraqi government has not addressed underlying grievances between Sunnis and Shi’ites .
They warn that sectarian violence could re-escalate after the planned withdrawal of 20,000 U.S. combat troops by next July .
Sectarian violence surged after the February 2006 bombing of a Shi’ite mosque in mainly Sunni Samarra .
Analysts say one reason for the recent drop in violence is the scale of sectarian “ cleansing ” that has since occurred in once - mixed Sunni and Shi’ite districts .
“ INTIMIDATION AND FEAR ”
U.S. officials assigned to the reconstruction teams in Iraq told the inspector general that much of the potential for renewed violence lies in Baghdad neighborhoods where U.S. forces had little presence before the troop build - up began .
They believe fighting could resume in once - mixed Sunni and Shi’ite areas , where one group has temporarily driven out its rivals , and in areas where homogenous Sunni and Shi’ite neighborhoods border each other .
The report referred to southern Baghdad ’s Doura market as a place where Shi’ite militias could be expected to expel Sunni shopkeepers if U.S. forces withdrew .
“ Their concern is that while the surge has helped pacify areas including Diyala and aided the PRT mission , it may only be temporary , ” Stuart Bowen , the special inspector general , told Reuters after a congressional hearing .
It was unclear what effect the potential for violence cited by the report might have on U.S. troop withdrawal plans .
U.S. officials have cautioned that the pace of withdrawal will depend on the security situation on the ground in Baghdad and its environs .
The special inspector general ’s report characterized political reality for the average Iraqi in Baghdad ’s neighborhoods as “ a matter of intimidation and fear . ”
“ Sunni and Shia extremists target local government officials , religious leaders and tribal sheikhs who step forward to help on matters of reconciliation , ” the report said .
“ Governance advisors ... noted that Baghdad had largely lost key components of its civil society -- senior civil service , academics and business leaders -- making it difficult to identify and recruit serious and capable partners . ”
The report said the Iraq reconstruction team program , on which the Bush administration has spent $ 1.9 billion in hopes of bringing stability to Iraq ’s 18 provinces , has had incremental successes across the country but has also been undermined by violence .
The government watchdog also said the program continues to lack a comprehensive plan with clearly defined objectives .
It called on U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker and U.S. Iraq Commander Gen. David Petraeus to establish such a plan .
Donna Brazile -- an uncommitted superdelegate of the Democratic National Convention and one of television 's few black , female political pundits -- interjected an intriguing observation this afternoon into a discussion on CNN about Hillary Clinton 's stiff - arming of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
In short , Brazile provided a pointed reminder that some voters ( African Americans , in particular , we would think ) might recall that Wright did not turn on Clinton 's husband during an hour of need for him .
Clinton , for the first time since the fury over Barack Obama 's tart - tongued former minister erupted more than a week ago , today rebuked her rival in the Democratic presidential race for his link to the pastor .
Responding to question during a sit - down with a Pittsburgh newspaper -- and then later reiterating her position to other reporters in Pennsylvania -- Clinton said she would not have been a member of a church headed by someone , like Wright , who indulged in racially tinged invective .
Her comments assured another burst of attention on the Obama - Wright connection -- something her campaign did n't have to do during the white - hot heat of the controversy .
And it took part of the media spotlight away from her faulty memory ( or , less kindly , utter fabrication ) about her visit to Bosnia when she was first lady .
Clinton could have contented herself with decrying Wright 's messages without saying , in essence , that no way would she tolerate an association with the likes of him .
That 's what Brazile picked up on , making a reference to Wright 's willingness to join dozens of other religious figures in attending an annual White House prayer breakfast just as the Starr report on Bill Clinton 's affair with Monica Lewinsky -- in all its lurid detail -- was about to come out .
No doubt ...
File - sharing and property rights
Recently , the Los Angeles Times 's Jon Healey kicked off a new round in the long - running debate about the moral status of file - sharing .
Critics of the practice analogize copyrights to property rights , suggesting that file - sharing is a form of theft .
Property rights have emotional resonance across the political spectrum .
As a result , those who want to increase the power of copyright owners have tended to stress the similarities between copyrights and property rights .
In contrast , those who who favor less restrictive copyright laws , as well as those who oppose copyright altogether , have resisted this analogy .
In a sense , this is obviously just a semantic dispute .
But there are also important philosophical and legal issues underlying these arguments .
As a strong supporter of property rights , I 'm very interested in the similarities and differences between copyrights and traditional property rights .
Two arguments for property rights
To evaluate the analogy more carefully , it 's necessary to consider why property rights are needed in the first place .
There are two basic arguments , which we might call the scarcity argument and the reward argument .
The scarcity argument suggests that property rights are needed to ensure an efficient allocation of scarce resources .
When a resource lacks a clear owner , there is a temptation to overuse it .
The classic example of this is the tragedy of the commons , in which communally - owned pasture land is over - grazed to the detriment of all of the field 's users .
The tragedy of the commons can often be solved by dividing the land up into discrete plots , each owned by a single individual who will be motivated to take good care of it .
The scarcity argument focuses on the efficient use of existing resources .
In contrast , the reward argument focuses on the creation of new resources .
It says that people will under - produce valuable resources if they are n't allowed to keep what they produce .
For example , a farmer is far less likely to plant crops in the spring if he wo n't be able to prevent others from harvesting them in the fall .
Both of these arguments are good reasons for property rights in physical objects .
But only the reward argument seems to apply to copyright .
As Mike Masnick has noted , once an information good has been produced , it can be reproduced an unlimited number of times without diminishing its value .
Opponents of copyright emphasize the scarcity argument to illustrate the differences between copyright and traditional property rights .
Of course , the reward argument assumes that particular classes of creative works would n't be adequately supplied in the absence of copyright protection .
This seems to be true for at least some categories of copyrighted works .
It is hard to imagine , for example , that Hollywood studios would spend tens of millions of dollars producing a new blockbuster if the law did n't grant them exclusive rights in its commercial reproduction .
Yet in many cases , it 's far from clear that copyright is necessary for all categories of creative works .
For example , I doubt there would be a shortage of photographs without copyright protections for photographers .
Similarly , there is no shortage of garage bands producing music with no realistic expectation of making music for a living .
It 's not hard to imagine that there would be continue to be plenty of music in the absence of copyright protection for musical works .
The mystery of copyright
If we take the analogy between copyright and property rights seriously , it has some implications that advocates of strong copyright may not like .
The copyright system is currently undergoing rapid changes as technology undermines old business models and enforcement regimes .
Some aspects of copyright law are widely ignored and evaded , and efforts to strictly enforce the law have sparked widespread outrage .
If we want to take the property rights analogy seriously , it does n't make sense to compare today 's chaotic copyright regime to the stable , orderly , and universally accepted property rights system we have today .
Rather , the right comparison is to the American property rights system at a time when it , too , faced rapid changes and serious challenges to its legitimacy .
In his widely - cited 2000 book The Mystery of Capital , economist Hernando de Soto looked back at the formative years of property regimes around the world .
While de Soto himself never mentions copyright law , the conflicts he describes have striking parallels to today 's copyright debate .
There 's no need to have any exposition on this image .
It says everything to the believer .
See if I will not open for you the windows of Heaven and pour out for you such blessing that there will not be room enough to receive it ...

Bush 's Favorite Lie When cataloguing George W. Bush ’s lies – even if you stick just to his fabrications about the Iraq War and the “ war on terror ” – there are so many to choose from , it ’s hard to pick a favorite .

There ’s the one about how before Sept. 11 , 2001 , Americans thought that “ oceans protected us ” – although perhaps not from Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles armed with nuclear warheads , which during the Cold War had school children hiding under desks and homeowners buying bomb shelters .
After taking office in January 2001 , Bush was so confident about the protective oceans that he pushed aggressively for a " Star Wars " missile defense system .
Or there ’s Bush ’s oft - repeated claim that al - Qaeda terrorists are poised to dominate the world through a caliphate “ stretching from Spain to Indonesia , ” though in reality they are a bunch of crazed misfits forcibly exiled from their own countries and now living in caves along the Afghan - Pakistani border .
Bush also insists that Americans must heed what Osama bin Laden says , like when this homicidal maniac supposedly calls Iraq the “ central front ” in the “ war on terror , ” the American people must keep troops there indefinitely .
But it ’s never explained why it makes sense for the United States to let bin Laden ’s public declarations shape Washington ’s policies .
There ’s a chance , you see , that bin Laden is either completely nuts or perhaps clever enough to bait Bush into taking actions that actually help al - Qaeda , like getting the United States bogged down in Iraq , alienating the Muslim world and diverting military resources away from where bin Laden is hiding .
Indeed , the evidence from captured ( internal rather than public ) al - Qaeda communications indicates that bin Laden ’s high command considers Afghanistan and Pakistan – not Iraq – their central front .
In 2005 , for instance , one intercepted letter , purportedly written by al - Qaeda ’s No. 2 Ayman al - Zawahiri , asked fighters in Iraq to send $ 100,000 to headquarters back on the Afghan - Pakistani border .
If Bush were right – and al - Qaeda considered Iraq the “ central front ” – one might expect that the money would be going in the opposite direction .

Personal Favorite
But my personal favorite Bush lie is when he insists that the United States invaded Iraq to enforce a United Nations resolution and that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein “ chose war ” by barring U.N. weapons inspectors .
Bush dusted off that old canard on Nov. 7 while standing next to French President Nicolas Sarkozy during a press conference at George Washington ’s estate at Mount Vernon in Virginia .
Responding to a question from a French journalist about Bush ’s dispute with France over the March 2003 invasion of Iraq , the U.S. president said : “ We had a difference of opinion with your great country over whether or not I should have used military force to enforce U.N. demands . … I just want to remind you that [ U.N. Resolution ] 1441 was supported by France and the United States , which clearly said to the dictator , you will disclose , disarm , or face serious consequences .
Now , I 'm the kind of person that when somebody says something , I take them for their word . ”
Bush has made this same false argument scores of times dating back to July 2003 , several months after the invasion when it was becoming clear that Saddam Hussein had told the truth when his government reported to the U.N. in 2002 that Iraq ’s WMD stockpiles had been eliminated .
Hussein also relented in fall 2002 , allowing U.N. weapons inspectors to travel freely around Iraq checking out suspected WMD sites .
The U.N. inspectors found nothing and reported growing Iraqi cooperation in the early months of 2003 .
In other words , Hussein was complying with Resolution 1441 .
Nevertheless , Bush was determined to invade Iraq and tried to get the U.N. Security Council to go along .
However , France and most other members of the Security Council rebuffed Bush and sought more time for the inspectors .
Then , in defiance of the U.N. – and in violation of the U.N. Charter which prohibits aggressive wars – Bush forced out the U.N. inspectors and launched his “ shock and awe ” assault .
After a bloody three - week campaign , U.S. - led forces toppled Hussein ’s government , but found no WMD caches .
Instead of admitting the obvious facts – that he had launched an unprovoked war on false pretenses – Bush rewrote the history .
Starting at a White House press briefing on July 14 , 2003 , Bush began insisting that he had no choice but to invade Iraq because Hussein would n’t let the U.N. inspectors in .
Bush told reporters : “ We gave him [ Saddam Hussein ] a chance to allow the inspectors in , and he would n’t let them in .
And , therefore , after a reasonable request , we decided to remove him from power . ”
Bush ’s Litany Facing no contradiction from the White House press corps , Bush repeated this lie in varied forms over the next four - plus years as part of his litany defending the invasion .
On Jan. 27 , 2004 , for example , Bush said , “ We went to the United Nations , of course , and got an overwhelming resolution – 1441 – unanimous resolution , that said to Saddam , you must disclose and destroy your weapons programs , which obviously meant the world felt he had such programs .
He chose defiance .
It was his choice to make , and he did not let us in . ”
As the years went by , Bush ’s lie and its unchallenged retelling took on the color of truth .
At a March 21 , 2006 , news conference , Bush again blamed the war on Hussein ’s defiance of U.N. demands for unfettered inspections .
“ I was hoping to solve this [ Iraq ] problem diplomatically , ” Bush said .
“ The world said , ‘ Disarm , disclose or face serious consequences . ’ …
We worked to make sure that Saddam Hussein heard the message of the world .
And when he chose to deny the inspectors , when he chose not to disclose , then I had the difficult decision to make to remove him .
And we did . ”
At a press conference on May 24 , 2007 , Bush offered a short - hand version , even inviting the journalists to remember the invented history .
“ As you might remember back then , we tried the diplomatic route : [ U.N. Resolution ] 1441 was a unanimous vote in the Security Council that said disclose , disarm or face serious consequences .
So the choice was his [ Hussein ’s ] to make .
And he made a choice that has subsequently caused him to lose his life . ”
Not only have Washington journalists stayed consistently silent in the face of this false history , some have even adopted Bush ’s lie as their own .
For instance , in a July 2004 interview , ABC ’s veteran newsman Ted Koppel used it to explain why he – Koppel – thought the invasion of Iraq was justified .
“ It did not make logical sense that Saddam Hussein , whose armies had been defeated once before by the United States and the Coalition , would be prepared to lose control over his country if all he had to do was say , ‘ All right , U.N. , come on in , check it out , ’ ” Koppel told Amy Goodman , host of “ Democracy Now . ”
Of course , Hussein did tell the U.N. to “ come on in , check it out . ”
But that was in the real world , not in the faux reality that governs modern Washington .
Bush ’s Iraq lies are now entering a new political generation , seeping into Campaign 2008 .
At the Republican debate on June 5 , 2007 , former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney defended Bush ’s invasion on the grounds that Hussein refused to let U.N. weapons inspectors in to search for WMD .
If Saddam “ had opened up his country to I.A.E.A. inspectors , and they ’d come in and they ’d found that there were no weapons of mass destruction , ” the war might have been averted , Romney said .
Not surprisingly , Romney ’s false statement was no more challenged by the CNN debate moderators than Bush ’s earlier versions had been .
By constant repetition , Bush has transformed his lie into what passes for truth in modern American politics .
