What did Chevron do when it learned that “ 60 Minutes ” was preparing a potentially damaging report about oil company contamination of the Amazon rain forest in Ecuador ?
It hired a former journalist to produce a mirror image of the report , from the corporation ’s point of view .
As a demonstration of just how far companies will go to counteract negative publicity , the Chevron case is extraordinary .
Gene Randall , a former CNN correspondent , spent about five months on the project , which was posted on the Internet in April , three weeks before the “ 60 Minutes ” report was shown on May 3 .
“ Chevron hired me to tell its side of the story , ” he said .
“ That ’s what I did . ”
The two videos  one by CBS , the other by a corporation being scrutinized by CBS  run about 14 minutes long .
They each discuss a class - action lawsuit filed by Ecuadoreans who accuse Texaco , a company acquired by Chevron in 2001 , of poisoning the rain forest .
An Ecuadorean judge is expected to rule soon on whether Chevron owes up to $ 27 billion in damages , which would make the case “ the largest environmental lawsuit in history , ” the “ 60 Minutes ” correspondent , Scott Pelley , said .
Breathing in polluted air may wreak havoc on our DNA , reprogramming genes in as few as three days and causing increased rates of cancer and other diseases .
So says a new study that tracked DNA damage in 63 steel - foundry workers in Brescia , Italy , who , under their normal factory conditions , were exposed to particulate matter .
The same damage may occur in city dwellers exposed to normal air , the researchers say .
Particulate matter includes suspended , tiny bits of dust , metal , or soot in the air , which can lodge deep in the lungs .
Exposure to the substance has been linked to respiratory diseases , lung cancer , and heart problems .
Scientists know little about how inhaling particulate matter can cause health problems , according to lead study author Andrea Baccarelli of the University of Milan .
But they did find that exposed workers ' DNA was damaged by a slowed rate of " methylation , " a biological process in which genes are organized into different chemical groups .
Fewer groups means that fewer genes are expressed — or made into proteins — a crucial process in the body 's regular maintenance .
Reduced - size gene groups like the ones observed in the new study have also been found in the blood DNA of lung cancer patients .
Widespread Damage
In the study , the workers ' blood was sampled on the morning of the first day of their workweeks — before they were heavily exposed to the foundry 's air — and again a few days later .
Comparisons between the two samples revealed significant changes in the methylation of four genes that may suppress tumors , said Baccarelli , who presented his research May 17 at the International Conference of the American Thoracic Society in San Diego , California .
You might not have to be a steelworker to sustain this kind of genetic damage , Baccarelli added .
It 's true that air near the steel foundry contains about ten times more particulate matter than ambient — or normal — air , and a larger fraction of foundry - air particles are metals .
But the team speculates that the same damage can occur in city dwellers — the effects , however , take weeks or months to show up .
For instance , Baccarelli has done previous research that shows elderly people in Boston had DNA damage from breathing in particulate matter .
But Baccarelli added that " our results need to be confirmed in air pollution studies before they can be extended to the general population . "
Take Your Vitamins ?
John Heffner is professor of medicine at Oregon Health and Science University and a past president of the American Thoracic Society .
The new study strengthens the link between particulate inhalation and lung cancer , said Heffner , who did not participate in the research .
" Other investigators have shown that inhalation of particulate matter affects DNA through the methylation process , " he said .
" What these investigators have done is show that the genes affected are ones that are known to be related to the development of lung cancer . "
Related work by Baccarelli's team also raises the possibility that methylation damage from particulate matter can be slowed or even reversed with folic acid , a vitamin naturally found in many foods .
The vitamin " may make methylation machineries more efficient , " lead study author Baccarelli said .
From the ' I wonder what Oracle will do now ? ' files :
MySQL Founder Monty Widenius left Sun back in February to pursue his own vision for MySQL .
We now have more insight into what that vision is all about .
Widenius today launched the " Open Database Alliance " which is intended to be a vendor - neutral consortium for the MySQL open source database and derivative code .
One such derivative is Widenius ' MariaDB which is a fork of MySQL run by Widenius .
" Our goal with the Open Database Alliance is to provide a central clearinghouse for MySQL development , to encourage a true open development environment with community participation , and to ensure that MySQL code remains extremely high quality , " Widenius said in a statement .
This could prove to be a very big deal in my opinion .
If the Open Database Alliance grows to include all those that feel dis-enfranchised by Oracle 's management of MySQL ( when they take over ) , Widenius has now given them a safe haven .
As a commerical enterprise the new Alliance could also end up being a new home for the MySQL ecosystem , essentially stripping Oracle of a billion dollar asset .
Then again , it might not .
Sun makes its money from MySQL by way of commercial support that its organization can provide .
Widenuis organization at present does not compare to the size , scale and scope of Sun 's support ( and soon Oracle ) operations or sales operations .
What this move does prove though is that the open source model does work .
Code can be forked , it can be supported by more than one company and if users want a choice they have one to make .
You can't do that with proprietary software .
Today the arsenal is under the control of its military leaders ; it is well protected , concealed and dispersed .
But if the country fell into the wrong hands -- those of the militant Islamic jihadists and al Qaeda -- so would the arsenal .
The U.S. and the rest of the world would face the worst security threat since the end of the Cold War .
Containing this nuclear threat would be difficult , if not impossible .
The danger of Pakistan becoming a jihadist state is real .
Just before her murder in December 2007 , former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said she believed al Qaeda would be marching on Islamabad in two years .
A jihadist Pakistan would be a global game changer -- the world ’s second largest Muslim state with nuclear weapons breeding a hothouse of terrorism .
There was a lot of talk yesterday about General David Petraeus ' jolting appearance -- jolting for Republicans -- on Fox News .
The Fox talking head was apparently too shocked to put up that normal ' ole Fox anti-reality fight .
He reiterated that its important for American national defense that the Guantánamo concentration camp be closed down .
He told her that he " oversee [s ] a region in which the existence of Gitmo has been used by the enemy against us .
We have not been without missteps or mistakes [ systematic torture ] in our activity since 9/11 and again Gitmo is a lingering reminder for the use of some in that regard .
" When she did try to come back with the standard , intellectually dishonest right - wing talking points , he swatted her away like a slow - moving fly .
" I do n't think we should be afraid of our values we 're fighting for , what we stand for .
And so indeed we need to embrace them and we need to operationalize them in how we carry out what it is we 're doing on the battlefield and everywhere else .
So one has to have some faith , I think , in the legal system .
One has to have a degree of confidence that individuals that have conducted such extremist activity would indeed be found guilty in our courts of law .
" I 'm sure Limbaugh and Rove are plotting their response now .
After all , his acknowledgment that we violated that Geneva Conventions -- and committed war crimes -- lead right to prison cells for Cheney , Rumsfeld and Bush .
If only !
Actually , I was more interested in his assessment of the highly volatile situation in Pakistan -- a dysfunctional nation of 165,900,000 mostly impoverished and angry people , which has been crippled by mind boggling endemic corruption .
During the Bush Regime , over 12 billion American tax dollars flooded into the country .
Most of the money disappeared down the rathole of corruption and most of the rest of it went in developing a nuclear arsenal which is useless in the guerilla war the country is now mired in .
On top of all that , Petraeus warned that anti-American sentiment there is growing .
Pakistanis are angered , he wrote , by “ cross - border operations and reported drone strikes ” that they believe “ cause unacceptable civilian casualties .
"
In today ' sformer CIA agent and a top advisor on Pakistan to both Clinton and Obama , Bruce Riedel takes a look at the relationship between this savage hellhole and the U.S. through the prism of Pakistan 's nuclear capabilities .
The background : intense fighting in the Swat Valley just a couple hours from the capital ; 2 million internal refugees ; rebels bombing cities across the country ( Lahore and Peshawar this week ) ; a disgruntled populace ; and a failing , hollowed - out political system ready to fall apart completely .
And between 60 and 100 nuclear weapons which may or may not be secure .
Riedel has no answers that make the slightest bit of sense .
His optimism is unfounded foolishness and I fear he 's infected Obama with it as well .
He 's correct when he points out that " U.S. policy toward Pakistan in general and the Pakistani bomb in particular has oscillated wildly over the past 30 years between blind enchantment and unsuccessful isolation .
President Ronald Reagan turned a blind eye to the program in the 1980s because he needed General Zia and the ISI to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan .
President George H. W. Bush sanctioned Pakistan for building the bomb in 1990 , and Mr. Clinton added more sanctions after the 1998 tests [ both having been forced to do so by Congress ] .
President George W. Bush lifted the sanctions after 9/11 and poured billions into the Pakistani army , much of it unaccounted for , in return for Pakistan ’s help again in Afghanistan .
"
The rest is just pie - in - the - sky woolly headed nonsense that ends in tripling " aid " to Pakistan -- more and more billions of dollars annually that do nothing whatsoever to secure the country or make life more bearable for its pissed off population .
The U.S. can't be the policeman of the world .

09:28 pm - Minoru3D - review of stereoscopic USB web camera
( статью на русском языке можно почитать здесь )
It 's been a while since web cameras became everyday 's gadget and it does n't surprise anymore so see someone from overseas while you are chatting on instant messenger .
However , Minoru 3D suggests that you can surprise your friend , for instance by showing yourself in three dimensions .
All you need is an inexpensive 3D camera and pair of cheap anaglyph glasses .
Camera 's design catches eye right from the beginning , and for some reason it reminds me Disney 's Wall - e .
The camera connects to a computer 's USB and after installing drivers and calibration is ready to work with any video chat program , such as Skype or Yahoo messenger .
Minoru3D driver allows to switch between several types of stereoscopic format : anaglyph , cross eyed and parallel pairs , but only after you install recent update from their website .
Camera 's design is revealed after installing the drivers , in fact that 's two USB cameras connected to an internal USB 2.0 hub .
You can know it by seeing 3 new video devices added to your list : two href = " http://www.vimicro.com/english/product/d_vc0326uvc.htm " >
Vimicro USB 2.0 UVC PC < / a > cameras and virtual Minoru 3D camera .
From one hand it 's kind of handy , because you can use internal cameras with stereoscopic software , such as Stereoscopic Player , but from the other hand such a design tells us that there 's no hardware synchronization between the cameras .
You can notice lack of synch on fast moving objects , they create visual distortion of depth .
Yet another disappointment is lack of settings for brightness and white balance .
The driver uses automatic adjustment which not always appropriate and also not synchronized , which again creates visual dissonance .
The good news is that internal cameras allow to set brightness and white balance through video device settings , so you can have full image control using a third party driver , such as Stereoscopic Multiplexer .
Hopefully Minoru 3D will add this essential feature in the future driver update .
It appears that native resolution is 640x480@30 fps , however manufacturer of Vimicro cameras claims up to 2MP resolution .
Perhaps this is just interpolation aka digital zoom .
Picture quality is not very impressive , but it 's good enough for internet chatting and home 3D video recording .
Camera comes with a Video Capture software which records clip in asf format .
We can expect and already see 3D submissions at youtube , taken with Minoru 3D camera .
Pros :
1. Cute eye catching design .
2. Elegant and convenient mounting .
3. Simple in use
4 . Allows to use internal cameras with a third party software
Cons :
1. Cameras are not calibrated by manufacturer , you have to do calibration yourself
2. Current driver missing image control and picture looks overexposed
3 . No hardware synchronization of the cameras
4. USB cable is short
Conclusion :
Minoru3D , a working inexpensive stereoscopic webcamera , will give hours of fun to you and to your chat pals .
But 3D enthusiasts will find it no more than just a 3D toy or yet another item in their dusting stereoscopic collection .
Unfortunately Minoru 3D , as most camera manufacturers , does n't feel responsible to show real images taken by their camera , so
And here 's a couple of cross eyed pairs :
http://pics.livejournal.com/3dimka/pic/0006y1k2
http://pics.livejournal.com/3dimka/pic/0006zfp9
You can buy Minoru 3D web camera from Amazon for $ 89.95 ( free shipping )

я сам анаглифические очки когда - то делал из цветных стеклышек от разбитого витража , некоторые умельцы красят принтерными чернилами пленку или печатают фильтры прямо на ней .
Еще можно попробывать подобрать цветофильтры в детских наборах цветных пленок для аппликаций .
И все же сейчас проще и скорее всего дешевле очки просто купить :)

Each year for Veteran ’s Day , we like to look back at the military inspired toys of our childhood and remember one of our favorites .
This year we have chosen to focus on classic G.I .
Joe television ads from the 1980s .
Growing up with more than my fair share of Joe soldiers , I totally recall these commercials airing nonstop throughout the afternoons and Saturday mornings especially during the very show they were pimping the toys from .
G.I . Joe was such an enormous part of so many boys ’ childhoods that I can practically guarantee most of you have at least seen one or two of these while eating a fat bowl of Cap ’n Crunch .
So sit back and check out these great TV spots of one of the greatest toys in history , which likely inspired many of our military veterans to enter the service .
10 . The Skyhawk
I love how these kids seem to have the inane ability to recreate entire battle scenes with yard detritus .
I was never that clever .
Also my yard was full of dog crap .
9. Destro ’s Razorback
I ’m not sure who named these vehicles , but I find it amusing how the names really do nothing to connect themselves with the machinery .
Should n’t the Razorback at least be shaped like Rosie O’Donnel ?
See more about the Razorback at YoJoe.com .
8. Destro
Why everyone was afraid of a delusional metal - faced Vader wannabe is beyond me .
7 . The Dreadnoks
This ad , and the music therein , is just a solid wad of hilarity .
Take your Australian accent and toss in a heaping helping of white trash .
You got your Dreadnoks right there !
6. G.I. Joe Mauler
It ’s amazing how many of these commercials has it ’s own unique song and lyrics .
Who the hell was writing all of these jingles for action figures and vehicles ?
We assume whatever they are doing now is way less fulfilling .
5. Cobra Command Center
Look , I understand size and scale issues between toys and toons well enough , but these ‘ Command Centers ’ are never big enough to house more than 2 figures comfortably .
That ’s not a Command Center , it ’s barely an apartment .
4. U.S.S. Flagg
My next door neighbor buddy I grew up with had this in his basement and let me tell you , for those of you not privy to its sheer immensity , the damn thing was massive .
3. G.I. Joe Phantom and Cobra Bugg
Here we have the very reason why Cobra never won : the vehicle differences were so unbelievably vast !
Case in point : this ad .
2. G.I. Joe Persuader and the Cobra Maggot
See ?
What seems more honestly terrifying a Persuader ( as in , possibly , torture ? ) or a baby fly .
You be the judge .
1. The G.I. Joe Electric Train & Battle Set
No , not exactly in scale to the toys we all know and love .
However , this is apparently rare and I for one have never seen one .
Also it ’s threatening , “ Choo Choo ” sound is a bane to Cobra , I ’m told .
See X - Entertainment for a detailed look at the G.I. Joe Train .
… and a special treat
This remastered video features a bunch of ads ( some duplicates ) and was just too good not to include .
If ever there was an argument to be made that these cartoons did n’t exist just to sell toys , this video alone would be enough to prove that wrong .
I ’ve been out of the TF2 scene for a few months now , as all that focus on achievement - whoring and increasingly technical play turned me off the game somewhat – paranoia I could n’t keep up with The Kids as much as anything else .
However , the combination of a masterful marketing effort and the promise of new toys that did n’t require incredi-skill or soulless grinding to attain lured me back in today .
Clearly , I ’ve had a great time – the current free weekend means there ’s a palpable excitement on the servers , and some of the community maps that have sprung up during my time in the wilderness are pretty spectacular .
( There ’s one with biplanes in the sky and an underground ice cave which was particularly gorgeous ) .
The new weapon unlock system though – not so keen , and you may have caught some folk venting in our other TF2 threads .
Top bit of info to know before your bonce explodes in rage , however – I bounced a quick mail to Valve ’s very own Saxton Hale , TF2 lead - guy Robin Walker , who reckons there ’s some sort of bug in the system that ’s meaning people are n’t getting unlocks even after hours of play .
“ Not at all how it ’s tuned , ” apparently .
Which is , I think , the first time I ’ve been relieved to hear a game has a bug – it means the problem will get fixed .
Read on for my thoughts on the change and word on how it ’s supposed to work from the goodly Mister Walker .
Here ’s what the controversial change is in , a nutshell .
Previously , gaining a new weapon / item required earning a certain number of achievements – some of which were pretty easy , some were enjoyably challenging , and some were just a silly grind that was totally divorced from what you ’d naturally get up to in the game .
Valve nobly tried to tweak the number and manner of achievements required for a new toy into something that was n’t quite so intimidating for the more casual TF2 player , but it never felt quite right – it was always a rich get richer system , the most practised players being rewarded with stuff that would make them only more fearsome on the battlefield .
So , with this update , Valve did the gentlemanly thing and scrapped the reliance on achievements to gain these unlocks altogether .
Now , anyone can get any unlock – be it from the new Spy / Sniper pack or the old Heavy , Scout , Pyro and Medic ones – no matter how good / bad / laughably bad they are at the game .
It is absolutely , entirely fair , and it ensures people are genuinely playing the game rather than disappearing into a cheerless , artificial pattern of achievement - hunting .
And that ’s what these updates are for – to get people playing TF2 , as TF2 is supposed to be played .
This way , the playing field should be entirely level – a quiet acknowledgement that maybe everyone should have had everything in the first place after all .
It also means the servers are n’t as swamped with Spies and Snipers as one might have expected , as winning an upgrade is class - agnostic – so a Scout might win a flare gun , or a Heavy a piquant Jarate .
It also means those creepy achievement servers are less in demand .
So all ’s fair in war and war , right ?
Technically , yes – but in practice , it feels unfair .
I clocked up four hours of play since the update went live , and won nothing .
Returning later in the day , I was granted Natascha whilst walking across a bridge , which was nice – but not one of the new incredi-toys .
The presentation of it was disappointingly naff too – no sense of having found something , despite it being described as such – just a pop - up screen out of nowhere .
Someone else said he ’d won three flare guns , and that he ’d already unlocked the flare gun during the Pyro update anyway , so he must have been really miffed .
Meanwhile , I saw messages about others finding Ambassadors and Razorbacks occasionally pop-up , and I just stared aghast , gripped by childish jealousy of these obscenely lucky strangers and unable to do anything whatsoever about it .
Where did they get those wonderful toys ?
Yes , it is true : I briefly became an Angry Internet Man .
The concept is certainly sound , but some combination of the execution and this bug has made for a frustrating experience today .
Especially given the new weapons have been a big lure for lapsed players , but now they ’re finding they ca n’t get access to them .
Without seeing the intended frequency of drops in action , it ’s impossible to judged whether there ’s genuinely a problem with turning that concept into practice , or if everyone would be as happy as a Scout with a Taco if it were n’t for this unfortunate bug .
We ’re told there ’ll be a post on the official TF2 blog , explaining exactly how the system works , soon .
That ’ll be fascinating in and of itself , as hearing people repeatedly come up with crazy theories as to what the behind the scenes maths is , only to have it obviously disproved moments later , has made for some laughs .
It ’ll almost be a shame to ruin the mystery …
Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan became a whole lot less interesting when we found out he was a teacher , y’know ?
Here ’s the full skinny from Robin Walker :
“ As in everything else we do , we want to iterate , so this is really the first step towards our desired implementation .
We also think we have bugs in the system as well , since we ’re seeing some players not finding any items after a few hours of play , which is not at all how it ’s tuned .
We want unlockable drops to be a pretty regular occurrence for players , with the cosmetic hats being the rare finds . ”
Which sounds reasonable – I suspect a frequent trickle of items would be exciting rather than , as it currently is , frustrating .
It almost make some sense of the current oddball collection of multiple duplicates – having more Flare Guns than everyone else could become a point of pride .
Hope the problem ’s fixed soon , anyway – I want my jar of piss , dammit .
Update – the TF2 blog now has more details , including the revelation that item trading is on its way .
The problem seems to persist for a lot of folk despite an apparent patch , however .
This certainly has n’t been Valve ’s finest hour – but again , let ’s hope the planned changes make up for it .
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Space officials in Russia and the United States were on Thursday tracking hundreds of pieces of debris that were spewed into space when a U.S. satellite collided with a defunct Russian military satellite .

REUTERS / Handout
The crash , which Russian officials said took place on Tuesday at about 1700 GMT ( 12:00 p.m. EST ) above northern Siberia , is the first publicly known satellite collision and has raised concerns about the safety of the manned International Space Station .
The collision happened in an orbit heavily used by satellites and other spacecraft and the U.S. Strategic Command , the arm of the Pentagon that handles space , said countries might have to maneuver their craft to avoid the debris .
“ The collision of these two space apparatuses happened by chance and these two apparatuses have been destroyed , ” Major - General Alexander Yakushin , first deputy commander of Russia ’s Space Forces , told Reuters .
“ The fragments pose no danger whatsoever to Russian space objects , ” he said .
When asked if the debris posed a danger to other nations ’ space craft , he said : “ As for foreign ones , it is not for me say as it is not in my competency . ”
The collision between the Iridium Satellite LLC - operated satellite and the Russian Cosmos - 2251 military satellite occurred at about 485 miles above the Russian Arctic .
That is an altitude used by satellites that monitor weather , relay communications and perform scientific observations .
“ It ’s a very important orbit for a lot of satellites , ” said Air Force Colonel Les Kodlick from the U.S. Strategic Command .
“ We believe it ’s the first time that two satellites have collided in orbit . ”
The U.S. Joint Space Operations Center was tracking 500 to 600 new pieces of debris , some as small as 4 inches across , in addition to the 18,000 or so other man-made objects it previously catalogued in space , he said .
Russian Space Forces said it was monitoring debris that was spread over altitudes between 500 km ( 310 miles ) and 1300 km ( 807 miles ) above earth .
The priority is guarding the International Space Station , which orbits at 220 miles , substantially below the collision altitude .
One Russian and two U.S. astronauts are currently aboard the station .
SPACE STATION
The orbit of the ISS can be changed by controllers from Earth but even a tiny piece of debris can cause significant damage to the space station as it travels at 8 km per second .
“ If there is any threat to the ISS then there will be an announcement , ” one Russian space official said .
Another said there was little immediate threat to the station .
The crash has underlined concerns about how crowded the orbit paths around the planet have become in recent decades .
But experts said the chances of such a collision are extremely low and added that leading space powers have been racing to develop new ways to destroy orbiting objects .
“ The orbital altitude where the collision took place is among the most crowded in low Earth orbit , ” Texas - based security consultancy Stratfor said in a research note .
“ But statistically speaking , the enormous scale of space makes the chance that this kind of direct collision would occur completely by accident infinitesimal , ” it said .
The collision occurred in a polar orbit not far from that of a defunct Chinese weather satellite shot apart by a ground - based ballistic missile in a Chinese weapons test in January 2007 .
The United States used a missile to blow apart a tank of toxic fuel on a defective U.S. spy satellite last February .
There was no indication that Tuesday ’s collision was intentional on the part of anyone , said a U.S. government source who asked not to be named .
The European Union said on Thursday leading nations should adopt a code of conduct for civil and military activities in space .
Headlines bring news every week of another industry failing .
One , though , is doing better than ever — self - publishing .
On Tuesday , the bibliographic information company Bowker released statistics showing that last year , for the first time , more books were released by on - demand publishers than by traditional ones .
Traditional publishers released fewer books in 2008 than in 2007 — 275,232 new books , a drop of 3.2 percent .
However , on - demand publishers , the route many writers take to self - publish , released an astounding 132 percent more — 285,394 in 2008 .
Self - publishing used to be derided as “ vanity publishing . ”
No longer .
Self - published books finally are getting more respect , thanks to two things — belt - tightening in the publishing industry and technology that makes it easier to publish and promote books electronically .
The big publishers have laid off scores of employees since last year ’s financial meltdown , and at least one , Houghton Mifflin Harcourt , has announced a freeze on buying new manuscripts .
“ Publishers are going into hibernation right now , ” said Jason Boog , an editor at the publishing blog GalleyCat , to The Washington Times a few months ago .
“ While they hibernate , a lot of writers are n’t going to have a place to publish . ”
Some already are looking elsewhere .
Wil Wheaton declares , “ The incredible ease of distribution online and the fact that more authors — and actually , all creative people — can reach their audience and their customers more easily and more directly than at any other time in history , I think makes self - publishing an option that can be considered in the first round of choices rather than the last resort it ’s been perceived as up until , let ’s say , 1998 to 2001 . ”
The writer and actor — best known as Wesley Crusher on “ Star Trek : The Next Generation ” — has self - published all but one of his books , which include the memoir “ Just a Geek . ” Mr. Wheaton , who made a new name for himself as one of the earliest bloggers , researched the industry after deciding to publish eight years ago .
“ What I saw repeated was the truism that books sell as well as their authors promote them , ” he says , “ whether you ’re publishing yourself and receiving the lion ’s share of the profits or published by a big publisher and receiving a tiny portion of them . ”
He thought his renown as an actor actually would hurt his chances of being taken seriously as a writer by a big publisher , so he decided to go it alone .
“ The first book was an overwhelming success , ” he says .
“ If you combine ‘ the long tail ’ with what Kevin Kelly calls ‘ the 1,000 true fans model , ’ it ’s really realistic and reasonable for creative people who are willing to work really hard to be successful via self - publishing , whether that ’s books or music or movies . ”
In other words , an artist can make a living selling his or her niche product to a small but devoted group of people .
Mr. Wheaton ’s one experience with traditional publishing — for “ Just a Geek ” — he found “ frustrating and disillusioning and disappointing . ”
The book was promoted just to “ Star Trek ” fans rather than a general audience .
It seems the books he sells himself have sold better .
He does n’t want to talk sales figures , but he says his latest — the short sampler “ Sunken Treasure ” — has “ sold like crazy . ”
He points out that it ’s easier to get noticed with online retailers — authors are n’t competing for the finite shelf space at their local chain store .
Also , sites such as GoodReads.com allow readers to tout their favorite authors , no matter who publishes them .
Mr. Wheaton makes a comparison between his two fields .
“ If I ’m represented by the same agent who represents the gigantic , above - the - title box - office multimillionaire actors that can open a movie no matter what the movie is about , an agent is not going to waste any time working for me , ” he says .
“ It ’s just an investment - return math problem . ”
Certain sellers get the promotional dollars at most publishing companies .
Melinda Roberts last month got what she calls “ the holy grail ” for authors — an appearance on “ The Oprah Winfrey Show . ”
Her book ?
The self - published “ Mommy Confidential . ”
She published herself after agents said they loved her writing but could n’t sell another memoir .
“ My mother is a writer and editor .
I ’m a graphic designer .
Between us , we had all of the publishing skills we needed , ” she says .
Her book , based on her humorous blog , has been described as “ Erma Bombeck meets Bridget Jones . ”
She admits it ’s been tough going : “ When I sell a book , I can buy a Big Mac , and that ’s about it .
My last quarterly check , which is sitting on my desk waiting to be deposited , was $ 24 . ”
She worried about the stigma , too .
“ It ’s almost like marrying beneath yourself , ” she says .
“ It ’s a matter of public record , and you ca n’t take it back once you ’ve done it . ”
Now that she ’s been on “ Oprah , ” though , she has agents calling her .
“ One woman said , ‘ If you want to write anything else at all , call me , ’ ” she reports .
Both Mr. Wheaton and Ms. Roberts have published with Lulu.com , a Raleigh , N.C. - based print - on - demand publisher that has no upfront charges and keeps just 20 percent of profits on books sold .
Gail Jordan , Lulu ’s director of public relations , says the recession is certainly helping her company .
“ Unfortunately , people have more time on their hands than before to finish that great American novel .
Then people are taking it into their own hands and like the control they get .
With Lulu , you control your copyright , you control your price , ” she says .
“ Even people who have n’t lost their jobs are looking to supplement their income . ”
She says the Internet has made people “ savvier in general , ” which encourages self - publishing .
“ Who needs a travel agent when you have Expedia ?
We ’re much more used to taking things into our own hands and controlling them .
Lulu is not going to tell me they do n’t like Chapter 10 , ” she says .
“ It ’s up to the marketplace to decide if it has value . ”
Anyone can self - publish , too .
“ It ’s so ridiculously easy .
We have 6- , 7- , 10 - year - old kids publishing on our site and doing it themselves . ”
Those who want help for formatting or cover design can buy those services through Lulu .
The majority of self - published books are n’t selling like “ The Da Vinci Code . ”
Neither are most mainstream books — and there certainly are self - published successes .
Ms. Jordan confirms that Mr. Wheaton ’s “ Sunken Treasure ” is “ selling hand over fist . ”
And the Lulu - published “ My Stroke of Insight ” by Jill Bolte Taylor went on to get picked up by Viking Press .
“ Penguin and its subsidiary imprints all have self - published books in their catalogs past and present , ” says Viking and Plume President and Publisher Clare Ferraro , who discovered the book when hearing the author ’s “ incredibly affecting ” talk at the Technology , Entertainment , Design ( TED ) conference .
“ There is n’t a belief here that self - publishing is stigmatized . ”
“ Jill ’s incredible story and its mainstream appeal were immediately evident .
Coupled with the remarkable viral effect of the author ’s TED conference online and the universal and profound messages in ‘ My Stroke of Insight , ’ Viking could not pass up the opportunity to give such a deserving book a large - scale publication , ” she says , adding that Viking is not trimming its list .
An author can get his or her Lulu book in days .
One also can self - publish within minutes , thanks to the increasing popularity of e-books .
Amazon.com allows authors to upload a book in minutes and see it for sale in its Kindle store within hours .
April L. Hamilton has done just that .
Her two novels are available as Kindle books and paperbacks , and she has published the IndieAuthor Guide to help others do the same .
“ At last , we ’re living in a time when authors can go ‘ indie , ’ just like musicians and filmmakers before them , ” she enthuses .
She had an agent but could n’t get published — like Ms. Roberts , she found people liked her work but thought it could n’t sell .
She entered Amazon ’s Breakthrough Novel Award contest on a whim and got dozens of glowing reviews from the site ’s customers .
“ I decided maybe New York editors do n’t really know what the book - buying public wants , ” she says .
“ I think the publishing industry is looking more like the movie industry all the time .
Big , mainstream publishers want blockbusters and sure things .
They ca n’t cover their overheads on books that only sell a few thousand copies .
But that does n’t mean a book that ’s destined to sell only a few thousand copies is n’t a good book that would be very much enjoyed by its audience .
And many an aspiring author would be very happy with a loyal readership of a few thousand . ”
Ms. Hamilton has founded an online community for indie authors called Publetariat .
“ The stigma is much greater among writers themselves than among readers or even publishers , ” she says .
“ Readers are n’t biased against self - published books ; they ’re biased against bad books . ”
Mr. Wheaton argues , “ There ’s a sharp distinction between self - publishing and vanity publishing . ”
He encourages writers who are serious about their work to self - publish — if they ’re certain they ’ve written a good book .
“ Retain creative control .
Retain the profits and the satisfaction that comes with being published , ” he says .
“ If you ’re serious , hire an editor .
And pay for it .
Listen to the editor .
If you think your story about magic ponies is really awesome but nobody wants to buy it , there ’s probably a reason for it . ”

what does it take to get a warp drive ?
Warp drives will work by creating a bubble of twisted space .
But the physics of that bubble get very complicated very quickly .
If you want to explore space firsthand , a warp drive is n’t just a good idea that could save you a lot of time and resources .
It ’s an absolute must .
Without it , exploring even 1 % of the galaxy would take eons .
Luckily for future interstellar explorers , physicists are on the case and have so far been able to derive a theoretical basis for a real warp drive thanks to Michael Alcubierre from the University of Mexico .
The concept he presented in 1994 has been the basis for years of theoretical fine tuning , hopes of space minded futurists and science fiction stories requiring writers to put aside relativity .
But now , a group of Italian physicists think they ’ve found a snag .
A warp drive as we understand it today is an asymmetric bubble of space and time wrapped around the craft that needs to move faster than light .
By stretching this bubble in a certain direction , the spacecraft can move without actually moving , having the bubble of space ferry it to where it needs to go .
Because special relativity only puts a limit on objects moving through space , there ’s no limit to how fast space itself can be moved .
For a period of time after the Big Bang , there could ’ve actually been enough energy to expand space faster than the universal speed limit of 299,792,458 meters per second .
A warp drive would create very similar conditions on a small scale .
All it needs is an output roughly similar to converting the entire mass of Jupiter into pure energy and bend numerous dimensions into a bubble around itself .
See , nothing to it !
However , by bending these dimensions , it could effectively form an event horizon around itself and that event horizon could flood the inside of the bubble with Hawking radiation .
As the spacecraft approaches the speed of light , it ’s bathed in a dose high enough to fry it to a crisp .
The Hawking radiation itself consists of particles that appear out of the quantum mesh and ordinarily disappear back into it .
In the presence of warped space though , the balance of their typical behavior is broken and they ’re free to bombard anything and everything like any other type of radiation out there .
Another problem with the warp bubble is the exponential increase of something called a renormalized stress - energy tensor .
This is basically stress that builds up on the deformed sections of the bubble as it moves with increasing speed .
Because of the quantum phenomena that come into play when the bubble is created exert a lot of force on this shell of space and time , they build up stress .
When the bubble moves quickly enough , the stress can become too great and the bubble itself pops .
What will happen to the spacecraft inside ?
Well that is a very tricky question .
Ideally , the bubble peels away and the craft is suddenly stationary somewhere in the vast expanses of interstellar space .
Because the sheer distance between stars , that ’s the likeliest place for it to end up .
If momentum is somehow preserved through a mechanism we do n’t know yet , the craft would be spat out at such an enormous speed , it would be torn apart by the interstellar medium or crushed by its own momentum as special relativity says .
Or , the bubble could collapse , destroying the craft inside .
Marooned or annihilated .
Neither option is good , although maybe it wo n’t take you more than a few years to get back home from the point where your warp bubble popped .
But before you shed a tear for warp drive technology and reach for the shovel , keep in mind that these physics are so new and require so much testing to be confirmed on such a large scale , we ca n’t rule out the idea that one day we will have the technology to move faster than light .
There are other ideas out there and maybe the combination of several different approaches will yield something that works .
The very first calculations of the amount of power it would take to hit warp speed said you ’d need infinite energy since the calculations were based on special relativity .
After applying general relativity and extra dimensions , that requirement shrunk to just the mass of Jupiter which is an absolutely amazing and encouraging downgrade .
Who knows that other phenomena we ’ll find in the future or even as soon as the completion of the LHC experiments ?
Maybe they ’ll help us overcome pretty much any quantum limitation to dreams of our faster than light travel …

Charles Bolden Jr. knows a thing or two about steering complex hardware through turbulence .
He flew combat missions in Vietnam .
He piloted two space shuttle missions and commanded two others .
Now , as President Obama 's nominee to head the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , the former Marine brigadier general has been tapped to steer the agency through a potentially uncertain transition .
The space shuttle program is winding down , and its replacement – the nearly five - year - old Constellation program – is under review .
Until that review is complete , budget entries for the program beyond the current fiscal year carry an asterisk .
Pending confirmation , it now falls to Mr. Bolden to guide NASA through the tough decisions ahead on the future of human spaceflight .
" What we 've got is a situation where we 're going to wipe the slate clean , and we 're going to do something different , " says Roger Launius , a former NASA historian and now curator of the Smithsonian Institution 's National Air and Space Museum .
If anything different does emerge , one of the administrator 's top priorities will be " making key decisions about what that something different is and how to proceed with it , " he added .
At first glance , any idea of scuttling Constellation might seem quixotic .
At the end of this month , NASA program managers are turning over pad 34 - B at the Kennedy Space Center to the Constellation team .
The program is preparing for the first suborbital flight test of the Ares 1 rocket , currently slated for Aug. 30 .
But past administrations have not been shy about pulling the financial plug on previous projects aimed at replacing the space shuttles – notably McDonnell Douglas 's Delta Clipper and Lockheed - Martin 's X - 33 / Venture Star , notes Howard McCurdy , a historian at American University in Washington .
Both were canceled well into their development phases due to mishaps and technological hurdles that threatened to push up costs .
A commission is currently reviewing NASA 's human spaceflight program , and it is not necessarily bound to hold onto Constellation , according to its chairman , Norman Augustine .
" We will be looking at different architectures , as well as the existing architecture , and I am not in a position to make any predictions , " he said during a briefing earlier this month .
" We have been asked to provide options . "
One important political factor that could keep Constellation on track :
Without it , US astronauts would have to rely on Russian Soyuz launches to reach the International Space Station far longer than they would otherwise would .
An approach other than Constellation would take years to develop .
It is a potential gap in US capabilities that former NASA administrator Michael Griffin called " unseemly . "
The commission 's recommendation is due out in August .
One of the biggest challenges the new NASA administrator will face is keeping the agency and politicians focused on whatever path the Obama administration chooses afterward .
" There 's a lot of frustration within the space community that so many replacements for the space shuttle have been attempted and then not followed through , " Dr. McCurdy says .
The administrator 's role is a constant test of political and personnel skills .
As a presidential appointee , an administrator must sell an administration 's agenda to the agency , while standing up for the agency before the president and Congress .
Bolden can do both , say people inside and outside the agency .
It 's hard to become a general officer in the military without honing political skills , and he counts among his former shuttle crew mates Sen. Bill Nelson ( D ) of Florida .
Senator Nelson served as a mission specialist on a flight in January 1986 and now chairs the Senate Commerce Committee 's Space , Aeronautics , and Related Sciences subcommittee .
He argued intensively for Bolden as NASA 's new administrator .
Moreover , Bolden 's long association with NASA , including his service on the agency 's Aerospace Safety and Advisory Panel , have reassured people working for the agency .
" There 's a lot of excitement about Chuck 's nomination , " says Ed Weiler , who heads the agency 's science directorate .
Obama and his public relations team have made it appear that his trillion dollars in higher taxes will fall only on " the rich . "
Obama stresses that his tax increase is only for the richest 5 percent of Americans while the other 95 percent receive a tax cut .
The fact of the matter is that the income differences within the top 5 % are far wider than the differences between the lower tax brackets and the " rich " American in the 96th percentile .
For Obama , being " rich " begins with $ 250,000 in annual income , the bottom rung of the top 5 percent .
Compare this " rich " income to that of , for example , Hank Paulson , President George W. Bush ’s Treasury Secretary when he was the head of Goldman Sachs .
In 2005 Paulson was paid $ 38.3 million in salary , stock and options .
That is 153 times the annual income of the " rich " $ 250,000 person .
Despite his massive income , Paulson himself was not among the super rich of that year , when a dozen hedge fund operators made $ 1,000 million .
The hedge fund honchos incomes were 26 times greater than Paulson ’s and 4,000 times greater than the " rich " man ’s or family ’s $ 250,000 .
For most Americans , a $ 250,000 income would be a godsend , but envy can make us blind .
A $ 250,000 income is not one that will support a rich lifestyle .
Moreover , many people prefer lesser incomes to the years of education , long work hours and stress of personal liability that are associated with many $ 250,000 incomes .
In truth , those with $ 250,000 gross incomes have more in common with those at the lower end of the income distribution than with the rich .
A $ 250,000 income is ten times greater than a $ 25,000 income , not hundreds or thousands of times greater .
On an after - tax basis , the difference shrinks to about 6 times .
The American tax code taxes the $ 250,000 income at the same rate as it taxes a $ 100,000,000 or higher income .
On an after tax basis , after the federal government grabs 30 % in income taxes and state government grabs 6 % , the " rich " man or woman or family earning $ 250,000 has $ 160,000 .
In New York City , where there is a city income tax in addition to state and federal , this sum diminishes further .
State sales taxes take another 6 or more percent of most consumption expenditures .
When all is said and done , the after - tax value of a $ 250,000 income in New York City is about $ 140,000 .
Is this rich ?
It might be in a small town in Alabama , but not in New York City .
The " rich " person or family wo n’t be purchasing a Manhattan apartment , much less a brownstone .
They wo n’t be driving a luxury car .
Indeed , they wo n’t be able to afford a parking garage for an economy car .
If they fly anywhere , it wo n’t be in a first class seat .
For the most part , $ 250,000 incomes are located in large cities where the cost of living is high .
For example , a husband and wife who are associates at major law firms , each of whom works 60 - hour weeks and has no job security , earn $ 125,000 each .
They might both have student loans to pay down .
For the Obama administration to lump these people in with Hank Paulson or billionaire hedge fund operators is propagandistic .
What is the difference between the $ 250,000 " rich " income and the $ 245,000 " non-rich " income ?
After Obama ’s tax scheme goes into effect , the $ 245,000 income will benefit from a tax cut , and the $ 250,000 will have a tax increase .
Will people in the 96th percentile ask for pay cuts that will drop them into the 95th percentile ?
In America , the truly rich are those in the top 0.5 % of the income distribution .
These are the people with yachts , private airplanes , and who are still rich after they lose half their wealth in a stock market collapse caused by government policy that accommodated financial gangsters .
" Oh well , I was worth $ 600,000,000 last year and only $ 300,000,000 this year .
Perhaps we should stop drinking $ 1,000 bottles of rare vintages and move down to $ 100 a bottle wines .
Probably should n’t buy that new yacht or that villa in the south of France . "
The upper middle class with $ 250,000 gross incomes are major losers of the financial collapse .
Many of the people in this income class are leveraged to the hilt in order to maintain appearances and can be swept away as easily as the very poor .
But those who were frugal and invested for their future have lost 50 % of their savings .
These wiped out people are the ones who will bear the brunt of Obama ’s tax increase .
If the tax rate on a multi-million dollar annual income goes up by 5 percentage points , the cutbacks wo n’t really affect the lifestyle .
But for the $ 250,000 gross income group , it means no prospect of private schools and Ivy League education for the children , who will be attending state colleges with the rest of the non-rich .
Obama is attacking the only income class that has any independence — the upper middle class professionals .
The real rich are few in number and seldom present any opposition to government .
Recently , the New York Times reported ( March 23 , 2009 ) that the 400 richest Americans ’ " share of the nation ’s total wealth has nearly doubled to more than 22 percent . "
The average income of the 400 richest Americans is $ 263 million annually .
That is 1,052 times the income of the " rich " $ 250,000 income .
What the Obama administration is really doing is taxing ordinary people in order to bail out the super rich .
The 95 % of Americans who get the tax cut will find that it is offset many times by the depreciation in the dollar and the raging inflation that will result from monetizing the multi-trillion dollar budget deficits made necessary by the bailouts of the banksters .
In the United States , government has become expert at manipulating both left - wing and right - wing ideologies .
It keeps those on both ends of the spectrum set at each other ’s throats in order to ensure the government ’s continuing independence from accountability .
Historically , the definition of a free person is a person who owns his own labor .
Serfs were not free , because they owed their feudal lords , the government of that time , a maximum of one - third of their labor .
Nineteenth century slaves were not free , because their owners could expropriate 50 % of their labor .
Today , no American is a free person .
The lowest tax rate , not counting state income , property tax and sales tax , is 15 % Social Security tax and 15 % federal income tax .
The " free American " starts off with a 30 % tax rate , the position of a medieval serf .
In medieval Europe , when tax rates reached beyond 30 % , serfs rebelled and killed their masters .

Advertisement Riots have broken out across the Indian state of Punjab after a preacher from an Indian sect was killed by a rival Sikh group in Austria .
Within hours of the incident in Vienna , thousands of Sikhs took to the streets , clashing with police and setting fire to buildings , vehicles and a train .
At least two men were killed when the security forces opened fire on crowds near the city of Jalandhar , police say .
The army has marched through the city , where a curfew is in force .
However thousands of protesters carrying swords , steel rods and sticks defied the curfew on Monday .
Whatever the provocation , it is important to maintain peace and harmony among different sections of the people

In pictures : Punjab riots
Major highways were blocked by bonfires of tyres and sticks .
Trains were attacked in several places .
Police said they had fired at rioting mobs in Jalandhar after coming under attack .
At least four people were wounded .
One man was shot dead as police dispersed a crowd in the nearby town of Lambran .
Police say they arrested six people for arson .
In the Sikh holy city of Amritsar , police fired tear gas after protesters burned dozens of buses .
The Delhi -Lahore bus was stopped near the town of Ludhiana as a precautionary measure .
Violent demonstrations have also been reported in the towns of Patiala , Ferozepur , Bathinda and Nawanshahr .
Appeal for calm Chief Minister of Punjab Prakash Singh Badal has called an all - party meeting on Tuesday and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has appealed for calm .
Most of the disturbances occurred in or near Jalandhar " I am deeply distressed by the outbreak of violence in Punjab following certain incidents in Vienna , Austria , " Mr Singh , himself a Sikh , said in a statement " Whatever the provocation , it is important to maintain peace and harmony among different sections of the people . "
The disturbances were triggered by the death of preacher Sant Rama Nand during a religious ceremony in Vienna on Sunday .
He was attacked by six men armed with knives and a pistol and succumbed to his wounds in hospital early on Monday .
Another preacher , Sant Nirajnan Dass , who was among 15 other people injured , is said to be stable .
Both the preachers were from a breakaway sect which has a large following in parts of Punjab and had travelled to Vienna to conduct a special service .
The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder , in Delhi , says several Sikh groups had apparently opposed his presence and threatened violence .

University of Miami study shows that physical attractiveness , personality , and grooming are good predictors of grades in high school and may indicate future success in college and labor markets
CORAL GABLES , FL ( April 22 , 2009 ) -- Do personal traits predict success in school ?
If so , which dimension of one 's outward appearance can tell the most about academic achievement ?
The answers to these questions are found in a new study by researchers from the University of Miami Health Economics Research Group .
The study is the first to demonstrate that non-cognitive traits play an important role in the assignment of grades in high school .
Economists have examined the role that beauty plays on the type of employment , earnings , productivity and the likelihood of politicians being elected to office , and have wondered if " beauty premiums " and " plainness penalties " in the labor market come from an accumulation of differences in attention and rewards received from teachers throughout the school years .
Findings from this peer - reviewed study titled : " Effects of Physical Attractiveness , Personality and Grooming on Academic Performance in High School " will be published in the next issue of Labour Economics .
The study offers a new perspective in an area of research that until now was almost exclusively focused on adults .
It examines the effect of three personal characteristics -- physical attractiveness , personality and grooming - - on students ' grade point averages ( GPA ) in high school .
The primary objective is to determine which aspects of these non-cognitive personal traits are more strongly linked to academic achievement , said Michael T. French , professor of health economics in the UM College of Arts and Sciences and one of the authors of the study .
" Several studies in the literature have found that physical attractiveness is significantly related to labor market earnings for men and women .
Thus , we were somewhat surprised to find that physical attractiveness was not the most important non-cognitive predictor of grades , " French said .
" Instead grooming and personality were stronger predictors of academic success in high school for boys and girls , respectively . "
Looking at GPA as a function of a long list of individual , familial , school , and environmental characteristics that are likely to affect academic performance , the researchers were able to make several significant observations , including :
Physical attractiveness has a positive effect on GPA for both genders , but only when considered alone .
When physical attractiveness is considered along with grooming and personality , the positive effect of physical attractiveness on high school GPA turns negative for both genders .
For male students , grooming delivers the biggest overall effect on GPA .
For female students , personality is positively related to GPA .
Physical appearance can be a way for adolescents to either rebel or accept adult 's standards .
However , whether the student is a " rebel " or a " conformist " does not have a significant independent effect on GPA .
The findings suggest that some degree of teacher bias is present in favor of , or against certain types of students .
All else equal , Hispanics and African Americans have lower GPAs than whites and girls have higher GPAs than males .
Students living with a mother who attended college , those that live in a two - parent household and those attending a small school have higher GPAs than those in different circumstances .
Receiving public assistance is negatively associated with GPA .
In conclusion , the study posits that students may be able to " trade - off " different personal characteristics to improve academic achievement and that this trend may affect future success in college , the labor market and family formation .

Gen Franco ruled Spain following the civil war until his death in 1975 A new book claims the Spanish dictator , General Francisco Franco , may have had more in common with Adolf Hitler than previously known - having one testicle .
Much like the Nazi leader , Franco 's loss stemmed from an injury he suffered in battle , his doctor 's granddaughter told the historian Jose Maria Zavala .
Franco was wounded in the lower abdomen at El Biutz , near Ceuta , in June 1916 .
Biographers have long speculated this affected the reproductive organs of the dictator , who ruled from 1939 to 1975 .
However , he did have a daughter , Carmen Franco y Polo , in 1926 .
Last year , documents came to light containing an account by a medic who treated Hitler during the Battle of the Somme in 1916 .
Dr Johan Jambor told his priest that Hitler had been injured in the abdomen and had lost a testicle .
He said the first question Hitler had asked him was : " Will I be able to have children ? " ' Monorchid '
In his new book , Mr Zavala quotes Dr Ana Puigvert as recalling that her grandfather , Antonio Puigvert , a urologist known to have had Franco as a patient , had told her the dictator had confided in him .
" Franco was monorchid - he had only one testicle , " she said .
Franco was a captain in the Spanish army when , in late June 1916 , he was shot in the lower abdomen while defending the modern - day Spanish enclave of Ceuta on Morocco 's Mediterranean coast .
In 1936 , he joined the military uprising that led to the Spanish Civil War and assumed leadership of the fascist Falange Party .
Three years later , with the aid of Nazi Germany and fascist Italy , he won the war and established a dictatorship .
Franco kept Spain neutral during World War II , after which he declared Spain a monarchy with himself as regent .
In 1969 , he announced that on his death he would be succeeded by Juan Carlos I , grandson of Spain 's last reigning king , hoping that he would maintain his regime .
However , after his death in 1975 , the new king moved to dismantle the authoritarian institutions and restore democratic rule .

The inquiry says Israel 's use of white phosphorous was reckless in Gaza A United Nations inquiry into attacks by Israeli forces on UN property during the Gaza conflict four months ago has heavily criticised Israel 's army .
It found Israel to blame in six out of nine incidents when death or injury were caused to people sheltering at UN property and UN buildings were damaged .
In one case , Palestinian militants were found to have fired at a UN warehouse .
The Israeli Defence Minister , Ehud Barak , rejected the report , saying it was biased .
" We have the most moral army in the world , " he said .
" IDF [ Israeli Defense Force ] commanders and soldiers made every effort to avoid hurting uninvolved civilians . "

He accused Hamas of hiding its fighters among civilians and in the vicinity of UN installations .
The UN report says the Israeli military took " inadequate " precautions to protect UN premises and civilians inside and recommends further investigation into possible war crimes .
One of the incidents highlighted in the document is the firing of artillery shells near a UN - run school in Jabalia where Palestinians were sheltering on 6 January .
The panel says more than 40 people died outside the school - Israel says only 12 were killed , and seven of them were " terror operatives " .
The board of inquiry also criticises Israel 's use of white phosphorus shells which the UN says caused the incineration of the UN 's main food warehouse in Gaza .
Reparations sought
The BBC's Laura Trevelyan at the UN says it is a hard - hitting report which includes heavy criticism of the Israeli military 's actions and subsequent explanations and justifications .
UN REPORT'S MAIN FINDINGS Israeli army responsible in six cases in which UN property was damaged and UN staff and other civilians hurt or killed No military activity was carried out from within UN premises in any of the incidents Israeli military 's actions " involved varying degrees of negligence or recklessness " Israeli military took " inadequate " precautions to protect UN premises and civilians inside
Case studies : Weapons use
The UN board 's first recommendation seeks " formal acknowledgment " by Israel that its initial public statement that Palestinians had fired from the school grounds and from within the UN field office compound " were untrue and are regretted " .
A later Israeli inquiry said militants had fired from a site about 80 m away from the school .
Israel also contends that Hamas militants had positioned themselves near the UN relief agency headquarters .
Another recommendation says the UN should take appropriate action to seek reparation for all deaths and injuries involving its personnel and property .
The report says Israel 's actions were in breach of the agreement that UN premises and those sheltering within them should be immune from attack , something which can not be set aside for military action .
The board says investigating the deaths outside the UN school is outside its remit .
It recommends that this and allegations of war crimes committed in Gaza and southern Israel by Palestinian militants and Israel should be investigated by another inquiry .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has stressed this report is not a legal document .

Because she is anticommunist
Auxiliadora Martinez , 23 , a Nicaraguan political refugee , was beaten with sticks , shot at , nearly raped and almost murdered – all because she fought for free elections .
Now , the U.S. is prepared to deny her asylum in the land of the free .
Martinez , a campaign organizer for Eduardo Montealegre , former Constitutionalist Party candidate for Managua mayor , has been tortured by Nicaragua ’s Sandinista regime and is pleading with the United States for asylum , but American immigration officials have shown her little sympathy .
Nicaragua President Daniel Ortega has employed neighborhood committees called Citizens Power Councils , or CPCs , used by his corrupt Sandinista party to spy on citizens , intimidate and torture them .
Martinez told WND the CPCs attacked her with large rocks , sticks , mortars and sprays of gunfire .
A gang of Sandinista CPCs tried to rape and kill her because she was part of a group protesting the legitimacy of the 2008 municipal elections .
Sandinistas murdered her uncles in the 1980s when they were only 12 years old after they refused to join their forces .
“ My mom said they hid her brothers under the bed so the Sandinistas would n’t take them away , ” she said .
“ They came with their weapons and their guns and they began to rip the house apart to find the boys .
The Sandinistas took them away by force and killed them . ”
Over the years , the Martinez family became immersed in politics , determined to prevent Sandinistas from returning to power in Nicaragua .
In 2006 , Martinez raised funds for Eduardo Montealegre ’s presidential campaign while she worked at Managua International Airport .
“ I would chat with people who would come through , and they would ask me how life is in my country , ” she said .
“ They would help me with money , so I was able to get about $ 5,000 . ”
But Martinez ’ family ’s worst nightmares came true as Ortega , a Marxist guerrilla leader who previously ruled Managua with a Soviet - backed iron fist , took office in 2006 – less than two decades after U.S. - backed freedom fighters ousted him from power .
Allied with Venezuela ’s Hugo Chavez , Ortega , of the Sandinista National Liberation Front , or FSLN , is determined to overhaul Nicaragua into a quasi - parliamentary system so he may be re-elected indefinitely .
As Nicaragua prepared for its key mayoral elections in 2008 , Ortega attempted to disqualify opposition parties from the ballot .
For a small country such as Nicaragua , the 146 municipal races are significant , because mayors have the ability to act as a check on the government ’s power … .
On the night of Nov. 4 , the CPCs fired a homemade mortar into Martinez ’ mother ’s home .
“ My family hid under their beds , ” she said .
“ It was because we were helping Montealegre .
I was very afraid that these people were not going to just throw rocks because they are murderers . ”
A neighbor told her mother that the CPCs had Martinez and her little sister ’s name on a list .
The neighbor said , “ This is not a game .
This is serious .
You need to protect your daughters , and you need to stop being part of this party . ”
“ She did n’t know if they were going to rape us or beat us , ” Martinez said .
“ Other liberals know these guys are n’t kidding with their threats . ” …
During Nicaragua ’s elections , it was estimated that one - third of the voting stations experienced irregularities , according to the Wall Street Journal .
Some polling locations closed early , and observers were evicted .
Martinez said voters ’ names were listed next to booth numbers where they were to cast their ballots .
“ There were a lot of people whose names were omitted from the lists , ” Martinez revealed .
“ This is just part of what they do so people cannot vote , because the surveys said Eduardo Monteleagre was going to win .
This was one of Ortega ’s traps . ”
The president banned independent election observers from monitoring the polls for the first time since 1990 .
Many say Ortega and Hugo Chavez are determined to consolidate Marxist power in the region .
Martinez said television news reports revealed that Chavez had provided pens to mark the ballots .
That night , Martinez said Monteleagre ’s assistant , Guadalupe , called to tell her that 300 CPCs were coming to set their headquarters on fire because they believed the proof of election results from the canvassing board was inside .
“ There were many people with gunshot wounds , ” she said .
“ The people inside the headquarters were about to jump a fence because the CPCs were inside .
Guadalupe told me she believed they were going to burn her alive . ” …
Martinez came to the United States in December to seek asylum .
She is terrified that if she returns to Nicaragua , the Sandinistas will recognize and harm her .
Her mother and sisters fled to Guatemala .
Martinez was given a hearing with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services .
She waited three hours to tell her story .
Martinez offered several original photographs , her testimony , media reports , film footage and her campaign ID , but she said officials failed to express interest in her evidence .
“ Honestly , it was the first time in my life that I was in the judgment seat , ” she said .
“ For me , it was very hard . ”
On March 17 , U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services sent her a notice of intent to deny her request for asylum .
The letter , signed by George S. Mihalko , director of the Los Angeles asylum office , stated that her testimony “ was found not credible , ” because it was “ vague and incoherent ” concerning her activities with “ Vamos con Eduardo . ”
The agency ’s note included puzzling statements such as , “ You were unable to provide any other reasons why Eduardo would want to harm you . ”
But Martinez said she never suggested that Montealegre would hurt her .
She said she is concerned that Ortega and the Sandinistas would attack her .
The letter continues , “ Your vague testimony is material to your claim because it casts doubt on whether you ever participated in this demonstration or that you were ever a leader in Eduardo ’s campaign organization as claimed . ”
Martinez said she was baffled at this comment , because she presented her campaign ID , numerous photos , campaign T - shirts and even offered film footage that shows her with Montealegre and Quinonez .
The note also said she failed to establish that she had almost been raped or killed by the CPCs on Nov. 18 .
“ USCIS has found that you are not eligible for asylum status in the United States , ” it said .
The office has given her only 16 days to submit a rebuttal .
Martinez sent a letter March 21 with a Channel 2 video of the Nov. 18 protest .
In the footage , she is shown standing with the Montealegre family .
She presented two more videos – including one she recorded at the march where a CPC mob is shown surrounding them .
Montealegre and Quinonez have spoken with Martinez in recent weeks and have offered to help document her case .
As the men are under enormous pressure , Martinez said she is deeply concerned that she will not be given a fair chance for asylum in the U.S .
Meanwhile , the United States Agency for International Development has given Nicaragua $ 1.4 billion for health , education , infrastructure , environmental protection , small businesses and democracy building , the Miami Herald reported .
The U.S. has also forgiven $ 500 million in Nicaraguan debts ; however , it recently froze $ 175 million in foreign aid following reports of the municipal election fraud .
Asked what would happen if she ever returned to Nicaragua , Martinez wiped away tears now streaming down her face .
“ If I go back to my country , first , I will be raped , ” she said .
“ Secondly , they will throw me in jail and say I am bringing drugs – or they will kill me . ”
Concerned individuals may contact George Mihalko , director of the Los Angeles Asylum Office at ( 714 ) 808-8000 , fax ( 714)635-8707 , attention : Duty Officer Charles Phillips and Director George Mihalko , or write to : 1585 South Manchester Avenue , Anaheim , CA 92802 .

North Korea said Wednesday it was abandoning the truce that ended the Korean war and warned it could launch a military attack on the South , two days after testing an atomic bomb for the second time .
The announcement came amid reports that the secretive North , which outraged the international community with its bomb test Monday , was restarting work to produce more weapons - grade plutonium .
Defying global condemnation , the regime of Kim Jong - Il said it could no longer guarantee the safety of US and South Korean ships off its west coast and that the Korean peninsula was veering back towards war .
The White House said it viewed Pyongyang 's threats as " saber - rattling and bluster " that would only deepen its isolation , with spokesman Robert Gibbs saying that " threats wo n't get North Korea the attention it craves . "
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton meanwhile stressed US commitments to defend South Korea and Japan , saying in Washington " that is part of our alliance commitment that we take very seriously . "
All great websites have a great server behind them .
In this tutorial , I 'll show you how to set up a dedicated web server ( with Apache , MySQL , and PHP ) using that old computer you have lying around the house and some free software .
1. A Quick Overview
In this tutorial , we are aiming to accomplish several things :
We 're going to install the Ubuntu Server operating system .
I commonly use Ubuntu because of its ease of use and
simple administration .
It also has a rather large and extremely active community behind it , which makes getting
support a breeze .
simple administration .
It also has a rather large and extremely active community behind it , which makes getting support a breeze .
We 're going to install an OpenSSH server .
This allows you to administer your server from remote computers .
A LAMP ( Linux , Apache , MySQL , and PHP ) stack is going to be installed .
This provides the backbone that will run
your web site .
Apache is the industry standard web server on Unix - based operating systems ; it 's what most web hosts
use ( NETTUTS is using it right now ! ) and it's what we 're going to use .
your web site .
Apache is the industry standard web server on Unix - based operating systems ; it 's what most web hosts use ( NETTUTS is using it right now ! ) and it's what we 're going to use .
We 're going to install a firewall to protect your server from unauthorized access .
In order to follow this tutorial , you 're going to need a few items :
A computer to use as your server .
It does n't need to be powerful ; as long as it's not ancient , it 'll work fine .
Please
do n't do this on your desktop PC ; Ubuntu will completely wipe your computer .
do n't do this on your desktop PC ; Ubuntu will completely wipe your computer .
A CD burner and a blank CD .
These are so that you can burn Ubuntu to a disk in order to install it .
Time .
Seriously , this process is time - consuming , especially if you run into problems .
Try to set aside an afternoon
to follow this tutorial .
You may be asking why you 'd want to have your own web server .
There are several reasons , a few of them being : you can have your own testing
ground for your websites ; with a little modification , you could host your own site ; and , you will learn a lot about Linux / Unix as you go .
With that said , let 's get started !
2. Download Ubuntu Server
First and foremost , we 're going to need a CD with Ubuntu on it .
Point your web browser to http://www.ubuntu.com/,
and click download from the menu to the left .
You will now be presented with a box with two tabs : " Desktop Edition " and
" Server Edition " .
Click the " Server Edition " tab , and select " Ubuntu 8.04 LTS " .
Next , select a download location from the
drop - down box .
Finally , hit the " Begin Download " button .
Now you need to burn the ISO ( the file that you downloaded ) to a blank CD .
If you do n't know how to do this , there is an
excellent guide at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto
3. Install Ubuntu Server
Now that you 've downloaded and burned the ISO , let 's get Ubuntu installed on your server .
Put the disk in the drive , and boot from the CD .
In most modern computers , this will happen by default if a disk is in the drive when you turn it on .
If it does n't , then you need to press a key on your keyboard right when you turn it on .
For my laptop , it 's F12 , and for my server , it 's F2 .
It just depends on your computer .
You can find it by looking at the text on your screen right when you turn the computer on , during the BIOS .
You 'll see something like " Press [ KEY ] to change boot order " .
Press that key , and select your CD drive .
Still with me ?
Good .
Now that you 've booted up Ubuntu , you should see the following screen :
Select your language , and hit enter .
Now you 'll see this screen :
Select " Install Ubuntu Server " , and away we go !
The installer will now ask you if you want it to detect your keyboard layout .
Personally , I always choose no , because
it 's faster to select a standard american keyboard from the list than to have the installer detect it .
Either option is fine ,
just follow the on -screen instructions .
After you 've done that , you 'll now see a bunch of loading screens saying things like " Detecting CD - ROM drives " and such .
These should pass quickly and without problems .
However , during these screens , the installer will try to auto - configure your
network settings .
For most cases , this will work without complaint .
However , if it does n't work for you , just follow the
on - screen instructions to get it working .
After it 's done with all of that , it will ask you for a host name .
You can usually set this to anything ; I always set
mine to " web- server " .
The system will now want you to set the time zone for your clock .
For me , it 's Pacific .
Choose the one that applies to
you .
Now , the system will detect more hardware , and you 'll be prompted to " partion the disk ( s ) " .
Select " Guided - use entire
disk " .
You will now need to select the disk you wish to partition .
For most setups , only one disk will be available ; however ,
for more specialized systems , more options will be available here .
Choose the one that applies to you .
It will ask you if you want to write the changes to the disk .
Select " Yes " and hit enter .
The installer will now proceed
to format the drive and set up the partitions .
Now the magic happens .
The system will begin to install .
While this happens , go get a cup of coffee .
This can take anywhere
from 10 minutes to an hour .
It just depends on your system .
There might be times that it seems like it 's frozen ; do n't worry ,
it is n't .
Just let it do it 's thing .
However , if it 's stuck on one thing for upwards of an hour , then yes , it is frozen .
Now that the system is installed , it needs to set up the account you are going to login with .
First , give it your full
name and hit " Continue " .
Now give it your username .
It will normally just set it as your first name ,
but you can change it .
One name you may not use is " root " .
You will now be asked to provide a password .
It is ESSENTIAL that you choose a strong password , or your server will not
be secure at all .
I recommend at LEAST a mixture of numbers , lowercase letters , and uppercase letters .
However , for my servers
I use symbols , as well as a mixture of the above .
DO NOT use a password shorter than 7 characters .
Then , re-enter your password to verify that you typed it correctly .
The system will now attempt to configure the " Package Manager " ( we 'll get to what that is shortly ) .
Provide it with your
proxy information , or leave it blank if you do n't use a proxy , and select " Continue " .
The system will now scan several servers looking for updates and configuration settings .
After that has completed , you will be presented with several options to install server software .
Now , listen VERY carefully .
Select OpenSSH server , and press SPACE , NOT ENTER .
If you hit enter , the install will proceed without installing the OpenSSH server .
You could install " LAMP server " as well , but I have no experience with this option , so we 're going to install it all with a different
command later on .
The system will now install your selected software , as well as other system components .
Finally , the install will finish .
Remove the CD , and hit enter .
The computer will reboot .
If all goes well , you will be
presented with a screen that looks similar to the following :
Congratulations !
You 've just finished the hardest part .
Ubuntu is now installed , and it is time to turn this computer into
a web server .
4. Update Your New Server
Before we go any further , we need to make sure your server is up - to - date .
To do this , you need to login .
First , type your username
( the one you chose earlier ) , press enter , and then type your password .
As you 're typing your password , you 'll notice that nothing
seems to be happening .
Do n't worry , that 's the way it was designed to work .
After you 've finished typing your password , hit enter ,
and your screen should look similar to the one below if all went well :
Now , type :
It will ask you for you password , and again , you wo n't see anything as you 're typing it .
After you 've done that , it will ask you if
you want to continue .
Type " y " and press enter .
Your screen will look similar to the following :
Your system will now download and install all the latest updates .
This will take a while depending on your internet connection .
After
it has finished , your computer will need to be rebooted .
To do this , type :
And let it reboot .
Your server is now completely updated .
A Quick Note About " Sudo "
By now , you may have noticed that all of the commands you have typed have started with " sudo " .
This is because they require
administrator privileges , and that 's what " sudo " does .
It runs the command ( i.e. " shutdown " ) as an administrator , allowing it to work
properly .
This is also why it asks you for your password .
However , after you have typed " sudo " once and entered your password ,
you do not have to enter your password again for five minutes .
Not all commands require sudo , only ones that modify parts of the system .
Got all of that ?
Good .
5. Install Apache , MySQL , and PHP
It is now time to install some programs .
In order to access your sites from the internet , we 're going to need to install a web server ( Apache ) .
In additon to the web server , we'll
also want a database server ( MySQL ) and a server - side language ( PHP ) so that we can run popular applications such as WordPress .
So ,
let 's get to it !
Installing programs on Ubuntu is a lot different than installing programs on Windows or
OS X , in that Ubuntu will download and install the programs for you with a simple command .
This is because Ubuntu has something called
a Package Manager , which manages nearly all the programs on your system .
All we have to do is tell the package manager
( called " aptitude " ) that we want it to install Apache , MySQL , and PHP .
To do this , type the following command :
And press enter .
Aptitude will download and install of the programs you specified .
It will also download and install any
dependencies .
During the install process , MySQL will ask you for a root password .
You can set this to anything , just be sure you make it long and secure .
Whatever you do , DO NOT leave this blank .
After that has all finished , you now have a fully working web server .
To test it out , first find your server 's IP by typing :
It 's usually the first IP returned .
In my case , it 's 192.168.177.129 .
Now that you know the IP , open your web browser and point it
to your server IP .
If you see the " It works ! " message , then congratulations , it works .
However , we 're not done yet .
We do n't want Apache or PHP to disclose any information about themselves , as this information is not needed
by your users and could pose a security risk .
First , back up the original Apache configuration file :
Now open the configuration file :
Scroll down ( down arrow ) to where it says " ServerTokens Full " and change it to read " ServerTokens Prod "
Now , scroll down a little further and change " ServerSignature On " to " ServerSignature Off "
Finally , press Control - O followed by Control - X . That will save the file and exit the text editor .
Now , we need to do the same thing for PHP .
First , back up the original PHP configuration file :
Open the configuration file :
Change " expose_php = On " to " expose_php = Off "
Again , press Control - O followed by Control - X . Now that the configuration files are updated , restart Apache :
You are done setting up Apache , MySQL , and PHP .
6. Install a Firewall
We now are going to lock down our server a bit more by installing Shorewall , a command - line firewall .
To install it :
By default , Shorewall is installed with no rules , allowing complete access .
However , this is not the behavior we want .
Instead , we 're going to block all connections to anything other than port 80 ( HTTP ) and port 22 ( SSH ) .
First , copy the configuration
files to the Shorewall directory :
Now , open the " rules " file :
Add these lines above where it says " #LAST LINE "
Then press Control - O and Control - X . Your firewall is now configured to only accept HTTP and SSH traffic .
The last thing we need to
do is tell Shorewall to start on boot .
So , open up the main Shorewall configuration file :
Scroll down to " STARTUP_ENABLED=No " and set it to " STARTUP_ENABLED=Yes "
Press Control - O and Control - X. Now , open the Shorewall default configuration file :
And change " startup=0 " to " startup=1 " .
Press Control - O and Control - X. Finally , start your firewall :
Congratulations !
Your firewall is now set up and protecting your server .
7. Add Your Website to Your Web Server
Now that you 've got everything all set up , you 'd probably like to add a website to it .
By default , all of the files Apache serves
up to the internet are located at " / var/www / " .
However , you cannot write to this folder .
Let 's make it so you can :
What happened there was you added yourself to the " www - data " group , and made the website folder writable to the members of the " www-data "
group .
Now , you 're going to log into your server using SFTP ( not to be confused with FTPS ) .
Some clients that support SFTP are :
WinSCP ( Windows , Free ) , FileZilla ( Windows , Linux , OS X , Free ) ,
Cyberduck ( OS X , Free ) , and , my personal favorite , Transmit
( OS X , $ 30 )
Connect to your server using your username and password , and , if your client supports it , a default path of " / var/www " ( if it does n't ,
simply browse to / var / www once you have logged in ) : ( Transmit pictured )
You may now add your files to this folder ( / var / www ) and they will show up on your server when you browse to it with your
web browser .
Now , you may wonder why we 're using SFTP instead of FTP .
Mainly , because SFTP is already built into OpenSSH ( which you installed
earlier ) .
However , it is also a lot more secure than FTP , and makes it difficult ( if not impossible ) for malicious users to gain access
to your login credentials .
8. Make Your Server Accesible to the Internet
Most modern home networks are behind a router these days .
Because of this , your web server will not be visible to the internet without
a little work .
As I do n't have every router available to test with , I can only give you general directions in this area .
There are two ways to open your server up to the internet : a DMZ or Port Forwarding .
The main difference you 'll notice is that with a DMZ , your server uses the
firewall we installed earlier to protect itself .
However , with Port Forwarding , your server will be protected by your router 's firewall .
However , before we go on , you 're going to want to give your server a static LAN address .
To do that , login to your router , and look for something
along the lines of " Static IPs " or " Static Routing " .
After you have given your server a static LAN address , you can do these next parts .
Remember ,
Google is your friend .
To port foward , there is an excellent website , PortForward.com , that , while ugly , can
help you get the job done for almost any router .
The ports that you want to forward are 22 and 80 .
To create a DMZ , you need to login to your router and look for something like " DMZ settings " .
Once you find it , add your server to
the DMZ , and you 'll be set .
Again , Google is helpful in situations like this .
Now , find your public IP , and voila !
You can access your server from anywhere as long
as your IP does n't change .
9. Managing Your Server Remotely
Beside allowing you to upload files , OpenSSH allows you to login to your server from anywhere as long as you know it 's IP .
For Windows , you'll
need an SSH client .
I recommend Putty .
For OS X , SSH is
already installed .
Simply open up Terminal , and type " ssh you@yourip " .
For Putty , choose SSH , and put in your IP , username , and password
when it asks for it .
You 'll notice that , once you login , it looks exactly the same as the screen on the server :
You can do anything from here that you would do actually sitting at the server .
To logout from the server , simply type " exit " and hit enter .
10 . That 's It !
You now have a completely functioning web server .
It makes for a great testing ground , and would even be suitable to host websites with fairly low traffic .
There is obviously a lot left to be learned , but hopefully you have gained a little insight into how web servers work .
If you 'd like to read more on the topics I covered , here are some great guides :

As Susie noted The Independent covered the toxic dumping and illegal fishing off the coast of Somalia and she asked which corporate media outlet would point out the big picture in this story .
I 'm still waiting for that to happen but as usual , Amy Goodman is doing the job the corporate media refuses to .
From Democracy
Now :
President Obama vowed an international crackdown to halt piracy off the coast of Somalia Monday soon after the freeing of US cargo ship captain Richard Phillips , who had been held hostage by Somali pirates since last Wednesday .
While the pirates story has dominated the corporate media , there has been little to no discussion of the root causes driving piracy .
We speak with consultant and analyst Mohamed Abshir Waldo .
In January , he wrote a paper titled “ The Two Piracies in Somalia : Why the World Ignores the Other ? ”
Transcript below the fold .
AMY GOODMAN : A little more on the issue of toxic dumping , if you would , Mohamed Abshir Waldo .
I do n’t think people in the United States understand exactly what it is you ’re referring to and how it affects people .
MOHAMED ABSHIR WALDO :
Well , toxic dumping , industrial waste dumping , nuclear dumping , as you are probably aware and have heard and many people know , for quite some time , in the ’70s mainly , in the ’ 80s , in the ’90s , there was a lot of waste of all these kinds that companies wanted to get rid of , following very strict environmental rules in their countries .
So where else to take but in countries in conflict or weak countries who could not prevent them or who could be bought ?
So these wastes have been carried to Somalia .
It ’s been in the papers .
It has been reported by media organizations like Al Jazeera , I think , like CNN .
Many had reported about the Mafia , Italian Mafia , who admitted it , dumping it in Somalia for quite some time , for quite a long time .
And as we speak now , I heard yesterday , in fact , another vessel was captured in the Gulf of Aden by community — this time not pirates , by the community , when the suspected it , and it was carrying two huge containers , which it dumped into the sea when they saw these people coming to them .
They have been apprehended .
The vessel had been apprehended .
Fortunately , the containers did not sink into the sea , but they are being towed to the coast .
And this community has invited the international community to come and investigate this matter .
So far , we do n’t have action .
So this dumping , waste dumping , toxic dumping , nuclear waste dumping has been ongoing in Somalia since 1992 .
AMY GOODMAN : When I read your article , Mohamed Abshir Waldo , it reminded me of a controversial memo that was leaked from the World Bank — this was when Lawrence Summers , now the chief economic adviser , was the chief economist at the World Bank — in which it said , “ I think the economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest - wage country is impeccable , and we should face up to that .
I ’ve always thought that under - populated countries in Africa are vastly under- polluted . ”
He said he was being sarcastic .
MOHAMED ABSHIR WALDO :
Actually , the more formal official concerned with this UN habitat has also confirmed in various reports that this has been dumped in Somalia .
The special representative of the Secretary - General , Ould - Abdullah , who is now working with the Somali authorities , has also , I think , made a statement to that effect .
So it is very well known .
It ’s not something hidden .
It ’s not something we are making up .
The world knows , but it does n’t do anything about it .
AMY GOODMAN : Mohamed Abshir Waldo , thank you for joining us , a consultant in Kenya , speaking to us from Mombasa .

WASHINGTON , April 29 ( UPI ) -- Garbage burning on U.S. military bases in Iraq and Afghanistan caused health problems for soldiers and others exposed to toxic fumes , lawsuits allege .
A series of six lawsuits filed Tuesday and three more to be filed Wednesday against defense contractor KBR and former parent company Halliburton allege they caused the deaths of men who were exposed to the fumes from " burn pits " on U.S. military bases , CNN reported .

Other military personnel and private contractors , the suits allege , were sickened by the garbage burning at Balad Air Force Base in Iraq and elsewhere .
U.S. military officials have said their investigation found there were no serious health risks for people exposed to the burn pits for a year or less .
The open pit at Balad was used to burn food and medical waste and plastics with jet fuel used as an accelerant at times , CNN said .
One plaintiff reportedly claims " thick black smoke and toxic fumes from a burn pit " caused him severe chest pain , diarrhea , asthma , sleep apnea and debilitating migraine headaches .
" The general assertion … that KBR knowingly harmed soldiers or contractors is unfounded , " the contractor said in a statement to the broadcaster .

Advertisement Europe 's largest onshore wind farm is to be expanded further , Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond has announced .
Mr Salmond was speaking as he officially switched on the 140 - turbine Whitelee wind farm on Eaglesham Moor in East Renfrewshire .
He said developers ScottishPower Renewables had been given permission to add a further 36 turbines to the site .
That will allow the £ 300 m wind farm to power 250,000 homes and could create up to 300 jobs , Mr Salmond said .
The first minister officially connected the wind farm , which covers an area about the size of Glasgow city centre , to the National Grid in a ceremony alongside Ignacio Galan , chairman and chief executive of Iberdrola , the Spanish owners of ScottishPower .
This is now the first over 300 megawatt wind farm in the United Kingdom and we believe others will follow
Keith Anderson
ScottishPower Renewables
Winds of change as event starts Each turbine at Whitelee , which started producing electricity in January 2008 , stands 110 m high .
Mr Salmond said the Scottish Government 's approval of the extension would give the wind farm a total power capacity of 452 MW .
He added : " Whitelee in its current form is already flying the flag for onshore wind power in Europe .
" The planned extension , which I am delighted to announce today , will enable the wind farm to harness its comparative and competitive advantage in wind generated energy within Europe .
" It has the infrastructure , the expertise and the capacity to continue to develop in the future . "
' Size and scale ' Director of ScottishPower Renewables Keith Anderson said Whitelee was a landmark for the country because of its size and scale .
Mr Anderson said : " This is now the first over 300 MW wind farm in the United Kingdom and we believe others will follow . "
But he said more work was needed on infrastructure to develop the industry , particularly to improve power grid connections and capacity to handle even larger offshore wind farms and wave and tidal projects .
" We 're currently in conversations with the Crown Estate and the Scottish Government about the development of an offshore wind farm off the west coast of Scotland which could be anything up to 1,800 MW , at least five or six times the size of Whitelee , " he added .
ScottishPower 's Keith Anderson called for better power infrastructure
He said the Whitelee site had generally received good support from the local community and local authorities and the biggest challenge had been potential interference with Glasgow Airport radar .
This led to the construction of a new radar tower for the airport at a disused power station in Kincardine , Fife .
Eaglesham Community Council objected to the scheme on the grounds of its size and location , although the area 's local authorities did not oppose the development .
The organisation Rural Scotland also raised concerns about " large - scale industrial schemes " which would alter the nature of the countryside .
ScottishPower Renewables said it was key to the project that it was close to large areas of population , such as Glasgow , had good transport and energy transmission links but was also an open area of countryside with a good supply of wind .

Discover how the turbines work , how much they cost , what they generate and where the best sites are
Wind turbines in graphics A planning application was submitted for the 36 additional turbines last year , and the company will lodge a further application for another 45 turbines at the site later in the summer .
David MacKay , professor of natural philosophy at the University of Cambridge 's department of physics , said Whitelee was a step towards targets to cut carbon emissions , but warned it was only a start .
He said : " To achieve the government target of a complete decarbonisation of our electricity supply system by 2030 we need to be talking about a 100 - fold increase in wind farms in Britain and perhaps as much as a five - fold increase in nuclear power .
" That 's the scale of the building challenge we have if we 're serious about getting off fossil fuels . "
A £ 2 m visitor centre is also planned at Whitelee and the wind farm is due to be fully opened to the public , walkers , cyclists and ramblers in the summer .
We cannot sacrifice the world famous wildness and beauty of Scotland in order to meet the energy demands of southern Britain
Dave Morris
Ramblers Scotland Efforts have also taken place to promote blanket bog and moorland regeneration , with the removal of more than two million non-native conifers and work to promote black and red grouse and upland wildlife .
Dave Morris , director of Ramblers Scotland , said the scale of the wind farm may be justified as it would " make a significant contribution to the development of Scotland 's renewable energy capacity " .
But he warned : " We can not go on depending on massive land - based wind factories to meet our future renewable energy targets .
" Existing UK energy policy will require an incredible 600 Whitelees to be built by 2050 - that would cover an area of land the size of Wales .
" Hundreds of giant turbines and their associated electricity transmission lines must not be built on the land of Scotland .
We cannot sacrifice the world famous wildness and beauty of Scotland in order to meet the energy demands of southern Britain . "
Mr Morris said the future for giant turbines should lie offshore , with much smaller , community based wind turbine developments forming the basis for onshore development .

Amid the blizzard of economic data that the government puts out every week , last Tuesday ’s report analyzing G.D.P. industry by industry got little notice .
But it contained one very interesting piece of data : in 2008 , for the first time in sixteen years , the finance and insurance industry shrank .
Since 1980 , this sector ’s share of the economy has grown by almost half .
Now , apparently , the worm has turned .
Illustration by Christoph Niemann
For many , this comes as a welcome development : the size of the banking industry has become a symbol of the much lamented “ financialization ” of the U.S. economy over the past thirty years , and of what the M.I.T. economist Simon Johnson has called a “ quiet coup ” by Wall Street .
But , while banking has become a hypertrophied monster , we still need to understand how the industry got so big in the first place in order to right - size it .
And although bad policy and regulatory somnambulism have something to do with it , much of the industry ’s growth has been driven by major changes in the economy as a whole , rather than vice versa .
The desire to bring back the boring , small banking industry of the nineteen - fifties is understandable .
Unfortunately , the only way to do that would be to bring back the economy of the fifties , too .
Banking was boring then because the economy was boring .
The financial sector ’s most important job is channelling money from investors to businesses that need capital for worthwhile investment .
But in the postwar era there was n’t much need for this .
The economy , while remarkably strong , was dominated by huge companies that faced little competition , and could finance investments out of their profits .
And entrepreneurship was restrained : there were many fewer start - ups then than in the period after 1980 .
So the financial sector did n’t have much to do .
Two things changed this .
First , in the seventies those huge companies started tottering , while the U.S. economy fell apart .
Second , the corporate world was transformed by revolutionary developments in information technology and by the emergence of new industries like cable television , wireless , and biotechnology .
This meant that the economy became , and has remained , far more competitive , while corporate performance became far more volatile .
In the nineteen - eighties , companies moved in and out of the Fortune 500 twice as fast as they had in the fifties and sixties .
Suddenly , there were lots of new companies with big appetites for outside capital , which they needed in order to keep growing .
And it was Wall Street that helped them get it .
Companies like Turner Broadcasting , M.C.I. , and McCaw Cellular used junk bonds to turn themselves into major businesses .
Venture - capital investing took off , and so did the I.P.O. market ; there were twice as many I.P.O.s between 1980 and 1999 as there were between 1960 and 1979 .
To be sure , deregulation was also a factor , but Thomas Philippon , an economist at N.Y.U. , has shown that most of the increase in the size of the financial sector in this period can be accounted for by companies ’ need for new capital .
This was n’t the first time that something like this had happened .
There have been three big banking booms in modern U.S. history .
The first began in the late nineteenth century , during the Second Industrial Revolution , when bankers like J. P. Morgan funded the creation of industrial giants like U.S. Steel and International Harvester .
The second wave came in the twenties , as electrification transformed manufacturing , and the modern consumer economy took hold .
The third wave accompanied the information - technology revolution .
Each wave , Philippon shows , was propelled by the need to fund new businesses , and each left finance significantly bigger than before .
In all these cases , it was n’t so much that the bankers had changed ; the world had .
The same ca n’t be said , though , of the boom of the past decade .
The housing bubble was unique , and uniquely awful .
Each of the previous waves had come in response to a profound shift in the real economy .
With the housing bubble , by contrast , there was no meaningful development in the real economy that could explain why homes were suddenly so much more attractive or valuable .
The only thing that had changed , really , was that banks were flinging cheap money at would - be homeowners , essentially conjuring up profits out of nowhere .
And while previous booms ( at least , those of the twenties and the nineties ) did end in tears , along the way they made the economy more productive and more innovative in a lasting way .
That ’s not true of the past decade .
Banking grew bigger and more profitable .
But all we got in exchange was acres of empty houses in Phoenix .
There ’s no doubt that the financial sector needs to be smaller ; Philippon suggests that , given the demands of businesses for capital , a normal financial sector would be about the size it was in 1996 .
Besides just shrinking the industry , though , we have the harder task of making credit bubbles like the one we just lived through less likely .
That will require limiting the ability of banks to rely on vast amounts of leverage , which clearly increases risk without adding social value .
Many financial innovations also seem to be overrated ; it ’s not clear that they actually help finance do its core job of channelling capital to businesses .
The most important change , though , may be something harder to legislate : Wall Street needs to recognize that its proper role is , as it has been in the past , to follow the real economy , rather than trying to drive it .
During the housing bubble , the financial sector essentially tried to create reality .
Now ’s the time for it to respond to reality instead . ♦
Like humans , Gummi Bears are often dissatisfied with the bodies they are given .
There was once a time when all Gummis would be happy with the color of their flesh , but with pop culture infecting their sugary little heads their desires have changed .
Some insist that greens have more fun and reds are spicier .
Or maybe it 's the other way around .
Silly little Gummis .
So foolish .
Unlike humans , Gummi Bears can easily swap heads thanks to modern surgical techniques .
In fact , this is the first type of surgery that happened in the Gummi world and continues to be popular at parties .
Just make sure you squish the head and body together good and tight so it sticks , OK ?
A falling apart Gummi is a sad Gummi .
Sometimes you may need to use special surgical fluid to help stick the two parts together .
If you do n't have that , try some saliva .
It 's always handy and puts a little bit of you into each surgery .

Crosley bought the rights to the Icyball refrigeration idea , and brought it to market .
Powel Crosley had a gift for recognizing great ideas and gift for marketing .
Crosley built thousands of Icyballs in at least two factories , one in the United States and one in Canada .
Icyballs have been spotted throughout North America and as far away as Africa .
The Canadian made Icyballs carry a tag indicating that they are Deforest Crosley Icyball , those made in the USA are labeled Crosley Icyball .
The Icyball is an intermittent heat absorption type of refrigerator .
A water / ammonia mixture is used as the refrigerant .
Water and ammonia combine easily .
So , they combine in the hot ball at room temperature .
When the hot ball is heated , for about 90 minutes , the ammonia evaporates first because it has a lower boiling point than water .
The other cylinder is in water to help condense the ammonia in the cold ball .
When the balls are fully charged , the cold ball is placed in the insulated box , as the ammonia evaporates to recombine with the water in the hot ball it removes heat , cooling the inside of the refrigerator for 24 + hours .
A hole in the cold ball was for a special ice cube tray .
If the above is n't completely correct , it 's because I really do n't know anything about refrigeration , feel free to Email me and correct me .

New York “ terror ” arrests : another government - orchestrated plot
By Tom Eley
28 May 2009
In a high - publicity “ terror ” arrest , authorities seized four men in New York City May 20 , alleging they intended to blow up synagogues in the Bronx and shoot down jets near the US Air National Guard Base in Newburgh , New York .
The evidence against the men was marshaled by a paid government informant , who authorities admit spent nearly a year attempting to convince the men to carry out such attacks and provided them with phony weaponry .
The arrested are four impoverished African - American men from nearby Newburgh , New York .
All had previously converted to Islam , at least two while in prison .
They are James Cromitie — whom police describe as the ringleader — David Williams , Onta Williams and Laguerre Payen , a Haitian immigrant .
The four are charged with conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction and conspiracy to acquire and use antiaircraft missiles .
Authorities claim that the men were arrested after they planted what the agent - provocateur told them were bombs outside of the Riverdale Jewish Center .
The bombs , which were obtained by the informant , were fakes .
The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) also claims that the men acquired phony Stinger missiles through the informant , which they purportedly planned to launch at US military planes flying in and out of Stewart International Airport , a small regional airport serving Newburgh , a depressed industrial city of 60,000 residents about 60 miles north of New York City .
According to New York Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly , the men planned to leave bombs in front of the two Bronx synagogues , and then return by car to Newburgh to detonate the explosives via cell phone .
They then intended to launch an attack on the Newburgh air base , Kelly asserted .
After the men supposedly placed the phony bombs , police rushed their vehicle , smashing their windows and arresting them .
The arrests , carried out by the New York Police Department ( NYPD ) , had the trappings of a well - rehearsed military exercise .
The action included an 18 - wheel police vehicle and an armored personnel carrier , and involved personnel from the NYPD Emergency Service Unit .
The case is the latest in a string of “ terror ” cases in which the federal government , to great media fanfare , announces that it has cracked a major plot based on evidence gathered from paid informants .
In spite of spending billions of dollars and trampling over basic civil liberties — for example wire - tapping the phone conversations of millions — the massive US government “ anti- terror ” operation has not so far generated one credible case .
Yet courts have consistently handed down guilty convictions based on the work of the agent provocateurs .
The cases have included those against five men charged with plotting to kill soldiers at Fort Dix in New Jersey , a Pakistani immigrant accused of conspiracy to plant a bomb in New York City , and five Haitian immigrants recently convicted — after two mistrials — who allegedly told paid agents they wished to blow up the Sears Tower in Chicago .
According to a New York Times report , the paid government informant spent months recruiting from among the young Muslim men of Newburgh for the plot .
He offered jobs , money , cars , cell phones , and computers .
“ It ’s easy to influence someone with the dollar , especially these guys coming out of prison , ” a member of the mosque noted .
According to a source close to the case , the informant ’s name is Shahed Hussain .
It was also Hussain who provided the crucial evidence used to charge two Albany , New York , Muslims with conspiracy to assist terrorism in 2004 .
The two men were charged and ultimately convicted of helping Hussain launder money in a missile sale designed to assist in the assassination of a Pakistani diplomat .
Hussain has been a government informant since 2002 , when he was arrested for illegally accepting money in exchange for providing drivers ’ licenses .
Prior to recruiting the men at the mosque in Newburgh , Hussain spent months in a similar effort at a nearby mosque in Wappingers Falls , New York .
The imam of the Newburgh mosque told the Times that he and other members of his mosque suspected Hussain , who introduced himself as Maqsood , was a government agent .
He thought of reporting his activities .
But , he asked , “ How do you go to the government about the government ? ”
A lawyer representing Cromitie , Vincent L. Briccetti , said of Hussain , “ His history is of interest to us . ”
In the Albany case , it emerged in trial testimony that Hussain ’s every step was overseen by the FBI .
This makes the timing of the New York City arrests troubling .
Hussain , acting on orders from the FBI , told the men to plant the bombs on May 20 .
The following day President Barack Obama and Vice President Dick Cheney held back - to - back press conferences to debate the administration ’s handling of the war on terror in the midst of a bitter struggle within the political elite over whether to openly repudiate the Constitution in the name of “ national defense . ”
Politicians were quick to seize on the arrest .
Republican Representative Peter King of New York told Fox News that the transfer of “ detainees ” from the Guantánamo Bay prison camp , which Obama has slated for closure , would result in more “ domestic ” terrorists .
“ And now if you ’re bringing hundreds of prisoners from Guantánamo who are very ideologically trained , that will add to it , ” he said .
“ And I can tell you , going back several years , whether it ’s California or New York , there ’s a real concern about these house conversions because they often become the most radical . ”
For its part , the media accepted government claims at face value , treating the episode as a near catastrophe , and dutifully splashing the variations of the phrase “ terror plot thwarted ” all over the airwaves and newsprint .
New York City ’s billionaire mayor , Michael Bloomberg — also a media mogul — was particularly shameless .
“ This latest attempt to attack our freedoms shows that the homeland security threats against New York City are sadly all too real and underscores why we must remain vigilant in our efforts to prevent terrorism , ” he said .
Democratic Senator Charles Schumer stated , “ if there can be any good news from this terror scare it ’s that this group was relatively unsophisticated , infiltrated early , and not connected to another terrorist group . ”
Rep. King , a Republican from Long Island , called the government - orchestrated plot “ a very serious threat that could have cost many , many lives if it had gone through ” — if the government had provided real weapons ?
—
” It would have been a horrible , damaging tragedy . ”
Politicians also focused on the threat posed by “ domestic ” terrorists .
Rep .
King warned “ there ’s a real threat from homegrown terrorists and also from jailhouse converts , ” and Sen .
Schumer said the “ incident shows that we must always be vigilant against terrorism — foreign or domestic . ”
Democratic Representative Eliot Engel of New York added , “ The initial reports that we ’re getting [ are ] that these alleged terrorists were converted to radical Islam in jails .
I think we need to look at that as a problem as well if jails are going to become a breeding ground for people to convert to any kind of radical Islam . ”
At most — and there is no reason to treat the government ’s claims with any confidence — the men were hapless victims of a government plot that capitalized on the confused social anger felt by the most impoverished and desperate sections of the population .
Initial reports make clear that the four would have been incapable of carrying out any sort of terror plot on their own .
James Cromitie , 44 , has already spent 12 years of his life behind bars , “ most recently for selling drugs to undercover officers behind a school . ”
In an evident bid to boost what police call his “ terror cred , ” Cromitie falsely told the informant that his parents once lived in Afghanistan .
In the police complaint , Cromitie is described as being angered over the US occupation of Afghanistan and saying he wanted to “ do something to America . ”
David Williams , 28 , had recently “ started to read the Koran on slow nights at his steakhouse job . ”
Williams has a seven - year - old daughter and a newborn son .
He had recently moved to Newburgh from New York City , where he studied computer science , to assist his mother with a younger brother who was dying of cancer .
Onta Williams , 32 , told the informant that because the US government is “ killing Muslim brothers and sisters in Muslim countries ... if we kill them here with I.E.D. ’s and Stingers , it is equal . ”
Laguerre Payen , 27 , an immigrant from Haiti , faced deportation last year until a federal judge ruled he was mentally unfit .
He has been hospitalized since the arrest , and is reputed to suffer from schizophrenia .

If you arrived late for “ Terminator Salvation ” and missed the name of the director , at what moment would you realize that you were not watching a Mike Leigh film ?
I would nominate the scene in which a rusty tow truck , armed with a wrecking ball , is pursued by a riderless robot motorbike , armed with automatic machine guns .
A wrecked car falls into the bike ’s path , at which point we are given privileged access to the display screen inside the robot ’s brain .
We get a blood - red projection of the obstacle ahead , and with it , for a second or two , the words “ Analyzing alternatives . ”
Slide under the wreck , crash through it , or skirt around the side ?
I felt sorry for this anxious bike , which may have been having trouble at home , and it certainly delivers a more measured performance than some of the leading actors .
Nonetheless , that brief digital readout gives the game away .
The business of the film is not to tell a cogent story or earn the devotion of our sympathies but to analyze alternatives , and , when in doubt , pick whichever is louder .
Take John Connor , whose destiny is to lead the human resistance movement against the evil techno - empire of Skynet , a defense system that “ became self - aware , ” we are told , and turned on its creators .
In “ Terminator 2 : Judgment Day , ” Connor was played by Edward Furlong as wry , resourceful , and laid - back ; in “ Terminator 3 : Rise of the Machines , ” he was played by Nick Stahl as a cocky wuss .
And now , in “ Terminator Salvation , ” he is played by Christian Bale as a scar - nicked warrior , consumed by a messianic belief that he can save the world by shouting .
After the opening battle , he answers his radio with yelps of “ Here ! ” and “ Connor ! ” as though introducing himself to a befuddled and very deaf grandmother .
A notorious clip , leaked to the Internet ahead of the film ’s release , showed Bale melting down on the set and bawling out a member of the crew , but let ’s be fair ; next to the finished product , that lively address feels almost Edwardian in its courtesy .
Connor is well matched , in the decibel contest , by the machines .
We get snapping croconators , metallic assailants that snake through rivers and try to eat a helicopter .
As for those bikes ( Bale has to mount one of them , which he may have found rather demeaning after riding his nifty Bat - Pod in “ The Dark Knight ” ) , they are launched from the shins of a giant Terminator , which treads on a gas station as if trying to squash a roach .
The film ’s director , McG , who is clearly not content with the man -size killers of the previous movies , has ordered the larger model ; but it feels like a backward stomp , already spoofed this season by the towering heavy of “ Monsters vs. Aliens , ” and , I fear , about to be outcrunched by the vast villains of “ Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen , ” the trailer for which is more exciting than McG ’s entire movie .
At least Transformers have some color in their cheeks , whereas this disheartening saga is tinted in duns , umbers , and unrelieved mouse - grays .
There is a nice warm glow at the climax , when a Terminator gets engulfed in molten metal , but , sadly , the same thing happened to the T - 1000 in “ T2 , ” and , to be frank , that liquid - orange look is so last century .
All of which raises the question : when , and on what possible ground , did someone decide that the Terminator franchise should be no fun to watch ?
Say what you like about Arnold Schwarzenegger , but there was no mistaking the gleam in his eye — a searing scarlet gleam , true , but still a gleam .
He , like James Cameron , knew precisely how much irony should be folded into the line readings , and into the encounters between man and cyborg , so as to leaven the sense of doom .
That is now gone , and “ Terminator Salvation ” is a confused , humorless grind , with nobody , from the stars to the set designers , prepared to prick its self - importance .
The narrative device that propels characters across decades is still functioning , at a pinch , with Connor managing to be older than his own father ( Anton Yelchin ) , which could prove awkward when they come to talk about sex , and a condemned criminal named Marcus Wright ( Sam Worthington ) being reanimated after death and spirited to the year 2018 , but it ’s surely not a good sign when time travel gives you a sense of déjà vu .
In the words of one resister , “ A person could go crazy thinking about all this . ”
By the end , I felt as weary as the Terminator whom we meet in the bowels of Skynet , and who , for some reason , wears a bandanna around his skull , like Rafael Nadal .
The poor wee thing .
Is he hot ?
Would he like a glass of water ?
I know the machines are self - aware , but this is ridiculous .
If the owners of the Terminator brand ever wish to revisit the Teutonic route , traversed in such crunching style by Schwarzenegger , they should take a good look at Benno Fürmann .
His footsteps might not be as large as Arnie ’s , but he still cuts a forbidding figure , with blue eyes that could easily double as lasers .
In a new German film , “ Jerichow , ” he hardly ever starts a conversation , preferring to speak only when spoken to — like a polite child , or a prisoner in the dock .
He does n’t move much , either , unless there are specific tasks to fulfill , such as loading a truck or putting his hand in a woman ’s mouth to stop her from crying out as they try to make silent love .
( He bears a bite mark to prove it . )
When he does shift a gear , into violence , it is over within seconds ; watch him in a warehouse , dodging a punch , landing two hits of his own , and tripping the other guy onto his back .
At that point , with equal neatness , the writer - director , Christian Petzold , cuts away , and we are left shaking and ringing , as if we had just taken a blow ourselves .
The early scenes of “ Jerichow ” are an object lesson in the slow release of dramatic information .
Drop by drop , this man ’s story accrues : he is called Thomas , he was with the German Army in Afghanistan , his mother has just died , he is living alone in her house , and , apart from that , he has nothing .
He seems to have arrived , not at the end of his tether , but simply at an end , radiating dead calm where the rest of us might panic or collapse .
I half - wanted this zero state to continue , so that we could observe him explore its limits ; instead , the plot swings up , as I guess it must , to bar his way .
He meets a local businessman , a Turkish immigrant named Ali ( Hilmi Sözer ) , who has a string of snack bars , which he runs on a tight rein , and a German wife , Laura ( Nina Hoss ) , who is no less under his command .
Ali needs a driver — and , you sense , a friend — and Thomas fits the bill .
You know what happens next .
In particular , if you know “ The Postman Always Rings Twice , ” in either version , or Luchino Visconti ’s “ Ossessione , ” or the James M. Cain novel from which the three movies sprang , the shape of the tale , in which a drifter enters a dry marriage and starts a blaze , might feel all too familiar .
But those were hot numbers , whereas Petzold , the most cool - headed of the younger German directors , has siphoned the steam out of the story .
As in his previous film , “ Yella , ” with its stripped - back vision of the modern workplace , the music and the editing are as sombre as the motions of the camera .
Sex — curtailed , despairing , without a hint of raunch — is never the issue here .
Laura and Thomas are not electing to be lovers but , at a more basic level , fighting to become living souls .
At one point , they hold hands in a dark wood , like Hansel and Gretel .
As for Ali , Sözer ’s careful performance deepens the role of the cuckold to a degree that none of the Cain movies could be bothered with .
He is brutish and unhappy ( brutish because unhappy ) , doing well from his adopted land yet lying low , somehow , as if he were an illegal refugee .
No wonder he is given a diagnosis of a bad heart ; it clearly belongs elsewhere .
“ I live in a country that does n’t want me , with a woman that I bought , ” he says .
That last detail refers to Laura ’s debts , which he took on when he married her .
Thomas , too , begins the movie among loan sharks , and Petzold has remarked , in a statement on the film , that not until he viewed the finished work did he realize “ there is not a single scene in which money does n’t play a role . ”
In short , “ Jerichow ” is the right movie at the right time — and , with its dangerous stealth , it unfolds in the right place , too , among the flat fields and the half - deserted roads of Jerichower Land , in the former East Germany .
Cash is tight ( almost everyone , Laura included , tries to chisel Ali out of his profits ) , and employment is thin on the ground .
Thomas ’s first job , before he joins Ali , is to lie flat on a machine and pick cucumbers , his face to the soil .
It ’s as though Petzold had crushed “ The Postman Always Rings Twice ” against “ The Grapes of Wrath , ” film noir against the parched hopes of the Depression , and transplanted what was left to an unregarded corner of northern Europe , where the sunshine feels like a cruel joke .
“ I love you , Laura , ” Thomas tells her .
“ You ca n’t love , if you do n’t have money , ” she says , like someone rebuking the Beatles .
So compact and controlled is this fine film , with its bitter closing twist , that , against your instincts , and despite your prayers , you fear that she may be right . ♦
The bodies of the two students were found at a bedsit in New Cross A flat where two French students were murdered after a burglary went wrong was a scene of " almost unimaginable horror " , the Old Bailey has heard .
Gabriel Ferez and Laurent Bonomo , both 23 , suffered hundreds of stab wounds in the attack in Sterling Gardens in New Cross , south - east London , last June .
Prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC described the torture and murder as " inhuman " .
Dano Sonnex , 23 , of Peckham , south London , and Nigel Farmer , 33 , of no fixed address , deny the murders .
Mr Aylett said : " To take revenge for the fact that they had been unable to steal money from Mr Ferez , both men were murdered in a way that can only be described as inhuman .
" What the firemen found was a scene of almost unimaginable horror . "
In some instances , a knife had been used with such force that the skull had been penetrated and damage caused to the brain
Crispin Aylett QC
Mr Aylett said the defendants burst into the bedsit at about 0530 BST on 29 June , overpowered and bound the two students and demanded their bank card numbers .
The students thought it best to co-operate but when one of their bank cards was retained by a cash machine the defendants wanted " revenge " , jurors were told .
Mr Aylett said : " The two men , dressed only in their underpants , had been tied up .
" They had been bound at the ankles and the wrists .
Their heads had been wrapped with towels .
" They had been subjected to an attack of brutal and sustained ferocity - one of them had been stabbed 194 times , the other 50 times .
' Merciless onslaught ' " Both of them had been repeatedly stabbed in the head .
In some instances , a knife had been used with such force that the skull had been penetrated and damage caused to the brain . "
One of the burglars returned that night to set the flat on fire , the court heard .
The victims ' badly - burnt bodies were found after an explosion at the property .
The biochemistry masters students from Polytech Clermont - Ferrand were weeks away from finishing a research project at Imperial College .
Jurors were told a neighbour alerted by the explosion had seen a man flee the property .
Both men deny murder , arson , false imprisonment and perverting justice Mr Farmer , who was living with Mr Sonnex at the time , handed himself in days after an e-fit image was released .
The court heard Mr Sonnex 's palm - mark was found on the frame of a foldaway bed and he was also seen on CCTV withdrawing money using one of the stolen bank cards .
The jury heard the two defendants were now blaming each other but Mr Aylett said the crime was a joint enterprise of " unmitigated evil " .
Mr Sonnex enjoyed using " gratuitous violence " and had a previous conviction for inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent for a stabbing he carried out at the age of 16 , the jury heard .
In a robbery last year , he had allegedly tied up his pregnant foster sister and her boyfriend , jurors were told .
The court was also told Mr Farmer was a drug addict who had checked into a psychiatric hospital in Woolwich a month before the murders but left after four days , complaining about not getting the " right help " .
Mr Farmer and Mr Sonnex deny murder , arson , false imprisonment and trying to pervert the course of justice .
Mr Sonnex has admitted one count of burglary at the property on the same date as the murders .
Mr Farmer denies a charge of burglary .
The trial was adjourned until Tuesday .

Car financing for used car is a HUGE business .
The reasoning is simple .
Why buy a new car when it is possible to get used car at a cheaper price ?
Moreover , loans for buying used cars could be available at competitive interest rates fair enough to compete with rates of interests offered on new car loans .
Besides , there ’s a big market for used cars and the process for obtaining a auto loan can be really very simple .
It starts with getting your financing lined up .
Once you are approved , you can purchase a car that fits your needs and drive it home !
It 's as simple as that .
Used car finance is also available for all those who have bad or very little credit .
— John Kemp is a Reuters columnist .
The views expressed are his own —
Even after its recent decline , the U.S. equity market does not look especially “ cheap ” or “ undervalued ” when viewed over time ; the bear market has simply brought valuations back into line with long - term trends .
At a fundamental level , equity is a claim on a corporation ’s residual cash flow after wages , interest , taxes and other costs have been paid .
In aggregate , the total value of equity outstanding cannot grow faster than nominal GDP ( which is simply the economy - wide sum of cash flows ) .
Otherwise , corporations and their owners would need to capture an ever - increasing share of national income at the expense of everyone else .
For four decades between 1952 and 1992 this stable relationship between equity valuation and nominal GDP did indeed seem to hold in the United States .
Click here for PDF
The chartbook shows how U.S. GDP , as well as profits , debt , interest rates and the market value of equity capital evolved between 1952 and September 2008 ( the latest date for which full data is available ) .
Between 1952 and 1992 , the value of outstanding equity rose at much the same rate ( 8.5 percent per year ) as nominal GDP ( 7.5 percent ) .
But from 1992 onwards , the relationship broke spectacularly .
The market value of equity has risen almost twice as fast ( 9.5 percent per year ) as nominal GDP ( 5.4 percent ) ( Chart 1 ) .
As a result , the value of outstanding equity , which had been stable for four decades at 40 - 80 percent of GDP , doubled to 160 percent of GDP at its peak in Q1 2000 ( the height of the millenarian boom ) .
It has remained above 100 percent of GDP for most of the current decade ( Chart 2 ) .
THREE FACTORS
Rising equity valuations relative to nominal income were underpinned by three factors :
(1) Profits began to rise as a percentage of GDP from the early 1990s onwards as corporations succeeded in retaining more of the value of output in the form of surplus / profits and reduced the amount captured by employees ( wages ) , government ( taxes ) and other investors ( interest payments on debt ) .
Between 1992 and 2006 , the share of corporate profits in national income increased from 7 percent to 13 percent ( Chart 3 ) .
(2) In an increasingly integrated world , U.S. corporations derived a growing share of profits from operations and subsidiaries abroad .
Profits overseas are tied to GDP growth in foreign countries rather than the United States .
Since developing countries have grown faster than the United States over this period , the foreign component of corporate profits could ( and did ) increase faster than domestic profits or U.S. GDP .
As a result , the proportion of foreign profits in total earnings has risen from 16 percent to 26 percent ( Chart 4 ) .
(3) Because equities are a claim on profits in future as well as the present , valuations are sensitive to the discount rate used to convert future profits back into current values .
By lowering the discount rate , the steady fall in long - term U.S. interest rates between 1982 and 2007 as part of the “ Great Moderation ” made these future profits much more valuable , driving up equity prices even further ( Chart 5 ) .
But two of these factors ( a rising share of profits in GDP , and a reduction in the discount rate ) could not be sustained indefinitely .
To some extent they represented a one - off structural shift .
The share of profits in GDP cannot rise forever at the expense of wages , interest charges and tax payments .
The discount rate applied to future profits cannot fall below zero .
So for a time , equity valuations could grow faster than nominal GDP as the market moved from a low - profit high - discount rate equilibrium to a high - profit low - discount one .
Once the transition was complete , however , it was inevitable that the rise in equity valuations would again be limited to the rate of nominal GDP growth ( albeit from a higher baseline ) .
HIDDEN LEVERAGE
The rise in equity valuations was also sustained by a massive increase in borrowing and indebtedness .
Share buy - backs , management buyouts and the debt - funded acquisitions by private equity firms substantially increased the amount of debt in the corporate capital structure and reduced shareholders ’ equity ( the leverage ratio ) .
In effect , the long period of sustained expansion during the 1990s and the early 2000s , characterized by a mild business cycle , together with falling interest rates , increased risk appetite , and falling borrowing costs made firms comfortable taking on more debt relative to their cash flow than before .
Some of that debt was used to retire outstanding equity , heightening the leverage ratio further .
Because leverage is measured as an increase in debt ( liabilities ) relative to equity ( residual assets ) the strong rise in equity prices masked the real increase in underlying leverage .
Between 1952 and 1992 , corporate debt , like equity valuations , rose roughly in line with nominal GDP .
But after 1992 , corporate debt , like equity values , accelerated sharply ( Chart 6 ) .
So long as equity values continued to rise , the leverage ratio remained unchanged .
In fact , strong growth in equity values cut the ratio from almost 100 percent to less than 50 percent between 1987 and early 2007 ( Chart 7 ) .
But the capital structure became increasingly vulnerable to any setback in equity prices ; the borrowing boom could only be sustained as long as interest rates fell and the share of profits in GDP rose .
The U.S. economy and capital markets were thus set on an unsustainable course .
And as President Richard Nixon ’s chief economic adviser Herbert Stein noted in the 1970s , if something cannot continue indefinitely , it will eventually stop .
That is what happened when the mortgage crisis erupted in the summer of 2007 and the music suddenly stopped playing .
Once rates and spreads had reached ultra-low levels in the mid-2000s they could not be reduced any further .
In fact the Federal Reserve began to lift short - term interest rates , cautiously , from mid-2004 , putting gentle upward pressure on longer rates .
Losses on imprudent subprime lending became apparent from 2006 .
Suddenly the cheap - credit dynamic that had previously supported increases in both corporate debt and equity valuations stalled and went into reverse .
The high - debt , high - equity valuation equilibrium proved immensely unstable .
As the economy stalled and nominal growth fell , credit availability and costs rose , and the equilibrium fell apart .
Looming deflation threatens to wreak even deeper destruction , because it would push nominal GDP growth below zero .
Suddenly the highly valued equity that supported an immense pile of debt has been re-valued downwards , sending leverage ratios soaring and exposing the underlying vulnerability .
The economy - wide leverage ratio reported by the Federal Reserve jumped 16 percentage points from 41 percent to 57 percent in just 15 months between June 2007 and September 2008 .
Recent declines in share values will push the ratio closer to 100 percent when data for Q4 2008 and Q1 2009 become available in the next few months .
In some sense , the sharp drop in equity valuations over the last six months has restored the historical relationship between equity values and nominal GDP .
It has undone much of the “ structural shift ” in equity valuations to GDP experienced in the last 15 years ( Chart 8 ) .
Whether equity prices settle here or recapture some or all of their previous level depends on what caused that structural shift ; how much of it proves sustainable ; and how much is now reversed .
Share valuations may rise from current levels , but higher credit costs and a lower share of profits in GDP will almost certainly ensure valuations do not regain their previously elevated level in relation to the rest of the economy .
Potato only makes up 42 % of the ingredients of Pringles Procter & Gamble will be forced to pay tens of millions of pounds in VAT after losing a legal battle with the taxman over its Pringles snack .
The Court of Appeal ruled in favour of the Revenue , which has long maintained that Pringles constitute a potato snack and are , therefore , liable for VAT .
A High Court judge ruled last summer that the snack was exempt from the tax .
Foods are usually exempt from VAT , but one of the few exceptions is the humble potato crisp .
' Reasonable view ' A High Court judge ruled last July that Pringles ' packaging , " unnatural shape " and the fact that the potato content is less than 50 % meant the snack was exempt from VAT .
The Appeal Court judges disagreed .
" There is more than enough potato content for it to be a reasonable view that it is made from potato , " said Lord Justice Jacob .
Potatoes make up 42 % of the Pringles ' ingredients .
He added that the lawyer acting for the Revenue advised him the VAT due on the sale of Pringles was " as much as £ 100 m of tax for the past and about £ 20 m a year for the future . "
But a spokesperson for Procter & Gamble said the company had been paying VAT on the snack pending the appeal process , and so was not liable for any back taxes .
Unnatural
While praising the " simplicity and common sense " of the judges , Toby O'Reilly , director in indirect tax at Ernst & Young , said an opportunity had been missed to provide " coherent guidance " on which snacks are , and which are not , subject to VAT .
At last year 's High Court hearing , Procter & Gamble insisted that their best - selling product was not similar to potato crisps , because of their " mouth melt " taste , " uniform colour " and " regular shape " which " is not found in nature " .
It also argued that potato crisps - unlike Pringles - did not contain non-potato flours , and were not packaged in tubes .
Pringles are more like a cake or a biscuit , it claimed , because they are manufactured from dough .

Breaking news from Iowa .
A huge win for marriage equality :
The Iowa Supreme Court this morning unanimously upheld gays ’ right to marry .
“ The Iowa statute limiting civil marriage to a union between a man and a woman violates the equal protection clause of the Iowa Constitution , ” the justices said in a summary of their decision .
The court affirmed a Polk County District Court decision that would allow six gay couples to marry .
The ruling is viewed as a victory for the gay rights movement in Iowa and elsewhere , and a setback for social conservatives who wanted to protect traditional families .
The decision makes Iowa the first Midwestern state , and the fourth nationwide , to allow same - sex marriages .
Lawyers for Lambda Legal , a gay rights group that financed the court battle and represented the couples , had hoped to use a court victory to demonstrate acceptance of same - sex marriage in heartland America .

IF AFGHAN asylum seekers trying to get into Australia by boat are " queue jumpers " , as talkback callers insist , where 's the queue ?
There is n't one .
Instead , there 's a bureaucratic maze that prompts some to use the dubious services of people smugglers .
There are only two Australian diplomats in the Afghan capital , Kabul , staffing an embassy that exists in name only , and they can't process visa applications .
So Afghans must apply at the Australian high commission in Islamabad , Pakistan , which is home to 2.1 million Afghan refugees .
But if they have a close relative in Australia who could sponsor them to come here , their application must be lodged in Melbourne  and then processed in Dubai .
This is because the Islamabad high commission does n't process partner and family migration applications from Afghans .
This includes people seeking refugee and humanitarian visas .
Nakajima finished 15th for Williams in the 2008 drivers championship
Williams ' Japanese driver Kazuki Nakajima set the fastest time of the week on the final day of Formula 1 testing in Jerez .
Nakajima , 24 , clocked a best time of one minute 17.494 , while Heikki Kovalainen showed that McLaren will be competitive with a time of 1:17.946 .
The previous best had been Jenson Button 's 1:17.844 for Brawn GP .
The four - day test was the last before the 2009 season gets underway in Australia on 29 March .
Testing is now banned until the end of the year , apart from a few days of straight - line aerodynamic testing .
The British - based Williams team finished eighth in the constructors ' world championship last year but Nakajima and fellow driver Nico Rosberg will be boosted by the car 's performance in testing .
606 : DEBATE
" We have put over 8,000 km on the FW31 ( car ) in the last two months and , while there are always areas that require attention , reliability has been good , " said Williams technical director Sam Michael .
Nakajima finished in the points five times last season , scoring nine in total , but came 15th in the overall standings .
F1 champion Lewis Hamilton was a couple of seconds off the pace in testing with a best lap of 1:19.121 set on Tuesday .

There are many , many ways that the Wii reboot of the Punch - Out franchise could have gone wrong .
For fans of the series , there was only one way to do it right .
Luckily , Next Level Games understood exactly what made the classic so beloved , and stuck with the primary mechanics from the original title .
That 's right , two buttons and a digital pad are all you need .
You can also play the game with a Wiimote and nunchuck , punching at the screen and using the analog pad of the nunchuk to control whether your punchers go high or low .
Right or left and you dodge , push up without a punch and you block .
Do you gain anything by using the waggle ?
Nothing much , although if you get into it , you can expect to break a nice sweat for your efforts .
This is how I played , dancing on the balls of my feet , trying to knock Piston Honda on his ass .
Title Punch - Out !!
Developer Next Level Games Publisher Nintendo Price $ 49.99 Shop.ars Platform Nintendo Wii
Punch - Out only looks like a boxing game , because at its core it's a puzzle title , and that 's the way it should be .
Each opponent is a maze of attacks , counters , and tells .
It 's your job to find out when it 's safe to punch back , when you need to dodge or block , and when you can land a surprise blow to get those all - important stars that allow you to throw uppercuts .
The game rewards observant players , and you 'll need lightning - quick reflexes to take advantage of the slim openings your opponents leave you .
You 'll see a number of recycled boxers from past games , although I wo n't list them here .
Everyone looks great ; this is the sort of game that uses strong art and design to make up for the technical shortcomings of Nintendo 's console .
You 'll be treated to still images of each of the boxers doing whatever stereotypical thing they do best before each match , and while some of the stereotypes from past games have been toned down , expect the effete Frenchmen , a flapjack - eating lumberjack , and a disco - loving fop .
If you 're looking for reasons to get offended , you 'll likely find one or two .
The main game is n't the only way for you to play .
You can take on a friend in a split screen showdown where you try to sneak past the other 's defenses , and while this mode is slight , it 's a ton of fun with a friend .
It would have been better if you could select other boxers to pit against each other , but as it stands it 's just Little Mac vs. Little Mac .
There 's also an Exhibition Mode that challenges you to win in different ways .
Defeat an opponent with a limited number of punches , use only one hand , or simply learn how to build up your uppercut stars reliably ; this mode will serve up some serious frustration if you do n't have a good amount of patience .
While the gameplay may seem straightforward , each fighter has a number of secrets , including instant knockouts and multiple ways to gain stars .
Of course , some of the tricks from past games may work for getting your health back or staying alive when it looks like you 'll be knocked out .
All this information you 'll be able to find by browsing strategy guides the moment the game is released , and that makes me miss the days of the NES when these secrets were talked about and shared in the schoolyard , gamer to gamer , in the oral tradition .
While the secrets and challenges are welcome , I can't help but think something has been lost in the years since the last Punch - Out release .
For fans of the series , this is manna from heaven .
I had a blast recognizing patterns and weaknesses from boxers I already knew , and it was fun to try to figure out the new ones .
The game keeps you on your toes — quite literally , if you 're using the waggle controls .
If you want a real workout you can use the Wii Balance Board for ducking and dodging , which is a neat touch .
I 'm sure some gamers will complain that this is n't much of a boxing experience , but they 're missing the point .
If you have any love for the classic Punch - Out titles that came before , this is a must - buy .
And that 's before you have to face all the opponents again ... but with all - new patterns .
This is quite the impressive beast : a Punch - Out title with replay value .
Verdict : Buy

Well I went out shopping today .
I told myself I 'd only grab Devil Summoner 2 if I could find it at retail .
I only had to check two EBGames in the area .
At the second EBGames I went to , they grabbed one from the back of the store .
The clerks got a little too excited .
Apparently it was stashed back there because one of them was going to buy it after their shift .
Luckily the guy helping me was cool and gave me priority .
What an awesome package .
I have n't played the first one but the impressions I 've been reading make this seem like a game that I ought to experience even if I had to buy it awkwardly at an EBGames :lol

Democratic attorney sends letter to state AG detailing new concerns about Tucson 's long - contested 2006 special election
AG 's office : Examination may end today , says will ' examine all evidence seized , including poll tapes '...
Brad Friedman Byon 4/15/2009 , 1:32 am PT
-- Brad Friedman , A BRAD BLOG Special Report
In a letter written to the Arizona Attorney General 's office on Monday , as obtained by The BRAD BLOG , the attorney for the Pima County ( Tucson ) Democratic Party has expressed a concern that thousands of ballots from a disputed 2006 special election , which should be in the AG 's possession , may instead be " missing " .
" Many thousands of ballots that should be in the ballot boxes in your possession do n't exist , " attorney Bill Risner writes in the 3 - page letter [ PDF ] to Donald E. Conrad , Chief Counsel of the Criminal Division at the office of state Attorney General Terry Goddard .
The alarming allegations come as the second week of an extraordinary hand - count of paper ballots , part of a criminal investigation into the '06 election , continued in Phoenix on Monday .
A spokesperson from the Attorney General 's office says she believes the count will be concluded on Wednesday , though that could change .
It was originally scheduled to conclude last week .
The AG is conducting a criminal investigation into allegations that that election may have been electronically manipulated by election official insiders .
The special election created Tucson 's Regional Transportation Authority ( RTA ) in May of 2006 , and funded it with a joint bond measure to the tune of $ 2 billion over ten years .
The Pima Democratic Party had endorsed the two RTA ballots questions in the election , but they now question the legitimate success of the measures .
They 've been bringing court cases to access ballot materials , and have been demanding a hand - count of the ballots for a number of years .
Similar RTA initiatives had failed in four previous elections before they were finally passed in 2006 .
" If we are correct , " Risner wrote in his Monday letter to the Attorney General 's office , concerning the absence of as many as 19,000 paper ballots , as estimated by observers of the counting in Phoenix , " the question arises as to what happened to those ballots . "
The latest mystery adds still more fuel to the already high - stakes , long - sought hand - count , and raises new questions in the nearly three - years long investigation into the 2006 election results .
If the ballots are indeed missing , did they ever actually exist ?
Was the Diebold electronic ballot box stuffed ?
Have ballots been surreptitiously removed by someone for some reason ?
Or have observers miscalculated the number of ballots being examined ?
The AG's Press Secretary Anne Titus Hilby tells
The BRAD BLOG she 's aware of the allegations of missing ballots but could not speak to that point in any more detail " until the examination is concluded " ...
The hand - counting at the Maricopa County ( Phoenix ) election facility began last Monday under strict security which limited observers from each of the Democratic , Republican , Libertarian and Green parties to one each , as selected by the AG 's office themselves .
Party representatives had expressed dismay at Goddard 's limiting of observers to just one from each party , as chosen by his office , and at the exclusion of " cameras ... cell telephones ... writing instruments...and ... audio or video records of any kind " .
Further , as Conrad wrote to the parties on behalf of the AG 's office , in a March 23 , 2009 letter [ PDF ] , " No representative will be permitted to communicate with anyone outside of the examination room while present in the examination room by signal , voice or other sign . "
" I must emphasize that this is a criminal investigation , not an elections process controlled by applicable Arizona election laws , " Conrad wrote , noting that observation would be permitted via streaming Internet cameras .
However , as The BRAD BLOG reported last week as the examination of ballots began , Conrad 's promised " Eight cameras ... stream[ing ] live video of the examination proceedings to the internet , " amounts to only two cameras in the actual counting room ( the others are in different areas of the facility entirely ) , and both of those are far enough away that it 's impossible to oversee the accurate counting of ballots via the Internet .
Nonetheless , despite the severe restrictions on observers , members of the Democratic and Libertarian parties , tracking the progress of the ballot counting through a glass window at the counting facility , have " roughly estimated " that anywhere from 10 to 19 thousand --- out of 120,821 ballots supposedly cast in the election --- are currently nowhere to be found .
Representatives of the Republican party told us that they had similar concerns about missing ballots , though they declined to go on record with specifics .
A ' Duty to Find Out '
" We do n't know the answer , " as to where those ballots may be , or why they may be missing , if they are indeed missing , Risner explained in his letter to the AG on Monday , " but it is our political party 's duty to find out . "
Risner explained that the AG " has in its possession 105 boxes from the RTA [ election ] that include all of the ballots from that election as well as additional records such as the poll tapes " printed out by the precinct - based Diebold optical ballot scanners before polls opened and after they closed on Election Night .
Theoretically , those tapes should show zero votes on the optical - scan tabulators at the beginning of the day , and the unofficial scanned results for each precinct , as printed after the polls closed at 8 pm .
19 boxes , says Risner , contain additional records from the election , leaving 86 boxes of RTA ballots in total .
31 of the boxes contain the vote - by - mail " early ballots " ( absentee ballots ) .
" On average those boxes should contain 1,152 ballots per box , " according to the Democratic Party Attorney .
" Your office should have the precise count for each box , as our number is simply an arithmetic average .
Our experience and visual observation suggests that the 31 boxes were fully packed for storage . "
That leaves a " problem " , Risner contents , in that the 55 remaining boxes are unlikely " to contain an average of 1,547 ballots per box to arrive at the total of 85,100 ballots reportedly cast at the various voting areas .
The boxes simply cannot hold that many ballots , as your office must know , " writes Risner .
120,821 ballots , in total , were reportedly cast in the election , according to the Pima County Elections Office results .
A check of the Pima County Recorders database of registered voters , made by a Libertarian Party observer on Tuesday night , indicates 120,499 voters voted in the election .
While that number is slightly smaller than the number of votes reported in the official results , it falls far short of the " thousands " of ballots believed to be possibly missing from ballots seized by the AG in February .
Why Would Ballots Be Missing ?
The BRAD BLOG has spoken to observers , from at least three different parties , who have been on the ground in Phoenix since the counting began last week , including the Democratic Party 's John Brakey , a longtime election integrity advocate from AuditAZ , one of the coalition leaders in trying to determine if the RTA election results were recorded and reported accurately .
" Ya know , I voted for the RTA because my party endorsed it , " Brakey told us earlier this week after the concern about " missing " ballots began to come to light .
" I voted for it .
So that 's one vote I know for sure the RTA got ! , " he added with a laugh .
" But I want to know , for certain , that it actually passed , or if it did n't . "
Both Brakey and the Libertarian Jim March , who has also been observing the count through glass windows at the counting facility , have confidence in their admittedly extrapolated numbers as gleaned over the past week .
" We made individual , specific counts of ballots going into several boxes .
We got absolutely , definitely accurate counts of those boxes on high - definition video tape .
We saw them going into uniform boxes , " March told us on Tuesday night .
" We could easily be off 20 , 30 , 40 or 50 " per box , " but not by 200 or more . "
" If the AG 's office claims that they have all 120,000 plus ballots accounted for , we are going to be able to prove with photograph evidence and video - taped evidence , that there are , in fact , over ten thousand missing ballots .
I believe that observers from the Democratic , Republican and Libertarian parties will all agree on this . "
Over the last several days , we 've been working through a lot of the numbers , background details , and possibilities as to what may be going on , with Brakey and others , in determining why the ballots , if they are missing , might be missing in the first place .
So why would any ballots be missing ?
Brakey says , " We do n't yet know .
It may be incompetence " leading to ballots simply getting " lost " somewhere along the way in the nearly three years since the election .
Or , he says , " it may be that some of those ballots never existed .
Maybe they stuffed the ballot box electronically .
You can hack Diebold [ 's central tabulator databases ] by using ' edit , find & replace ' , we know that .
So we do n't know what 's going on , and that 's what we 're trying to find out . "
The secure chain of custody , at various times over those three years since the election , has been in question , including since February 24th of this year when Goddard 's office suddenly , and secretly , " hauled the boxes away " according to an email we reviewed from an attorney for the Pima County Treasurer 's Office .
The Treasurer , Beth Ford , had was in charge of custody of the ballots for a number of years , up until they were taken away 7 weeks ago by the AG .
The ballots had been stored in an Iron Mountain facility in Tucson until they were " hauled ...away " , and then they re-appeared at the Maricopa counting facility for examination in the criminal investigation last Monday .
" The paper ballots were originally stored at the Pima elections office , then were transported [ about six weeks later ] to the Iron Mountain private document storage facility , back to Pima elections as part of litigation over access to other documents in the same boxes , then back to Iron Mountain , then were grabbed by the AZ AG 's office and taken to points unknown with no oversight , and then under some circumstance we do n't have details on , [ went ] to the Maricopa elections office for counting , " March , an election watchdog and founding board member of BlackBoxVoting.org explained recently .
" There are ( or have been ) opportunities for tampering at several points along the line . "
A successful lawsuit brought by Risner and the Democratic Party led to the release of the Diebold tabulator databases from the '06 RTA election in May of 2008 .
Those databases , the plaintiffs in the suit have charged , show signs of potential fraud , as well as evidence that the results of the " early ballots " were printed out several times before Election Day , which would have been in violation of the state election code .
Brakey contends that years of public records requests , and detailed review of reams of materials from the disputed election , also reveal that " at least 93 " optical - scan memory cards , containing precinct results from the election , were " reloaded at least twice " into the Diebold central tabulators by officials following the election , for some unknown reason .
By contrast , in the much bigger 2004 general election in November , no more than 3 cards were reloaded by Pima County election officials , he says .
The Diebold memory cards , used in all of their voting systems , have been found in several scientific studies to be exceedingly vulnerable to tampering , as first revealed in the climactic final scene of HBO 's Emmy - nominated documenary film , Hacking Democracy .
( You can watch the scene , and the live hack of the Diebold op - scan tabulator , via a memory card , right here . )
Additionally , Brakey added to the growing mystery : " On Election Night they reported that 38 machines broke in the field .
I learned via email that it was 75 .
But looking at the database , it tells us that it could be as many as 149 . "
That 's a lot of broken machines .
If they broke down , they may not have been able to produce either early morning " zero test " , results showing the cards had no votes on them when the polls were opened , or end of the day election result poll tapes .
Those still - unexamined poll tapes could offer quite a bit of additional information , but they 've been sealed in the ballot boxes until now , and over the past week , examiners at the Maricopa facility have carefully re-sealed them into ballot boxes after removing ballots for counting .
The BRAD BLOG has learned from an AG spokesperson , however , that those poll tapes will also be counted as part of the criminal investigation .
The information came as news to representatives of the Democratic , Libertarian and Republican parties , when we shared it with them on Tuesday night ...
' A Wild Story '
So what happened ?
Why all the reloaded cards , broken machines --- even a whistleblower affidavit alleging that one official admitted he " fixed " the election " on the instructions of his bosses " --- and now potentially " thousands " of " missing " ballots from the criminal investigation hand - count ?
Attorney Bill Risner had just notified the Attorney General , earlier this year , of his hopes to review the precinct poll tapes which , the Democrats believed , might offer clues as to whether the precinct results actuallymatched up with the final reported results .
" We have been requesting the cooperation of your office concerning public records that are in the same boxes as the RTA ballots , " Risner wrote to the AG on Monday .
" Your office 's refusal to cooperate on that simple matter not only causes us specific harm , but frustrates our party 's ability to carry out its oversight role . "
Just ten days before Goddard " hauled ...away " the ballots from the Tucson Iron Mountain facility , he had indicated to the Arizona Daily Star that it would be unlikely he'd be counting RTA ballots , despite the years of clamoring for such a count to answer the questions about the election once and for all .
" If they can bring us viable information we would continue to investigate it .
They have n't .
They 've brought us what I can only describe as a wild story , " Goddard told the Star .
We do n't do " curiosity recounts , " he 's quoted as saying .
" There is simply nothing there that says , well , if you had a bad feeling about it and everybody agrees you can take them out and count them again .
You simply can't open those boxes under the law that we have and take a look . "
Yet , ten days later Goddard , would take the ballots from Tucson up to Phoenix , under cover of secrecy , and a few days later he was forced to admit a hand - count examination was set to begin on April 6th , last Monday .
Goddard 's spokesperson
Ann Hilby told The BRAD BLOG on Tuesday afternoon that information brought to the AG 's office by Risner , in July of 2008 , led them to re-open their criminal investigation .
Specifically , she pointed to the affidavit filed last summer alleging that a Pima County election official claimed to have " fixed " the results of the 2006 RTA election
But , as to what may have changed Goddard 's disbelief in that " wild story " on February 10 , as he described it in the Arizona Daily Star , to the time he " hauled ...away " the ballots on February 24 remains unclear .
Hilby would neither confirm nor deny that there was any actual change in Goddard 's position , noting several times in our interview that " part of the protocol we established is that we will not be commenting until the count is finished . "
' We Want an Honest Count Whether We Win or Lose '
Risner believes Goddard 's surprise action at the end of February may have been related to the Democrats ' pending lawsuit to allow them to review the poll tapes from the election .
Action was being taken on that suit just prior to the seizure of the ballots .
The tapes were stored inside the then - secured boxes of ballots at the Iron Mountain facility in Tucson .
Perhaps Goddard , the state 's highest elected Democratic official --- widely believed to be seeking the nomination for Governor in 2010 --- has a reason to either expose or protect the results from the election , as the controversial measures were endorsed by his party .
Risner wrote in his Monday letter to Goddard : " For us to do our job , we need to see the poll tapes and yellow sheets and other public record election documents .
Those same documents would seem to be useful to your office .
Our observer has informed us , however , that your office does not examine those documents [ during the examination over the past week ] , does not record any information from them , and does not make copies of them .
Instead , you place those important records back into boxes that you then securely seal , where they remain unseen and unrecorded . "
The Democratic attorney goes on to suggest those documents should , instead , be inspected and copied , as " They contain information that would be useful to your office , just as they are useful to our political party . "
" We 're the biggest political party in Tucson .
We 're not just ' some guys on the street ! ' " , Risner told us with a laugh this evening by telephone .
" It 's astonishing to me to have a lawsuit concerning the poll tapes and then to see them not look at the poll tapes " during the hand - count in Phoenix .
As Risner contends --- and observers from the Democratic , Republican and Libertarian Parties have all confirmed to us --- the Maricopa counting officials " go through a detailed procedure to seal back up the poll tapes in the ballot boxes , " after they remove the ballots from them .
They have not been examining them .
But the AG 's spokesperson told us , point blank , when we asked her directly on Tuesday if they would be examining those poll tapes : " Do we plan to examine those ?
Yes , we 're examining all of the evidence seized , including the poll tapes . "
All three of the parties expressed surprise at Hilby 's comment .
Risner , while still " suspicious " , was happy to hear that news .
" If the heat is on , and they agree to examine them , that 's good , " he told The BRAD BLOG .
" All we really know is [ Pima ] county went to an extraordinary length to keep us from examining the ballots .
And that the AG 's office has gone to extraordinary measures to work with the suspects [ the Pima County election officials ] , and to keep us from seeing the evidence , such as the poll tapes . "
" It 's amazing that they 've been going to these lengths , " he said , " at least up until now . "
Hilby , however , would not confirm who " the suspects " were .
" We have n't commented publicly on who may or may not be the suspects , other than the fact that we 're investigating potential fraud associated with the RTA election of 2006 .
We have worked to respond to Mr. Risner 's concerns , including when he brought additional evidence to light in July 2008 , when we reopened the investigation . "
She did say her office would be " commenting on the status of the ballots , once that examination is concluded . "
Though she " anticipates the count will conclude tomorrow [ Wednesday ] " , she did n't know when her office would be commenting on the actual results .
She also said they would be releasing " specifics of totals from the count " due to " great public interest --- particular in the Tucson area --- as soon as we can make that information public without jeopardizing the investigation . "
" I understand that it is frustrating , " Hilby added , " when there is public interest in a matter , to not be able to provide the details as soon as it may be done --- as people may be used to --- in a normal election recount . "
But , she says , this is a criminal investigation , an extraordinary one and " not a normal election recount . "
Near the end of Risner 's Monday letter to the AG , he promised to " remain available to assist your office in any way in your investigation , " and noted , in no uncertain terms :
" We have repeatedly tried to make two points clear to the Attorney General 's Office .
The first point is that the Democratic Party endorsed and supported the RTA .
The second point is that our interest in election integrity lies at the heart of the democratic process .
This is what we do .
We participate in all elections and we want an honest count whether we win or lose . "
Whether anybody will ever be able to get " an honest count " --- if thousands of ballots prove , in fact , to be missing --- is still anybody 's guess .

For those curious , these are the general results breakdowns from the officially reported final results of the 2006 RTA special election .
Question 1 sought to create the RTA , Question 2 sought a tax hike for Pima residents , in order to fund $ 2 billion dollars in bods to pay for the RTA .
Question 1
YES : 60.05 | NO : 39.95 %
YES : 71,948 | NO : 47,870
( Precinct results ) - YES : 49,491 | NO : 34,754
( Early vote - by - mail , provisional results ) - YES : 21,310 | NO : 12,473 Question 2
YES : 57.64 % | NO : 42.36 %
YES : 68,773 | NO : 50,551

CORRECTION :
The original version of the article defined the RTA as the " Rapid Transit Authority " instead of the " Regional Transportation Authority " .
We regret the error and have corrected it in the story above .
LOS ANGELES , April 15 ( Reuters ) - United Airlines , a unit of UAL Corp UAUA.O , will require obese passengers bumped from full flights to purchase two seats on a subsequent flight , matching the policy of some other carriers .
The change brings the Chicago - based in line with eight other airlines including Continental , Delta , JetBlue and Southwest , United spokeswoman Robin Urbanski said on Wednesday .
“ Last year we had 700 complaints from passengers who had to share their seats , ” she said .
Under the new policy , obese passengers -- defined as unable to lower the arm rest and buckle a seat belt with one extension belt -- will still be reaccommodated , at no extra charge , to two empty seats if there is space available .
If , however , the airplane is full , they will be bumped from the flight and may have to purchase a second ticket , at the same price as the original fare , Urbanski said .
If the bumped passenger chooses to cancel the trip , the ticket will be refunded with no additional charge .
The policy is effective immediately .

Apple has been ordered to pay $ 19 million to Opti Inc. , a technology company based up the road in Palo Alto , for patent infringement .
The verdict came out of Patent Lawsuit Valley ( also known as the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in Marshall ) late Thursday , where a jury found that Apple had " willfully " infringed on Opti 's patent for " Predictive snooping . "
The patent — its full name is " Predictive snooping of cache memory for master - initiated accesses " — describes a method to more efficiently transfer data among the CPU , memory , and " other devices . "
The patent was issued to Opti in June of 2002 , and the company filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Apple in January of 2007 ( which we briefly mentioned in a Friday Apple links post that week ) .
Apple had acknowledged that it used similar technology , but argued unsuccessfully that the patent should be declared invalid due to prior art and obviousness .
Much to Apple 's dismay , the jury did n't buy it .
They ended up rejecting Apple 's claims and found the company guilty of willful patent infringement , awarding Opti $ 19,009,728 as a " reasonable royalty for infringement . "
We sincerely hope some lawyer uses that extra $ 8 to buy a nice coffee or something .
With close close to $ 30 billion in the bank , $ 19 million is n't likely to hurt Apple very much in the overall picture .
However , cases like this remind us of why Apple seems to be a popular target for patent infringement suits .
It 's a large , well - loved company that has tons of cash .
If it 's not careful with those patent searches when developing new technology , the company could continue to find itself shelling out — or being forced to change its products .

Many beginning gardeners trying to build an organic garden are often discouraged by the cost and availability of organic fertilizers .
Making your own organic fertilizer by composting yard waste and food scraps in your backyard is an excellent way to get inexpensive organic fertilizer for your garden .
Backyard composting is easy to do and anyone with some available space can do it .
Why Compost for Fertilizer ?
If you have decided to go organic in your garden , especially if you are growing vegetables for your own family ’s consumption , you are already aware of the dangers of using chemicals in your garden .
Composting is one way you can make your own fertilizer that is organic and chemical free .
But it provides many other benefits that are hard to get from commercial inorganic products and can also save a lot of money in the long run .
Improves soil structure : Compost used as mulch or mixed in with soil as an amendment adds structure ( for sandy soil ) and porosity ( for clay ) to the soil that helps soil to retain moisture longer .
The micro-organisms in the compost are invaluable to the plants as they continue to work to release nitrogen and other valuable nutrients that the plants need .
Recycle waste and reduce landfills : Recycling kitchen organic scraps and yard waste back into your garden via compost can drastically cut down on the trash that needs to be sent to the landfills .
If you pay for your trash to be picked up , the savings will be immediate .
Even if you do n’t , consider this as one of the greenest action you can take to help the environment out .
Not only you are avoiding chemicals that may leech into ground water , you are also directly helping avoid more greenhouse gas production by cutting down on the waste that goes into landfills ( landfills produce methane ) .
Chemical fertilizers also use petroleum or natural gas or other fossil fuels in their production ( and transportation ) which can be avoided .
Easy to do : Composting is a natural process and requires very little effort from us .
Consider this , the lush vegetation in natural forests and tropical forests is the result of nature ’s own composting process whereby the fallen leaves and other organic debris on the forest floor is broken down and composted over time with no intervention from humans .
Actively managing the composting process can help the process go faster .
If left alone , a compost pile will eventually decompose and become compost .
Any once living organic matter can be composted .
No special ingredients are required , although composting vegetable and plant scraps and waste only is advised for a home composter ( dairy , meat and fat scraps may attract pests and home composting may not be intense enough to kill off all the harmful germs that I am sure we do not want going into our gardens )
How to Compost ?
Composting occurs naturally with microbes in the mix actively working to breakdown the organic matter .
There are four basic ingredients needed for compost : Carbon ( browns ) , Nitrogen ( greens ) , Air and Water .
Greens , including grass clippings , kitchen vegetable scrap , coffee / tea grounds , horse / cow manure ( herbivorous animal manure to avoid harmful germs from passing on ) etc are high in nitrogen .
Some sites advise throwing in a handful of urea to supply the needed nitrogen to kick start the composting process , but it is not necessary .
When I mow my lawn , I normally leave the clippings on the grass to be recycled back into the soil but have been spiriting away a bag of clippings every mow to put it in the compost pile .
You can also add weeds from your garden to the mix but take care to avoid any weeds that have gone to seed as these may comeback to your garden with seeds intact .
Carbon forms the fuel for the bacteria to feed on and can be supplied by dry leaves ( when you rack up the leaves in the fall , be sure to save them for use in the compost pile ) , dry wood trimmings , shredded newspaper ( avoid the colored parts ) , shredded cardboard , saw dust , straw , etc .
Make sure that the pile is moist ( not wet ) and is regularly turned or fluffed up to supply oxygen to all parts of the pile .
Composting process can be speed up considerably by using ingredients that provide Carbon to Nitrogen ratio ( C:N ratio ) of about 30:1 .
At this ratio , the compost pile create the optimum conditions for the microbes to grow and multiply .
Although this ratio is ideal , good compost can be had at any ratio close enough to 30:1 and frankly , in practice , the ideal conditions are difficult to achieve for a home composter who is most likely going to indulge in ‘ add as you go ’ composting .
A good article explaining the C:N ratio is at Home Composting Made Easy website .
When the conditions are ideal , the compost pile will heat up with internal temperatures reaching 140 F/60 C .
You can further aid this process by keeping the pile moist and aerating it frequently by turning or fluffing it up .
At ideal mix , very little nitrogen is lost to the atmosphere in form of ammonia therefore it will not smell .
In fact , if your pile starts smelling , it is an indication that you have too much green and need to add more browns to the mix .
Adding two parts green material to 1 part packed brown material ( shredded and packed with little fluff for measurement ) by volume will get very close to the ideal C:N ratio .
Although since different ingredients vary in their C:N composition , your ideal mix of greens and browns will only become apparent after a bit of experimentation .
Be sure to throw in a shovelful of garden soil or compost from the previous batch into the new compost pile to supply hungry microbes ready to work on your new pile .
How to build a compost bin ?
There are many commercial bins available for backyard composting and can be bought from garden stores or Costco .
Commercial bins come in many shapes and sizes .
I prefer the tumbler bins that can be turned frequently as this avoids having to take the pile out to turn it .
For those on a budget , a large garbage can can be converted into a compost bin .
If you have a large backyard and do not need to worry about neighbors complaining , you can build an uncovered compost bin .
Just fence off a 3 ft x 3 ft or larger area using old shipping pallets or chicken wire and start dumping compost material into it .
An ideal size of a compost pile is 1 cubic yard or larger .
Open piles need to be protected against heavy rains and wind .
Do not be alarmed if you see steam coming out of your pile when it gets too hot .

Mid-April , the four founders of The Pirate Bay were found guilty of being accessories to breaching copyright law ; they aided in breaching copyright of 33 files .
As a result , they were sentenced to one year in jail and a 2.75 million EUR fine .
However , it was quickly revealed that the judge in the case was heavily biased , and ever since then there ’s been a search for a judge who is actually not involved with any pro-copyright groups or with the lawyers working for the entertainment industry in this case .
Turns out that ’s actually kind of hard .
The original judge during the case turned out to be a member of several pro-copyright groups .
To make matters worse , the lawyers working for the entertainment industry in this case were members of the same groups , which obviously meant that the judge was simply not a good fit for the case .
So , the search began for a new judge , one without any affiliations , to investigate the conflict - of - interest .
Well , this turns out to be a bit more difficult than anticipated .
Judge Ulrika Ihrfeldt was appointed by Court President Fredrik WersÃ¤ll to investigate the conflict - of - interest , but Ihrfeldt herself soon revealed that she has also been a member of the Swedish Copyright Association , making her unfit to preside over this case .
Judge Anders Eka was then moved forward , but Eka , too , is connected to the lawyers working for the entertainment industry .
Eka is part of the Stockholm Center for Commercial Law , and who are also affiliated with this research centre ?
Exactly , Monique Wadsted and Peter Danowsky , lawyers who represent the entertainment industry in this court case .
Eka says he has no background in copyright law , and that he is not friends with the two lawyers , but he does acknowledge that an investigation into possible bias on his end should be undertaken .
So , investigate a judge for bias who is investigating a judge for bias .
If you ever need proof that the entertainment industry is a good lobbyist , here you have it .
If the original judge is to be found biased , the trial will have to be redone .
UNDER THE MICROSCOPE :ONE THIRD of global agricultural production depends on pollination by the European honeybee , Apis mellifera .
Unfortunately , a mysterious ailment called colony collapse disorder ( CCD ) has recently afflicted bees worldwide , putting nearly 100 crops that require pollination at risk .
Research points to a complex disease in which a combination of factors make the bees vulnerable to viruses .
The situation is described by Diana Cox -Foster and Dennis vanEngelsdorp in Scientific American ( April 2009 ) .
A flowering plant grows from a seed .
Pollination must occur at the flower , producing a fruit with seeds .
Dispersal of the seeds completes the cycle of plant reproduction .
About 250,000 species of flowering plant require pollination .
Pollination is the process whereby the male germ cell , borne in pollen , is transferred to the female sex organ .
Many plants produce pollen that is heavy and sticky and does n’t blow easily from flower to flower .
These plants require agents such as insects to move the pollen .
The honeybee is particularly well adapted for unconsciously picking up and moving pollen when feeding on flower nectar .
Some of the crops that require pollination by honeybees include alfalfa , clover , apple , avocado , strawberry , cherry , peach , pear , almond , macadamia , cotton , sunflower , broccoli , cauliflower , carrot , onion , squash and watermelon .
Commercial beekeepers move beehives from field to field to pollinate crops .
The annual value of bees ’ work worldwide is $ 215 billion .
CCD came to prominence in 2006 .
Typically a honeybee colony suffering from CCD loses large numbers of its worker bees , leaving only the queen and the young workers .
The dead bees are not found in the hives .
Alternatively the colony may be wiped out completely .
A US survey in spring 2007 revealed that more than 30 per cent of all colonies had died .
The die - off resumed the following winter and also occurred in Europe , Australia , Brazil , China and Canada .
This is not the first time that the honeybee has suffered problems .
Between 1987 and 2006 the number of managed bee colonies dropped by 45 per cent worldwide due to an onslaught by the varroa mite parasite .
CCD colonies have been examined in detail and it is confirmed that the varroa mite is not present in sufficient numbers to explain the sudden die - off .
Rather , the bees suffer from a variety of ailments , including many viral infections of known type , but no single pathogen explains the scale of the problem .
The researchers hypothesised that something is compromising the bees ’ immune systems , making them susceptible to many infections they would normally be able to resist .
Many suggestions were proposed as to what is weakening the bees .
Radiation from mobile phones was suggested , but there is no evidence .
Poisoning by pollen from GM crops was suggested , but this will not stand up because the particular insecticidal toxin produced by these crops is not activated in the honeybee gut .
Synthetic poisons used by beekeepers to control mites and new pesticides are more credible candidates for weakening the bees .
A new class of pesticide , the neonicotinoids , were blamed by French beekeepers for harming insect pollinators .
Research has shown that neonicotinoids interfere with the honeybee ’s memory of how to return home to the hive .
The researchers also postulated that poor nutrition might be weakening bees .
In a completely natural environment , bees will feed on a wide variety of flowers and are consequently very unlikely to miss out on any essential nutrient .
However , bee colonies now feed on huge acreages of a single crop , which might be deficient in important nutrients .
Nutritionally rich , weedy , flower - filled borders and hedgerows have also been eliminated .
Beekeepers attempt to make up for these deficiencies by feeding protein supplements to the bees , but CCD still develops .
Intensive investigation of the CCD problem has failed to identify any particular chemical root cause of the problem .
Initial tests failed to identify any new infectious disease that would explain the problem , but , eventually , one virus stood out – the Israeli acute paralysis virus ( IAPV ) .
IAPV was found in almost all colonies suffering from CCD .
Cox -Foster exposed healthy honeybees , with no previous exposure to the virus , to IAPV .
The infected bees began to die within two weeks .
They did n’t die near the hives , which is characteristic of CCD .
However , not all colonies infected with IAPV develop CCD , so , either IAPV alone cannot cause the disease or some bees are IAPV - resistant .
The growing consensus is that multiple factors , such as new pesticides and poor nutrition , combine to weaken colonies , making them susceptible to virus - induced collapse .
The long term solution to the problem is to identify and breed virus - resistant bees .
In the meantime , beekeepers are improving colonies ’ diets and keeping infections and parasites in check .
And , simple changes in agriculture such as breaking up big expanses of single crops with hedgerows could restore balance to honeybees ’ diets .
May 08 , 2009 News Corp. :
Bill Donohue , President of the Catholic League , on Fox News , discussing President Obama 's speech at Notre Dame :
To give him an honorary degree would be like Howard University giving David Duke a degree in racial politics .
Dave N. : Now this is one that will make your head spin , Linda - Blair like , right off your shoulders if you think about it too much :
Bill Donohue , the man who virulently defended Mel Gibson against charges of anti-Semitism for his The Jews Killed Jesus Movie ( accusing the ADL , one of Gibson 's critics , of " threatening to poison Jewish - Catholic relations " ) -- all this before that unfortunate DUI thing kind of put a dent in Donohue 's claim that " Mel Gibson represents the mainstream of America " -- while himself indulging in theories about the Jews controlling Hollywood ( on multiple occasions ) and who has made a career out of rhetorical thuggery against anyone who stands up to him ...
That guy is actually comparing the nation 's first African - American president to the country 's most notorious white supremacist , a man who recently did prison time for ripping off his donors to feed his gambling addiction , and more recently has been traveling to faraway places to spread the Jew - bashing white - supremacist gospel .
You can't make this s--t up .

Maybe the nerdiest comic I 've ever drawn .
Expect a few more updates in the next hour or two .
I WILL get back on schedule !
Now that they 've got round to seeing Angels & Demons , the pope 's people seem to have decided that it is , after all , harmless .
Perhaps they 'll now be apologising to director Ron Howard 's people for obstructing the shoot .
At the very least , let 's hope they 'll discourage conservative media watchdogs from calling Tom Hanks a " pawn of Satan " for starring in the sequel to The Da Vinci Code .
You can see why the Vatican might have decided to relent .
Unlike its Dan Brown predecessor , Angels & Demons does n't diss Jesus Christ , Mary Magdalene or Opus Dei .
Its handling of its most resonant rift , the conflict between religion and modernity , seems sympathetic to Catholicism , at least superficially .
The Vatican is portrayed as harbouring reaction and stupidity , but also compassion and insight , and it's the latter that are allowed to prevail .
All in all , Angels & Demons sometimes sounds like an act of penance for The Da Vinci Code that could have been scripted by the Catholic church 's PR department .
However , its visual impact belies its overt message .
Religion and science are formally declared to be reconcilable , but in cinematic terms they 're locked in glorious combat .
It 's science that emerges as the hands - down winner , and it achieves its victory by stealing religion 's clothes .
The mainspring of the action is derived from fact , not faith .
At Cern 's international laboratories on the outskirts of Geneva , antimatter is being created .
This miraculous material has the power to ordain doomsday .
The film 's villains steal an eighth of a gram of it , all they 'll need to bring apocalypse to the Vatican .
The cathedral in which Cern 's priesthood conduct their rituals puts St Peter 's in the shade .
It includes a cavern hundreds of feet underground that could enshrine the nave of Notre Dame .
From here , protons hurtle round a 17 - mile - diameter underground tunnel at the rate of 11,000 circuits a second .
The purpose of this secular sacrament is no less than to discover the truths of creation .
For its own exegesis of those truths , the church can point only to a book .
Hanks 's character shuffles impatiently through many a fusty tome in search of vital knowledge , but the Vatican 's soulless and deoxygenated library lacks the onscreen charisma of Cern 's Large Hadron Collider .
On the face of it , Rome , bedecked by some of history 's greatest creative figures , ought surely to outshine a suburban laboratory complex .
However , it 's Cern , with its uncompromisingly functional hardware , that turns out to cast the more imposing spell .
Set against its mysteriously purposeful conformations , the eternal city 's colonnades , statuary , vestments and chalices seem like kitsch adornments for a creed lacking enough lustre of its own .
Because the Vatican banned location filming , St Peter 's Square , complete with its 284 Doric columns and 140 statues of saints , was reconstructed on 20 acres of Hollywood parking lot .
Hundreds of costumes were handmade , red for cardinals , magenta for bishops and multicoloured for the Swiss Guard .
It 's all extremely convincing , but the institution being depicted still ends up looking tacky .
Its paraphernalia summon up thoughts of pantomime and Elton John , not the secrets of the universe with which Cern 's sober accoutrements seem rather more in touch .
When Catholicism first embraced spectacle and mystique , it was effectively the sole provider of mass entertainment .
In the face of the ascetic challenges of Protestantism , the Enlightenment and science , it chose to cling to showmanship .
Because of this , it 's found itself confronting rationalism with bells , smells and razzmatazz .
Now , Howard 's film - making implicitly suggests , the church is being outclassed in the cinematic terms through which it 's chosen to present itself .
As a result , it 's losing an image war with science .
This will do it no favours as it finds itself increasingly at odds with practices enabled by its rival .
If , as seems likely , Angels & Demons attracts a large worldwide audience , it seems bound to colour future perceptions of Catholicism .
This wo n't stop the world 's biggest religious institution from continuing to be seen as grand and colourful .
It may , however , leave it looking increasingly irrelevant – on the way to becoming more of a global theme park than the shaper of humanity 's destiny .
Pirate Bay defendant Peter Sunde Kolmissoppi is having a rough week .
As if the looming threat of a year in jail and a large fine were n't enough to give anyone a permanent case of " the Mondays , " Kolmisoppi had his bag stolen at a conference .
Luckily , he got it back .
" Money was still there , my PC was still there , " he tweeted .
" Things missing : Underwear and a tshirt .
Pervert thief ?
Fun ! "
Good thing the money came back , too , since Kolmisoppi and his merry band now find themselves the recipients of debt collection letters from the wonderfully named Kronofogdemyndigheten .
This government agency operates like a national cash collector , grabbing not just money owed the government , but also helping private citizens and businesses collect money owed to them .
Kronofogdemyndigheten now wants about half the total fine owed from The Pirate Bay trial , and it plans to freeze the bank accounts of the defendants until it gets paid .
Not that this worries the saucy pirates ; Kolmisoppi put his letter through the shredder as soon as he got it .
The Pirate Bay defendants have always claimed to have no money , with most of the dough TPB brings in being poured into website expenses and hardware upgrades .
The fourth defendant , crisp bread heir Carl Lundstr�m , may end up paying far more than his fair share , since the fine was applied jointly to all four defendants .
The attempt to collect the fine comes even as the case is being appealed and new questions have surfaced about the judge 's involvement with a pair of pro-copyright societies .
The issue of the judge 's possible bias has been big news in Sweden , where newspapers have verified ( English account ) that judge Tomas Norstr�m belongs to lobby groups that are explicitly pro-copyright and pro-rightsholder .
A higher Swedish court is currently considering whether the judge 's affiliations are grounds for a retrial — which , unlike an appeal , would restart the entire " spectrial " from the beginning .
The thought of going through so much weirdness again is almost too wonderfully horrible to contemplate , but one suspects that the thought of throwing the Swedish justice system into an uproar ( again ) is one that The Pirate Bay admins enjoy nearly as much as BitTorrent .

ARLINGTON , Texas ( AP )  Former President George W. Bush will throw out the ceremonial first pitch on opening day for the Texas Rangers .
Bush will become the third U.S. president to throw out the first pitch for a Rangers ' home opener when Texas plays the Cleveland Indians on April 6 .
Gerald Ford did the honors in 1976 , just four years after the Rangers left Washington , D.C. , for the Dallas - Fort Worth area .
Bush 's father , George H.W. Bush , threw out the first pitch in 1991 .
SPRING PREVIEW : Texas Rangers
Bush , who lives in Dallas , threw out the first pitch for the Rangers in 2000 when he was Texas governor .
Before he was elected governor , Bush was managing general partner of the Rangers from 1989 - 94 .

JAFFA , Israel , April 6 ( UPI ) --
An Israeli Army medic and his superior officer are facing charges they brutalized Palestinian detainees in the West Bank , prosecutors say .
Charges filed with the Jaffa Military Court allege the two , a staff sergeant serving as a medic and a lieutenant serving as a company commander , committed aggravated assault upon Palestinians detained for routine searches and questioning , Ynetnews.com reported .

Prosecutors say the incident occurred last September when , while on a military motorcade patrolling the West Bank , the medic struck a Palestinian who had been stopped for questioning with his helmet , kicked him in the abdomen and tore his shirt while the lieutenant -- his direct superior -- stood by and did nothing .
The indictment also alleges that the medic struck a second Palestinian and shoved a third to the ground , later pinning another detainee to a wall , choking and kicking him , Ynetnews reported .
The officer 's attorney , Shimon Cohen , reportedly demanded his client be released from jail and provided a statement by the soldiers ' brigade commander saying the case was hurting military morale .

With that in mind we present some of history 's greatest inventors who lived to see their inventions take on unexpected , terrifying lives of their own ...
Just like a parent , every inventor has to send their child out into the world .
Sometimes that child becomes a doctor or a movie star .
Other times that child ends up in a clock tower with a rifle ...
6 Orville Wright ( 1871 - 1948 )
Invented :
The airplane .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Lived to See :
One used to vaporize an entire city .
EUREKA !
You know the story of the Wright brothers .
December 17 , 1903 , Orville is the one inside the plane :
Orville had big dreams for the invention he and his brother became famous for .
Really big dreams .
He thought it would end warfare forever .
In 1915 , Orville ( his brother Wilbur had passed away by then ) predicted aerial reconnaissance would make war " ... too expensive , too slow , too difficult , too long drawn out " for anyone to keep doing it .
After the U.S. entered WWI , Orville confidently wrote that the nation with the most airborne scouts , " will win the war and put an end to war . "

Put an end to war !
Awesome !
Hey , how did that turn out ?
CRAP !
While Orville looked at the plane and dreamed of world peace , everybody else was thinking , " Wow , those people down on the ground look like tiny ants !
Ants I could totally crush from up here ! "
But still , he clung to the idea .
At the end of WWI , Orville wrote that " the aeroplane has made war so terrible that I do not believe any country will again care to start a war , " and five years later authored a radio broadcast declaring that " the aeroplane , in forcing upon governments a realization of the possibilities for destruction , has actually become a powerful instrument for peace . "

At that same moment , military engineers scratched their chins and said , " You know , we really have n't realized the possibilities for destruction in these things .
We 've packed as many bombs as it can carry ... can we make the bombs like , way deadlier ?
Would that work ? "
Orville Wright held to his optimism until passing in early 1948 .
Which means he lived long enough to see ...
... the dropping of the atomic bomb .
In 1945 , this invention that started out as a flimsy thing that could barely skim over the ground , dropped city - flattening bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
And that was the culmination of six years of devastating warfare in which city after city was shattered by aerial bombardment .

We have to say , though , it did nothing to dampen the man 's spirit .
In a typically on - the - bright - side letter to a friend shortly after the atomic bombings , Orville wrote , " I once thought the aeroplane would end wars .
I now wonder whether the aeroplane and the atomic bomb can do it . "
Which leads us to ask the obvious :
You mean one of his friends actually asked him what he thought about the atomic bombs ?
Geez , talk about a dick move .
On the bright side , Orville Wright did live to see Chuck Yeager 's breaking of the sound barrier , which had to have blown his fucking mind .
It was , simply put , the most stunning abdication since King Edward VIII in 1936 gave up the British throne for Wallis Simpson , the twice - divorced American socialite .
Only two weeks after being elected to serve his fourth term , Mayor J.W. Lown of San Angelo submitted his resignation letter Tuesday from an undisclosed location in Mexico .
No , being mayor of San Angelo is not exactly the same as being the King of the United Kingdom and Emperor of India , but the reason for Lown ’s abdication is the same as Edward’s .
Love .
What made it stunning was n’t the status of Lown ’s office , which pays $ 600 a year , but the status of his lover .
Lown fell for an illegal Mexican immigrant .
A man .
Lown told the San Angelo Standard - Times he had fallen for the man in March , after he had already filed for re-election .
The man came to the U.S. five years ago to study at Angelo State University .
It was unclear whether he had a student visa , but if he did it apparently had expired .
Lown told the Standard - Times he chose not to take the oath of office while “ aiding and assisting ” a person who was illegally in the country .
Lown had been an extraordinarily popular mayor .
Only 32 years old , he was elected in 2003 as the city ’s youngest mayor .
Serving in an office that inevitably requires decisions that accumulate enemies , he managed to get re-elected three times with increasing margins of victory each time .
Two weeks ago he defeated two challengers by garnering 89 percent of the vote .
Lown did not give the name of his lover , but said he planned to stay in Mexico to try to obtain a visa so that his partner can return with him if “ the people of San Angelo will welcome me back . ”
It could be a long wait .
According to former Houston city councilman Gordon Quan , an immigration lawyer , Lown ’s partner faces two problems in seeking a visa that would permit residency in the U.S .
One involves restrictions caused by his having been in the United States illegally .
If he had a student visa and overstayed it more than six months but less than a year , he is not eligible for a visa for three years .
If it was more than a year , he must wait 10 years , even for a tourist visa .
The other problem , said Quan , is that he would require a blood relative or a spouse to sponsor him .
And it would n’t matter if Lown went to Iowa and married his partner by proxy .
The federal government does n’t recognize same - sex marriages for immigration purposes .
King Edward , who became Prince Edward , lived the remainder of his life in exile .
Lown may face the same fate if he stays with his partner .
For some this will be a story of sinful deviance .
Some will sigh at the power of love .
As someone who has closely observed politicians for many years , what I see is the rare integrity of a politician who could n’t rationalize his way to swearing to uphold the laws of his state and nation while breaking them .
When it comes to sex , we ’ve seen the president of the United States lie under oath , the governor of New Jersey provide a high - level job for his unqualified secret gay lover , the governor of New York frequent a high - priced prostitute .
The mayor of San Angelo chose not only love , but also honesty .

AURORA , Colorado ( CNN ) --
Gun shops across the country are reporting a run on ammunition , a phenomenon apparently driven by fear that the Obama administration will increase taxes on bullets or enact new gun-control measures .
Ron Cardwell fires his 9 mm semiautomatic at a paper target at a range in Aurora , Colorado .
" In the last two months it 's gotten very , very difficult to find ammunition , " says Richard Taylor , manager of The Firing Line , a gun shop and shooting range in the Denver , Colorado , suburbs .
" There are a lot of rumors floating around that the present government would like to increase taxes on ammunition .
I think [ there is ] just a lot of panicked buying going on . "
While campaigning for the White House , Obama supported re-enacting the now - expired ban on assault weapons .
But there is no indication that the administration will take up that measure -- or any other gun-control initiative -- anytime soon .
Nonetheless , some gun owners are n't taking any chances .
Two weeks ago , The Firing Line was forced to impose a four - box - per- customer limit on ammo .
Before that , the shop was selling 10,000 rounds of 9 mm handgun ammunition a day .
Some calibers of ammunition have been unavailable for months .
" Currently no .380 ammunition -- I have n't seen any for about four months ... .38 special , it 's been at least a couple of months , " Taylor says .
" It 's just that there 's been a huge demand and it's far outweighed supply right now . "
Taylor says plenty of people are still coming to the range to shoot , but are gun owners hoarding ammo ?
" People are buying cases or whatever they can get their hands on and putting it away , absolutely , " he says .
" The only way that this shortage can have to do with it is that people are buying and hoarding . "
Karl Roos , a physician , stopped by the range to do some shooting with his Smith and Wesson .357 - caliber Magnum , using some rounds from his personal stock of ammo .
" I have yet to see .38 special or .357 Magnum ammunition on the shelf .
The stuff I 'm shooting I 've had for several years .
I just have n't seen it for the last several months , " says Roos , who adds he is always on the lookout for fresh sources of ammo .
" As I 'm doing the rounds of the local stores that carry ammunition , if I see something on the shelf I 'll buy it . "
" I 'm not too worried about things being banned or anything like that , " he says .
But he notes that many of his fellow gun enthusiasts are scared : " There 's definitely a lot of fear . "
Jim Minardi , a gun dealer in Lakewood , Colorado , says only a few people are actually hoarding .
But they are buying up so much ammo that there is n't much left on the shelves .
" The minority of our customers are stockpiling ammunition , " Minardi says .
" The majority are standard shooters buying what they can . "
Wal - Mart is one of the largest ammo dealers in the United States .
In an e-mail exchange , a Wal - Mart spokesman confirmed that ammo sales have been brisk .
" Some Wal - Mart stores have experienced an increase in demand for guns and ammo and for those locations , we are working closely with suppliers to replenish shelves , " says William C. Wertz , the discount chain 's divisional director for public affairs and government relations .
" In some situations where demand is high , so that we can better serve all customers , we will place a limit on the amount of a product that can be purchased . "
" It 's no different with ammo than other products ( toilet paper , batteries , etc. ) that may be in short supply for one reason or another . "
Each year U.S. ammo manufacturers make about 8 billion rounds , according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation , the trade association for the firearms and ammunition industry .
Current production data wo n't be in until late May , but the foundation expects the numbers to be way up .
" In order to keep up with demand for ammunition , manufacturers are working at full capacity , 24 - 7 , " says Ted Novin , an NSSF spokesman .
" Currently demand for ammunition is outpacing supply . "
Novin says he believes the reason is clear .
" The increase in demand for firearms and ammunition is largely attributable to gun owner concerns regarding the current political climate , " says Novin , referring to the Obama administration and the Democrat - controlled Congress .
" Many of the lawmakers in power have a long history of supporting legislation that violates the Second Amendment rights of law - abiding Americans , " Novin adds .
" Gun owners recognize this and are reacting accordingly . "
Ammunition manufacturers have been scrambling to keep up with demand .
A message from Steve Hornady , president of Hornady Ammunition , on the company 's Web site reads :
" Here at Hornady Manufacturing we are breaking our own production records in an attempt to keep up with customer demand .
We have added extra shifts , machinery and we are also in the process of expanding our manufacturing plant . "
Winchester Ammunition posted a similar statement :
" Winchester Ammunition , like other ammunition manufacturers , has seen the demand for our products increase significantly since last fall .
To meet that increased demand , our operations are running 24 hours a day , 7 days a week . "
Andrew Arulanandam , communications director of the National Rifle Association , says the " unprecedented ammo shortages are widespread , and they affect small and large retailers . "
" We have heard from members across the country in cities and in small towns from California to Maine , " Arulanandam says .
" There is a fear that Congress or the new administration will push for a firearm or an ammunition ban , or for a significant increase in excise taxes on firearms and ammunition .
We hear this from hunters , target shooters and even from first - time gun owners who fear that there will be an effort to incrementally curtail and eventually dismantle this freedom . "
Back at The Firing Line 's gun range , pilot Ron Cardwell is working on his target shooting with his 9 mm semiautomatic pistol .
He loves to shoot and hopes the ammo crisis ends soon .
" I have three or four boxes of 9 mm left at home and a couple of boxes of .45 , " he says .
" I 'm just buying as much as I can whenever I can . "

Most propositional knowledge ( knowledge of facts ) is pretty easy to come by ( at least in principle ) .
There is only one capital of Venezuela , and if you wish to learn the capital of Venezuela , Wikipedia will cooperatively inform you that it is Caracas .
For propositional knowledge that Wikipedia knoweth not , there is the scientific method .
Procedural knowledge - the knowledge of how to do something - is a different animal entirely .
This is true not only with regard to the question of whether Wikipedia will be helpful , but also in the brain architecture at work : anterograde amnesiacs can often pick up new procedural skills while remaining unable to learn new propositional information .
One complication in learning new procedures is that there are usually dozens , if not hundreds , of ways to do something .
Little details - the sorts of things that sink into the subconscious with practice but are crucial to know for a beginner - are frequently omitted in casual descriptions .
Often , it can be very difficult to break into a new procedurally - oriented field of knowledge because so much background information is required .
While there may be acknowledged masters of the procedure , it is rarely the case that their methods are ideal for every situation and potential user , because the success of a procedure depends on a vast array of circumstantial factors .
I propose below a general strategy for acquiring new procedural knowledge .
First , saturate by getting a diverse set of instructions from different sources .
Then , distill by identifying what all or most of them have in common .
Finally , improvise within the remaining search space to find something that works reliably for you and your circumstances .
The strategy is not fully general : I expect it would only work properly for procedures that are widely attempted and shared ; that you can afford to try multiple times ; that have at least partially independent steps so you can mix and match ; and that are in fields you have at least a passing familiarity with .
The sort of procedural knowledge that I seek with the most regularity is how to make new kinds of food , so I will illustrate my strategy with a description of how I used it to learn to make meringues .
If you find cookies a dreadfully boring subject of discourse , you may not wish to read the rest of this post .
I. Saturation
The first step is to collect procedural instructions for the object of your search from many different people , saturating your field of search with a variety of recommendations .
A Google search did it in my case ; for more esoteric knowledge , it might be necessary to look harder .
Half a dozen of the more popular sets of instructions tends to be plenty for recipes , but the ideal number could easily be higher for procedures with a wider variance of detail or an unusually high number of people who have no clue what they are talking about .
Here are four recipes for meringues that I referred to and one recipe for meringue pie topping that also informed my learning .
I also got one recipe from a friend .
All of the recipes purported to teach me to do the same thing : turn some eggwhites and sugar ( and varying other ingredients ) into puffy little cookies .
They varied in such details as : ingredient ratios , type of sugar , other ingredients called for besides eggwhites and sugar , oven temperature , what to line the cookie sheet with , and mentions of other factors such as having a clean mixing bowl or humid weather .
II .
Distillation
The second step is to extract what all of the procedures have in common , and decide which non-ubiquitous steps to include .
In this case , I first had to multiply all the recipes to make them call for the same number of eggwhites ( since those are very difficult to halve or otherwise adjust , I chose them instead of sugar as my starting point ) .
All five of the recipes ( after this revision ) called for four eggwhites ; all of the recipes call for either caster / superfine sugar or unspecified sugar1 ; all of them call for vanilla ; all of them instruct me to beat the eggwhites to peaks first and then add the sugar and beat it in .
Four of them call for salt .
Four of them call for cream of tartar .
Most of them call for components like candy and nuts , but since I know that meringues come in a wide variety of flavors ( by , for example , reading these recipes ) I treat these all as optional .
Proposed oven temperatures / baking times are ( 200/1.5 hours ) , ( 250/30 minutes ) , ( 300/25 minutes ) , and ( 325/15 minutes ) .
They vary in whether the cookies are to be baked on a greased cookie sheet , a greased and floured cookie sheet , on baking parchment , on paper towels , or on tinfoil .
A good place to start is to go with the majority : I decided to include both salt and cream of tartar .
Next , I eliminated the impractical : I could not find superfine sugar at the store and I do n't own a food processor , so I went with granulated sugar .
As for the rest of the instructions , it was a free - for - all .
No two recipes agreed about the cookie sheet arrangement ; the two of them that mentioned " cracking " disagreed on whether it was a desireable outcome ; and worst , none of them explained why every time I tried to make these cookies , they refused to foam up and form peaks2 .
Time for the last step .
III .
Improvisation
A close reading of the more verbose recipes turns up urgent cautions about not letting any grease into the batter , be it a smear from a prior cooking adventure left on the mixing bowl , a bit of yolk , or - in one recipe - the oils that are naturally on skin .
This last , it turned out , was the key : I was separating eggs by hand , and was not very neat about it .
I switched to a technique recommended by a friend involving spoons , and presto , I could get the meringue batter to hold peaks ...
But how long to cook them , at what temperature , and sitting on what ?
There , it was necessary to experiment ( fortunately , after having narrowed the search space somewhat ) .
This stage depended as much on my personal taste , the local weather , and the behavior of my oven as on the accuracy of the original recipes ; it seems that my oven runs hot , so I need to bake them at 250 degrees or cooler and babysit them after the first ten minutes , or they will burn .
Additionally , parchment paper and tinfoil3 wound up burning the bottoms of the cookies before the tops were even dry ; paper towels worked .
1 Caster and superfine sugar are the same thing , and you can make a reasonable facsimile using a food processor .
When the type of sugar is not specified in a recipe , it means to use granulated white sugar ; other kinds are named ( e.g. light or dark brown sugar , turbinado sugar , confectioner 's sugar , etc. ) .
This is one of the examples of a situation where background knowledge of the field comes in handy .
2 Not that this stopped me from baking the batter anyway .
It just turned into round , flat cookies instead of puffy , light ones .
3 I did n't get around to trying greased nor greased and floured bare cookie sheets - I prioritized these tests last because they involve more dishes to wash .
NEWPORT , Rhode Island – Yesterday , the Washington Times reported that Defense Secretary had nixed the use of one of the military 's most advanced radar systems to monitor North Korea 's recent missile launch - preventing " officials from collecting finely detailed launch data . "
Today , Robert Gates took issue with the report .
" It really ticked me off , " he told reporters at an informal gathering .
The article implied that Gates kept the radar back , to keep from " provoking the North Koreans . "
Gates responded that it was really just a matter of money .
Gates said his military advisors – including Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Michael Mullen and Vice Chairman General James Cartwright – had advised against using the Sea - Based X - Band Radar ( SBX ) .
The $ 900 million system has a powerful tracking and discrimination radar that can pinpoint tiny objects thousands of miles away .
But the SBX – sometimes referred to as the " giant golf ball " because of its bulbous , ten - story high radome – is also notoriously fragile .
In the weeks leading up to the North Korean launch , the SBX was undergoing repairs .
Hauling it up to Alaska , to track Pyongyang 's missile , would have cost " 50 to 100 million dollars , " according to Gates .
That did n't seem worth the cash , he added , when " all the intelligence – all the intelligence – said it was a satellite launch . "

NEW BEDFORD , Massachusetts ( CNN ) --
When you think scooter , you might think of something a child would ride .
Steve Shapiro rides his VX - 1 scooter on road in New Bedford , Massachusetts .
The Vectrix VX - 1 maxi scooter , which weighs much more than a typical bike at 515 pounds , is anything but a kid 's toy .
It requires a motorcycle license to drive .
It 's also electric , with a 180 - pound battery that lets the rider forget about pumping gas .
The Vectrix just needs an electrical outlet to get its fuel .
Steven Shapiro bought a scooter last year , when gas prices were surpassing $ 4 a gallon .
" I felt like I had an opportunity to sort of make a statement , just at the local level , " Shapiro said .
That statement came with a price , though .
His Vectrix VX - 1 was $ 8,000 .
" The cost of new technology is always higher than old technology , " explains Mike Boyle , Vectrix 's CEO .
" You may win [ people 's ] minds and hearts through the understanding of what an electric vehicle can bring to them .
You then have to win their pocketbooks as well . "
The Obama administration is helping do just that .
Earlier this year , President Obama 's stimulus plan proposed tax credits for those who buy plug - in electric vehicles .
Depending on the size of the battery , the credit can reach up to $ 7,500 .
Peter Hughes , Vectrix 's chief technology officer , said the scooter was designed to suit the needs of a commuting executive .
" Think about the lawyer ; think about the businessman , the banker , the engineer who does n't want to take his car into the city .
He has about a 20 - to 40 - mile round - trip commute . "
The scooter can go about 50 to 60 miles when fully charged and it can reach speeds up to about 60 mph .
It 's billed as the only electric scooter on the market that 's highway legal .
Watch the Vectrix and Tesla take to the roads »
" We classify this as a zero emissions vehicle .
...
When you 're riding it and driving it , it is zero [ greenhouse gas ] emission , " Hughes said of its environmental impact .
" But we do account for the fact that when you plug it in , that energy comes from somewhere .
You 're going to take four kilowatt hours to charge this vehicle .
The VX - 1 has a carbon footprint of 36 grams per kilometer .
Now equate that to a car , which is typically 10 times that . "
But it 's still a tough sell in the U.S. market .
" In America , I would say , No. 1 , we 're a four - wheel society .
We 're in love with the car , right ?
In Europe , out of necessity , everybody grows up on a two - wheel vehicle , " Hughes said .
The company has sold almost 2,000 bikes since 2007 .
Electric scooters are n't new to the market .
Several other companies , such as ZAP and e-max , sell models that are n't highway legal .
John Anthony , a bartender in Rhode Island , was the third person in the United States to buy a Vectrix .
He read about it when it was a still a prototype .
" I wrote a check , and I sent it to them .
Sight unseen , " he recalled .
The independence from gas intrigued him .
" I try to use less gas and oil than most people , " he said .
" I heat my home with a wood pellet stove and I heat my hot water with solar panels . "
Of course , going electric has its limitations .
" I did get stuck , " he said .
" It was right after I got it , and I said , ' I 'm not letting my neighbors see me push this home . '
It 's not like running out of gas in a car , where somebody can bring you a gas can .
You can't do that , so it 's something that you really have to be careful of . "
For those wary of changing their ways completely , the Tesla Roadster might offer a solution .
This sports car can travel up to 244 miles between charges .
But it also costs more than 10 times more than a Vectrix scooter .
" If you look at any new technology that enters the marketplace , for instance plasma TVs ... five years ago , it was a $ 10,000 luxury item .
Now I could walk into a store and pick up something higher quality for 10 percent of that , for a thousand bucks , " said Jeremy Snyder , Tesla Motors ' general manager .
According to Snyder , the company hopes to " change the preconceived notion of society that efficiency needs to be boring . "
A sedan model is planned for 2011 , and its base price is $ 49,900 .
There 's already a waiting list of more than 700 people , Snyder said .
A more affordable electric car may be available as soon as this year .
Th!nk city sells electric cars in Europe , and plans to sell U.S. models for under $ 25,000 .
While there is still a long way to go before gas stations become extinct , electric vehicle owners are always on the lookout for electrical outlets .
And Vectrix owner Shapiro has a few other ideas .
" I had a dream when I bought it , " Shapiro said .
" I was going to go across country and make a documentary about going every 40 to 50 miles , and then knocking on people 's door and saying , ' Do you mind if I sit on your couch for two hours while I plug in ? '
" And it 's still an idea I have in my head , " he said .
" Just waiting for a few offers from Hollywood . "

Refuted economic doctrines # 6 : Central bank independence
Here ’s the latest in my series on theoretical and policy doctrines in economics that have been refuted , or at least rendered highly problematic by the global financial crisis .
Mainly of technical interest , I think , but I ’m posting it here to keep numbering continuous .
The idea that central banks can and should act independently of governments is , fairly clearly , inoperative for the duration of the crisis in many countries .
The combination of massively increased liquidity provision and large - scale bank bailouts requires close co-ordination between central banks and national treasuries , though the form of this co-ordination is inevitably different in different countries .
But the failure of central bank independence goes much deeper than this .
The underlying idea was that monetary policy should be left to independent experts , and should be the main tool for macroeconomic stabilisation .
Governments were expected to avoid active fiscal policy , focusing primarily on maintaining budget balance ( there were some differences in view as to whether governments should target annual balance , or balance over the course of the macroeconomic cycle ) .
The shift to independent central banking was closely associated with the adoption ( implicit or explicit ) of inflation targets as the primary focus of monetary policy , and with interest rates as the primary tool .
Not much of this appears sustainable in the light of the crisis .
Inflation targeting failed to prevent unsustainable asset price booms , and it now seems clear that these could not have been prevented without much more direct control over unsound financial innovations .
That ’s a task where interaction between governments and central banks appears unavoidable .
On the one hand , expertise is crucial .
On the other hand , as with war , financial innovation is to important , and too dangerous , to be left to finance experts .
The idea that monetary policy alone is sufficient for macroeconomic stability might have looked appealing during the Great Moderation , but does not stand up when examined over a longer period .
To put it bluntly , central bank independence appears to work well except when it is most needed .
A more difficult question relates to the separation between monetary policy and prudential regulation .
The need to take systematic risk into account suggests that monetary policy must be closely integrated with prudential policy .
On the other hand , Australia , with a clear separation between monetary and prudential regulators has done better than countries where central banks are more closely involved .
My feeling is that the correct separation is between strategic issues , such as monitoring of systemic risk and the regulation of financial innovations , which belongs with the central bank , and institution - level supervision , which belongs with a specialist agency .
The versatile captain has been given an end - of - season award .
The PFA Fans ' Player of the Year for the 2008 - 09 campaign has been awarded to Liverpool 's driving force , Steven Gerrard The Reds captain has embarked on his most prolific season to date as manager Rafael Benitez has shifted him further up field to support silky Spanish striker Fernando Torres .
The tactical re-jig has born emphatic results , including a hat - trick against Aston Villa in the Premier League , and a brace versus Real Madrid in the Champions League .
Gerrard missed out on the PFA Players '
Player of the Year award , that was instead handed to Manchester United veteran Ryan Giggs .
The chief executive of the Professional Footballer 's Association , Gordon Taylor , is quoted by the club 's official website as saying , " Steven has always been a particular favourite of mine and I was delighted when he was nominated by his fellow pros for our Players ’
Player of the Year award .
" Obviously , that particular award went to Ryan Giggs , and rightly so , but I am equally thrilled that football fans up and down the country have acknowledged Steven in this way .
" Like his many supporters and suitors , I have the utmost respect and admiration for the way he continues to go about his business .
He is a top pro and a worthy winner , " he concluded .
This probably wo n’t go over well with the Virginia Tech cheerleading coach .
One of the team ’s freshman cheerleaders did a Playboy “ Girls of the ACC ” test shoot last week and her name made it onto a local NBC affliate ’s Web site which was then entered into a Google search .
The results of our search led us to finding out that Carly Hinchman is a Hokies cheerleader .
We smell drama !
Hinchman , an Atlanta native , smiled proudly as a Roanoke news station interviewed her and a friend about doing the test shoot for Playboy .
No , her parents did n’t know about this .
And we ’re guessing the same goes for the cheerleading coach .
From the NBC report :
Carly Hinchman and Maggie Cook , both freshmen , are friends and decided to try out together .
â€ œWhen weâ€ ™re older and itâ€™s 20 years from now , we can be like , remember when we tried out for Playboy ? â€ œ
Cook said .
Carly goes on to say that she will tell her parents if Playboy calls back .
We hate to break the news to you , but Playboy is calling back .
From what we can see from the Va .
Tech visit , there is no doubt
Hef ’s people would love to have a teenage college cheerleader posing in their magazine .
It would send shock waves through the industry ( blogosphere ) if Hef can pull off this one .
Carly ’s parents are in for a huge shock when they either get a phone call or do a Google search .

Logic programs by nature have a form of exceptions : fail .
Failure of a goal in a conjunction terminates further evaluation of the conjunction .
A disjunction plays the role of exception handling , catching the failure and invoking the second disjunct to `handle ' it .
Failure as a form of exceptions is not sufficient .
Unlike success ( which is accompanied by the current substitution , with the bindings for logic variables ) , failure carries no information and has no flavors .
Success comes in many forms ; failure is singular .
Often an informative failure and nuanced failure handling is desired .
One example is parsing , which was the first and still is the compelling application of logic programming .
The laconic NO as the parsing result is infuriatingly unhelpful , especially for large input .
The error ought to be described and pin-pointed .
Furthermore , some failures of parsing are provisional , indicating the need to try another parsing alternative .
Some other parsing errors ( e.g. , of lexing ) should be treated as definite and immediately reported to the user .
As another example , an undefined predicate ought to be treated differently from other failures , and handled not by initiating backtracking but by trying to locate the missing predicate ( e.g. , search for a predicate with a similar spelling ; attempt to load an external library ; etc ) .
For these reasons , Prolog systems from early on had an ad hoc exception handling .
ISO Prolog codified these practices , as catch / 3 and throw / 1 predicates .
Here is their specification ( quoted from the SWI Prolog documentation ) :
catch (: Goal , + Catcher , : Recover ) ``Behaves as call / 1 if no exception is raised when executing Goal .
If an exception is raised using throw / 1 while Goal executes , and the Goal is the innermost goal for which Catcher unifies with the argument of throw / 1 , all choice - points generated by Goal are cut , the system backtracks to the start of catch / 3 while preserving the thrown exception term and Recover is called as in call / 1 .
The overhead of calling a goal through catch / 3 is very comparable to call / 1 .
Recovery from an exception is much slower , especially if the exception - term is large due to the copying thereof . '' throw ( + Exception ) ``Raise an exception .
The system looks for the innermost catch / 3 ancestor for which Exception unifies with the Catcher argument of the catch / 3 call .
ISO demands throw / 1 | to make a copy of Exception , walk up the stack to a catch / 3 call , backtrack and try to unify the copy of Exception with Catcher .''
We stress the discarding of choice points after an exception is raised .
In the following example , the exception cuts the choice X=4 :
?- catch ( ( X=1 ; X=2 ; throw ( 3 ) ; X=4 ) , Z, true ) .
X = 1 ; X = 2 ; Z = 3 .
Kanren implements the catch / 3 and throw / 1 predicates with the ISO Prolog interface .
However , choice points are not discarded when the exception is raised .
Therefore , the exception term does not have to be copied , and exception recovery is cheap .
Here is the illustration .
( run #f ( q ) ( fresh ( y ) ( catch ( fresh ( x ) ( conde ( succeed ( == x 1 ) ) ( succeed ( == x 2 ) ) ( succeed ( == x 3 ) ( throw ` ( e1 5 ) ) ) ( succeed ( == x 4 ) ( throw `( e1 15 ) ) ) ( succeed ( == x 5 ) ) ) ( == q ` ( no - exc , x ) ) ) ` ( e1 , y ) ( == q `( caught 1 , y ) ) ) ) )
( ( no - exc 1 ) ( no-exc 2 ) ( caught 1 5 ) ( caught 1 15 ) ( no-exc 5 ) )
The two ways of handling exceptions in non-deterministic programs are clearest to explain in Haskell terms , as two different ways to compose a non-determinism monad transformer such as ListT with an exception monad transformer such as Either err .
( We use lists here only for the sake of example ; strictly speaking , ListT is not fully a monad transformer . )
Transforming an exception monad with ListT gives us the type Either err [ a ] .
This type expresses either a list of choices Right [ a ] for the values of type a , or a definite exception Left err .
This monad describes the ISO Prolog exception handling .
The alternative is to transform the list monad with Either err , obtaining the type [ Either err a ] that expresses the list of choices for successful computations Right a and exceptions Left err , or the mixture of the two .
Kanren implements a particular non-determinism monad LogicT .
Transforming it with Either err is straightforward .
Hansei , a domain - specific probabilistic programming language embedded in OCaml , may be regarded as a logic programming system .
Since OCaml has native exceptions , so does Hansei .
Unlike Kanren , Hansei implements non-determinism directly , using the library of delimited continuations .
Hansei supports both modes of exception handling , cutting choice points or preserving them .
The direct - style implementation makes the difference lucid , reducing it to the dynamic scoping of an exception handler try relative to a `non- determinism handler ' reify0 .
If try dynamically scopes over reify0 , choice points are cut off .
If an exception is caught and handled before it gets to reify0 , choice points are preserved .
( Different exceptions in Hansei may have different behavior with respect to choice points ) .
Here is an illustration .
open ProbM open Ptypes exception E of int let model ( ) = let i = geometric 0.4 in if i = 3 || i = 4 then raise ( E ( 100 + i ) ) else i (* val model : unit -> int = < fun > *)
The examples t1 and t2 below do the inference first .
Since the geometric distribution is infinite , over the entire domain of natural numbers , we have to limit the depth of the exact inference over this model ( see the first argument to reify_part ) .
Once the inference extends far enough to trigger the exception , the inference is aborted .
( The function reify_part is a composition of reify0 and the function to traverse the reified tree and collect the results .
We can insert exception handling into reify_part so to preserve the values collected before an exception is raised . )
type ( 'a , 'b ) either =
Left of ' a | Right of 'b ; ; let t1 = try Right ( reify_part ( Some 2 ) model ) with E x -> Left x (* Right [ ( 0.4 , 0 ) ; ( 0.24 , 1 ) ] *) let t2 = try Right ( reify_part ( Some 10 ) model ) with E x -> Left x (* Left 103 *)
The alternative is to catch exceptions before reifying a non-deterministic computation .
All choice points are preserved then .
let t3 = reify_part ( Some 10 ) ( fun ( ) -> try model ( ) with E x -> x ) (* val t3 : ( Ptypes.prob * int ) list = [ ( 0.4 , 0 ) ; ( 0.24 , 1 ) ; ( 0.144 , 2 ) ; ( 0.031 , 5 ) ; ( 0.019 , 6 ) ; ( 0.01 , 7 ) ; ( 0.007 , 8 ) ; ( 0.004 , 9 ) ; ( 0.086 , 103 ) ; ( 0.052 , 104 ) ] *)

Those Google " doodles " that sometimes adorn the search giant 's homepage with clever variations on the company logo might be cute , but take a closer look .
Critics charge that it 's possible to see in the sketches Google 's disdain for ( take your pick ) America , Muslims , Christians , Christmas , and creationism .
Take this week 's unveiling of the darwinius masillae fossil called Ida .
Our own science editor , John Timmer , calls the fossil 's big reveal a tremendous bit of hype not fully justified by the science , but some press accounts have talked Ida up as a key missing link in human evolution .
So when Google turned Ida into a doodle , it was only a matter of hours before backers of creationism charged the Big G with " going ape over the supposed discovery of a ' missing link ' in the evolution theory . "
And posters on message boards like Rapture Ready went much further .
" I am really tired of this stupid AC [ antichrist ? ] world ...
MY FATHER IS YHWH [ Yahweh ] ...
MY GOD AND MY SAVIOUR YESHUA [ Jesus ] and THE KADOSH RUACH [ the Holy Spirit ] .... they [ Google , not the Trinity ] worship satan ...
Sick stuff . "
Another poster said that " I almost threw my laptop it made me soooooooooo mad !
Made me wonder what the logo would look like after we 're taken outta here ! "
But the Satan worshippers over at Mountain View do n't just irritate creationists waiting to be raptured .
No , it turns out the doodles have a long history of angering people .
Back in 2006 , the National Review noted , " They [ Google ] change their homepage logo for all sorts of holidays and occasions .
Just last week they paid tribute to Arthur Conan Doyle 's birthday .
But Memorial Day does n't seem to rate anything at all . "
A totalitarian - loving doodle ?
When Google doodled the 50th anniversary of the Sputnik satellite launch in 2007 , the LA Times covered the Sputnik - sized controversy that followed .
" Not only did Google honor an achievement by a totalitarian regime that was our Cold War enemy , [ critics ] griped , but it did so without having ever altered its logo to commemorate US military personnel on Memorial Day or Veterans Day . "
If it 's not quite clear that Google does n't love America enough , a later quote from WorldNetDaily editor Joseph Farah made it plain .
" When they ignore Veterans Day and Memorial Day , I think they 're telling us something about the way they view America , " he told the paper .
And in 2008 , " America 's most controversial radio talk show host " took Google to task for " hating Christmas . "
" There ’s one holiday they steadfastly refuse to acknowledge — Christmas , " wrote James Edwards .
" Go through all [ the past logos ] and you ’ll see that Google has never once acknowledged Christmas , even though it ’s by far the most popular and important holiday to the people who made Google the overwhelmingly dominant search engine it is today . "
It 's not just Christians who have had problems with the doodles .
A Pakistani blogger complained last year that " Google never celebrated Happy Ramadan to the Muslim community around the world .
...
If Christmas , St. Patrick ’s day , St. George day and other days are so much important then I think Google should also celebrate Happy Ramadan or Eids , etc. ...
But Google never ever made a dedicated logo . "
No offense
The company has made it clear in the past that it chooses not to make doodles for religious holidays .
That 's why the " Christmas " doodles that the Pakistani blogger noted really are n't about " Christmas " ; they feature snowmen and icicles and " season 's greetings " messages .
A desire not to offend also appears to be behind the lack of " patriotic " doodles like those for Memorial Day and Veterans Day — though Google did start doing Veterans Day doodles in 2007 .
For a multinational , it 's always worth keeping in mind that martial holidays in victorious countries always mean that soldiers in some other state where you do business suffered and died — though that has n't stopped the company from doodling about Independence Day in the US .
Looking back though the doodles , we 're most impressed not with how controversial they are but with how far they 've come ( see two designs on the right ) .
Early drawings from 1999 look like something quite possibly thrown together by Larry or Sergey during a coffee break ; 2009 's images , by contrast , are real works of art .
They are also surprisingly eclectic .
What other company would celebrate Ren ?
Magritte 's birthday , Dr. Seuss , and the Large Hadron Collider ?
If these are Satanists , they 're Satanists with exquisite taste .
Tomas Norström , the judge who sentenced the Pirate Bay Four , was recently outed as a member of two copyright advocacy organizations , prompting rumblings about a mistrial .

Some Swedish attorneys believe that Norström 's membership of the Swedish Copyright Association and the Swedish Association for the Protection of Industrial Property ( where he is a board member ) represent a full - on conflict of interest , a charge that , naturally , he denies .
I wo n't pretend to know whether or not these accusations constitute full - on shenanigans ( legal term ! ) under Swedish law , but the fact that a juror on the case was dismissed for membership in the same organizations should raise a few eyebrows .

So , there 's a little conspiracy to mix in with your boiling indignation .
Enjoy !

Concept design of a mobile Virtual Cocoon
( PhysOrg.com ) --
The first virtual reality headset that can stimulate all five senses will be unveiled at a major science event in London on March 4th .
What was it really like to live in Ancient Egypt ?
What did the streets there actually look , sound and smell like ?
For decades , Virtual Reality has held out the hope that , one day , we might be able visit all kinds of places and periods as ' virtual ' tourists .
To date , though , Virtual Reality devices have not been able to stimulate simultaneously all five senses with a high degree of realism .
But with funding from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ( EPSRC ) , scientists from the Universities of York and Warwick believe they have been able to pinpoint the necessary expertise to make this possible , in a project called ' Towards Real Virtuality ' .
' Real Virtuality ' is a term coined by the project team to highlight their aim of providing a ' real ' experience in which all senses are stimulated in such a way that the user has a fully immersive perceptual experience , during which s/he cannot tell whether or not it is real .
Teams at York and Warwick now aim to link up with experts at the Universities of Bangor , Bradford and Brighton to develop the ' Virtual Cocoon ' - a new Real Virtuality device that can stimulate all five senses much more realistically than any other current or prospective device .
For the user the ' Virtual Cocoon ' will consist of a headset incorporating specially developed electronics and computing capabilities .
It could help unlock the full potential benefits of Real Virtuality in fields such as education , business and environmental protection .
A mock - up of the Virtual Cocoon will be on display at ' Pioneers 09 ' , an EPSRC showcase event to be held at London 's Olympia Conference Centre on Wednesday 4th March .
Professor David Howard of the University of York , lead scientist on the initiative , says : " Virtual Reality projects have typically only focused on one or two of the five senses - usually sight and hearing .
We 're not aware of any other research group anywhere else in the world doing what we plan to do .
" Smell will be generated electronically via a new technique being pioneered by Alan Chalmers and his team at Warwick which will deliver a pre-determined smell recipe on - demand .
Taste and smell are closely linked but we intend to provide a texture sensation relating to something being in the mouth .
Tactile devices will provide touch . "
A key objective will be to optimise the way all five senses interact , as in real life .
The team also aim to make the Virtual Cocoon much lighter , more comfortable and less expensive than existing devices , as a result of the improved computing and electronics they develop .
There has been considerable public debate on health & safety as well as on ethical issues surrounding Real Virtuality , since this kind of technology fundamentally involves immersing users in virtual environments that separate them from the real world .
Professor David Howard says : " In addition to the technical development of the Virtual Cocoon , we aim to closely evaluate the full , far - reaching economic and other implications of more widespread application of Real Virtuality technologies for society as a whole . "

Just moments ago , the California Supreme Court announced their decision to uphold Proposition 8's ban on same - sex marriage .
The court was split 6 - 1 on the constitutionality of Proposition 8 and were unanimous in allowing the validity for 18,000 gay couples who married before Prop 8 was passed .
Chief Justice Ronald M. George said that the November initiative was not an illegal constitutional revision , nor unconstitutional .
Only one judge , Justice Carlos R. Moreno , wanted to strike down Proposition 8 as an illegal constitutional revision .
Before last fall , California was one of only two states to allow same - sex marriage .
Since then , Iowa , Vermont , Connecticut and Maine have legalized it and bills are currently being considered in New Jersey , New Hampshire , and New York .
Wow , impressive California ... looks like bigotry prevailed again .
This IS 2009 , right ?
Or is it 1959 ?
I can't remember .
WASHINGTON --
The Obama administration is weighing plans to detain some terror suspects on U.S. soil -- indefinitely and without trial -- as part of a plan to retool military commission trials that were conducted for prisoners held in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
The proposal being floated with members of Congress is another indication of President Barack Obama 's struggles to establish his counter - terrorism policies , balancing security concerns against attempts to alter Bush - administration practices he has harshly criticized .
...
One hundred million years ago a termite was wounded and its abdomen split open .
The resin of a pine tree slowly enveloped its body and the contents of its gut .
In what is now the Hukawng Valley in Myanmar , the resin fossilized and was buried until it was chipped out of an amber mine .
The resin had seeped into the termite 's wound and preserved even the microscopic organisms in its gut .
These microbes are the forebears of the microbes that live in the guts of today 's termites and help them digest wood .
The fossil is the earliest example of a relationship between an animal and the microbes in its gut , a new study shows .
" The chances of finding a termite with its body open like this are rare , " said George Poinar , an amber expert at Oregon State University who led the research , published in the latest edition of the journal Parasites and Vectors .
The amber preserved the microbes with exquisite detail , including internal features like the nuclei .
" In some of these [ microbes ] you can actually see wood particles , " Poinar told LiveScience .
Wood is the termite 's diet , a fact that makes the insects the bane of homeowners and a boon to exterminators .
The insect could not digest the sugars in wood , called cellulose , without the aid of a separate kind of animal in its gut : several kinds of protozoa .
The termite chews off pieces of wood and swallows them in mouthfuls that the protozoa can break down .
Then the termite digests the leftovers .
Without the protozoa , the termite would starve .
Meanwhile , the protozoa would quickly die outside of the termite , resulting in a relationship of dependence between the animals that scientists call " mutualism . "
Since termites and their protozoa are separate animals , each new generation of termite must be united with its microscopic crew of wood digesters .
To do so , adult termites secrete a liquid from their anus that is laced with protozoa and newly hatched termites lap it up .
Termites are related to cockroaches and split from them in evolutionary time at about the same time the termite in the amber was trapped .
" Lo and behold the DNA evidence that came out said that basically all termites were cockroaches , " said Vernard Lewis , termite expert at the University of California at Berkeley , who was not involved in the amber study .
Roaches today also have gut microbes , and the common ancestors of both insects probably did , too , Lewis said .
Those in the termite gut give it a distinct advantage .
To describe it , Lewis pictures an ancient rainforest floor covered with decaying plants .
" Think of a roach running around in there probably 10 stories deep in leaf debris and ferns , " he said .
" Would n’t it be a slick trick if you could somehow use microbes to make use of that leaf litter ? "
Their internal passengers allow termites to digest more of what they eat and become efficient and evolutionarily successful .
Numbering about 2,300 known species , termites today are widespread , though more common in tropical climates .
" Books , wood , living plants – it's amazing what termites can feed on , " Poinar said .
In forests they perform the important work of breaking down and recycling dead wood and improving the fertility of soil .
We think of them now as pests because they do n’t distinguish between wooden planks in walls and fallen logs on the forest floor .
" As far as they ’re concerned wood is wood , " Poinar said .
There are some professions that lose their demand as time goes by — this may happen because of changing public opinions or new technology .
Other trades never have to worry about their trade becoming obsolete .
This is the case for electricians , plumbers , and other skilled tradespersons .
However , it does n’t mean they should n’t try to keep up with the times .
Nowadays , there are several apps for electricians designed to make their jobs easier .
Read on to learn more about what these apps have to offer .
The Top Apps for Electricians
So , you claim to be one of the electricians educated in the old - school .
What could some app possibly tell you about how to do your own job ?
You may be very pleasantly surprised .
No , these apps are n’t going to replace anyone , but they can help you .
1. Master Electrician Reference
The Master Electrician Reference ( MER ) is essentially a portable bible for all things electrician - related .
You can search for anything you need with the click of a button .
Its affordability and usefulness make it one of the favorite apps for electrical students .
2. Ugly ’s Electrical References
Ugly ’s is one of the top apps for electricians in the UK .
It has several similarities to the MER and most people tend to go with one or the other .
In the end , they serve a similar purpose .
Choosing a favorite boils down more to personal preference rather than superiority .
3. FieldPulse
A substantial amount of work goes into running the business side of an electrical company .
When things are going well , it can be difficult to keep up with a large number of invoices , estimates , and other matters revolving around billing .
FieldPulse is like having a personal secretary that can help you keep everything organized so you are free to properly focus on your work .
4. Electrodroid
Electricians are constantly dealing with complex mathematical equations and physics problems .
Finally , there is an app that helps to calculate the solution to any problem they may face at work .
Forget digging up the old textbooks .
All you need now fits in your hand .
This is crucial for local electricians who work for themselves or for smaller companies .
This is one of the best and most popular free apps for electricians .
It ’s similar to Electrodroid in that it ’s used for calculations on the job .
Also , it ’s packed with useful reference information about coding and other helpful bits .
Let Technology Work for You
All professionals need to stay up - to - date in their fields .
This holds true , especially for jobs like electricians .
Thankfully , there are apps for electricians designed to help make some of the more tedious aspects of the job easier .
If you still have doubts , try downloading a free version of one of the available apps above .
Give it a try and see for yourself — then realize your true potential as an electrician .

Rogers Wireless said that it will charge 15 cents for every incoming message since July 7 .
In opinion this move by Rogers is just another way to grab money from its customers .
Many people already lost their jobs and do n't have money to pay any extra charges .
If you are against this new Roger 's plan please posts you opinions below .
Only together we can stop companies from stealing our hard earned money .
This demo contains 4 total missions , two story missions and two side missions .
You ’ll be tossed into the first one immediately with a Hero rank , and tasked with getting a train full of Reaper prisoners out of their territory and back to safety .
Your enemies are n’t going to take kindly to this , and here is where I should tell you that the AI in this game does n’t mess around .
If you do n’t have your wits about you , then they will make pleasant sport out of killing you over and over again .
Did I mention that the difficulty for this demo is what they call “ easy ? ”
The controls for this game are fluid and responsive , and I never had much difficulty making Cole do exactly what I needed him to do in any situation , and even if your aim on jumps is slightly off , the game is good at anticipating what you were trying to do and helping you out in that regard .
The ease at which Cole will turn and try to grab onto things was at first annoying , but the more I played it , the more it just made sense .
After you get the train to its destination , the game opens up a bit .
You ’re set on the map , given two waypoints , and told to go to one of them .
At this point you can pretty much explore the area and do what you want .
There is a time limit , but you ’re not kicked from the demo when it expires , but simply pushed into the next mission .
During the second two missions ( one of which tasks you with restoring the purity of the water supply , and the second of which asks you do defend a vital crate of medical supplies from a Reaper assault ) , you ’ll do so under the Infamous rank , which changes both your appearance and the effects of many of your powers ( they tend to skew more towards destruction at this juncture ) .
After you have completed both of these tasks , the final mission of the demo will open up , and for this one you ’re back to your Hero rank .
This mission can be either really easy or really hard depending on how you do it , but your goal is to destroy a tar truck that the Reapers would very enthusiastically prefer you did n’t .
The difficulty of this task in entirely dependent on your proficiency with a new ability you ’ll have : the power to call down lightning from the sky to annihilate everything in your path .
Accomplish this , and the demo is over …and then you ’ll instantly want to play it again .
It ’s THAT good .
On May 21st you ’ll all get to experience this first - hand when the demo goes live for everyone who wants it , at which point you ’ll understand why you NEED to own this game when it releases on May 26th .
Dear readers , the PlayStation 3 has yet another must - own exclusive , so you better bulk up those wallets .
Now if you ’ll excuse me , I ’m going to go play the demo again .
You 'll begin the game as a young boy , in the 16 - 18 range , and it seems you 're just another average young man with awesome hair and no job , school , hobbies , responsibilities , life experience or changes of clothes to worry about .
Then , one fateful day , you 'll wake up and find that …
And today ’s the day of the town 's special holiday fair .
Luckily , your grandfather woke you up before you missed it .
Still , it 's sad that your parents were n't around to help him raise you , but they were killed under non-specific circumstances in the Great War that ended once and for all a few years ago .
Above : Just another day at the Millennial Fair
Despite the rustic , medieval setting , your grandfather is seen as a source of wisdom and experience .
Nobody ’s noticed his lack of usefulness and apparent unemployment in a village where every other house has a specific purpose .
The two of you have lived a quiet life in your one room cabin that is simply “ your house . ”
Gramps will tell you to go check out the village .
You know , see what ’s new with the 15 villagers you ’ve spent every moment of the first 16 years of your life with .
That ’s when you find …
Damn , you can't say no to an old lady .
We mean that literally .
It will not be an option to decline this inane task .
The following tasks are the only possible errands she wants you to run :
a . Go search for her missing grandchild , he was last seen going off to look for something in the nearby dangerous area .
b. Find the last ingredient she needs to create the only medicine that can cure her sick relative .
It 's located in the nearby dangerous area .
c.Retrieve the special artifact needed for today 's celebration .
The villagers decided it would be smart to keep in outside of the village ( in that nearby dangerous area ) .
Above :
The old woman says , " Would you mind running up to the top of the tower ?
It should be no problem , Sonny "
In other words , you 're going to fight monsters , but do n't button - up your shirt and prance out the town gate before finishing up your business .
Seeing as how you 'll most - likely die helping out your elders , you might want to hang out for a bit longer and ...
You two grew up in the same town , but your friend always had all the advantages in life .
He or she was probably recently accepted to " The Academy " and is planning on attending soon .
That 's too bad for you because being poor and having a grandpa for your second - best friend means that , under normal circumstances , you would have no future .
Congratulations !
You ’ll end up discovering true love with her over the course of your adventures .
Yes , this is only the first of many adventures , so do n't count on The Academy working out for her .
Do n’t get too attached .
You 've spent an entire childhood full of bonding moments with your buddy , but he ’s going to betray you .
It ’s nothing personal .
When it ’s all over , he ’ll swear it was n’t him , “ it was the evil magic , and now he ’s totally in control . ”
Above : “ Evil magic ”
Keep talking to villagers and …
It will probably be your grandpa .
It turns out that your grandfather was not always as useless as he is now .
He was once a world - famous adventurer , but has n't told you because he did n't want you stuck the same life of fortune and perpetual retirement .
The weapon has been handed down through generations of your family .
Every other sword in the game will be better than grandpop ’s tin kitchen knife , and you should sell it as soon as you find something better .
Above : Sword technology is n't cyclical
Finally , take a few moments to reflect on what your fellow villagers had to say when you were walking around saying hi .
Sure , they tended to repeat the same simple sentences over and over until you eventually walked away , but maybe they were programmed that way for a reason .
If you hear that there “ might ” be a bandit camp to the east , whip out your automap and label everything east “ unexplored bandit camp . ”
If you hear a rumor from the dithering old lady who ’s spent the last 50 years in the hut next to your grandfather ’s house about how the king might have a terrible illness and be secretly nearing death , just take her uninformed , loony word for it .
And anyone who so much as whispers anything about a prophecy , even if they heard it while drunk , underwater and out the beak of a 1,000 year - old duck , take their word as fact , and expect it to be fulfilled in the next 20 - some hours of gameplay .
Rick Warren goes on national TV and lies through his teeth ; via Americablog , here 's Warren , speaking to Larry King :
I was asked a question that made it sound like I equated gay marriage with pedophilia or incest , which I absolutely do not believe .
Oh , okay .
He was misunderstood ... it just sounded like he equated it with pedophilia and incest :
Steven Waldman :
One controversial moment for you in the last election was your support for Proposition 8 in California . [...]
Rick Warren : Not a problem to me .
But the issue to me is , I ’m not opposed to that as much as I ’m opposed to the redefinition of a 5,000 - year definition of marriage .
I ’m opposed to having a brother and sister be together and call that marriage .
I ’m opposed to an older guy marrying a child and calling that a marriage .
I ’m opposed to one guy having multiple wives and calling that marriage .
Steven Waldman :
Do you think , though , that they are equivalent to having gays getting married ?
Rick Warren : Oh I do .
Do n't you hate it when people try to put words in your mouth ?
Warren also claimed that :
I never once went to a meeting , I never once issued a statement , I never once even gave an endorsement in the two years Prop 8 was going .
The week before the vote , somebody in my church said , ' Pastor Rick , what do you think about this ? '
And I sent a note to my own members that I actually believe that marriage is really should be defined , that definition should be say between a man and a woman , and then all of a sudden out of it they made me something that I really was n't .
Apparently some people " equated " this public service announcement with a statement and an endorsement :

The woman behind the mass protests which rocked the capital of Moldova last week has gone into hiding after the so - called " Twitter revolution " forced a recount of the general election .
Natalia Morar , 25 , a Moldovan who has already been banned from Russia for opposing the Kremlin , told the Guardian she feared arrest after organising a flash mob which ended with 20,000 people storming the parliament building .
Morar , who was tonight reported to be under house arrest , said she had not slept for two nights and was shuttling from one apartment to the next to outwit the police .
" They have staked out my house and my mother 's , " she said .
" They entered my apartment without a search warrant .
If they find me they will arrest me – and what happens then , no one knows .
I have n't spoken on the phone or gone online for two days for fear of being traced . "
It was " ironic " , she added , that the tools she used to launch a revolution could now potentially betray her whereabouts .
The protests began after a conversation between Morar and six friends in a cafe in Chisinau , Moldova 's tiny capital , on Monday 6 April .
" We discussed what we should do about the previous day 's parliamentary elections , which we were sure had been rigged , " said Morar , speaking at a secret location .
The elections brought a larger - than - expected victory for the incumbent Communist party .
" We decided to organise a flash mob for the same day using Twitter , as well as networking sites and SMS . "
With no recent history of mass protests in Moldova , " we expected at the most a couple of hundred friends , friends of friends , and colleagues " , she said .
" When we went to the square , there were 20,000 people waiting there .
It was unbelievable . "
The demonstrations continued into Tuesday peacefully .
But later that day , with no response from the government , protesters swept police aside to storm the parliament building and the towering presidential palace opposite .
Fire broke out in one wing of the parliament , and the young protesters vented their fury by wrecking computers and office furniture .
" Not only did we underestimate the power of Twitter and the internet , we also underestimated the explosive anger among young people at the government 's policies and electoral fraud , " said Morar .
This morningelection officials in Moldova began a recount of votes , which was ordered by President Vladimir Voronin following the protests .
The results of the recount will be announced on Friday .
Moldova , with a population of 4 million , is Europe 's poorest country , and a large number of young people are forced to find work in the west .
" The discrepancy between what they see and learn there , and what they come back to in Moldova , has just grown too much , " said Morar .
Despite controversy over the ­damage caused , Morar is " proud of young Moldovans " for having shown courage and taken to the streets .
She does not believe the current vendetta against her is purely the work of the Moldovan authorities , but sees the Kremlin's hand in it as well : " It was when Russia expressed strong support for Moldova 's position on the elections , and condemned the protests , that they started targeting us . "
Morar was expelled from Russia in 2007 after writing a series of articles accusing top Kremlin officials , including Alexander Bortnikov , the current head of the Russian security services , the FSB , of being behind the murder of Russia 's central bank deputy head Andrey Kozlov in September 2006 .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- House Republican leader John Boehner released a lengthy Web video Thursday suggesting Democrats are not keeping Americans safe -- part of what GOP sources tell CNN is a renewed political effort to push a historically winning issue for Republicans : national security .
An image of the Pentagon on fire during the 9/11 attacks is used in a new GOP Web video attacking the president .
" We 're quite happy to be talking about national security , " said a House GOP leadership aide who requested anonymity to speak freely about internal strategy .
The aide insisted that Republicans have substantive , serious policy differences with President Obama on national security , especially with regard to his approach to dealing with detained terror suspects .
But the aide also conceded Republicans believe those differences have a political upside for them .
" It 's an issue that traditionally plays well for us , " said the aide .
" From a political perspective , it will be beneficial over the long run . "
The campaign - style video , created by a Boehner aide in his Capitol office , begins with the question , " What are Democrats doing to keep America safe ? "
Then , with ominous music in the background , it splices sound bites from news reports and Republicans talking about the dangers of President Obama 's decision to close Guantanamo Bay and to release Bush - era memos about harsh interrogation techniques .
The video 's climax races through images of Obama hugging the Saudi king , shaking hands with Venezuela 's Hugo Chavez and ends with an image of the Pentagon burning on September 11 , 2001 , followed by a final question : " Do you feel safer ? "
Watch the ad
Boehner spokeswoman Antonia Ferrier defended using the 9/11 image .
" The events of September 11 happened .
Pretending they did n't wo n't make America any safer .
And ignoring the fact that it happened is even worse , " Ferrier said .
When asked by CNN why he released what some will view as an alarmist video , Boehner said he is trying to " push the administration to tell us :
What is the overarching strategy to take on the terrorists and defeat them and to help keep America safe ? "
Watch Boehner press Obama on security »
Democrats said such " politics of fear " are scaring voters away from the GOP .
" Is it any wonder that voters and senators alike are running away in droves from the Republican Party ?
Looks like they have taken a page from the discredited Rove / Bush / Cheney playbook .
This ad is nothing more than a pathetic attempt to play up the politics of fear and smear , " said Jim Manley , spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid .
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer 's spokeswoman , Katie Grant , said , " Republicans are once again resorting to fear tactics because they have no new ideas or constructive policies to offer .
The American people have already rejected their politics of fear , and this will be no different . "
A GOP source said the idea for the video was born out of strategy sessions among Boehner , his staff , and other Republican leaders about the fact that they believe Obama is increasingly politically vulnerable on the issue of terrorism .
That view is shared by Republicans in the Senate .
" This is one of those cases where good policy makes good politics , " said a Senate GOP leadership aide , in describing their decision to pound away at Obama for saying he 'll close the Guantanamo Bay prison .
In fact , GOP Senate leader Mitch McConnell made a rare appearance at a Senate appropriations hearing Thursday to publicly question Defense Secretary Robert Gates about closing Guantanamo Bay .
McConnell chastised Gates about the fact that Obama announced his decision to shut the prison before making alternative plans for the prisoners there .
" We have n't been attacked against since 9/11 .
We like that and we'd like for that record to continue , " McConnell told Gates .

President Bush won re-election in 2004 after warning voters that his Democratic opponent , John Kerry , would make them less safe .
In 2008 , GOP candidate Sen . John McCain tried to label Obama an inexperienced leader whose policies on Iraq and other global hot spots would jeopardize America 's security .
But that stopped resonating as the ailing economy took over as voters ' most important priority .
Thursday , economic troubles loomed larger than ever , and a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll earlier in April suggested Americans do not agree with Republicans that Obama is making them less safe .
When asked whether the president 's actions increased chances of a terrorist attack in the United States , 26 percent said yes and 72 percent said no .
Republicans insisted national security will return to the forefront if they continue to highlight what they call the dangers and unanswered questions about Obama policies .

Not only did the terror plot go up in smoke , the alleged mastermind was high .
The ringleader of the four - man homegrown terror cell accused of plotting to blow up synagogues in the Bronx and military planes in Newburgh admitted to a judge today that he had smoked pot before his bust last night .
When U.S. Magistrate Judge Lisa M. Smith asked James Cromitie if his judgment was impaired during his appearance in federal court in White Plains , the 55 - year - old confessed : “ No .
I smoke it regularly … I understand everything you are saying . ”
The stunning revelation came as the accused plotters made their first court appearances following a dramatic arrest by the NYPD and FBI last night .
The suspects drove in an SUV that law enforcement believed was laden with explosives ready to be detonated outside the Jewish centers .
The men did not enter a plea and no bail request was made , but federal prosecutors warned that these were deadly men with murder on their minds .
“ These are extremely violent men , ” said Prosecutor Eric Snyder .
“ These are people eager to bring death to Jews . ”
Cromitie and two brothers , Onta and David Williams , were present in court early in the day .
The fourth suspect , Leguerre Payen , appeared later -- apparently after receiving medical treatment .
The FBI and other agencies monitored the men and provided an inactive missile and inert C - 4 to an informant for the defendants to use in their plot .
Sources have stressed that there was " no chance " the plot could succeed and said the cell was quite unsophisticated .
Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said he believed the men knew each other through prison .
They had long rap sheets for charges including drug possession and assault .
Though all four are accused in the domestic terror plot , David Williams was singled out by prosecutors as being particularly violent .
“ When he bought a gun in a Brooklyn project , he said that if the informant was n’t there he would have shot the gang leader to get the $ 700 back , ” Snyder said about a meeting between Williams and an alleged Blood gangster in Brooklyn .
The men are due back in court on June 5 and defense attorney Suzane Brody reserved the right to request bail .
“ Of course , there is more to the story , ” said Brody .
" One of us can still be saved .
Let us pool our resources to make that happen .
Do n't be selfish . "
" Also it actually does make sense to buy low . "
The Western Australian Government has offered a man wrongfully convicted of murdering a Perth woman a multi-million dollar ex-gratia payment .
Andrew Mallard spent more than a decade behind bars for the 1994 murder of Mosman Park jeweller Pamela Lawrence .
His conviction was later overturned .
The state 's Attorney - General , Christian Porter , today announced Mr Mallard has been offered $ 3.25 million as what he describes as a ' gift ' from the Government .
The offer is the largest in the state 's history and comes after months of negotiations .
Mr Porter says it is up to Mr Mallard to accept the money , but if he does , that figure will be deducted from any other settlement he may reach in the courts .
" What path Mr Mallard chooses from here is entirely his own choice , and what we have done from here does not limit his choices in any way or form , " he said .
He says the sum offered is a life - changing amount of money and Mr Mallard might never have to work again .
The Premier , Colin Barnett , has described it as a historic offer , and is urging Mr Mallard 's friends and supporters , including the Shadow Attorney - General John Quigley , to accept the deal .
Mr Quigley says the amount offered is grossly insufficient and Mr Mallard will continue with legal action against those involved in his wrongful conviction .
" I do n't think there 's anyone in the community that would accept $ 3.25 million as fair compensation for being snatched off the street today , jailed for 12 and a half years and have their whole life destroyed , " Mr Quigley said .
Mr Mallard says he 's disappointed by the offer .
" This is a very , very delicate situation and and I will be conferring with my lawyers , " he said .
Last year , Ray and Peter Mickelberg were awarded more than $ 1 million for their wrongful conviction over the 1982 Perth Mint swindle .
Los Angeles County has the largest known rape kit backlog in the United States .
At least 12,669 untested sexual assault kits ( " rape kits " ) - which potentially contain DNA and other evidence collected from rape victims ' bodies and clothes immediately after the crime - are sitting in police storage facilities in the Los Angeles Police Department , the Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Department , and 47 independent police departments in Los Angeles County .
The untested rape kits in Los Angeles County represent lost justice for the victims who reported their rape to the police , and consented to the four - to - six hour rape kit collection process .

Bahrain 's foreign labourers will no longer be at the mercy of their employers Bahrain has announced it will scrap its sponsorship system for foreign workers - a first in a region often criticised by rights groups over the issue .
The system , known as " kafala " , is used to monitor the number of foreigners working in Gulf Arab economies , which rely heavily on cheap foreign labour , mostly recruited from countries from the Indian subcontinent .
Bahraini Labour Minister Majeed al - Alawi said the changes would be introduced in August .
Mr Alawi said the main change in the regulations would mean foreign workers would now be directly sponsored by the Labour Authority and would not rely on their employers .
The current system , which is common to all Gulf countries , has long been criticised by human rights groups for placing workers at the mercy of their employers .
Employers usually take employees ' passports when they enter the country and sometimes use possession of the travel documents to extort a large fee before the workers can leave the country .
Overhaul Gulf governments have historically welcomed immigrant workers on the assumption that nationals will not do many jobs , which they consider to be below them .
Despite this , Majeed al - Alawi told BBC Arabic radio that the new system would form part of a broader initiative to place a ceiling on the number of expatriate workers in Bahrain .
The US State Department in 2008 placed Bahrain in tier two - out of three - of its annual human trafficking report for not fully complying with minimum standards to stop the trafficking of people for forced labour or the sex trade .
Labour ministers of other Gulf countries have agreed that the present sponsorship system needs to be overhauled .
The system means that expatriate workers can enter , work , and leave the host country only with the permission or assistance of their sponsor .
Many sponsors exploit the system to make money .
Since the 1970s , there has been a significant increase in the number of immigrants working in the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council or GCC ( Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar , Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates ) .
The pattern of immigration has also changed as South and Southeast Asian migrant workers have replaced Arab migrants .
They now constitute as much as 90 % of the foreign workforce in some GCC States .
The " kafala " system has become the legal basis for residency and employment .
Migrant workers receive an entry visa and a residence permit only if a GCC citizen or a GCC institution employs them .
Sponsorship requires the sponsor - employer to assume full economic and legal responsibility for the employee during the contract period .
The worker can only work for the sponsor and is entirely dependent on their sponsor to remain in the country .
Vulnerable
In many GCC States , the sponsor is legally able to confiscate the passports of employees until their contract has ended .
Bahrain 's Labour Minister Majeed al - Alawi likened the current system to slavery .
Women employed in domestic service are particularly vulnerable .
If an employee sues their sponsor for violating labour practices , there is generally no form of unemployment protection while the case is pending in the legal system .
And even if the worker wins the case , the usual result is for the sponsor contract to be terminated , meaning that the worker has to leave the country .
While the " kafala " system provides the state with an important means for monitoring labour flow , these policies can infringe the rights of workers as they are often used to deny them justice and basic protection .
This is the system that Bahrain says it is now committed to change .

There are specialized terms referring to all sorts of aspects of web design .
For someone just getting started in web design , or someone looking to have a site designed , all the technical jargon can be overwhelming .
Especially the acronyms .
Below is a guide to industry terms that should get you well on your way to understanding what web designers are talking about .
In addition , we ’ve provided some resources for each term to give you more in - depth information .
Accessibility .
Basically , this is the ability of a website to be used by people with disabilities , including visually impaired visitors using screen readers , hearing impaired visitors using no sound , color blind people , or those with other disabilities .
A website with low accessibility is basically going to be impossible for those with disabilities to use .
Accessibility is particularly important for sites providing information to those with disabilities ( healthcare sites , government sites , etc. ) , though it is an important aspect to consider when designing any site .

Accessibility
Basically , this is the ability of a website to be used by people with disabilities , including visually impaired visitors using screen readers , hearing impaired visitors using no sound , color blind people , or those with other disabilities .
A website with low accessibility is basically going to be impossible for those with disabilities to use .
Accessibility is particularly important for sites providing information to those with disabilities ( healthcare sites , government sites , etc. ) , though it is an important aspect to consider when designing any site .
AJAX
Stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML .
AJAX is typically used for creating dynamic web applications and allows for asynchronous data retrieval without having to reload the page a visitor is on .
The JavaScript on a given page handles most of the basic functions of the application , making it perform more like a desktop program instead of a web - based one .
Anchor Text
The text a link uses to refer to your site .
This can make a big difference in your site ’s search engine results .
See also : Backlink .
Automagically
A portmanteau that combines “ automatically ” and “ magically . ”
Generally , it refers to something that has a complex technical process that ’s hidden from users , so that something almost appears to work by magic .
If you think about it , many modern internet - based technologies could be classified as “ automagical . ”
B
Back End
The back end of a website is the part hidden from view of regular website visitors .
The back end generally includes the information structure , applications , and the CMS controlling content on the site .
Backlink
Backlinks are links from other sites back to your own .
They ’re sometimes also referred to as “ trackbacks ” ( especially on blogs ) .
Backlinks have a huge impact on your sites search rankings .
Lots of backlinks from high - ranking sites can greatly improve your search engine results , especially if those links use keywords in their anchor text .
Bad Neighborhood
A “ bad neighborhood ” refers to the server where your site is hosted .
A site hosted on a server that hosts other sites that spam or use black - hat SEO practices can end up penalized by search engines solely because of their proximity to those sites .
In other words , be very careful about which web host you choose , what their terms of service are , and how strictly they enforce those terms if you want to avoid being penalized because of what your neighbors are doing .
Linking to sites in bad neighborhoods can also have a negative effect on your search rankings .
Bandwidth
Bandwidth can refer to two different things : the rate at which data can be transferred or the total amount of data allowed to be transferred from a web host during a given month ( or other hosting service term ) before overage charges are applied .
It is generally referred to in term of bits - per- second ( bps ) , kilobits per second ( kbs ) , or other metric measurements .
Lower bandwidth internet connections ( such as dial - up ) mean data loads slower than with high bandwidth connections ( like cable or fiber ) .

Below the Fold
This term is a carry - over from newspaper publishing days .
In newspaper terms , “ below the fold ” means content was on the bottom half of the page ( below the physical fold in the paper ) .
In web design terms , “ below the fold ” refers to the content that is generally going to be below the point first viewable to the average website visitor in their browser ( in other words , viewers would have to scroll down to see the content ) .
Resources
Bounce Rate
A website ’s bounce rate is the percentage of people who leave the site from the same page they entered the site , without clicking through to any other pages .
This can be a good indicator of how good a website ’s navigation is , as well as an indicator of the quality of the site ’s content ( a very high bounce rate does n’t bode well for either of those things ) .

Breadcrumb
Breadcrumbs are the bit of navigation elements that generally appear near the top of a give web page that show you the pages and subpages the appear before the page you ’re on .
For examples , on a blog , the breadcrumbs might look something like : Home > Category > Year >
Month >
Post ( or they might be a lot simpler that that ) .
The breadcrumbs term comes from the fairy tale “ Hansel and Gretel . ”
Browser
Browser refers to the program a website visitor is using to view the web site .
Examples include Safari , Firefox , Google Chrome , Opera , and Internet Explorer .

C
Cache / Caching
Cached files are those that are saved or copied ( downloaded ) by a web browser so that the next time that user visits the site , the page loads faster .
Cascading Style Sheets
Also referred to simply as CSS , Cascading Style Sheets are used to define the look and feel of a web site outside of the actual HTML file (s ) of the site .
In recent years , CSS has replaced tables and other HTML - based methods for formatting and laying out websites .
The benefits to using CSS are many , but some of the most important are the simplification of a site ’s HTML files ( which can actually increase search engine rankings ) and the ability to completely change the style of a site by changing just one file , without having to make changes to content .
Client - Side
Client - side refers to scripts that are run in a viewer ’s browser , instead of on a web server ( as in server - side scripts ) .
Client - side scripts are generally faster to interact with , though they can take longer to load initially .
Content Management System
Also known as a CMS , the Content Management System is a backend tool for managing a site ’s content that separates said content from the design and functionality of the site .
Using a CMS generally makes it easier to change the design or function of a site independent of the site ’s content .
It also ( usually ) makes it easier for content to be added to the site for people who are n’t designers .
In web design terms , a comment is a bit of information contained in a site ’s HTML or XHTML files that is ignored by the browser .
Comments are used to identify different parts of the file and as reference notes .
Good commenting makes it much easier for a designer ( whether the original designer or someone else ) to make changes to the site , as it keeps it clear which parts of the code perform which functions .
There are different comment formats for different programming and markup languages .
CSS
See Cascading Style Sheets .
CSS Framework
A CSS framework is a collection of CSS files used as the starting point to make XHTML and CSS web sites quickly and painlessly .
They usually contain CSS styles for typography and layout .

Dither
In GIF and certain other image formats , there is a limited color palette used for each image .
Because of this , not all colors in an image are presented .
Dither is used to approximate these colors by combining pixels of different colors side by side .
DNS
Stands for Domain Name Service ( alternately Domain Name System or Domain Name Server ) .
Basically , it ’s the thing that converts IP addresses into domain names .
DNS servers are provided with the IP address of your web server when you assign your domain name to those servers .
In turn , when someone types your domain name into their web browser , those DNS servers translate the domain name to the IP address and point the browser to the correct web server .

Doctype
The doctype declaration specifies which version of HTML is used in a document .
It has a direct effect on whether your HTML will validate .
Dom ,
The
Stands for Document Object Model .
It ’s a language - indpendent , cross- platform convention for representing objects in XML , XHTML , and HTML documents .
Rules for interacting with and programming the DOM are specified in the DOM API .
Domain
The domain is the name by which a website is identified .
The domain is associated with an IP address .
Domains can be purchased with any combination of letters , hyphens ( - ) , and numbers ( though it ca n’t start with a hyphen ) .
Depending on the extension ( .com , .net , .org , etc. ) , a domain can be anywhere up to 26 to 63 characters long .
DTD
Stands for Document Type Definition .
DTD is one of several SGML and XML schema languages .
It provides a list of the attributes , comments , elements , entities , and notes in a document along with their relationships to each other .
E

Short for electronic commerce .
It ’s the buying and selling of goods online , through websites .
Products sold through e-commerce can be physical products that require shipping , or digital products delivered electronically .
Elastic Layout
An elastic layout is one that uses percentages and ems for widths paired with a max - width style to allow the site layout to stretch when font sizes are changed .
It ’s ability to flex to accommodate the browser width and reader ’s font preferences are where it gets its name .
Element
In XML , an element is the central building block of any document .
Individual elements can contain text , other elements , or both .
Em
Em is a unit of measurement for sizing fonts and other elements within a web page relative to the item ’s parent element .
A 1em font is equal to the point size for the font already defined in the parent element ( 2em would be twice the current size ; .5 em would be half the current size ) .
Embedded Style
An embedded style is a CSS style written into the head of an XHTML document .
It only effects the elements on that page , instead of site - wide as a separate CSS file does .
Style in an embedded style sheet will override styles from the linked CSS file .
Ex
Ex is a measurement for font height or size relative to the height of a lowercase “ x ” in that font family .
Extensible Markup Language
Otherwise known as XML .
XML is a markup language used for writing custom markup languages .
In other words , XML describes how to write new languages ( it ’s sometimes referred to as a “ meta ” language because of this ) .
It also serves as a basic syntax that allows different kinds of computers and applications to share information without having to go through multiple conversion layers .
External Style Sheet
This is a CSS document that is written in a separate , external document .
The biggest advantage to using an external style sheet is that it can be linked to by multiple HTML / XHTML files ( which means changes made to the style sheet will effect all the pages linked to it without having to change each page individually ) .
F
Favicon
Favicons are tiny ( generally 16x16 pixels , though some are 32x32 pixels ) , customizable icons displayed in the web address bar in most browsers next to the web address .
They ’re either 8 - bit or 24 - bit in color depth and are saved in either .ico , .gif or .png file formats .
Fixed Width Layout
A fixed width layout has a set width ( generally defined in pixels ) set by the designer .
The width stays the same regardless of screen resolution , monitor size , or browser window size .
It allows for minute adjustments to be made to a design that will stay consistent across browsers .
Designers have more control over exactly how a site will appear across platforms with this type of layout .
Fluid Layout
See Liquid Layout
Focal Point
The focal point of a web site is the spot on a web page that they eye is naturally drawn to .
This could be an image , a banner , text , Flash content , or just about anything else .
You want to make sure that whatever is acting as your focal point is the most important part of your site .
Fold
The fold is a term carried over from newspaper design and pagination ( where the fold referred to the physical fold in the paper ) .
The fold in a website is the point on the webpage that rests at the bottom of someone ’s browser ( in other words , to see anything below the fold , they would have to scroll down ) .
There are varying opinions on how important the fold is in web design .
Font Family
Font family is a group designation for defining the typefaces used in CSS documents .
The font family tag generally lists multiple fonts to be used , and usually ends with the generic font category ( such as “ serif ” or “ sans- serif ’ ) .

It ’s all the components of a website that a visitor to the site can see ( pages , images , content , etc . )
Specifically , it ’s the interface that visitors use to access the site ’s content .
It ’s also sometimes referred to as the User Interface .
G
Graceful Degradation
Graceful degradation refers to a website ’s ability to have elements that may take advantage of the capabilities of newer browsers done in a way that allows users with older browsers to still view the site in a manner that at least allows access to basic content .
It also applies to making sure that if one small portion of your site does n’t work in someone ’s browser , it does n’t break your entire site for them .

Graphical User Interface
Also referred to by its acronym : GUI .
A graphical user interface uses an input device ( like the mouse ) and visual representations of how the user is able to interact with a web application .
In other words , it ’s all the front - end stuff you see on a web application .
It ’s purpose is to allow you to interact with a web application without having to enter code .
H
Hexadecimal
Also referred to a “ hex ” numbers , they are a base - 16 numbering system used to define colors online .
Hex numbers include the numerals 0 - 9 and letters A - F. Hexadecimal numbers are written in three sets of hex pairs .

Hit
Contrary to popular belief , a hit does not represent a single visitor to a website .
A hit is actually a request for a single file from your web server .
This means one page can actually generate multiple hits , as each page generally has more than one file ( an html or other base file , a css file , multiple images , etc. ) and each one is requested from the server whenever the page is loaded .
Some marketing people like to quote hits to unknowing consumers as the number makes their site sound like it ’s getting a whole lot more traffic than it actually is .
. htaccess
The .htaccess file is the default directory - level configuration file on Apache servers .
They are also known as “ distributed configuration files . ”
Configuration directives contained in the .htaccess file apply to the directory in which the file is placed as well as all of its subdirectories .
Within the .htaccess file things like authorization and authentication , rewriting of URLs , cache control and customized error responses can all be specified .
HTML
Stands for Hypertext Markup Language .
It ’s the primary language used to write web pages .
HTML is primarily intended as a way to provide content on websites ( with CSS handling the layout and stylistic options ) , though it can also be used to determine how that content is displayed .

HTML Tag
Also referred to as an HTML element , an HTML tag is the bit of code that describes how that particular piece of the web page it ’s on is formatted .
Typical tags specify things like headings , paragraphs , links , and a variety of other items .
HTTP
Stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol .
HTTP is a set of rules for transferring hypertext requests between a web browser and a web server .
HTTPS
Similar to HTTP , HTTPS stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol over SSL ( Secure Socket Layer ) or , alternately , HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure .
Like HTTP , it ’s a set of rules for transferring hypertext requests between browsers and servers , but this time it ’s done over a secure , encrypted connection .
Hyperlink
A hyperlink is a link from one web page to another , either on the same site or another one .
Generally these are text or images , and are highlighted in some way ( text is often underlined or put in a different color or font weight ) .
The inclusion of hyperlinks are the “ hyper ” part of “ hypertext . ”
Hypertext
Hypertext is any computer - based text that includes hyperlinks .
Hypertext can also include presentation devices like tables or images , in addition to plain text and links .
I
i Frame
Short for Inline Frame .
An iframe is used to display one or more web pages within another normal web page ( one that is n’t a frameset page ) .

Image Map
An image map is used in XHTML to allow different parts of an image to become different clickable elements ( and can also allow some portions of the image to have no clickable element ) .
Inheritance
In CSS , elements that do n’t have a pre-defined style will take on the style of their parent element within the document tree .

Inline Style
Elements with CSS written directly around the element it affects , instead of in a separate style sheet or header style .
L
LAMP
Stands for Linux , Apache , MySQL , and PHP ( or sometimes Perl or Python ) , and is referring to the specifications of a web server ( defining the operating system , web server , database , and scripting language , in that order ) .
One of the advantages of LAMP setups is that the software used is all free and open source .
Landing Page
A landing page is the page where a visitor first enters a website .
Oftentimes , a special landing page is created to elicit a specific action from the new visitor ( usually in connection with an advertising or marketing campaign ) .
Link Farm
A link farm is any website setup specifically to increase the link popularity of other websites by increasing the number of incoming links to that site .
While some link farms are single pages listing unrelated links , others consist of networks of sites that contain multiple links back and forth to one another .
Search engines can generally recognize these types of schemes and often remove link farms from their directories and penalize the sites linking to and from them .
Liquid Layout
A liquid layout is one that is based on percentages of the browser window ’s size .
The layout of the site will change with the width of the browser , even if the visitor changes their browser size while viewing the page .
Liquid layouts take full advantage of a person ’s browser width , optimizing the amount of content you can fit onscreen at one time .
M
Markup
This refers to the coding applied to a text document to change it into an HTML , XML , or other Markup Language document .
Meta Data
Meta data is the data contained in the header that offers information about the web page that a visitor is currently on .
The information contained in the meta data is n’t viewable on the web page ( except in the source code ) .
Meta data is contained within meta tags .

Plug -In
A plug - in is a bit of third party code that extends the capabilities of a website .
It ’s most often used in conjunction with a CMS or blogging platform .
Plug-ins are a way to extend the functionality of a website without having to redo the core coding of the site .
Plugins can also refer to bits of third - party software installed within a computer program to increase its functionality .
Progressive Enhancement
Progressive enhancement is a strategy for web design that uses web technologies in a layered fashion that allows everyone to access the basic content and functionality of a web page , using any browser or Internet connection , while also providing those with better bandwidth or more advanced browser software an enhanced version of the page .

RSS also allows visitors to subscribe to a blog or other site and receive updates via a feed reader .
Resolution
Refers to the physical number of pixels displayed on a screen ( such as 1280x1024 ) .
Unlike in print , display resolution does not refer to the number of pixels or dots per inch on a computer screen , as this can be changed by changing the resolution of the screen ( which , of course , does not change the physical size of the screen ) .
The resolution of an image , however , is often referred to in terms of pixels per inch , though this has very little effect on how the image is displayed on screen .
S
Schema
Generally , a schema is an XML document used in place of a DTD to describe other XML documents .
Script

Semantic Markup
In semantic markup , content is written within XHTML tags that offer context to what the content contains .
Basic semantic markup refers to using items like header and paragraph tags , though semantic markup is also being used to provide much more useful context to web pages in an effort to make the web as a whole more semantic .
Server -Side
Server - side refers to scripts run on a web server , as opposed to in a user ’s browser .
Server - side scripts often take a bit longer to run than a client - side script , as each page must reload when an action is taken .
SGML
Stands for Standard Generalized Markup Language .
It ’s a markup language used for defining the structure of a document .
SGML is n’t mentioned very often , but it ’s the markup language that serves as the basis for both XML and HTML .

HURRICANE KATRINA'S effect on the city of New Orleans has been much longer - lasting than most expected .
Almost four years after the storm , a quarter of the population has never returned .
A third of homes still lie empty , many decked with tarpaulins and with the flood - line still visible .
Residential streets are lined with houses with collapsing porches , fallen plasterwork and hopeful For Sale signs .
Less than half the city 's public transport facilities have been restored , and the wheels on the city 's famous street - cars , even the one named Desire , are still rusty .
AP
Your records may be somewhere here .
Or not
Most important , though the number of chronically sick in the city has risen sharply , medical services remain in tatters .
Only 57 % of the city 's medical facilities have reopened , and tens of thousands of records have been lost .
In St Bernard Parish , which once had two hospitals , there is now none .
Charity Hospital , the main refuge for the poor and uninsured for more than 250 years , is shuttered and surrounded by wire fencing .
Doctors , nurses and military personnel spent a month cleaning and decontaminating the first three floors in the weeks after Katrina , but the hospital remains closed .
Last month a group of citizens launched a legal appeal for it to be reopened , claiming that corrupt officials are using it as an excuse to get access to federal relief funds .
But the owners of the building want to sell it .
The Lindy Boggs Medical Centre became a symbol of the struggle for survival in the hot , dank days after the flood .
A day after the levees broke , the generators in the hospital failed , knocking out ventilators , transfusion machines and fresh water supplies .
Nineteen patients died .
The hospital is now to become a shopping centre .
Even in hospitals that are functioning again , medical staff are in short supply and treatment has become riskier .
Emergency - room medics complain of having to treat too many desperately ill patients simultaneously .
This increases the chance of both mistakes and lawsuits .
That fear has led some doctors who live in the city to commute to hospitals far outside New Orleans rather than work locally .
Even before the storm , Louisiana was the least healthy state in America .
In the past few years , however , levels of sickness have risen sharply .
Almost two - thirds of New Orleans residents now report chronic health problems , a 45 % rise since 2006 .
The percentage of people suffering from mental difficulties , mostly depression , has tripled since then , and the suicide rate has doubled since 2005 .
For months thousands of people were housed in temporary trailers which were poorly ventilated and contained high levels of formaldehyde .
In the houses which were left habitable , mould and spores grew during the many humid weeks when the city lacked electricity .
As a result , respiratory and skin problems are rife .
Greater poverty is also a factor .
Almost a fifth of New Orleans households now live below the federal poverty line ( $ 22,000 a year for a family of four ) .
Many people were unemployed for months after Katrina and , although the number out of work has fallen , the effects endure .
An estimated 12,000 people are still homeless .
The situation is expected to deteriorate in the coming years .
Nearly 20 % of people are now without health insurance .
One in four say the emergency room is their primary source of care and , as the recession bites , that proportion is growing .
Plans for two new hospitals are mired in payment battles and preservation disputes , meaning neither will become operational until at least 2013 .
It is little wonder that one in five New Orleans residents say they are considering leaving .
Which country -- the United States or China -- will make the 21st century its own ?
When President Obama recently called for American young people “ to be makers of things ” and focus on subjects such as science and engineering , it was partly a nod to China ’s rapid growth .
Had he lived , taught and consulted in China for the last 33 months , as I have , he might have urged American students first to follow his example and study the liberal arts .
Only technical knowledge complemented by well - honed critical and creative thinking skills can help us regain our innovative edge .
China ’s traditional lack of emphasis on teaching these skills could undermine its efforts to develop its own innovative economy .
I once challenged my Chinese MBA students to brainstorm “ two - hour business plans . ”
I divided them into six groups , gave them detailed instructions and an example : a restaurant chain .
The more original their idea , the better , I stressed -- and we ’d vote for a prize winner .
The word “ prize ” energized the room .
Laptops flew open .
Fingers pounded .
Voices roared .
Packs of cookies were ripped open and shared .
Not a single person text - messaged .
I ’d touched a nerve .
In the end , five of the six groups presented plans for , you guessed it , restaurant chains .
The sixth proposed a catering service .
Why risk a unique solution when the instructor has let it slip he likes the food business ?
Advertisement
Though I admitted the time limit had been difficult , I expressed my disappointment and reiterated what I had expected -- originality -- and why .
But they ’d been so enthusiastic that I could n’t deny them a winner .
After a polite discussion of the merits of each idea , the Haagen - Dazs gift certificates were awarded , but not without controversy .
Runners - up later complained that an identical concept had been featured on CCTV the night before .
My students were n’t recent college grads .
They were middle managers , financial analysts and marketers from state - owned enterprises and multinational companies .
They occupied the space in the developing economy that has spawned a small industry of articles about “ China ’s great talent shortage . ”
Most were intelligent , personable men and women , not without talent or opinions , but they had been shaped by an educational system that rarely stressed or rewarded critical thinking or inventiveness .
The scenario I ’ve described occurred in different forms throughout my two years at the school .
Papers were routinely copied from the Web and the Harvard Business Review .
Case study debates meant to be spontaneous were jointly scripted by the opposing teams and memorized .
Students frequently posited that copying is a superior business strategy to inventing and innovating .
When they considered the wealth that Chinese industry had amassed in such a short time , it was hard for them to believe otherwise .
Throughout the semesters , like students everywhere but more so , they wanted to know exactly what they needed to memorize for the mid-term and final .
Considering it takes me a week just to commit several Chinese phrases to memory , I had to respect their skills .
Advertisement
Nonetheless , I reminded them that their exams would require analysis , and often re-explained at their request the difference between analysis and summary .
My Western - trained colleagues , both foreigners and Chinese , tell similar stories .
It ’s not that university students in the West had n’t also needed coaching in critical thinking , but they were n’t so blindly locked into such a seemingly entrenched style .
It does n’t help , of course , that certain important topics related to politics and business have to be avoided in my Chinese classes .
Ironically , the government that has enforced such restrictions and focused its schools so intensely on math and science seems to realize its efforts may be too effective .
Highways , dams , bridges and airports have been built , every conceivable product manufactured and sold , but so few sophisticated marketing and management minds have been cultivated that it will be a long time before most people in the world can name a Chinese brand .
With this problem in mind , local partnerships with institutions such as USC , Johns Hopkins , Yale , MIT and Insead of France have been established .
If not quite ready to create cadres of disaffected litterateurs and cineastes , Beijing clearly recognizes it will take different kinds of thinkers to invent new products and sell them around the world .
Advertisement
And then there ’s the “ thousand - talent scheme , ” a new government program intended to boost technological innovation by luring top foreign - trained scientists , including those of non-Chinese origin , to the mainland with big money and perks .
But the officials and professors who conceived this “ scheme ” are likely products of the educational system that generated the problem they are trying to solve .
They are ambitious .
They are confident .
They want to push China forward .
But worries about China ’s research environment , hardly known for fostering independent thinking and openness , may overshadow lucrative salary offers .
“ Money is important for practical issues , ” said Zhangqing Li , a University of Maryland professor , to Nature.com in January .
“ But the determinant factor is whether we would be able to be as productive in China as the United States . ”
Ultimately for China , becoming a major world innovator -- and by extension , a robust economic power -- is not just about setting up partnerships with top Western universities or roping off elites and telling them to think creatively .
It ’s about establishing an intellectually rich learning environment for young minds .
It ’s about harnessing the same inventive energy of the street markets and small - time entrepreneurs and putting it in the schools .

The Chinese do n’t need expensive free - agent scientists .
They need a new farm system -- and about 10 million liberal arts professors .
Norway , the world 's fourth biggest crude exporter , said Monday that its oil production fell a sizeable 7 % in April to 1.99 million barrels a day last month from 2.15 million barrels a day in March .

Though preliminary , the data highlight one of the big underlying supply problems in non-OPEC states ...

Throughout the history of the planet , there have been a number of mass extinction events .
The largest was the " Great Dying , " which occurred at the border of the Permian and Triassic periods — during this event , over half of the species on Earth at the time went extinct .
Thanks to a recent find in southwestern China , researchers have been able to nearly pinpoint the events that appear to have precipitated the Great Dying .
Major volcanic activity is often a leading candidate for causing mass extinctions , but pinpointing a specific eruption or sequence of eruptions that caused a mass die - off of marine life is difficult .
Typically , indirect geochronological methods must be employed , and they have known timing inaccuracies that complicate the analysis .
In the case of the Great Dying , it appears that there may have been several pulses of extinctions .
The finds from China are described in a letter in this week 's edition of Science , and they come very close to providing a direct cause - and - effect relationship between volcanic activity and the earliest of these mass extinction pulses , the End - Guadalupian , which occurred 8 million years before the primary event at the Permian - Triassic boundary .
The researchers were studying the Maokou Formation , a set of limestone rocks in the Emeishan flood basalt province in south China ( flood basalts are formed by massive volcanic activity ) .
They found that the rocks contained evidence of both a massive marine extinction and a major carbon isotope excursion occurring within the same geological temporal and spatial frames .
At the onset of the eruptions , the rocks reveal that the carbonate deposition , which is driven by oceanic life , collapsed .
The fossil record shows the disappearance of shallow water creatures such as foraminifers and algae .
Approximately 50 kilometers to the East of the Emeishan volcanic range , a large amount of fauna went extinct in a similar time frame .
A substantial and widespread shift in the carbon isotope ratios suggest that the eruptions here had a global impact .
The large shift in the carbon isotope ratios are an indication that the Earth 's carbon cycle was knocked out of whack for some time after the extinction , with a likely impact on climate .
The immediate effects of the eruptions — acid rain , short - term cooling , and other environmental effects — would also have helped extend the extinction event that was in progress .
The authors do not go so far as to conclude that they have unearthed a definite cause - and - effect relationship between the Emeishan volcanic eruptions and the global marine mass extinction at the End - Guadalupian , but they feel that the evidence makes a compelling case .
The findings presented in this letter clearly give a big boost to the proposal that volcanism was responsible for one of the extinctions near the Permian - Triassic boundary .
Mass extinction may not come only from above , but also from within .

The most famous " smegheads " in space are back
By Tim Masters
Entertainment reporter , BBC News
Cult comedy Red Dwarf is returning to TV , 21 years after its initial launch .
BBC
News pulls on a giant space helmet and goes behind the scenes at Shepperton Studios .
Warning : may contain minor plot spoilers .
We 're three million years in the future , and Dave Lister - the last man in the universe - is eating tomatoes and sneezing all over his ironing .
Welcome back to the sleeping quarters of the mining ship Red Dwarf , which have been lavishly recreated for three new episodes of the hit comedy show that ran on BBC Two between 1988 and 1999 .
The show has been resurrected by digital channel Dave for the Easter weekend .
Written and directed by Red Dwarf co-creator Doug Naylor , the new storyline reunites the classic cast , including Coronation Street 's Craig Charles .
" This is the costume from 1992 , " says Charles - who plays space slob Dave Lister - during a break in filming .
" It still fits , I 'm really chuffed . "
" It 's a great feeling .
You put on the boots and the leather trousers - and you start to get the Lister walk .
Then the leather jacket and the dreadlocks go on and suddenly you 're Dave Lister again . "
Space whale I walk up those cobbles five days a week and all of a sudden I 'm walking up dressed in leather with a robot !
Craig Charles
The new story Back to Earth sees the Red Dwarf crew - Lister , Rimmer , Cat and Kryten - nine years older , and interrupted by the discovery of a dimension - hopping leviathan in the ship 's water tank .
" The banter 's still the same .
It 's like we never went away , " says Charles , who was given special leave from Coronation Street for the February shoot .
" This plot is amazing .
It 's more of a comedy - drama than a sitcom .
" On Lister 's part it 's much more emotional .
He cries his eyes out in this .
I think it 's going to surprise a lot of people , the emotional maturity of the piece . "
It has already been revealed that , in a surreal plot twist , the Red Dwarf crew find themselves on Coronation Street .
" It was very strange seeing my new friends and my old friends together in the same location .
I walk up those cobbles five days a week and all of a sudden I 'm walking up dressed in leather with a robot ! " laughs Charles .
Green screen
It can get quite mind - melting , especially when you 're 300 degrees and your head 's covered in rubber !
Robert Llewellyn
That " robot " is Kryten , the square - headed mechanoid played by Robert Llewellyn .
Lewellyn admits he 's enjoying the astronomical leap in technology since the old days of Red Dwarf .
" We 're using Red cameras and they 're the latest bit of super high definition technology .
So it looks like proper film , " he enthuses before heading into make - up .
" The scenes that are hard to get your head round are when you 're in front of a green screen and you 're meant to be next to a 70,000 tonne space ship , or in a corridor that 's four miles long .
" It can get quite mind - melting , especially when you 're 300 degrees and your head 's covered in rubber ! "
Llewellyn has been keeping Red Dwarf fans up to date during filming via his Twitter feed .
" I have so many questions that I just can't answer , " he says .
" There 's a couple of people on the set who are following me as well , so I 'm being very discreet .
And also I do n't want to spoil the show . "
Cat bling
This is n't the first time the Red Dwarf team have been working on a new story in the 21st Century .
A big screen outing nearly got off the ground in 2004 but ultimately failed to launch .
Danny John - Jules , who plays fashion - obsessed Cat , recalls : " Several times we'd be sitting round doing script readings .
There were production meetings at one point . "
Peep Show regular Sophie Winkleman plays Russian hologram Katerina
So what 's been the reaction of Red Dwarf fans to the resurrected TV show ?
" It 's been fandemonium , " says John - Jules , who 's as cool and laid - back in real life as he is on screen .
" We 'd always been answering that question - when is Red Dwarf coming back ?
You do n't have to be a Bachelor of Science to work out that if you 've got a few million people asking the same question then you should do something about it . "
And what 's in the Cat 's wardrobe this Easter ?
" I 'm in lilac and burgundies and all kinds of bling .
One of my costumes is inspired by Mama Mia and the other by Strictly Come Dancing ! "
Chris Barrie is back as Arnold Rimmer , the uptight hologram with an H on his forehead .
But now he has to contend with a rival called Katerina ( played by Sophie Winkleman ) .
" She 's a sort of nemesis figure for Rimmer , " says Barrie .
" I do n't think I 've ever had to perform in a not - get - on kind of way with someone so gorgeous in my life . "
It 's two weeks after all the location filming is complete and Barrie is still fizzing with enthusiasm .
Red Dwarf won a Bafta for best British comedy series " The stakes are high - it 's 10 years since we were last on screen , the 21st anniversary of the start - I 'm a little bit biased , but I think this could be some of the best Red Dwarf we 've ever made . "
But does Barrie think there 's more Red Dwarf to come ?
" There was definitely a sense that this could be the beginning of something new .
we 'll see . "
Whether we will ever again see them lying shipwrecked and comatose ( drinking fresh mango juice with goldfish shoals nibbling at their toes ) will depend heavily on how the new episodes are received .
But watching the actors rehearse on the vast Shepperton set , it 's remarkable how none of them seem to have aged since they were last on screen .
Can it be that time is going backwards ?
It 's just like a classic Red Dwarf plotline .
Back To Earth - Part One is on Dave on Good Friday , 10 April 2100 BST .

A Race Against Time
March 28 , 2009 March 28 , 2009
“ The Modern Militia Movement ” – the report written by Missouri law enforcement which lists support for Ron Paul , Chuck Baldwin , or Bob Barr for president as a sign of involvement in the militia movement – is very troubling .
While the report has drawn much criticism , little attention has been paid to where Missouri law enforcement got their information from .
My immediate suspicion was that the report was written with the help of either the Southern Poverty Law Center or the Anti-Defamation League .
Minimal Internet detective work has shown that my suspicion was correct , and that the report was written with the assistance of the latter group .
While the Anti-Defamation League of B’nai B’rith purports to be a Jewish civil rights organization , in reality the ADL is a left - wing advocacy group which conducts extensive surveillance on individuals and groups across the political spectrum .
The San Francisco district attorney accused the ADL of conducting a national “ spy network ” after a 1993 raid on the organization ’s San Francisco offices uncovered computer files [ including stolen confidential police documents containing personal information ] on 9,876 individuals and more than 950 groups .
Noam Chomsky decried the ADL ’s “ Stalinist - style mentality and behavior ” after a detailed 150 - page report on his activities was leaked to him by someone within the group .
While the ADL denies engaging in illegal activities , they boast of their “ nationwide fact - finding infrastructure . ”
According to their web site , they specialize in gathering , analyzing and disseminating intelligence on extremism to law enforcement agencies in order for them to combat “ serious threats ” .
[ efoods ]
The ADL regularly conducts “ extremism training ” classes for law enforcement , where they instruct officers on “ extremist ideologies ” and share effective investigation and prosecuting techniques to combat these ideologies .
According to the ADL ’s web site , an extremism training class for Missouri law enforcement was held in Arnold , Mo. in March 2008 , in which officers from 25 different agencies heard lectures from “ ADL experts on right - wing extremism . ”
It ’s likely that documentation provided to law enforcement officers at this meeting was the basis for the “ Modern Militia Movement ” report written by Missouri law enforcement .
Almost the entire Missouri report is composed of cursorily re-worded documents publicly available on the ADL ’s web site .
The first similarity I noticed was this one below .
See if you can spot the similarities between the two selections ( compare the italicized text ) .
Selection on “ Underground Groups ” in the Missouri report
These groups primarily adhere to the principles of Louis Beam ’s philosophy of leaderless resistance .
This philosophy advocates small autonomous cells driven by ideology rather than by the direction of leaders .
These groups are difficult to gather intelligence on as no one outside of the cell would be aware of the organization or its plans .
Individuals or “ lone wolves ” have also been known to adhere to the principles of leaderless resistance in order to perform or plot acts of violence .
Selection on “ Leaderless Resistance ” ( a.k.a. “ lone wolf ” theory ) from the ADL
Beam called for an overhaul of the movement ’s tactics ; he advocated the formation of small , autonomous underground groups driven by ideology rather than by the directions of leaders and membership organizations .
Because those outside the cell would not be aware of planned attacks , Beam explained , leaks or infiltration became far less likely .
I thought I was pretty clever for figuring this out , but in fact nearly the entire Missouri edocument is a re-wording of documents available on the ADL ’s web site .
Simon Jester , a poster at the ConnectMidMissouri forum , discovered that the entire section on the Christian Identity movement in the Missouri report was copied nearly verbatim from an ADL source .
The one exception seems to be the section of the Missouri report on “ Political Paraphernalia ” that mentions Paul , Barr , and Baldwin .
The ADL has previously branded Ron Paul a “ far - right conservative ” with extremist views on taxes , but there ’s nothing on their web site associating him with the militia movement .
Also , a search of the ADL ’s website returns no matches for either “ Chuck Baldwin ” or “ Campaign for Liberty ” .
If the rest of the Missouri document was based on information provided by the ADL , you can be sure the section on Paul , Barr , and Baldwin was as well .
We can safely assume the ADL has been closely monitoring the activities of Ron Paul and the Campaign for Liberty .
Noam Chomsky ’s secret ADL file was 150 pages .
Any guesses as to how long Ron Paul ’s file is ?
It ’s worth noting that the ADL has been in the forefront of national and state efforts to pass hate crimes legislation .
To date 45 states and the District of Columbia have statutes for bias crimes , many of which have been based on the ADL ’s model hate crimes legislation originally drafted in 1981 .
The David Ray Ritcheson Hate Crimes Prevention
Act of 2009 ( HR 262 ) , which could pass in Congress this session , will construct a federal hate crimes command center in Washington , D.C. with an annual cost of $ 10 million to taxpayers .
This command center will not be run by the federal government but by the ADL .
Ron Paul and the Campaign for Liberty should aggressively combat the ADL and this latest hate crimes bill .

ONE of the prices humanity seems to pay for getting richer is the rise of asthma .
This life - threatening , allergy - driven lung disease is common in wealthy countries , absent from poor ones and on the rise in those making the transition .
But exactly what causes it is unknown .
A number of explanations have been proposed .
These range from the idea that clean modern living makes the immune system over - reactive to random allergens to the thought that chemicals in swimming pools are responsible .
What these ideas have in common is the suggestion that some environmental change which accompanies economic development is the cause .
A group of researchers led by Shadmehr Demehri of Washington University , in St Louis , believe these explanations are looking in the wrong place .
Asthma is not , they think , caused directly by environmental factors .
Rather , the link is indirect .
The direct cause is a chemical distress signal produced in skin that is damaged by another hazard of modern life : eczema .
Eczema is also on the rise in the industrialised world , in the same sorts of countries where asthma is a problem .
Unlike asthma it is not dangerous , so people rarely worry about it .
Nevertheless , 17 % of children in America have it , and similarly high figures are found in Australia , Britain and New Zealand .
What is particularly intriguing is that many people with eczema go on to develop asthma ( in America the figure is 70 % ) .
That compares with an asthma prevalence of 4 - 8 % in the general population .
As they describe in Public Library of Science Biology , Dr Demehri and his colleagues now believe they know what causes this link .
The culprit is thymic stromal lymphopoietin ( TSLP ) , a signalling molecule secreted by damaged skin cells which elicits a strong immune response from the body to fight off invaders .
Dr Demehri and his team hypothesised that eczema - induced TSLP enters the bloodstream and , when it arrives at the lungs , sensitises them so that they react to allergens that would not previously have bothered them .
In other words , they become asthmatic .
They tested their hypothesis in a series of experiments on mice .
First , using genetic engineering , they created mice prone to the kind of skin defects found in eczema .
These mice were , as they hoped , susceptible to asthma .
Then they used additional engineering to delete the gene for the receptor molecule which picks up TSLP in the lungs .
These mice no longer developed asthma .
Thirdly , they engineered mice to produce high levels of TSLP in their skin in the absence of other skin problems .
These mice also developed asthma .
Taken together these experiments indicate — at least in mice — that skin damage creates susceptibility to asthma by releasing TSLP .
If that proves true in people , too , it suggests several ways asthma might be prevented .
One is to take eczema seriously , and treat it early .
The usual treatment is to apply steroids to the damaged skin , but there is evidence that some parents reject this treatment for their children .
If a link between eczema and asthma were properly established , that reluctance would probably diminish .
In the longer term , it might be possible to devise drugs that inhibit the production of TSLP or interfere with TSLP - receptor molecules in the lungs .
Better still , though , would be to work out what aspect of modern life causes eczema .
One possible culprit related both to cleanliness and bathing is the widespread use of detergents .
By degreasing the skin , modern detergents might lead to infection and inflammation .
At the moment , that idea is just speculation .
But the question is an itch that certainly needs a scratch .
In the summer of 1997 , at the age of fifteen , I learned a valuable life lesson .
And I learned it the hard way .
Leave It There For Now
“ Go deep ! ” Roger shouts .
I sprint as fast as I can , but not fast enough .
The football flies over my head , bounces off the ground , and takes a massive leap over the schoolyard ’s fence .
It lands in private property on the opposite side .
“ Ahh … jeez ! ” I yelp .
“ That ’s the witch lady ’s yard !
You ’re going to go get that ! ”
“ No I ’m not ! ” Roger insists .
“ I had to deal with that freak last week .
So this time it ’s your turn . ”
“ Man , she creeps me out !
The way she speaks … and that hairy mole on her nose … yuck .
I do n’t feel like dealing with her .
It ’s my football , and I ’d rather just leave it there for now and get it later . ”
“ Fair enough , I ’m ready to do something else anyway , ” Roger replies .
“ Let ’s head over to the arcade .
I would n’t mind whooping your butt in a few rounds of Street Fighter . ”
“ Hah , you wish !
I ’ll destroy you , but not today .
I promised my mom I would n’t leave the schoolyard . ”
Roger rolls his eyes .
“ Dude , you ’re such a goody - goody .
The arcade is practically across the street .
We ’ll be back here long before your mom comes looking for us . ”
I think for a second .
“ Well … alright , screw it .
Let ’s go . ”
We jump on our bikes and peddle off to the arcade .
It ’s Too Late
Thirty minutes later , Roger is begging for mercy .
“ Ah , today is just your lucky day , ” he gripes .
“ Do n’t let it get to your head . ”
I chuckle .
“ Yeah , yeah … I did n’t say a word .
But we do need to get back to the schoolyard so I can get my football . ”
We jump back on our bikes , peddle to the crosswalk , and wait for the ‘ walk ’ signal .
“ Okay , ‘ walk , ’ we ’re good !
Last one to the witch ’s house is a rotten egg ! ”
Roger shouts .
I have about a six foot head start on him , so I begin peddling as fast as I can .
“ No Marc !
Watch out ! ” Roger squeals in a panic .
I look up just in time to see a black car speeding directly at me through the red light .
I leap from my bike .
But it ’s too late .
My lanky fifteen year old body smashes into the windshield , flips lifelessly over the roof of the car , and strikes the concrete with a sickening thud .
Barely conscious , bloody , and broken .
I vaguely hear Roger ’s voice crying for help over the sound of screeching tires … as the black car speeds away from the scene of the accident .
He ’s Our Guardian Angel
I open my eyes slowly and my vision gradually comes into focus .
“ Hey honey , ” my mom says .
“ Where am I ? ”
“ You ’re in the hospital , dear .
But the surgeon said you ’re going to be just fine . ”
“ Surgery ? ”
“ It ’s okay , you ’ve already been through surgery in the ER , ” my mom replies as she grasps my hand .
“ You cracked four of your ribs , which punctured your lungs .
But they went in and stitched you back together . ”
“ That … That … ”
My mom interrupts me as tears begin rolling down her cheeks .
“ We just need to be grateful … because you were barely breathing , honey .
The surgeon said your lungs were filled with blood .
He said it could have been a lot worse had the ambulance not gotten to you in time . ”
“ That car … that black car … it ran the red light , ” I whisper restlessly .
“ Shhh … It ’s okay , ” my mom reassures me .
“ The same wonderful man that called the ambulance also called the police with the license plate number of the black car .
The driver was drunk .
It was a hit and run .
But the police already have him in custody . ”
“ Do you know who made the calls ? ”
My mom reaches into her jeans pocket , pulls out a post - it note , and holds it up so I can read it .
“ Chris Evans – 305-555-8362 ” is written in red ink .
“ Chris Evans , ” my mom says as she takes a deep breath .
“ Whoever he is , he ’s our guardian angel . ”
“ How ’d you get his name and number ? ”
“ I asked the paramedics for it .
They told me they were n’t supposed to give out this kind of information , but I begged , ” my mom says .
“ I told them I needed to know who saved my baby ’s life . ”
“ Have you called him ? ”
“ Yeah , but he does n’t answer my calls .
It rings four times and goes straight to a voicemail beep .
There ’s not even a voice greeting .
I ’ve already left three messages over the last forty - eight hours .
But he has n’t called me back , and I suspect he may never . ”
How Do You Know ?
Six months later , after a grueling recovery process , my doctor finally gives me the nod to partake in regular physical activity again .
Roger and I jump at the chance to toss his new Nerf football around at the schoolyard .
“ Go deep ! ” Roger shouts .
“ Not yet , dude .
I ’m still not 100 % .
My doctor says I need to ease into it slowly .
Cool ? ”
Roger smiles .
“ Yeah , of course , bro .
My bad , I did n’t mean to … ”
He is suddenly interrupted .
“ Marc ! Marc Andrew something ! ” a raspy female voice hollers from behind us .
Roger and I turn around and are shocked to see the witch lady peeking her head over the schoolyard ’s fence .
“ I believe this belongs to you . ”
She holds up an old football and tosses it towards me .
The ball bounces across the ground and rolls up to my feet .
Sure enough , it ’s the ball I left on her property the day of the accident .
“ Thanks , but … how … how do you know my name ?
And my middle name ? ” I ask .
“ About six months ago , your mom left me a few voicemail messages .
My name is Chris Evans , ” she says .

1 - Always forgive your enemies - Not ...
An 18 - year - old hacker with a history of celebrity pranks has admitted to Monday 's hijacking of multiple high - profile Twitter accounts , including President - Elect Barack Obama's , and the official feed for Fox News .
The hacker , who goes by the handle GMZ , told Threat Level on Tuesday he gained entry to Twitter 's administrative control panel by pointing an automated password - guesser at a popular user 's account .
The user turned out to be a member of Twitter 's support staff , who'd chosen the weak password " happiness . "
Cracking the site was easy , because Twitter allowed an unlimited number of rapid - fire log - in attempts .
" I feel it 's another case of administrators not putting forth effort toward one of the most obvious and overused security flaws , " he wrote in an IM interview .
" I 'm sure they find it difficult to admit it . "
The hacker identified himself only as an 18 - year - old student on the East Coast .
He agreed to an interview with Threat Level on Tuesday after other hackers implicated him in the attack .
The intrusion began unfolding Sunday night , when GMZ randomly targeted the Twitter account belonging to a woman identified as " Crystal . "
He found Crystal only because her name had popped up repeatedly as a follower on a number of Twitter feeds .
" I thought she was just a really popular member , " he said .
Using a tool he authored himself , he launched a dictionary attack against the account , automatically trying English words .
He let the program run overnight , and when he checked the results Monday morning at around 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time , he found he was in Crystal 's account .
That 's when he realized that Crystal was a Twitter staffer , and he now had the ability to access any other Twitter account by simply resetting an account holder 's password through the administrative panel .
He also realized he had n't used a proxy to hide his IP address , potentially making him traceable .
He said he had n't used a proxy because he did n't think the intrusion was important enough to draw law - enforcement attention , and " did n't think it would make headlines . "
He said he decided not to use other hacked accounts personally .
Instead he posted a message to Digital Gangster , a forum for hackers and former hackers , offering access to any Twitter account by request .
" I ... threw the hack away by providing DG free accounts , " he said .
He also posted a video he made of his hack to prove he had administrative access to Twitter .
President - Elect Barack Obama was among the most popular requests from Digital Gangster denizens , with around 20 members asking for access to the election campaign account .
After resetting the password for the account , he gave the credentials to five people .
He also filled requests for access to Britney Spears ' account , as well as the official feeds for Facebook , CBS News , Fox News and the accounts of CNN correspondent Rick Sanchez and Digg founder Kevin Rose .
Other targets included additional news outlets and other celebrities .
Fox won the hacker popularity contest , beating out even Obama and Spears .
According to Twitter , 33 high - profile accounts were compromised in all .
GMZ does n't know what the reset passwords were , because Twitter resets them randomly with a 12 - character string of numbers and letters .
On Monday morning , the Twitter accounts belonging to Obama , Britney Spears , FoxNews and others , began sending out bogus messages .
Someone used the Obama account to send out a message urging supporters to click on a link to take a survey about the president - elect , and be eligible to win $ 500 in gasoline .
A fake message sent to followers of the Fox News Twitter feed announced that
Fox host Bill O'Reilly " is gay , " while a message from Britney Spears '
feed made lewd comments about the singer .
It was initially believed that the Twitter account hijackings were related to two phishing scams that surfaced over the weekend .
But GMZ 's hack was unrelated .
Shortly after GMZ posted his original message to Digital Gangster , the site 's administrator deleted it , along with the responses from members asking for access to other accounts .
But a subsequent thread on the site supports GMZ 's account of the hack .
GMZ said he did n't access any of the high - profile accounts himself , and did n't send out any of the bogus tweets .
He thinks he was in
Twitter a couple of hours before the company became aware of his access and locked him out .
Twitter co-founder Biz Stone confirmed for Threat Level that the intruder had used a dictionary attack to gain access to the administrative account , but would n't confirm the name of the employee who was hacked , or the password .
He also would n't comment on how long the intruder was in the Twitter account resetting passwords before he was discovered .
" Regarding your other questions , I 'd feel more comfortable addressing them once we 've spoken to counsel because this is still ongoing , " he wrote Threat Level in an e-mail .
Stone said that Twitter has already been contacted by the Barack
Obama campaign about the hack and has been in touch with everyone whose account was accessed by the intruders .
He said Twitter had not had contact with the FBI or any other law enforcement agency .
" We 're waiting to hear back from our lawyer about what our responsibilities are about this and how to approach it , " Stone said in a separate phone interview .
As for addressing the security issues that allowed the breach , he wrote in a follow - up e-mail that the company is doing " a full security review on all access points to Twitter .
More immediately , we 're strengthening the security surrounding sign - in .
We 're also further restricting access to the support tools for added security . "
GMZ , who said he 's been hacking for about three years and is currently studying game development , said he conducted the dictionary attack using a script he wrote and used last November to break into the
YouTube account of teen queen Miley Cyrus .
That hack gained widespread attention when someone posted a – video memorial to Cyrus on the account , claiming Cyrus had died in a car accident .
GMZ said a friend of his was responsible for the hoax .
GMZ said he 's used the same dictionary attack to breach the SayNow accounts of Disney star Selena Gomez and other celebrities .
After YouTube blocked his IP and patched some vulnerabilities he was exploiting , he decided " for the fun of it ( curiosity and self - entertainment ) I 'll pen-test Twitter . "
He was " shocked to realize that there was no rate limit " to lock someone out after a specific number of failed password attempts .
He said he'd never even heard of Twitter until he saw someone mention it on YouTube .

Peter Power , the former Scotland Yard official Anti-Terrorist Branch official , who oversaw drills of the very events of the London bombings on the morning of 7/7 as they were happening , has revealed more details behind the events for the first time in three and a half years .
A statement , apparently from Mr Power , has appeared in the comments section of a recent blog posting regarding comments Power made on the BBC last week .
As we highlighted , the “ crisis management expert ” revealed that some companies used the shut down of the city of London on Wednesday , during the G20 protests , as a dress rehearsal for an influenza pandemic .
In response to an explanation of who Peter Power is , which was added by the Uncensored Magazine blog , Mr Power himself posted a lengthy statement in which he reveals that the company he was working with on 7/7 was London based information giant Reed Elsevier .
The company is most notable for its ownership of the Lexis / Nexis legal database , as well as many other information sources .
As Elsevier , it runs a vast number of science journals , including some of the biggest and most reputable ones .
Reed is also known as a host of large exhibitions .
The company part owns the ExCel Centre in London ’s Docklands area , where the G20 summit was held this past weekend .
Here is Peter Power ’s statement in full :
There has been much nonsense written about why my company ran an exercise on 7 July 2005 that had very close parallels to the real thing that day .
Since then I have made several attempts to add my own comments to numerous sites that seem to get increasingly excited about their own conspiracy theories and in the process exclude any rational debate .
It seems those who occupy the world of finding conspiracy theories to replace just about any coincidence , do not want to have any dialogue with those offering a different view , but I have not yet given up hope .
I am therefore hoping , perhaps naively , that someone might like to read an honest and factual account about a particular exercise my company ran in London three years ago .
Unfortunately , the BBC had postponed in 2008 a programme in their ‘ conspiracy files ’ series that would have done this .
Our client three years ago agreed to be named in the BBC programme since the attitude of the producer and his team was very balanced ( several conspiracy theorists were also invited to take part ) .
We even allowed our complete exercise material to be made available to the BBC .
Regrettably broadcasting in 2008 might have jeopardised an ongoing court case , so they had little choice about postponing it to 2009 .
Early in 2005 Reed Elsevier , an organisation specialising in information and publishing that employs 1,000 people in and around London , asked us to help them prepare an effective crisis management plan and rehearse it before sign - off .
Several draft scenarios were drawn up and the crisis team themselves set the exercise date and time : 9.00 am on 7 July .
The test was planned as a table - top walk through for about six people ( the CM team ) in a lecture room with all injects simulated .
Everything was on MS PowerPoint .
The location of their Central London office near to Chancery Lane was chosen as one test site .
With many staff travelling to work via the London underground system , the chosen exercise simulated incendiary devices on three trains , very similar to a real IRA attack in 1992 , as well as other events .
As there had been eighteen terrorist bomb attacks on tube trains prior to 2005 , choosing the London Underground was logical rather than just prescient .
With this in mind it was hardly surprising that Deutsche Bank had run a similar exercise a few days before and , prior to that , a multi-agency ( and much publicised ) exercise code - named Osiris II had simulated a terrorist attack at Bank tube station .
Moreover , I had also taken part in a BBC Panorama programme in 2004 as a panellist alongside Michael Portillo MP et al , in an unscripted debate ( we had no idea at all what the scenario was to be ? ) on how London might once again , deal with terrorist attacks , only this time it was fictional ( created entirely by the BBC ) .
In short , some of the research for our exercise had already been done .
The scenario developed for our client even started by using fictitious news items from the Panorama programme then , as with any walk through exercise , events unfolded solely on a screen as dictated by the facilitator without any external injects or actions beyond the exercise room .
Also factored into the scenario was to be an above ground fictitious bomb exploding not far from the head office of the protected Jewish Chronicle magazine where for exercise purposes , our imagined terrorists would have been aware that commuters would now be walking to work ( past a building already considered a target ) as some tube stations would have been closed .
Of just eight nearby tube stations that fell within possible exercise scope , three were chosen that , by coincidence , were involved in the awful drama that actually took place on 7 July 2005 .
A level of scenario validation that on this occasion , we could have done without .
An exercise that turns into the real thing is not that unusual .
For example , in January 2003 , thirty people were injured when a tube train derailed and hit a wall at speed .
At the same time , the City of London Police were running an exercise for their central casualty bureau where the team quickly abandoned their plans and swung into action to cope with the real thing .
For a surprising number of people such coincidents cannot be accepted as such .
There just has to be a conspiracy behind them , despite the obvious point that painstaking research will always identify probable above possible scenarios .
By the way , the only reason I was asked to speak on TV news that day , when there was still much confusion about the real tragedies , was to encourage more organisations to thoroughly plan their own exercises knowing the threat of terrorism is and remains , very real .
One tragic consequence being Islam , a great Abrahamic , monotheistic faith ( along with Judaism and Christianity ) , has undeservedly become vilified by some people .
Peter Power
Visor Consultants
To re-cap the situation , on the afternoon of July 7th , 2005 , Power told a BBC radio interviewer that his company was running an exercise for an unnamed group that revolved around three bombs going off at precisely the same tube stations and precisely the same time as those that were hit that morning .
The transcript is as follows .
PETER POWER :
At half past nine this morning we were actually running an exercise for a company of over a thousand people in London based on simultaneous bombs going off precisely at the railway stations where it happened this morning , so I still have the hairs on the back of my neck standing up right now .
HOST : To get this quite straight , you were running an exercise to see how you would cope with this and it happened while you were running the exercise ?
POWER : Precisely , and it was about half past nine this morning , we planned this for a company and for obvious reasons I do n’t want to reveal their name but they ’re listening and they ’ll know it .
And we had a room full of crisis managers for the first time they ’d met and so within five minutes we made a pretty rapid decision that this is the real one and so we went through the correct drills of activating crisis management procedures to jump from slow time to quick time thinking and so on .
The odds of such a coincidence are absolutely staggering , which led some to charge that Power ’s drill was set up ahead of time , or used by people with insider foreknowledge of 7/7 .
Just as happened on 9/11 , when exercises involving hijacked aircraft overlapped with the real attacks , some charge that the drill was a cover for the real attack in case any of its perpetrators were caught .
Power alluded to the nature of the simulations in the days after 7/7 , in an effort to downplay the significance of the mock - versus - real events .
Less than one week after the bombings , as Power and his company Visor consultants received correspondence and questions , mostly stemming from our articles on the drills , a short statement was issued , concluding with the following comments :
“ Beyond this no further comment will be made and based on the extraordinary number of messages from ill informed people , no replies will henceforth be given to anyone unable to demonstrate a bona fide reason for asking ( e.g. accredited journalist / academic ) . ”
Power ’s culpability is seemingly minimal – after all why would he announce the drill on national radio hours after the attack ?
– but his reaction to questions regarding the drills highlighted that he was not comfortable discussing the subject further .
Indeed , in December 2007 , when Power was approached politiely by members of the We Are Change group , who explained who they were and what they were doing , he refused to answer any of their questions on camera , saying he would not tolerate the approach .

Guest Editorial by Sibel Edmonds
" In politics we presume that everyone who knows how to get votes knows how to administer a city or a state .
When we are ill ... we do not ask for the handsomest physician , or the most eloquent one . "
--- Plato
During the campaign , amid their state of elation , many disregarded Presidential Candidate Senator Barack Obama 's past record and took any criticism of these past actions as partisan attacks deserving equally partisan counterattacks .
Some continued their reluctant support after candidate Obama became grand finalist and prayed for the best .
And a few still continue their rationalizing and defense , with illogical excuses such as ' He 's been in office for only 20 days , give the man a break ! ' and ' He 's had only 50 days in office , give him a chance ! ' and currently , 'be reasonable - how much can a man do in 120 days ?!'
I am going to give this logic , or lack of , a slight spicing of reason , then , turn it around , and present it as : If ' the man ' can do this much astounding damage , whether to our civil liberties , or to our notion of democracy , or to government integrity , in ' only ' 120 days , may God help us with the next [ ( 4 X 365 ) - 120 ] days .
I know there are those who have been tackling President Obama 's changes on change ; they have been challenging his flipping , or rather flopping , on issues central to getting him elected .
While some have been covering the changes comprehensively , others have been running right and left like headless chickens in the field - pick one hypocrisy , scream a bit , then move on to the next outrageous flop , the same , and then to the next , basically , looking and treating this entire mosaic one piece at a time .
Despite all the promises Mr. Obama made during his campaign , especially on those issues that were absolutely central to those whose support he garnered , so far the President of Change has followed in the footsteps of his predecessor .
Not only that , his administration has made it clear that they intend to continue this trend .
Some call it a major betrayal .
Can we go so far as to call it a ' swindling of the voters ' ?
On the State Secrets Privilege
Yes , I am going to begin with the issue of State Secrets Privilege ; because I was the first recipient of this ' privilege ' during the now gone Administration ; because long before it became ' a popular ' topic among the ' progressive experts , ' during the time when these same experts avoided writing or speaking about it ; when many constitutional attorneys had no idea we even had this " law " - similar to and based on the British ' Official Secret Act ; when many journalists did not dare to question this draconian abuse of Executive Power ; I was out there , writing , speaking , making the rounds in Congress , and fighting this ' privilege ' in the courts .
And because in 2004 I stood up in front of the Federal Court building in DC , turned to less than a handful of reporters , and said , ' This , my case , is setting a precedent , and you are letting this happen by your fear - induced censorship .
Now that they have gotten away with this , now that you have let them get away , we 'll be seeing this ' privilege ' invoked in case after case involving government criminal deeds in need of cover up . '
Unfortunately I was proven right .
So far The Obama administration has invoked the state secrets privilege in three cases in the first 100 days : Al Haramain Islamic Foundation v. Obama , Mohammed v. Jeppesen Dataplan , and Jewel v. NSA .
In defending the NSA illegal wiretapping , the Obama administration maintained that the State Secrets Privilege , the same draconian executive privilege used and abused voraciously by the previous administration , required the dismissal of the case in courts .
Not only has the new administration continued the practice of invoking SSP to shield government wrongdoing , it has expanded its abuses much further .
In the Al Haramain case , Obama 's Justice Department has threatened to have the FBI or federal marshals break into a judge 's office and remove evidence already turned over in the case , according to the plaintiff 's attorney .
Even Bush did n't go this far so brazenly .
In a well - written , disgust - provoking piece plaintiff 's attorney Jon Eisenberg , poses the question : " The president 's lawyers continue to block access to information that could expose warrantless wiretapping .
Is this change we can believe in ? "
This is the same President , the same well - spoken showman , who went on record in 2007 , during the campaign shenanigans , and said the following :
" When I am president we wo n't work in secret to avoid honoring our laws and Constitution . "
-- Presidential Candidate Barack Obama , 2007
Yes , this is the same President who had frowned upon and criticized the abuses and misuse of the State Secrets Privilege .
[ Update 5/23/09 : Judge threatens Obama administration with sanctions if they fail to obey court 's order by refusing to turn over documents detailing illegal wiretaps in the Al Haramain case , by " continuing to assert legal positions already specifically rejected by the court in previous orders " .

On NSA Warrantless Wiretapping
The new Administration has pledged to defend the Telecommunications Industry by giving them immunity against any lawsuit that may involve their participation in the illegal NSA wiretapping program .
In 2007 , Obama 's office released the following position of then Senator Obama : " Senator Obama unequivocally opposes giving retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies ... Senator Obama will not be among those voting to end the filibuster . "
But then Senator Obama made his 180 degree flip , and voted to end the filibuster .
After that , along with other colleagues in Congress , he tried to placate the critics of his move by falsely assuring them that the immunity did not extend to the Bush Administration - the Executive Branch who did break the law .
Another flip was yet to come , awaiting his presidency , when Obama 's Justice Department defended its predecessor not only by using the State Secrets Privilege , but taking it even further , by astoundingly granting [ PDF ] the Executive Branch an unlimited immunity for any kind of ' illegal ' government surveillance .
Let me emphasize , the Obama Administration 's action in this regard was not about ' being trapped ' in situations created and put in place by the previous administration .
These were willful acts fully reviewed , decided upon , and then implemented by the new president and his Justice Department .
Accountability on Torture
President Obama 's action and inaction on Torture can be summarized very clearly as follows :
First give an absolute pass , under the guise of ' looking forward not backward , ' to the ultimate culprits who had ordered it .
Next , absolve all the implementers , practitioners and related agencies , under the excuse of ' complying with orders without questioning , ' and then start giving the ' drafters ' of the memos an out by transferring the decision for action to the states .
After granting the ' untouchable ' status to all involved in this shameful chapter in our nation 's dangerous downward slide , he now refuses to release the photos , the incriminating evidence , and is doing so by using the exact same justification used repeatedly by his predecessors : ' Their release would endanger the troops , ' as in ' the revelation on NSA would endanger our national security ' and ' stronger whistleblower laws would endanger our intelligence agencies ' and so on and so forth .
Not only that , he goes even further to shove his secrecy promotion down other nations ' courts throat .
In the case of Binyam Mohamed , an Ethiopian citizen and a legal resident in Britain who was held and tortured in Guantanamo from 2004 to 2009 , and filed lawsuits in the British courts to have the evidence of his torture released , Mr. Obama 's position has been to threaten the British Government in order to conceal all facts and related evidence .
This case involves the brutal torture and so very ' extraordinary ' rendition practices of the previous administration , the same practices that ' in words ' were strongly condemned by the President during his candidacy .
Today he and his administration unapologetically maintain the same Bush Administration position on extraordinary rendition , torture , and related secrecy to cover up .
Here is Ben Wizner 's , the attorney who argued the case for the ACLU , response " We are shocked and deeply disappointed that the Justice Department has chosen to continue the Bush administration 's practice of dodging judicial scrutiny of extraordinary rendition and torture .
This was an opportunity for the new administration to act on its condemnation of torture and rendition , but instead it has chosen to stay the course . "
Yes indeed , President Obama has chosen to protect and support the course involving torture , rendition and the abuse of secrecy to cover them all up .
The Revival of Bush Era Military Commission
After all the talk and pretty speeches given during his presidential campaign on the ' failure ' of Bush era military tribunals of Guantanamo inmates , Mr. Obama has decided to revive the same style military commission , albeit with a little cosmetic tweak here and there to re-brand it as his own .
Many former supporters of Mr. Obama who 've been vocal and active on Human Rights fronts have expressed their ' total shock ' by this move and its pretense of being different and improved , " As a constitutional lawyer , Obama must know that he can put lipstick on this pig - but it will always be a pig , " said Zachary Katznelson , legal director of Reprieve .
Thankfully the ' on the record ' statements of Candidate Obama in 2008 on this issue , contradicting his action today , are accessible to all :
" It 's time to better protect the American people and our values by bringing swift and sure justice to terrorists through our courts and our Uniform Code of Military Justice . "
Suspect terrorists ( emphasis on ' suspect ' ) cannot have just trials consistent / in line with our ' courts and Uniform Code of Military Justice ' via military commissions .
It 's almost an oxymoron !
And if you add to that the other Obama - approved ingredients such as secrecy , rendition , and evidence obtained under torture , what have we got ?
Anything resembling our courts and Uniform Code of Military Justice system ?
On War and Bodies Piling Up
Here is the first paragraph in a New York Times report on May 15 , 2009 :
" The number of civilians killed by the American air strikes in Farah Province last week may never be fully known .
But villagers , including two girls recovering from burn wounds , described devastation that officials and human rights workers are calling the worst episode of civilian casualties in eight years of war in Afghanistan . "
The report also includes the disagreement over the exact number of ' Civilian Casualties ' in Afghanistan by our military airstrike :
" Government officials have accepted handwritten lists compiled by the villagers of 147 dead civilians .
An independent Afghan human rights group said it had accounts from interviews of 117 dead .
American officials say that even 100 is an exaggeration but have yet to issue their own count . "
Does it really matter - the difference between 147 and 117 or just 100 when it comes to children , grandmothers … innocent lives lost in a war with no well - defined objectives or plans ?
If for some it indeed does matter , then here is a more specific and detailed report :
" A copy of the government 's list of the names , ages and father 's names of each of the 140 dead was obtained by Reuters earlier this week .
It shows that 93 of those killed were children --- the youngest eight days old --- and only 22 were adult males . "
Maybe releasing the photographs of the nameless unrepresented victims of these airstrikes should be as important as those of torture .
Because , from what I see , they and their loss of lives have been reduced to some petty number to fight about .
When I was around twelve years old , in Iran , during the Iran - Iraq war , my father , a surgeon in charge of a hospital specializing in burns and reconstructive surgery , decided to take me to the hospital to teach me an unforgettable lesson on war .
I think one of the factors that prompted him was my new obsession with classic war movies ; you know , ones like ' the Great Escape . '
Anyhow , he took my hand and we entered a ' transition ICU Unit . '
In that room , on a standard size hospital bunk bed , laid an infant of eight or nine months of age , or what was remaining of her .
Over eighty percent of her body was burned ; to a degree that the skin had melted and absorbed the melting clothing on top - impossible to remove without removing the skin with it .
Instead of a nose two holes were drilled in the middle of her face with tubes inserted allowing breathing , the upper eyelids were melted and glued to the lower ones , and …I am not going to go further - I believe you get the picture .
This baby was the victim of an air strike , a bombing that killed her entire family and leveled her modest home to the ground .
My father pointed at this heartbreaking baby and said , " Sibel , this is war .
This is the real face of war .
This is the result of war .
Do you think anything can justify this ?
I want to replace the glamorous exciting phony images of those war movies in your head .
I want you to remember this for the rest of your life and stand against this kind of destruction … "
And I do .
This is why I am offended by those petty numbers when it comes to civilian deaths .
This is the reason I believe some may need pictures of these atrocities as much as those of torture to replace those ' Shock & Awe ' footages fed to them by our MSM .
All this death and destruction is carried out while the administration 's Afghan policy is still murky and confused , and it 's strategy ambiguous .
Sure , our so - called ' New ' Afghan Strategy includes more troops and asks for a much larger budget allocation ; nothing new there .
It is another war with no time table .
It is the continuation of the same abstract ' War on Terror ' without any definition of what would constitute an ' accomplished mission . '
One minute there is pondering on possible ' reconciliation ' with the Taliban , and the next minute seeking to topple it .
In fact , to confuse the matter even further , we now hear this distinction between ' Good Taliban , Bad Taliban , and the Plain Ugly Taliban . '
As stated by Karzai on Meet the Press on May 10 , 2009 , not all Taliban are equal !!
I can go on listing cases of Mr. Obama 's change on change .
Whether it is his reversal on protection for whistleblowers , despite his campaign promise to the contrary , or his expansion of the Un - American title of ' Czardom , ' where we now have more czars than ever : Border Czar , Energy Czar , Cyber Security Czar… Car Czar…maybe even a Bicycle Czar !.
Or …But for now I 'll stick with the major promises that were ' Central ' to him getting elected , all of which he has flipped on in less than 150 days in office , a track record indeed .
What I want the readers to do is to read the extremely important cases above , step back in time to those un-ending campaign trail days , and answer the following questions :
How would Senator McCain have acted on these same issues if he had been elected ?
How would Senator Hilary Clinton ?
Do you believe there would have been any major differences ?
Were n't their records almost identical to Senator Obama 's on these issues ?
If you are like me , and answer ' same , ' ' same , ' ' no , ' and ' yes , ' then , why do you think we ended up with these exact same candidates , those deemed ' viable ' and sold to us as such ?
With too much at stake , too many unfinished agendas for the course of our nation , and too many skeletons in the closet in need of hiding for self - preservation , the ' permanent establishment ' made certain that they took no risk by giving the public , via their MSM tentacles , a coin that no matter how many times flipped would come up the same - Heads , Heads .
" Politics will eventually be replaced by imagery .
The politician will be only too happy to abdicate in favor of his image , because the image will be much more powerful than he could ever be . "

As most of us know it , charity toward others is among humanity 's greatest virtues .
There is a purity to the very word .
It is a principle of selflessness and sacrifice dwelling at the very core of the Christian faith .
To give is to receive .
To be charitable toward the downtrodden , toward society 's less fortunate , is to share in the very nature of God .
Charity is emblematic of the best in us , regardless of faith , bringing to mind a cornucopia of wealth flowing the right way , from the haves to the have - nots .
With little or nothing expected in return save the exquisite joy of giving .
Charity affirms our souls .
For those reasons and more , many of us - dare we say most - find something offensive in " charity " that is , in fact , a means of profiteering .
Virtually all true charities measure their benevolence by how little they extract from the till .
Watchdog groups - the Better Business Bureau 's Wise Giving Alliance , for example - typically measure a charity 's effectiveness by the percentage of its receipts that are spent on " program activities . "
How much they actually give to the poor , in other words .
For over a year , Arizona Republic reporter Robert Anglen and his editors have tracked the activities of an intricately knit group of charities that appears to have violated some of those basic principles of giving .
While these charities do , in fact , provide resources of food and medicine to the needy , often in far - flung points on the globe , their operators appear to expect - and receive - a great deal in return for themselves .
Like luxury cars and disturbingly high salaries for charity operators .
The charity operators appear to have used cash donations to pay for their salaries , travel and expenses while using the ( often inflated ) value of food and medical supplies to understate their operating expenses as a percentage of donations .
Following a paper trail
The many charity organizations tied to the Don Stewart Association , a Phoenix Christian ministry , have a system .
Over a three - year period , 22 charities tied to the Stewart association reported $ 154 million in revenue , four - fifths of it in the form of food and medicine , according to The Republic 's investigation .
Of that $ 154 million , fully $ 82 million of it involved food and medicine the charities never handled .
They were all on paper .
And with every paper donation of hard goods a charity in the Stewart system receives , the bottom line of each charity is enhanced , making it more appealing to potential cash donors .
And the ratio of expenses racked up by each charity 's directors - virtually all of them tied by family or business association to Christian preacher Don Stewart himself - dwindles in comparison to the seemingly enormous supplies of food and medicine each charity handles .
Handles , that is , on paper .
Today through Wednesday , The Republic reports on the charities tied to Don Stewart .
On the intricate system of transactions .
On the tight , often familial relationships of the charity directors , whose operations ( often located in residences or , in one case , a post - office box ) are spread across cities in the U.S. , Canada , Europe and the Near East .
Further , Anglen reports on the deep concerns watchdog groups have with these charities , which receive financial contributions from the Combined Federal Campaign , a source of $ 273 million overall in charitable contributions last year from a million federal employees .
Anglen 's reporting already appears to be generating results .
Piqued with interest following Anglen 's inquiries , Canadian officials have shut down a " charity " in British Columbia that facilitated the transfer of goods within the network of Stewart - related charities - at least on paper .
The " charity , " operated by a couple that spends half the year in France , is less a charity than a middleman or broker , according to the Canadians .
The clever , tightly woven scheme appears to be unraveling .
A flawed system of giving
Anglen 's reporting can be found both on Republic news pages and online .
The online reporting includes graphics and interactive imagery that depict , with stunning clarity , the depth of interplay among the web of charities tied to the Phoenix - based Stewart .
The food , the medicine and the services go back and forth incessantly .
Almost always on paper .
And the cash gets spread around from charity to charity , bolstering the bottom line of each charity and allowing for the inflated expenses , such as salaries and vehicles .
And burnishing a false image of charitable efficiency for each one .
Anglen 's detailed reporting has revealed a gross flaw in the system that allocates the precious dollars of well - intentioned givers to the nation 's charities .
The system is clearly broken .
Among the most serious problems in need of immediate fixing : the system of charitable " federations " that gives groups like the Stewart - related charities credibility , yet which themselves are reliant on their members for their funding .
The charity game appears to be an easy one to manipulate .
A nation that donated $ 300 billion to charitable causes in 2006 - a nation of citizens committed to the virtue of selflessness toward others , in other words - should not be made the prey of clever schemers who game the system to their own advantage whether their scheme is legal or not .
It is , at the least , uncharitable .
People who can speak two languages are more adept at learning a new foreign language than their monolingual counterparts , according to research conducted at Northwestern University .
And their bilingual advantage persists even when the new language they study is completely different from the languages they already know .
" It 's often assumed that individuals who 've learned multiple languages simply have a natural aptitude for learning languages , " said Viorica Marian , associate professor of communication sciences and disorders at Northwestern University .
" While that is true in some cases , our research shows that the experience of becoming bilingual itself makes learning a new language easier . "
In the first study to explore a possible advantage in bilinguals who learned a second language at a parent 's knee , Northwestern researchers asked three groups of native English speakers -- English - Mandarin bilinguals , English - Spanish bilinguals and monolinguals -- to master words in an invented language that bore no relationship to English , Spanish or Mandarin .
They found that the bilingual participants -- whether English - Mandarin or English - Spanish speakers – mastered nearly twice the number of words as the monolinguals .
And they believe the bilingual advantage is likely to generalize beyond word learning to other kinds of language learning , including learning new words in one 's own language and a very basic ability to maintain verbal information .
" After learning another language , individuals can transfer language learning strategies they 've acquired to subsequent language learning and become better language learners in general , " said Northwestern School of Communication 's Marian .
advertisement
Marian and Margarita Kaushanskaya , now assistant professor of communicative disorders at University of Wisconsin - Madison , are co-authors of " The Bilingual Advantage in Novel World Learning . "
Their study will be published in the August issue of Psychonomic Bulletin and Review .
The study has important implications for educators who are considering the appropriate age at which to introduce foreign language instruction as well as for parents who in increasing numbers have an option to enroll their children in dual language immersion programs .
" We 're seeing that exposure to two languages early in life carries far - reaching benefits , " said co-author Kaushanskaya .
" Our research tells us that children who grow up with two languages wind up being better language learners later on . "
Although there are more opportunities today for children to participate in dual language immersion programs than in the past , parents often avoid them for fear that dual language instruction may end up confusing or distracting their children and inhibit subject learning .
In research presented in the May issue of the Journal of Experimental Psychology , however , the two co-authors demonstrate that bilinguals actually are better able than monolinguals to inhibit irrelevant information while learning a new language .
Repressing irrelevant information , after all , is something bilinguals do every time they speak .
advertisement
What 's more , the majority of the world 's population outside the United States is bilingual or multilingual , Marian noted .
In the U.S. , approximately one out of five American households speaks a language other than English at home , according to the U.S. Census .
And , with higher birth rates among Hispanics relative to the rest of the population , that proportion is rapidly growing .
Previous research already indicates that individuals who have formally studied two or more languages as adults more easily acquire a new language than monolinguals .
New research even indicates that the onset of Alzheimer 's disease in bilinguals is , on average , delayed by four years compared to monolinguals .
The Northwestern researchers chose to study bilinguals who learned a second language at an early age and in a non-classroom study to avoid suggestions that their subjects simply were exceptionally talented or motivated foreign language learners .
For their study in Psychonomic Bulletin and Review , the researchers controlled for age , education , English language vocabulary size and , in the case of bilinguals , second language proficiency .
Sixty Northwestern University students in their early twenties -- 20 monolinguals , 20 early English - Mandarin speakers and 20 early English - Spanish speakers – participated .
All participants were tested twice for word mastery in the invented language .
The initial test took place immediately after they heard and repeated the invented language words .
The second test occurred a week later .

MENLO PARK , Calif . 
In 2003 , when Foundation Capital , a venture capital firm , started looking for new investors for Silver Spring Networks , one of its portfolio of companies , it was rejected by every firm it called .
Investors in clean technology were just not excited about Silver Spring , because it makes hardware and software that utilities use to connect electric meters in a digital grid .
They were more interested in companies that envisioned making energy from the sun ’s rays , algae or tropical plants .
“ People laughed at us , ” said Adam Grosser , a partner at Foundation Capital .
Last summer , the thinking in Silicon Valley began to shift .
Five top venture firms vied to invest in Silver Spring .
The company chose Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers , perhaps the most well - known green technology investor , and two of its partners , John Doerr and Al Gore , joined Silver Spring ’s advisory board .
Venture capital is starting to move away from its infatuation with alternative energy and returning to one of its traditional strengths : applying information technology to improve the efficiency of energy consumption .
Refusing to leave well enough alone , crazypants former D.C. mayor and current City Council member Marion Barry declares just because the D.C. Council approved the recognition of out - of - state same - sex marriages , the fight is n’t over : “ All hell is going to break lose .
We may have a civil war .
The black community is just adamant against this .
…
What you ’ve got to understand is 98 percent of my constituents are black and we do n’t have but a handful of openly gay residents .
Secondly , at least 70 percent of those who express themselves to me about this are opposed to anything dealing with this issue .
The ministers think it is a sin , and I have to be sensitive to that . ”
His comments came after a group of anti-gay ministers stormed the council building and “ caused such a ruckus that security guards and police had to clear the hallway .
The protesters shouted that council members who voted for the bill will face retribution at the polls . ”

Here is a question :
If I gave you the choice between a $ 100 bill right here and now , and $ 200 when GM goes bankrupt , which would you take ?
If you responded with the $ 200 answer , then you understand that GM is most likely going bankrupt .
Going ‘ short ’
GM shares right now looks like an absolutely brilliant stock pick , but what happens if you end up being wrong ?
Throw GM out the window now , and lets talk about Google .
If I gave the same option for Google , I would bet the response would be more along the lines of the $ 100 option .
This transaction can be simulated by a stock market game , one of which can be played at fool .
com and is more commonly known as The Motley Fool Caps system .
In the Caps system , normal people and wall streeters alike combine to form one giant investment tracking system .
User / players of the Caps system make their own stock picks and rate them underperform ( short ) or outperform ( long ) depending on where they think the individual stock will go in a chosen time frame .
Wall streeters are lumped into their own category and tracked separately from the plebeians to gauge how accurate or inaccurate an individual investor or investing organization is .
People like favorite reddit whipping boy Jim Cramer are tracked on The Motley Fool so that the users of the caps system can research just about anyone who makes or attempts to make accurate market calls .
As you can see from the link , Jim ’s accuracy in calling a stock pick is ‘ only ’ 46 % , but the extent to which his picks make money puts him very much in the positive earnings category , because his incorrect calls lose only a small amount , while his correct calls are more than enough to make up the meager losses and put him in the top 1 percent of money earners .
As a reward for picking your stocks publicly as part of the caps system , you may find yourself one day considered a Caps All - Star .
You may be asking , what does the GM bet have to do with the Motley Fool Caps system ?
The answer to that question lies in the study of the Motley Fool All - Stars and their method to get to the top .
A quick glance at the Motley Fool All - Star list shows EverydayInvestor at the top .
Can it be that a mere mortal is SO good at stock picking , he beats out others like Warren Buffett or the Wall Street powerhouse JP Morgan Chase carrier to noise ratio ?
According to EverydayInvestor ’s Caps score , you should be listening to him for investing advice .
There are , however , an awful lot of red thumbs on EI ’s caps page and even more red in the score column , while Buffett and JP Morgan show many more green thumbs and a much lower accuracy percentage .
Why then , is EI considered the Motley Fool cream of the crop , while Buffett and JP Morgan both reside in the middle of the pack even amongst fellow wallstreeters ?
The answer is : solvency !
Motley
Fool does not have any concept of solvency built into the system , so users like EI can red thumb everything , effectively going short every stock that smells even a slight bit foul , without having to deal with a margin call .
This effectively gives them unlimited capital with which to ‘ invest ’ without needing to worry about the cataclysmic effect of a short squeeze .
In the real world , you have to be on margin to go short a stock , but on the motley fool caps system , no mechanism exists to simulate margin requirements .
Margin Calls are a fact of life for every investor on margin .
When an investor makes a bad call on margin , the investor is required by the broker to satisfy a difference in what he or she has outstanding with a minimum capital requirement specified by the broker .
The process with which the broker and investor battle back and forth is the process of the investor staying solvent .
I refer to this process here as a battle , because your ability to make correct calls , coupled with your ability to raise and maintain capital to remain solvent is a battle that many , many investors are involved in every day .
I find it intriguing that the Motley Fool Caps system has no way of tracking how under the water the red thumb armies would be if they were required to make a margin call in the event one of their shorts goes south ( or more likely North .. ) .
A great example is that EI ’s worst performing call ever lost 487 % of its value .
It is only possible to loose that high a percentage when you are short .
The problem is that you end up losing other peoples money when you make that bad of a call .
And those other people want it back , with interest , in a short amount of time , or they will liquidate your other holdings with extreme prejudice .
Margin calls are exceptionally nasty , in that a broker can take any other open position you have and close it to get its money back after a certain time period , if you do n’t deposit the money you owe or come up with the money under your own power .
Real investors are aware that this can occur , and therefor have to make their bets very very carefully , and often hedge against a major potential upswing or downturn in their position .
Motley Fool Caps participants , however , have no such dire consequence , and as such , their top tier of All - stars are just amateurs red thumbing everything to be an All - Star , while most of the other participants have not caught on to the concept yet .
This is similar to figuring out that in the 80’s Sega video game “ College Football National Championships ” , you can use CU to throw Hail Mary ’s all day and win the game .
A simple loophole in the game was discovered , and now everyone is using it to look like an All - Star .
It is readily apparent that The Motley Fool Caps system is conceived and implemented as a game , and as such , the results of the game are arbitrary and insignificant .
At current however , around 67,000 people are involved in the Caps System , and the ones at the top would most likely be insolvent , while the remainder simply have n’t figured out that you can just use the red thumb to get to the top .

In the middle of this decade , Americans bought 17 million cars per year ( .8 per driver per decade ) .
Now they 're buying 9 million ( .4 per driver per decade ) .
Detroit is terrified that Americans have discovered that they can get by on used cars , rental cars , and public transportation and that new car sales have been permanently hammered .
As with other sectors of the economy -- retail sales , real estate , etc. -- the most likely scenario is a " new normal " well below the peaks of recent years but above the current lows .
Some of the current paralysis is from fear about the economy rather than poverty or lack of desire .
So what 's the " new normal " for cars ?
The chart below , from the New York Times , shows how cyclical the industry 's sales have been ( until the last recession ) .
The crash in the oil crisis of the late 70s , leading into the recessions of the early 1980s , saw a similar decline .
Assuming the sales of the early and mid 1990s represent a non -bubble average , sales should eventually rebound to 14 - 15 million or so .

Thanks to a reader for the correction .
China is a creditor country with large current account surpluses , a small budget deficit , much lower public debt as a share of G.D.P. than the United States , and solid growth .
And it is already taking steps toward challenging the supremacy of the dollar .
Beijing has called for a new international reserve currency in the form of the International Monetary Fund ’s special drawing rights ( a basket of dollars , euros , pounds and yen ) .
China will soon want to see its own currency included in the basket , as well as the renminbi used as a means of payment in bilateral trade .
Image Credit ...
Gary Taxali
At the moment , though , the renminbi is far from ready to achieve reserve currency status .
China would first have to ease restrictions on money entering and leaving the country , make its currency fully convertible for such transactions , continue its domestic financial reforms and make its bond markets more liquid .
It would take a long time for the renminbi to become a reserve currency , but it could happen .
China has already flexed its muscle by setting up currency swaps with several countries ( including Argentina , Belarus and Indonesia ) and by letting institutions in Hong Kong issue bonds denominated in renminbi , a first step toward creating a deep domestic and international market for its currency .
If China and other countries were to diversify their reserve holdings away from the dollar  and they eventually will  the United States would suffer .
We have reaped significant financial benefits from having the dollar as the reserve currency .
In particular , the strong market for the dollar allows Americans to borrow at better rates .
We have thus been able to finance larger deficits for longer and at lower interest rates , as foreign demand has kept Treasury yields low .
We have been able to issue debt in our own currency rather than a foreign one , thus shifting the losses of a fall in the value of the dollar to our creditors .
Having commodities priced in dollars has also meant that a fall in the dollar ’s value does n’t lead to a rise in the price of imports .
Now , imagine a world in which China could borrow and lend internationally in its own currency .
The renminbi , rather than the dollar , could eventually become a means of payment in trade and a unit of account in pricing imports and exports , as well as a store of value for wealth by international investors .
Americans would pay the price .
We would have to shell out more for imported goods , and interest rates on both private and public debt would rise .
The higher private cost of borrowing could lead to weaker consumption and investment , and slower growth .
This decline of the dollar might take more than a decade , but it could happen even sooner if we do not get our financial house in order .
The United States must rein in spending and borrowing , and pursue growth that is not based on asset and credit bubbles .
For the last two decades America has been spending more than its income , increasing its foreign liabilities and amassing debts that have become unsustainable .
A system where the dollar was the major global currency allowed us to prolong reckless borrowing .
This quote , from Newsweek 's piece on former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson , strikes me as a bombshell :
Paulson -- by his own admission -- was not paying much attention to the way banks were slicing and dicing mortgages and selling them as complex securities .
" I did n't understand the retail market ; I just was n't close to it , " he told NEWSWEEK .
If Newsweek wo n't play prosecutor , I will : " Hank Paulson , you were Goldman 's chief executive as mortgage securities boomed in 2004 - 5 .
Your earned an incredible severance , partly because of it .
And you say you did n't understand mortgage securities ?
How is that remotely possible ? "
I 'd like to offer a bit of analysis , but all I 've got is bewilderment .
The reason I find the revolving door between Wall St. and Washington somewhat acceptable is that I think it 's important that those who govern Wall Street understand it .
But Paulson , by his own admission , did n't really .
Think about this :
A guy whose $ 46 million compensation package was made possible by leaving during Goldman 's mortgage - security boom " was not paying much attention " to the mortgage - security boom !
I do n't know if Paulson is fibbing , or if mortgage - securities were such a specialized and esoteric money machine that basically nobody understood what was going on , but either way , this seems devastating .
Also in the department of buried leads , Paulson denies " secretly arranging " Bank of America 's merger with Merrill Lynch .
That also seems impossible to believe .
New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo testified in April that Paulson and Ben Bernanke did strong - arm Ken Lewis into eating Merrill 's big ugly balance sheet .
The article claims that B of A's chief exec Ken Lewis was interested in snagging Merrill 's retail brokers .
Well look , retail brokers are nice things to have , but clearly Lewis was more interested in the Feds not gutting his board in retribution !
Apparently Paulson is resuscitating his reputation like a doctor defibrillating a patient with wooden stakes , but just as culpable here is Newsweek .
This was the magazine 's fresh attempt to appear like something other than a bullhorn for conventional wisdom .
It seems to me that one really good way to stop seeming like a mouthpiece for the half - truths of powerful people is n't more dynamic graphics -- it's to stop being a mouthpiece for the half - truths of powerful people .

[ Index ] Anne- Sophie Mutter -
The fiddler who should be banned By Norman Lebrecht / October 5 , 2005 Read Send a Musical Greeting Card

Norman Lebrecht on the 100 Definitive Recordings
La Scena Musicale CD and Book Reviews
Only one classical musician has been banned from London in my time .
There have been music directors who threatened to leave town forever unless they got a pay rise - a transparent ruse to secure increased orchestral subsidy from the Arts Council - and one celebrated conductor stayed away for years after a well - whispered brush with the constabulary in a popular West End cottage .
But only one artist was ever sent packing .
The cause was cash and I regret to report that the soloist in question is up to her old tricks again .
Twelve years ago , four London orchestras set aside their rivalries and agreed to inform Anne-Sophie Mutter , the German violinist , that they were not going to book her again until she dropped her £ 10,000 fee .
Mutter 's office replied by fax that this was her standard rate .
Not in this town it is n't , said the bands , and for two seasons London got along fine without the sight and sound of the bare - shouldered beauty .
There was no dip in audiences and other soloists flourished until , fearing for her sales in the world 's fourth largest record market , Mutter cut her London rate by twenty percent and returned to circulation , mostly with the London Symphony Orchestra .
The episode shed little credit on anyone concerned , least of all the orchestras who had acted as a cartel which , if challenged , might have been declared illegal .
Still , the point was well made , and it was promptly taken by the rest of the classical roundabout .
Stars who were paid fifty grand in greenbacks at Carnegie Hall - Perlman , Kissin , Vengerov - settled for thirty percent of that on the South Bank .
Mutter , meanwhile , developed a perfectly pre-packaged style of performance .
What you see on stage , you hear on her DG record , neither more nor less .
She scarcely looks at the audience and seldom gives an encore .
Few musicians give so little for so much dosh .
Back home , in Germany , she is treated as minor royalty , heir to the all - powerful aura of Herbert von Karajan , who picked her out as a child of 13 and set her on the golden path .
' It was Karajan 's wish I played Mozart , ' she told Gramophone magazine recently .
' If he 'd said jump out of the window , I probably would have done that , too . '
America saw her first in a gravity - defying strapless gown that caused outbreaks of fast breathing in elderly subscribers .
After the death of her first husband , a successful corporate lawyer , she married Andre Previn , a conductor whose triumphs are long past .
At 42 she makes well over three million dollars a year from sixty performances , which is more than the combined income of players in a symphony orchestra in Britain or Scandinavia .
Ahead of next year 's Mozart jamboree - it 's the 250th anniversary of his birth - Mutter astutely organised a world tour of the violin concertos and sonatas .
The LSO booked her sonata cycle , three nights at £ 30,000 each - breaking the budget rules , but just about justifiable in terms of a warm longterm relationship and virtual exclusivity .
Then Mutter decided to play the concertos with the London Philharmonic at an earlier brace of concerts , and record them for DG .
By the time she reached the Barbican a fortnight ago , whatever musical curiosity London felt about her Mozart had been thoroughly exhausted and only sixty percent of the tickets were sold .
The Barbican echoed with empty spaces and the LSO , which paid for the series , was left with a substantial loss .
Mutter , I hear on the grapevine , was asked to reduce her invoice and bluntly refused .
True , she was always bound to be a loss leader .
The Barbican has two thousand seats .
The LSO would have had to charge £ 15 a ticket to cover the fee , and that 's without house rent , promotional costs and her accompanist 's tiny wage .
Booking Mutter was a charitable farewell gesture by ex-LSO boss Clive Gillinson who will now be working closely with her at Carnegie Hall .
I hope the orchestra put it down to experience and reimpose the old ban on the bumptious fiddler , for anything less will incite rampant inflation in London 's musical fee structures .
Why are orchestral managers tempted to overpay the likes of Mutter ?
Because they think her smidgeon of fame will attract a lashing of celebrity seekers .
A sixty percent turnout proves them wrong .
The lady has no more pulling power than a one - armed dentist with a manual drill .
Concert stardom these days is not what it was in the lifetime of Rubinstein and Horowitz .
Few , outside her own country , would know Anne- Sophie Mutter from a soap bubble .
Replacing her with a rising talent would have minimal impact on sales , while booking her actively depresses the careers of sharper , keener , more exciting prospects .
Every time Mutter breaks the bank with an overpolished Mozart , a door is slammed in the face of a host of young contenders - Lisa Batiashvili , Nicola Benedetti , Rachel Podger , Matt Trusler , Daniel Hope , Jack Liebeck , to name a talented half - dozen in Britain alone who bring impetuosity and vigour to an art that is dying of ennui .
If the orchestras wo n't ban greedy - guts soloists , the funding authorities should step in .
Music is paid for in part by the taxpayer , who does not generally approve of subsidising rich foreigners unless they play football , and in part by private and corporate donors whose innocence of musical economics is cruelly abused by avaricious musicians .
A principle needs to be re-established .
Money that is given to the arts in a spirit of idealism should be put towards creative renewal .
Any other purpose is bad for business and death for art .
The time has come to impose a ceiling on concert fees of the kind that prevails in all the leading opera houses .
Nobody , not even Pavarotti , got more than $ 15,000 for appearing at the Metropolitan Opera in New York .
Not enough ?
said manager Joe Volpe .
Go sing in a park .
And while Pavarotti could earn a million any night of the week miming arias to a pre-recorded tape in a supermarket car - lot , if he wanted to retain credibility as an opera singer he accepted the Joe Volpe pay freeze and delivered his high Cs for a reasonable fee .
Covent Garden and La Scala pay by much the same rules .
It keeps the books clean , and the singers honest .
Concert halls and orchestras need to absorb that lesson , drawing the line at any soloist who seeks to hold them to ransom .

Just when it seemed most everyone in the tech industry was gearing up for the release of Windows 7 this Christmas , the U.S. Army has announced it will soon upgrade its PC systems to the much - maligned Windows Vista operating system .
It 's surprising but welcome news for Microsoft , which has been criticized for Vista 's faults since the OS release in 2007 .
The decision to upgrade United States Army PC desktops from Windows XP to Windows Vista was announced yesterday , and early reports suggest the military plans to complete the change by next year .
The announcement is good news for Microsoft , which has faced numerous studies suggesting that business and home users alike are planning to skip Vista altogether , opting to make the leap from XP all the way to Windows 7 .
Rubbing salt in the wound were the Fiasco awards , which chose Windows Vista over Google 's Second Life rival ' Lively ' and the stunted One Laptop Per Child campaign for top " honors " .
Fiasco or Not , Vista Much Improved
However , Microsoft has worked hard to improve the compatibility and security problems afflicting Vista .
The company has also assured potential Windows 7 buyers that the upgrade from Vista to Win7 will be easier than the transition made from XP .
Clearly , the U.S. Army bought into that .
In addition to the operating system overhaul , it will also upgrade all copies of Microsoft Office 2003 to Office 2007 .
That means it wo n't wait until the 2010 version ; reports suggest this decision was made for security concerns , a point Microsoft may someday soon need to comment on .
( Source : neoseeker.com )
Army Upgrade Includes 700,000 + PCs
As you might expect , this marks an enormous victory for Microsoft 's attempts to keep Vista popularity up prior to the release of Windows 7 sometime this holiday season .
The U.S. Army switch marks one of the biggest mass - upgrades in the history of American computing .
Sources reveal that the Army could make the switch on all of its three - quarters of a million desktop PCs .
( Source : techradar.com )
Reports suggest the military has been pondering this decision for some time , settling upon Vista because of its superior data encryption features .
This week ’s project is a collaboration with Rob from the always - entertaining - but - hard - to - describe science / prank / DIY / investigative journalism site Cockeyed.com .
He had the brilliant idea of making an Amazon Kindling — a wireless wooden e-book ( which uses no electricity …. ) , and we were pleased to help out .
You can read his writeup here .
It came out well , and you can even use it as firewood when you ’re done reading .
Amongst his other projects , Rob has a long and remarkable history of putting unusual objects on eBay– and apparently the Kindling qualifies – his auction is here .
Update 5/14 , 11:55 PM : eBay has pulled the auction .
That ’s surprising – it was accurately described , listed in the “ sculpture ” category , and very clearly a parody .
( No sense of humor , some people . )
Update 5/15 , 12:15 AM : The auction appears to have been reinstated .
( Have to keep an eye on this . )

In an interview with North Dakota radio host Scott Hennen former vice president Dick Cheney said that it would be a mistake for the Republican Party to become more moderate .
He said that doing so would mean changing the fundamental philosophy of the GOP .
Cheney also said that the older Republicans should move on , but yet he is still here , helping the Democrats .
Cheney was asked if he thinks that the GOP should moderate .
He answered , “ No I do n’t .
I think it would be a mistake for us to moderate .
This is about fundamental beliefs and values and ideas … what the role of government should be in our society , and our commitment to the Constitution and Constitutional principles .
You know , when you add all those things up the idea that we ought to moderate basically means we ought to fundamentally change our philosophy .
I for one am not prepared to do that , and I think most us are n’t . ”
He did mention that it was time to clean out the older members of the party , “ So I think periodically we have to go through one these sessions .
It helps clear away some of the underbrush … some of the older folks who ’ve been around a long time ( like yours truly ) need to move on , and make room for that young talent that ’s coming along .
But I think it ’s basically healthy .
I do n’t spend a lot of time or lose a lot of sleep over it .
I just think now is the time for people who are committed to get out there and find candidates they like and go to work for them . ”

I think Cheney is one for two on this one .
He is correct that the Republican Party needs to clean out the old faces and move forward with some new blood .
The problem that they have is that their party is seriously lacking new blood and fresh ideas .
It took the Democratic Party 12 years to rebuild after they lost control of Congress in 1994 , and I think it may take the GOP even longer because they lost Congress in 2006 , and are still in denial .
Cheney is way off on his first point .
The Republican Party will never win another election by not moving to the middle .
The GOP leadership does n’t not see that their party can move to the middle without sacrificing its values and principles , and until they figure this out , they will continue to lose elections badly .
This is great news for Democrats because as long as Republicans continue to listen to Dick Cheney , they will still be stuck in the past .
Nevada Gov. Jim Gibbons ( R ) has promised to veto the domestic partnership bill .
His spokesperson Daniel Burns has said that :
" The governor believes that government has no business in your medicine chest or your bedroom "
He also believes there are existing contracts that can be created , so no change to the law is needed .
If there are people who want to be domestic partners , they can do so under existing laws .
He is also mindful of the fact that voters of this state on two occasions have said that marriage is between a man and a woman , and it 's part of our Constitution . "
It is unfair to deny domestic partners equal rights , and create legal obstacles for partners to obtain the same rights when it comes to estate planning , family planning , and medical decision making .
To contact Governor Jim Gibbons :
State Capitol
101 N. Carson Street
Carson City , NV 89701
( 775 ) 684-5670
Fax : ( 775 ) 684-5683
E-contact form
The good news is that there is word there may be enough votes within the state senate to override the Governor 's veto .
It is imperative Nevada residents contact their senators to urge for passage of senate bill 283 .
LAKE ELSINORE , California ( CNN ) --
The two - story homes on Fir Circle in an upscale Lake Elsinore , California , neighborhood tell two stunningly different tales .
Mary Ann and Derrick Lepley bought a home for nearly $ 300,000 less than what the previous owners paid .
Some are vacant , bank - owned and beat - up inside .
Others are filled with kids ' laughter and the sounds of boxes unpacking and families moving in .
Mary Ann Lepley , her husband , Derrick , and their 2 - year - old daughter , Melody , have been in their 3,000 square - foot home here for about three months .
They bought it for about $ 250,000 .
Just two years ago , amid California 's housing boom , the same house sold for nearly $ 550,000 .
" My heart goes out to everybody that lost their home [ and ] lost their jobs , " says Derrick Lepley .
" I 'm real sympathetic toward them .
But the reality for us was , if this did n't happen , we would n't be in this situation . "
Walking through his spacious four - bedroom home , he says , " We feel fortunate . "
His wife adds , " We love our new home .
...
We 're just really grateful for the market dropping , so we were actually able to buy a home . "
See what states are being hammered by foreclosures »
With the nation facing historically high foreclosures , many Americans -- like the Lepleys , who have been cautious with their spending and savings in recent years -- are using this opportunity to buy their dream homes , large comfy places that once seemed completely unattainable .
A private report issued this week showed that housing prices in 20 major cities have plummeted at record levels , down 19 percent from a year earlier .
Home prices have plunged 29.1 percent nationally since they peaked during the second quarter of 2006 , according to the S&P Case - Shiller Home Price Index .

" Right now any distressed property that goes from being available to being occupied is a good thing , because it reduces inventory on the market , " said Rick Sharga , senior vice president of RealtyTrac , which lists 1.8 million foreclosed and bank - owned property across the nation .
" Even though the properties are selling at a dramatic discount from a couple years ago , in most of these markets , the simple truth is that the properties were wildly overpriced -- and only able to be sold because there was such recklessness in lending practices . "
Lake Elsinore is in Riverside County , one of the hardest hit counties in the nation 's foreclosure mess .
The scenic community about 70 miles southeast of Los Angeles is dotted with large suburban homes .
The streets are lined with " for sale " signs .
" The banks have dropped the homes tremendously in the past few months and homeowners that usually could n't purchase before are being able to purchase at very low prices right now , " said Rachel Morales , a realtor in the area .
Nearly 23,000 homes in Riverside County alone are listed as " bank owned " on RealtyTrac .
One in 80 homes is now in the foreclosure process , according to the county assessor 's office .
" Riverside County is in the middle of the mortgage meltdown , " says county assessor Larry Ward .
" It 's really tough on people , the foreclosures and prices that dropped below $ 100 a square foot . "
Next door to the Lepleys are Frank and Leslie Aceves .
They are in the midst of a different situation .
They are trying to " short sell " their house in order to avoid foreclosure and lose everything to the bank .
The couple has two children , ages 10 and 3 , and they bought their 3,500 square - foot home for $ 620,000 a few years ago .
A house about the same size across the street recently went for $ 267,000 .
" We just did n't think it would happen , " Leslie Aceves says of the massive drop in prices .
" We just thought it would stop somewhere . "
Neighbors Shane Latham and Kathy Valdez , a couple in their 20s , bought their house for $ 220,000 -- nearly $ 300,000 less than what it was a couple of years ago .
" We 've got to feel for people , " Latham says .
Valdez adds , " I 'm in my 20s .
I mean , why not ?
A house right now , we could afford it . "
It 's a tale of ecstasy and agony : One person 's gain from others ' pain playing out across America .
" It 's unfortunate for those who are going through such tough times , " says Mary Ann Lepley .
" But in some ways , we were really glad that we were able to do something we would n't have been able to do otherwise . "

In trying to create the most Earth - friendly , energy - efficient buildings possible , architects and engineers have stumbled on a problem they had n't fully understood : You .
Your desktop computer that 's on , even when you 're out to lunch .
The power - hogging photo copier in your office and its incessant red light .
And then there 's the space heater under your desk , keeping you warm because the building is too cold .
Designers have found ways to make cooling and heating systems more efficient than ever , mainly by using cutting - edge technology and old - school techniques such as natural ventilation .
But some of the greenest buildings in the world are undermined by human behavior and the traditions of engineers who design structures , build them and leave them for fallible humans to figure out later .
To make buildings truly sustainable , engineers say they need to sit down with the people who will live and work in their projects .
" Education of the occupants and involvement of the occupants is increasingly important , " says Omid Nabipoor , president of Portland 's Interface Engineering .
" They need to buy into strategies and understand how they can change their behavior . "
Energy - saving solutions
Strides in heating - and cooling - system efficiency have raised pressure to cut small appliances ' power use .
Here are some resources for cutting your energy use .

It 's true that consumer and desktop electronics are puny consumers of energy compared with the massive furnaces and air conditioning chillers that make offices comfortable year - round .
At home , the refrigerator and furnace soak up far more energy than the cell phone charger and stereo equipment .
But the elite of the green building industry have already figured out how to cut energy bills for heating and cooling by 50 percent or more .
In an age when green is a new metric of competition , and energy bills seem to go nowhere but up , energy use by small electronics has become a large concern .
It 's keeping green designers from achieving their next goal : Popularizing offices and homes that have " net zero " energy use - meaning that in the course of a year they should use no more energy than can be produced by their own solar panels .
Some months , they buy power from a local utility ; other months , they sell excess back to the power company .
" When you 've squeezed everything down to a much smaller pie , what 's left , the human factor , becomes the next thing we need to tackle to get down to the next level , " says Jason McLennan , an architect influential in the green building movement .
For years , architects and engineers could largely ignore the behavior of the people who would live and work in their buildings , says McLennan , chief executive officer of the Cascadia Region Green Building Council .
A real estate developer would call for a house , an office building or a hospital , and the design team would draw up as much space as needed , with no regard for energy use .
They just assumed that every desk required a desktop computer , and not a more efficient laptop .
And that workers would n't tolerate indoor temperatures higher than 75 degrees , even in August .
But programs like the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design , or LEED , raised the question of how much energy and water are consumed by buildings .
As architects and engineers pushed the program , developers reaped lower energy bills and some pushed for more innovation .
LEED calls for building designs that use far less energy than industry standards , and for testing on completion .
But a question lingers :
Are green buildings really as efficient as we think they are ?
The answer :
In many cases yes , but often not for the greenest of green buildings .
" We 're being overly optimistic in what we think we 're doing in designing the most elite buildings , " says Mark Frankel , technical director for the New Buildings Institute , based in Vancouver .
Frankel spoke at the Living Future conference last week at Portland 's Nines Hotel , where about 500 architects and engineers gathered to brainstorm buildings even greener than the LEED system requires .
The New Buildings Institute studied 120 LEED - certified buildings and found their actual energy use varied widely .
Most were still more efficient than a typical nongreen building , but the actual energy use was often far from the forecast , Frankel says .
Designers assume that building managers understand new , often complex energy - monitoring systems , but often they do n't .
And the people who live or work in the building usually have no idea how much energy they use .
That 's because the building can't tell them .
A case in point : Oregon Health & Science University 's first building on the South Waterfront is a highly acclaimed LEED " platinum " building .
It uses 50 percent less energy than a typical medical office building , among a panoply of green features .
According to a post - occupancy study , the energy use for heating and cooling were about as low as forecast , Interface Engineering 's Nabipoor says .
But the OHSU building also consumes nearly twice as much energy from small electronic appliances as engineers had expected .
" Occupants are not as responsible as we once thought about turning things off , " Nabipoor says .
The OHSU project is n't alone in underestimating the energy demand from plugged - in electronics , what engineers call " plug loads . "
A Pacific Lutheran University building in Tacoma uses more than four times the energy from plug loads that Portland 's PAE Consulting Engineers Inc. had forecast .
Engineers are investigating what happened :
They suspect some computer science professors are using multiple computers .
Interface Engineering has come up with energy - saving strategies for the Oregon Sustainability Center , a cutting - edge high - rise office building planned near Portland State University .
The project is planning to have " net zero " energy use - a key requirement of the Living Building Challenge , a new green building system that goes beyond the LEED program to more sustainable standards .
Engineers and the nonprofits that will rent space in the building are considering a range of approaches .
Perhaps each cubicle could have an energy meter .
Workers could compare meters , see the effects of appliances and compete to use less energy .
Using laptops instead of desktop computers can reduce power consumption by 70 $ ? percent .
Ceiling - mounted occupancy sensors can power off electrical outlets when a worker leaves a workstation .
Some receptacles could stay on at all times for items such as refrigerators and aquariums .
Technology alone wo n't get most new buildings to " net zero " energy use anytime soon , says Stephen Selkowitz , head of the Building Technologies Department at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory .
" The technology alone probably wo n't get you there , and the behavior alone wo n't get you there , " Selkowitz says .
" But the combination of the two is even more powerful . "

The recent Pew findings — that churchgoers , especially white evangelical Protestants , are more likely to believe that torture can be justified — have caused many commentators to wonder whether particular forms of Christian theology engender an acceptance of the use of torture .
In a recent article on Religion Dispatches , Sarah Sentilles suggests that Christian theologies and images of Christ ’s crucifixion ( essentially is an act of torture ) have influenced some Christian communities ’ understanding of torture as salvific , necessary , and justified .
This view of torture is especially fueled by what is known as atonement theology : the view that Jesus ’ death provided reparation for humanity ’s sins against God .
So what would a Christian theological response against torture look like ?
Most Christian theologies are rooted in the writings of Paul , who is particularly celebrated this year by the Catholic church on the bimillenial anniversary of the apostle ’s birth ;
Paul provides the earliest interpretation of the meaning of the crucified Christ .
People often forget , or are not aware , that nowhere in the gospels does Jesus himself explain the meaning of his own suffering on the cross .
But Paul does .
And I believe that if we were to bring Paul into our current dialogue about whether Christians should support the use of torture , his response would be a resolute “ No ! ”
First ,
Paul ’s life experiences reflect a radical shift from violence to nonviolence due to his Christian conversion .
The Acts of the Apostles describes Paul before his conversion as persecuting the earliest followers of Christ .
At the outset of a religiously - sanctioned campaign to persecute Christians in Damascus , Paul encounters the risen Christ on the road to Damascus and undergoes a dramatic , religious conversion ; from persecutor to preacher .
Paul ’s encounter with Christ , then , transformed his life of religious violence to a life of love .
When we shift our attention to Paul ’s writings , we see further indications of his stance on nonviolence .
Take , for instance , his statements in Romans ( 12.14 , 16 , 17–21 ) , which echo the themes of nonviolence and non-retaliation in Jesus ’ Sermon on the Mount :
Bless those who persecute you ; bless and do not curse them …
Live in harmony with one another …
Do not repay anyone evil for evil , but take thought for what is noble in the sight of all .
If it is possible , so far as it depends on you , live peaceably with all .
Beloved , never avenge yourselves , but leave room for the wrath of God ; for it is written , “ Vengeance is mine , I will repay , says the Lord . ”
No , “ if your enemies are hungry , feed them ; if they are thirsty , give them something to drink ; for by doing this you will heap burning coals on their heads . ”
Do not be overcome by evil , but overcome evil with good .
Not to Crucify but to be Crucified
Scholars have typically paid little attention to the themes of nonviolence in Paul ’s letters , and some would argue that Paul does not hold such a position .
In recent times , however , a small voice in biblical studies has drawn attention to Paul ’s theme of nonviolence as it relates to his understanding of God ’s restorative justice .
New Testament scholar Richard Hays asserts in The Moral Vision of the New Testament : Community , Cross , New Creation , “ There is not a syllable in the Pauline letters that can be cited in support of Christians employing violence . ”
He further explains that even in cases where Paul employs military imagery in his rhetoric , they “ actually have the opposite effect : the warfare imagery is drafted into the service of the gospel , rather than the reverse . ”
We observe Paul , then , as actually re-visioning violence in light of the gospel .
We see in the life and teachings of Paul a inculcation of a Christian lifestyle of justice and nonviolence through the cross ; one that imitates the crucified Christ who did not inflict suffering on others , but who embraced it for the sake of others .
Michael Gorman , in his book Reading Paul , argues that the saving , restorative justice of God “ takes place not by inflicting violence on the enemy , but by absorbing violence on behalf of the enemy .
Its extreme modus operandi is not to crucify but to be crucified .
It does not require the destruction of the enemy but the embrace of the enemy . ”
I believe that Christians must embrace and embody Paul ’s revision of violence .
This also needs to be applied to our understanding of America ’s rhetoric and activities of justified war and violence , and the “ war on terror . ”
We must be mindful that Christians are to embody the cruciform ethics of not crucifying ( i.e. torturing ) one ’s enemy , but to be crucified ( i.e. be tortured ) on behalf of one ’s enemy .
And our attention needs to be not only on those who are tortured , but perhaps even more so on those who torture .
Rhetoric such as a “ war on terror ” that seeks to eliminate terrorism and condones the use of violence and torture ( i.e. terror ) is contrary to Paul ’s view of God ’s peaceable , restorative justice .
As Gorman argues in his newest book , Inhabiting the Cruciform God : Kenosis , Justification , and Theosis in Paul ’s Narrative Soteriology :
That world leaders who call themselves practicing Christians ( or Muslims or Jews ) seem to espouse such views and that many others who follow such leaders seem prepared to carry out their allegedly sacred violence without question should concern us deeply .
More specifically , as an alternative to this kind of thinking and acting , the church of Jesus Christ must make nonviolence a more central dimension of its life and teaching and a central corollary of its creedal affirmation that God raised the crucified Jesus from the dead , thereby ending the case for violence as the modus operandi of God and of God ’s people in the world .
Those who are in Christ today , with Paul , identify with the life - giving and reconciling cross of Christ , validated by God in the resurrection , not as an expression of a violent personality or a conviction that violence can be sacred and salutary , but in the paradoxical belief that in Christ and his cross God was nonviolently reconciling the world to himself and giving to us the ongoing task of nonviolent reconciliation of people to God and to one another .
In that spirit , we may need to be prepared to absorb violence , but not to inflict it .
Such is one central aspect of the calling of our time to those justified , sanctified , and divinized in Christ .
In sum , Paul ’s stance on nonviolent reconciliation and justice provides us with the necessary anti-torture posture for Christians today as they reflect on and respond to the pressing issues of war , terrorism , and torture .
Will Christians embrace Paul ’s moral vision and lifestyle of justice and nonviolence ?
Hundreds of thousands of people in this country live “ off the grid . ”
If the power fails , food runs short or drought hits , their families wo n’t be hurt .
Their houses have solar panels and electric generators ; their shelves are stocked with canned food and seeds .
They have wells in their back yard so they ’ll never go thirsty .
Some are retreating into farms .
Others are bringing the countryside into their homes .
You ’ll see vegetable gardens growing where once there were pools and barbecues .
Bahia grass , golden rod , and azaleas have fallen to tomatoes , peppers , lettuce , onions , squash , and carrots .
If they do n’t have yards , people are growing vegetables indoors in a study or on the window sill .
Heard of square - foot gardening ?
For a few dollars you can try it yourself .
A professional square - foot gardener will send you prepared sod , seeds , and a prefab grid of small squares in which you plant your seeds .
It does n’t matter any longer if you do n’t have yard space .
And you do n’t have to deal with bad soil , mulch , or pests .
Apparently , you can grow twelve - inch carrots in six inches of soil on your office desk .
You can grow luscious strawberries between your coffee - maker and your dish - rack .
Last year , seed companies and garden shops saw the strongest uptick in sales since inflation took off in the 1970s .
The biggest sellers were survival vegetables — peas , beans , corn , beets , carrots , broccoli , kale , spinach and the lettuces .
I have to laugh .
It ’s what I ’ve been living on all along , even in the boom years .
I love making salads with kale — a humble leafy vegetable that costs a dollar and yet has more nutrients than most others .
Nature gives us everything we need cheap , but wastrels that we are , we ’d rather kill ourselves fighting for what ’s bad for us in the first place .
The off - gridders are independent in other ways .
They ’ve paid off their debts — if they had any — and sold what they do n’t need .
They ’ve turned part of their money into gold and buried it where even their family does n’t know .
Some of them have second and third passports .
Just in case .
These are n’t raccoon country rebels ( no slur to raccoons or rebels ) who never saw a fight they did n’t like .
They are n’t polo- playing speculators winging off to a weekend in Chile .
Or cranks picking at sea-weed and bee - pollen in a New Mexico colony .
They ’re “ regular folk ” who sense trouble ahead and are getting ready for it .
They ’re acting on instinct .
There ’ll be people to tell you those instincts are wrong .
Instincts make people rob , rape , and kill .
Instincts turn us into mobs , and mobs go crazy with greed and fear .
Well , we know that .
We lived through the biggest bubble in history and there were mobs as far as the eye could see — mobs of real estate agents , mortgage lenders , borrowers and consumers , flippers and speculators , bankers and regulators , pundits , pols , and prognosticators .
The pigs and the parasites — we saw them all .
It was mobs all the way up and it ’ll be mobs all the way down .
But every group is not a mob and all instincts are n’t bad ones .
Instinct helps jungle animals escape death .
Deer run when they sense a lion lurking in the growth , and monkeys screech and chatter at the smell of fire .
The hot stink of a carcass and vultures begin to descend .
The sky is dark with vultures now .
And the stench rises not just from Washington and New York but from all over .
Huge tracts of cities have fallen into foreclosure , in California , in Michigan , in Pennsylvania , in Florida .
Whole neighborhoods have been abandoned .
The borders on the south are fracturing from gangs and drugs and murder .
State surveillance and violations of civil freedom are becoming graver by the day .
Things are unraveling at home .
Abroad , the bombing goes on still , manufacturing the chaos it ’s meant to control .
But who would expect anything different .
Take a look around you .
What do you see ?
Fools parading their ignorance publicly , while those who know stay cynically silent .
Criminals flaunting their crimes like medals of honor .
Sycophants in the government fawning and flattering .
And the rest of us — gagged , not by the government but by our own stupidity , cowardice , and blindness .
That will tell you how we got here .
But what are you going to do about it ?
Wait around and see what happens next ?
It may be too late for that .
In one sense , " what " has already happened .
In another sense , it does n’t matter what happens if you ’re prepared .
Predicting and panicking wo n’t help you now .
You have to prepare .
Fortunately , it ’s easier and there are fewer people doing it .
Your preparation consists essentially of one thing — becoming more independent .
The foundation for that is to become — and stay — healthy .
Earlier , I outlined a simple ten - step program to good health — eating a largely vegetarian diet and drinking a lot of water ; exercising and improving your posture ; breathing correctly ; cutting out smoking and heavy drinking ; and cultivating your intellectual , emotional , and spiritual life .
That should be your start .
The next thing you need to do is to remove some of the physical constraints on your life .
Here ’s one way .
If you need to drive a lot to get to work , think about moving closer , car pooling , or riding a train or bus .
The amount of time you spend traveling imposes an invisible but huge burden on your well - being .
It ’s not just the time and money spent , it ’s the wear and tear on your tires and on your body .
Sharing the ride will cut your expenses .
If you take a train , you can read , have a meal , or work .
On a bus , you ’ll be able to relax and watch the scenery .
You ’ll be able to enjoy a good conversation without endangering any one else .
If your commute is really stressful , you could try coming into the office fewer times but working longer hours .
Or you could do part of your job from home .
You might also think of transferring to another department .
Or of telecommuting .
I wo n’t tell you to leave your job , because jobs are hard to come by , but if you have enough money to go into business for yourself , this might be the time to do it .
The other face of disaster is always opportunity .

Even if you do n’t make enough to live on , it will give you a useful second income that will cushion you in case of trouble at work .
Telecommuting is also light on your wallet .
You wo n’t need a car except for household needs .
And with more time to plan , you ’ll use your car more efficiently .
Becoming free of your car will free you up in other ways .
Instead of making several trips to the grocery store in a week , you might go once in two months and buy in bulk at a discount .
You could then put the saved money and time to better use .
You could grow your own food at home .
Which means you ’ll save even more .
Suddenly , you ’re eating better , having more time , more fun , and less stress .

Gardening is just a start .
Try other ways of getting off the market economy .
Exchange services or barter things to meet your needs .
Give away that old guitar you never played and get something you need in exchange .
You can look up craigslist in any city in America for people offering services or selling things .
I recently found a work - out machine that would retail for a $ 1000 for about $ 200 that way .
Another idea .
Instead of booking expensive hotels when you travel , try exchanging houses with someone who wants to come here to visit .
For people on tight budgets , try couchsurfing , a network which gets you a room or a couch in someone ’s home .
Although I ’ve never tried it myself , it looks like a great way to meet people .
Again , the government ca n’t tax it .
5. Recycle and reuse .
Spending more time at home should make you acutely aware of the dozens of ways your house is draining you of your money and energy .
Bad insulation , leaky pipes , and poor telephone connections all end up costing you .
For minor problems , get a hammer , a screw - driver , and a how - to guide , and try fixing them .
Do n’t expect to produce a professional job .
And do n’t be too proud to give up and call a professional if you think you ’re making the problem worse .
Research and fit your house with fluorescent bulbs that use 75 percent less energy and last about 10 times longer than incandescent bulbs .
Use recycled water for your garden and pay less , but make sure you understand what ’s in the recycled water , or you might hurt your plants .
Use dual flush toilets that can save you thousands of gallons of water .
Reducing water usage is not only thrifty it ’s good ecological practice and has a direct impact on energy consumption .
A large chunk of energy is spent pumping and heating water .
Start storing things .
Use solar panels to store natural energy from the sun .
Store water in tanks so you do n’t run short in a drought .
Store organic seeds .
Store computer parts and electronic goods .
Store anything you think you need which might go up drastically in price .
A quick recap now :
Live healthily
Grow your own food
Drive less
Make your job portable
Barter
Exchange services
Recycle / reuse

You might have noticed by now that I have n’t mentioned financial independence , which is where most people start .
The reason I did n’t is that people rarely want just money .
They say they do , but in practice they usually want something else — security , or admiration , or power , or status , or love .
Money is simply a stand - in for those things .
Investment gurus have built far - flung empires on this simple observation .
If that ’s so , then the way to financial independence is n’t to think about money at all .
At least , it ’s not where you start .
Instead , think about what it is you ’ve always craved — the glamorous neighborhood , the extravagant car , the high - status job , the high - status lifestyle .
Learn to take them or leave them .
The way to financial independence ?
Do n’t worry about how little or how much money you make .
First become independent of all those other things you think you ca n’t live without .

Birds are famous for airborne speed and endurance .
Some have been clocked flying 60 miles per hour or more .
Others make annual migrations from Alaska to New Zealand , nonstop .
But for scientists , tracking birds as they perform those feats has been an intractable problem .
Now researchers think they have cracked it with a novel device — a tiny bird backpack that contains sophisticated sensors and weighs less than a dime .
The new technology has opened up vast new possibilities for bird researchers .
Already , it is yielding surprising findings — for example , that some birds fly even faster than previously thought .
But its real importance , biologists say , is the opportunity to unlock mysteries of bird migration that could help preserve species threatened by habitat loss and climate change .
“ We knew that purple martins went to Brazil and wood thrush went to Central America , ” said Bridget J. M. Stutchbury , a biologist at York University in Toronto , who with colleagues fitted birds from the species with the sensors and mapped their migrations last year .
“ But the details of how an individual gets there , what routes they take , how fast they fly , how often they stop to rest — these are the kinds of details we have never been able to have . ”

With Prism you can take any online site and create an desktop version that will run without being in a browser .
Mozilla is now out with Prism 1.0 beta which builds in new API support , update notifications , control over fonts and settings to make Prism truly behave more like a desktop platform .

It 's a very long story , but I 'll try to keep it short .
On the 357th rotation of the Moon King 's birth , the kingdom awoke to a new proclamation .
The Moon King 's royal council had rejected the proposition to install cheese rejuvenation chambers in the public crater .
The general populace of Man - in - the - Moon City was shocked , but as the culture was to obey the king without question , the cheesy people let this pass with little argument .
However , one young boy named Lunether Lunius would not bend over and take this up the space butt .
He lept high into the air and cleared the walls to the Moon King 's palace as if he were a space bird .
The Moon King always kept with him only one guard .
This guard , Cosmo Starshine , was invincible in all ways except for a weak skull .
Just then , Lunether fell from space and landed on Cosmo's head , blowing him up into a cheesplosion .
The Moon King drew his dirk and placed it at Lunether 's throat .
" Why did you reject the bill ? " Lunether asked .
The Moon King stared at the Earth solemnly .
" For love . "
He then proceeded to make fondue out of Lunether .
I hope I answered your question .

The orbital planes of the two satellites were at nearly right angles at the time of the collision ( left ) .
But the orbital planes of the debris are expected to spread out over time – the illustration at right is a prediction of what the paths of the debris may look like after six months ( Illustration : NASA Orbital Debris Program Office )
The unprecedented collision between an Iridium communications satellite and a derelict Russian Cosmos 2251 communications satellite on 10 February could have been far worse .
One satellite probably did not hit the other ’s massive body directly but only rammed into a protruding solar panel or antenna , NASA has concluded .
At the end of March , NASA had catalogued 823 large pieces of debris from the collision , well below the roughly 1300 fragments expected from a direct collision of the 900 - kilogram Cosmos with the 560 - kg Iridium .
More pieces are still being catalogued .
Observations show about two - thirds of the pieces came from the Cosmos , a compact cylinder with solar panels covering its circumference .
Iridium satellites are longer , thinner cylinders with appendages such as solar panels and antennas projecting from them .
“ The Iridium is underrepresented ” in the debris , says Mark Matney of NASA ’s orbital debris programme , so it ’s possible that something projecting from the Iridium smashed into the Cosmos .
That collision , at a velocity of more than 11 km /s , broke up the Cosmos more severely than the Iridium .

“ Body - to - body collisions are the worst case .
As near as we can tell , that ’s what happened with the Chinese anti-satellite test , ” Matney told New Scientist .
That test shattered a 750 - kg Chinese weather satellite in January 2007 , producing thousands of pieces of debris .
“ Each breakup has a character all its own ” because satellites have different structures , says Matney .
Studying the events should help NASA better understand collisions , which are inevitable as satellite and debris populations grow .
So far most fragments remain near the 790 - km elevation where the collision occurred .
There they threaten the 70 remaining Iridium satellites ( including spares ) and important Earth - observing satellites .
Few of the pieces have reached lower orbits occupied by the International Space Station and the space shuttle .
( CNN ) -- Matthew Baron is one of those gizmo guys , the kind who covets all toys new and shiny .
The slumping economy has more consumers holding on to older gadgets while holding off on shiny new purchases .
But the Brooklyn , New York , attorney , like so many other American consumers who are watching their bank account balances , is reassessing his gadget habit .
" If I 'm going to buy something , I want it to count .
I want it to last , " said Baron , who incidentally goes by " OMG !
Ponies ! " when he posts comments on Gizmodo , a popular tech and gadget blog .
So , even though he'd like to upgrade his 4 ½ - year - old HDTV , this cowboy 's holding back the reins .
And while the latest iPhone was a " must have " for Baron , he said he 's " waiting to pull the trigger " on that camera he 's been circling .
" I just ca n't go out and spend $ 400 right now . "
Ignoring what you want .
Recycling the old .
Fixing what can be saved .
Is this the new American way when it comes to tech toys and electronics -- an industry in which new gadgets can become outdated within months ?
Many consumers are hoping to make products last longer , which is keeping businesses that repair and refurbish computers and other gadgets and electronics as busy as ever .
" The percent of our business devoted to repair is definitely increasing , " said Paula Baldwin , the mistress of propaganda ( yes , that is her title ) for Geek Squad , a consumer - electronics services company .
People are seeking help " to either repair that gear or add to its functionality and what it [ the product ] does for them . "
Scott Steinberg , publisher of DigitalTrends.com , said that function , in fact , " is the new fad . "
People may need their cell phones and computers to work so they can simply get by , but they do n't necessarily need the highest resolution screens , the sleekest designs and all the technological bells and whistles .
" Shiny is great , but shiny does n't necessarily let you send that e-mail or send that text message , " Steinberg said .
" At the end of the day , as long as the gadget functions properly , does it have to be wrapped in white gold ? "
But to hear it from Shawn DuBravac , an economist for the Consumer Electronics Association , which represents 2,200 technology companies , we 're staying more true to our old selves than you might think .
" During other recessions , we could live without these technologies , " he said .
" Whether you 're male or female , 18 or 81 , chances are you 'll buy a technology product this year . "
People are more inclined to scrimp elsewhere -- tape a bumper to a car , for example -- than they are to go without a new cell phone , he suggested .
In fact , the proportion of dollars spent on electronics versus other " durable goods , " such as cars , has never been higher , he said , referencing Department of Commerce statistics .
To illustrate how strong the market remains , DuBravac pointed to the popularity of new televisions in 2008 , saying that sales for LCD TVs were up 41 percent and digital TV sales , overall , were up 24 percent over the previous year .
" What he 's telling you is right , but it 's only half the story , " said Wilson Rothman , feature editor at Gizmodo , the site " OMG ! Ponies ! " frequents .
While people are buying , they 're paying much less , Rothman said .
The Seattle , Washington , journalist believes the TV industry " kind of burned itself out " with its rock - bottom prices at the end of 2008 .
" What ended up happening is after most people who wanted a TV bought a TV , the market vanished , " leading to layoffs , slashed budgets and to Pioneer -- which he said currently has " the best TV on the market " -- getting out of the business .
" But the good news is everyone has an HDTV now , " he added with a laugh .
Just as companies " bend over backwards to get people to buy , " Rothman said the next best things are being held up in production because people can't pay for them .
The OLED screens for phones and cameras , for example , are n't rolling in the way folks expected .
iReport.com : How are you saving on gadgets ?
" Kodak sent me an OLED photo frame , " Rothman said .
" A thousand dollars !
I sent it right back and said , ' I 'm not going to review it .
If I did , I 'd only spend 800 words making fun of you . ' "
Not only do people want to pay less , they also want more free .
Gizmodo is seeing increased traffic for its Dealzmodo link , where visitors can find discounted games , computers , movies and more .
Same for its Hobomodo link , which offers freebies -- including everything from software to teeth - whitening products and tacos .
Nice - looking teeth and food handouts may not make up for out - of - reach tech gadgets , but Rothman , who said his site 's audience is made up of " college kids and nerds of all ages , " is learning that such things also can't hurt .
" The only agenda we have is we love gadgets , " he said , " But we 're also sympathetic to consumers . "

GAZA / JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Palestinians struggling to cope with the Israeli blockade of Gaza and the trauma of war are turning to painkillers and tranquillizers at a rate that risks triggering a wave of addiction .
Palestinians wait for relatives to return to Gaza from Egypt through the Rafah border crossing in the southern Gaza Strip April 19 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Ibraheem Abu Mustafa
There is also evidence of mounting recreational drug use as Gaza drifts in limbo , with no clear political future .
Gaza residents reported health problems after a 22 - day Israeli offensive last January , with most citing psychological problems and stress , according to a survey published by the United Nations Gender Task Force on April 21 .
“ With increased trauma and stress and limited access to professional psychosocial services , there is a rising problem of self - medication with unsupervised pharmaceutical therapies among the Gaza population , ” said a summary presented in Jerusalem .
One eighth - grade teacher , speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity , said she recently found several 13 - year - olds using tramadol hydrochloride , a strong painkiller sold under the brand name Tramal which is now drug of choice in the Gaza Strip .
A boy had stolen the drug from his parents ’ room and passed it to friends , unaware of its potency or the risk of addiction .
A synthetic opioid developed by German company Gruenenthal in 1977 to treat moderate to severe pain , Tramal has caught on among Gaza high school students , male and female , said Islam Shahwan , a Hamas police spokesman .
There are rich profits to be made on drugs which pharmacists and other traders say can be smuggled in through tunnels from Egypt and sold for several times the purchase price .
“ Every kind , anything you want , comes through the tunnels that are still functioning , ” said Salim , a doctor and pharmacist who declined to give his full name , referring to a crackdown on the supply tunnels .
Palestinians say some 1,400 people including 926 civilians died in Israel ’s war from December 27 to January 18 against Hamas - led Islamist militants in the Gaza Strip .
Israel , which launched the offensive to halt daily salvoes of short - range rockets from Gaza , says most of the dead in its own tally of 1,166 Palestinians killed were fighters .
Besides extensive destruction , the bombing has added to Gaza ’s problems of poverty , unemployment and overcrowding .
“ To deal with depression here in Gaza , many take these drugs , especially youths who ’ve lost their jobs , who sit at home and do n’t have a salary , ” said Taysir Diab , a psychiatrist at the Gaza Community Mental Health Program ( GCMHP ) .
Tramal pills at 100 mg doses sell for 25 Israeli shekels ( $ 6 ) for a box of 10 .
Besides Tramal , pharmacists named Elatrol ( amitriptyline hydrochloride ) and older antidepressants such as Valium ( diazepam ) and Anafranil ( clomipramine ) as commonly used .
Also popular -- and much more expensive -- is a mystery pill stamped “ $. ”
Mental health professionals say addiction is rife .
EASY TO GET
Turning to tranquillizers and other self - medication is not uncommon in response to the chaos of war : for example in besieged Sarajevo and other cities in the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s , when normal regulations broke down .
Gaza lacks professionally trained psychiatrists and psychologists , said GCMHP president Eyad el - Sarraj .
Doctors with limited knowledge often prescribe medication for the physical symptoms of psychosomatic problems .
But controls over the drugs are also loose .
“ The law makes it clear that drugs of this kind should not be given to people without a prescription , ” said el - Sarraj .
“ But there is no control of this so people can go and buy over the counter any drug they want . ”
Salim said Gazans ’ consumption of anti-anxiety drugs and anti-depressants had risen dramatically .
“ During the war people were tense , afraid , and they lacked the ability to concentrate , ” he said .
“ The situation continued after the war because of the continued state of internal division and the possibility of a renewal of war . ”
Israel ended its occupation of Gaza in 2005 and withdrew from settlements , handing it over to native Palestinians .
In 2007 , Islamists led by Hamas , which rejects peace with Israel , wrested control of the territory from the Fatah group which is seeking a peace deal with the Jewish state .
Prospects of lifting the Israeli embargo depend on healing the Palestinian split , but so far talks to this end have made no substantial progress .
Once in control , Hamas banned sales of natural opioids , but failed to regulate synthetics like Tramal , which its police began to encounter during raids on drug dealers .
“ We have discovered from investigations and interrogations that some drug addicts take Tramal in large doses and big quantities when they do not find ( opiate ) drugs , ” said Hamas police spokesman Shahwan .
“ I know a case where one went into a coma , ” said Nabil Abu Dalal , a pharmacist at the GCMHP .
“ He ’d taken 1,000 mg of Tramadol in a single dose . ”
PROFITS TO BE MADE
The Hamas - run health ministry recently renewed instructions not to sell medication without prescriptions and to enforce the rule , Shahwan said policemen disguised as youths tested city pharmacies .
“ We detained some pharmacists for illegally selling Tramal , ” he said .
“ We released them soon after they made pledges not to sell it .
Unfortunately , it is still being sold privately . ”
Psychiatrist Diab said improved and prolonged sexual performance , a side effect of Tramal and similar drugs , adds to their popularity among young married men between the ages of 18 and 30 .
“ Police have warned merchants and tunnelers against smuggling Tramal and other drugs and we have confiscated thousands of boxes , ” Shahwan said .
The pill with a dollar sign stamped into it is called Sa’ada ( Arabic for pleasure ) .
It is smuggled through the tunnels and sold on the black market in Gaza , but neither its composition nor its manufacturer is known , said Abu Dalal .
Though it is not widespread like Tramal , a dose of Sa’ada can cost from 50 to 100 Israeli shekels , he said .
Sameh the merchant said he spends 500 shekels ( $ 120 ) a month on Tramal and other similar drugs .
“ It makes me feel good , ” he said .
“ I forget my problems for some time . ”
“ I hope this will have some end , but I doubt it , ” said GCMHP president el - Sarraj .
“ I think that we have to brace ourselves for even more serious problems . ”
" I shall further have meetings today , " the PM said and sat down on Jim Murphy .
" Further have meetings " ?
The sentence he was attempting is said before every PMQs .
It 's like grace before dinner .
" For what we are about to receive may thankful the lord make us truly . "
How bad do things have to be for the Archbishop of Canterbury to make a mistake like that ?
People as tired as Gordon Brown are usually in hospital .
The Tories approached their victim in a spirit of wanton mockery .
They made bruising , abusive statements with a question mark at the end .
What do they think they are , sketch writers ?
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
They wanted him to agree that he was a useless , spineless loser .
In an equal and opposite way , he reproached them for not asking about his successes with the economy , mortgages and welfare reform .
" I 'm ashamed no Tory has raised these issues , " he said indignantly .
The first rule of politics is : " accuse your opponent of your own most obvious fault " .
It 's not : " accuse yourself of the most obvious fault you want them to have " .
That 's too clever by half .
His back bench roared approval anyway .
It 's a defective juke box .
You do n't even have to put money in – just kick it and it plays the tune you want .
David Cameron listed selected highlights from the recent horlicks and asked whether these were symptoms of a government " in terminal decline " .
The PM answered the only way he can : " He ca n't ask about the economic situation ! "
And later he delivered another of those bizarre sentences : " What we are taking on the recession is action ! "
He then mentioned " the September Schools Guarantee " .
I 'm with Hazel Blears on that .
Brown may have substance , policy , action plans – but he has no way of spinning them into a story we want to hear .
You write down what he says and it reads back as a terrible concrete poem : " 4,000 skills for life achievements in the community scheme with funding support " .
Another Tory asked about bullying in Whitehall and asked what could be done about a senior boss being accused of throwing mobile phones and printers around and swearing at switchboard operators .
Among shouts of laughter , Gordon Brown ( for he himself was the accused ) searched for something to say .
" Any complaints are dealt with in the usual manner , " he said to Tory joy .
Edward Garnier gave the lemon another squeeze by asking whether Hazel Blears " had been dealt with in the usual manner " .
She certainly looked thoroughly dealt with .
They all did , actually , poor things .
Andrew Rosindell mentioned the largest petition on the Downing Street website .
" Twice as many people are calling for his resignation as voted for him at the last election . "
There was another petition on Gordon 's site begging him not to resign .
It had 234 signatures and today it 's gone .
The reason ?
All the names were things like Juan Kerr ( it took me a moment as well ) .

Ian Tomlinson , the man who died at last week 's G20 protests in London , was attacked from behind and thrown to the ground by a baton - wielding police officer in riot gear , dramatic footage obtained by the ­Guardian shows .
Moments after the assault on ­Tomlinson was captured on video , he ­suffered a heart attack and died .
The Guardian is preparing to hand a ­dossier of evidence to the police ­complaints watchdog .
It sheds fresh light on the events ­surrounding the death of the 47 - year - old newspaper seller , who had been on his way home from work when he was confronted by lines of riot police near the Bank of England .
The submission to the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) includes a collection of testimonies from witnesses , along with the footage , shot at about 7.20 pm last Wednesday , which shows ­Tomlinson at Royal Exchange ­Passage .
The film reveals that as he walks , with his hands in his pockets , he does not speak to the police or offer any resistance .
A phalanx of officers , some with dogs and some in riot gear , are close behind him and try to urge him forward .
A Metropolitan police officer appears to strike him with a baton , hitting him from behind on his upper thigh .
Moments later , the same policeman rushes forward and , using both hands , pushes Tomlinson in the back and sends him flying to the ground , where he ­remonstrates with police who stand back , leaving bystanders to help him to his feet .
The man who shot the footage , a fund manager from New York who was in ­London on business , said he had attended the protests out of curiosity .
He said : " The primary reason for me coming forward is that it was clear the family were not ­getting any answers . "
The Guardian 's dossier also includes a sequence of photographs , taken by three people , showing the aftermath of the attack , as well as witness statements from people in the area at the time .
A number of witnesses provided time and date - stamped photographs which substantiated their accounts .
Some said they saw police officers attack Tomlinson .
Witnesses said that , prior to the moment captured on video , he had already been hit with batons and thrown to the floor by police who blocked his route home .
One witness , Anna Branthwaite , a ­photographer , described how in the ­minutes before the video was shot , she saw Tomlinson walking towards Cornhill Street .
" A riot police officer had already grabbed him and was pushing him , " she said .
" It was n't just pushing him – he'd rushed him .
He went to the floor and he did actually roll .
That was quite noticeable .
" It was the force of the impact .
He bounced on the floor .
It was a very forceful knocking down from behind .
The officer hit him twice with a baton when he was lying on the floor .
" So it was n't just that the officer had pushed him – it became an assault .
And then the officer picked him up from the back , continued to walk or charge with him , and threw him .
" He was running and stumbling .
He did n't turn and confront the officer or anything like that . "
The witness accounts contradict the official version of events given by police .
In an official statement on the night of Tomlinson 's death , the Metropolitan police made no reference to any ­contact with officers and described attempts by police medics and an ambulance crew to save his life after he collapsed – efforts which they said were marred by ­protesters throwing missiles as first aid was ­administered .
The force said officers had created a ­cordon around Tomlinson to give him CPR .
" The officers took the decision to move him as during this time a number of ­missiles – believed to be bottles – were being thrown at them , " it said .
Yesterday , the IPCC began managing an investigation by City of London police into the ­circumstances of ­Tomlinson 's death after the Guardian ­published photographs of him on the ground and witness statements indicated he had been assaulted by police officers .
The IPCC 's commissioner for London , Deborah Glass , said : " Initially , we had accounts from independent witnesses who were on Cornhill , who told us that there had been no contact between the police and Mr Tomlinson when he collapsed .
" However , other witnesses who saw him in the Royal Exchange area have since told us that Mr Tomlinson did have ­contact with police officers .
" This would have been a few minutes before he collapsed .
It is important that we are able to establish as far as possible whether that contact had anything to do with his death . "
The IPCC added that Tomlinson was captured on CCTV walking onto Royal Exchange Passage .
" This is the aspect of the incident that the IPCC is now investigating , " it said .
It was here the video was shot .
A post mortem carried out by a Home Office pathologist last Friday revealed ­Tomlinson died of a heart attack .
Prior to seeing the dossier of evidence , Tomlinson 's ­family said in a statement : " There were so many people around where Ian died , and so many people with cameras , that ­somebody must have seen what happened in the Royal Exchange passageway .
" We need to know what happened there and whether it had anything to do with Ian 's death .
We know that some ­people who were at the protest may not feel comfortable talking to the police .
" People are putting pictures on the internet , writing on blogs and talking to journalists .
But we really need them to talk to the people who are investigating what happened . "

LeBron James made one better .
James dropped a 3 - pointer from the top of the key over Orlando 's Hedo Turkoglu as the final horn sounded Friday night to give the Cavaliers , their season a heartbeat from major trouble , a 96 - 95 victory over the Magic that evened the Eastern Conference finals at one game apiece .
From 23 feet -- matching his jersey number and Jordan's -- James hit a shot that will go down as one of the defining moments in a career that 's just hitting its stride .
" That guy is not in the league any more , " James said of Jordan .
" The other 23 is on the good side now . "
Taking the inbounds pass from Mo Williams , James only had time to turn his shoulders toward the rim and fire .
As the high - arcing shot dropped through , James sprinted into the arms of his delirious teammates as 20,562 stunned fans hugged in disbelief .
" You could n't hear anything but a roar , " James said .
" Those fans deserved it .
That was the biggest shot I 've made in my career . "
In the past , this was the kind of shot that happened against the Cavs .
Jordan 's jumper in 1989 over Craig Ehlo eliminated Cleveland from the playoffs -- a punch - in - the - stomach moment burned into the psyche of every Cleveland fan .
Well , James is changing everything around here .
Game 3 is Sunday night in Orlando , where the Magic beat the Cavaliers twice this season and thumped them by 29 points on April 3 .
One second before James ' shot , Turkoglu hit a 12 - footer in the lane to give the Magic , who overcame a 23 - point deficit in the first half , a 95 - 93 lead .
Cleveland called a timeout and set up a play for James , the league 's MVP who finished with 35 points .
James darted toward the basket to get some room on Turkoglu and cut back near the top of the circle before letting loose with the shot of his life .
After seeing James ' only 3 - pointer of the game fall , Williams dropped to his knees and pounded the floor with his right hand as Quicken Loans Arena shook to its core .
" I was punch drunk , " Williams said .
" I was stuck .
I could n't move . "
Officials looked at the replay to make sure it should count .
BERLIN  Microsoft and the European Commission have canceled the only hearing planned in an antitrust investigation into the company ’s Internet browser because of a dispute over the attendance of European regulators serving as advisers .
As a result , the commission , which began its inquiry after a complaint by Opera , a small browser maker in Norway , will reach its decision and levy a fine based on written statements from Microsoft and its adversaries .
Microsoft decided not to give oral evidence in the case after it was unable to persuade the commission to move the meeting , scheduled for June 3 through 5 , so that it did not conflict with a global antitrust conference in Zurich that draws European antitrust regulators .
Dave Heiner , a Microsoft vice president and deputy general counsel , said the conflict would have prevented some regulators from attending the hearings as observers and advisers .
“ It appears many of the most influential commission and national competition officials with the greatest interest in our case will be in Zurich and so unable to attend our hearing , ” Mr. Heiner wrote on his blog on the Microsoft Web site .
Daily Mail & General
Trust fell into the red as it reported a pre-tax loss of £ 239 m for the six months to 29 March , with an 85 % fall in operating profit at its regional arm and a 59 % fall across its national newspaper division .
The owner of the Daily Mail and about 100 regional titles said that its results were affected by a £ 179 m non-cash charge principally relating to assets acquired in recent years by Northcliffe , DMG World Media , Euromoney and DMG Radio .
On an adjusted basis , stripping out factors such as exceptional charges , pre-tax profits fell 47 % to £ 77 m for the period .
Adjusted operating profits dropped 30 % year on year to £ 116 m and group revenues decline by 7 % to £ 1.08bn .
Operating profits at DMGT 's regional arm , Northcliffe Media , fell 85 % to just £ 6 m , with revenue down 23 % to £ 166 m .
UK circulation revenues fell by 6 % to £ 35 m at the division .
The company said that April trading saw UK advertising revenues remaining at 36 % below the equivalent period last year .
Recruitment revenues in the UK were down 63 % , with property down 54 % and retail down 11 % year on year .
However , the company said that other categories were " at or above " previous months .
" In total , advertising revenues in the last 15 weeks have remained steady , with the exception of recruitment , " the company said .
At Associated Newspapers , the company 's national newspaper arm , operating profit fell 59 % year on year to £ 18 m , with revenue down 10 % to £ 455 m .
There was a 16 % year - on - year fall in underlying ad revenue at the division .
Ad revenues were down 8 % in the first quarter and 23 % down in the second quarter .
However , April and May have seen an " improving trend " , down 15 % to date .
Display advertising was down by 16 % to £ 150 m .
By sector , all categories were lower , but retail , the largest category , was the best performer , falling by 7 % boosted by strong advertising from supermarkets .
Classified advertising fell by 13 % to £ 29 m .
The company said that overall circulation revenues at the division remained stable at £ 181 m , due to an increase in cover prices .
However , circulation at the Daily Mail fell 5.8 % and at the Mail on Sunday 5.6 % for the period .
" The overall first - half result has been badly affected by the impact of the recession on our consumer media advertising revenues , " said Martin Morgan , the chief executive of DMGT .
" However , the decisive action taken to defend profitability , along with the continued management of our cost base , will help to offset the effect of continued weak trading conditions in the second half of the year . "
In November the company unveiled a cost- cutting and revenue - boosting strategy it hoped would save £ 100m .
DMGT said this morning that revenue and cost - saving initiatives would improve profitability by £ 150 m this year .
In total , the company charged £ 232 m in amortisation charges and impairment losses and £ 85 m of exceptional items .
DMGT said that it expected total headcount to fall by 1,500 this year .
Peter Williams , the DMGT finance director , said the company was through the " vast majority " of the cost - savings plan " assuming no further substantial downturn " .
The DMGT chief executive , Martin Morgan , said there had been some signs of stabilisation .
" There is little visibility in [ ad ] bookings in the consumer business – it is very short term , " he said .
" However , for several weeks in the Northcliffe operation it feels like revenues have levelled out .
" Recruitment is still weak but there is some relative strength in other categories .
In the nationals [ newspaper division ] the year - on - year decline has reduced coming out of March and into April and May .
It would be a brave person to call that a trend yet , but at least it is not going the other way . "
Morgan said DMGT 's business - to - business operations , which accout for 80 % of group profits , had proved resilient " in the face of the economic crisis " .
For example , its Risk Management Solutions operation saw underlying revenue increase by 11 % and operating profit increase by 18 % year on year .
The company said it expected full - year results to be in line with market expectations .
The deficit on DMGT 's pension scheme rose to £ 220 m .
Net debt at the end of the period was £ 1.2bn , an increase of £ 212 m since the year end .
DMGT said that it was trading " comfortably " within the requirements of its banking covenants .

The number of people displaced by fighting in Pakistan 's turbulent northwest has doubled to one million in recent days , the United Nations ' refugee agency said Friday .
Children from Swat arrive on a truck at a refugee camp in Mardan , northwest Pakistan , on Thursday .
( ( Greg Baker / Associated Press ) )
Up to 200,000 people have arrived in safe areas in the past few days and another 300,000 are on the move or are about to flee , Ron Redmond , spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees , said Friday .
The new numbers are in addition to the estimated 555,000 people displaced from the area since August , he told reporters in Geneva .
There has been renewed violence in the northwest in the past few days after the Taliban took control of large areas of the Swat valley in the northwest .
Particularly contentious was a militant foray in late April into the Buner region , about 100 kilometres from Pakistan 's capital , Islamabad .
The Pakistani government , under increasing international pressure to crack down on militants and alarmed by the Taliban 's new proximity to the capital , began an army offensive into the Swat last week .
The military campaign has effectively nullified a peace pact under which the government allowed the implementation of Islamic law in Swat and the surrounding region .
The Swat valley , once an alpine resort popular with tourists , was violently seized by the Taliban in 2007 .
The government has sent the army into Swat three times in the last year and a half to fight the Taliban , and has managed to temporarily subdue the militants on each occasion .
" Nobody really doubts the army has the power to push back the Taliban , " said freelance reporter Graham Usher , reporting from Islamabad .
The problem , he said , is whether there is " an effective civil administration and functioning police force that can then step in and govern the territory once the army leaves .
Taliban keep returning
" In the last 18 months every time the army has stepped back , the Taliban have re-entered and re-conquered the city .
And that is the fear , [ that ] this will happen again this time , " he told CBC News .
On Friday , Pakistan continued its assault on the area , sending fighter jets to bomb Taliban targets in and around Mingora , the main town in the Swat valley .
The Pakistani government is expected to begin a " major operation " within the next two days to take Mingora , Usher said .
While many residents have fled the city , tens of thousand remain .
Some have said the Taliban are not allowing them to leave , perhaps because they want to use them as " human shields " and make the army unwilling to use force .
" We want to leave the city , but we can not go out because of the fighting , " said one resident , Hidayat Ullah .
" We will be killed , our children will be killed , our women will be killed and these Taliban will escape . "
" Kill terrorists , but do n't harm us , " he pleaded .
Thousands crowd makeshift camps
There are about 11 functioning refugee camps in West Pakistan to receive the displaced , said Usher .
" Tens of thousands of people are living in makeshift camps or staying with relatives , and the Pakistani government has called on the international community to donate money , resources and tents , " he said .
" But at the moment it has to be said the Pakistani government is ill - prepared for the refugee exodus we 're expect the from Swat , especially if the numbers are something like 1 million which is what the UN , [ and ] the International Red Cross are predicting . "
The International Committee of the Red Cross said Thursday it no longer had access to the Swat region and could no longer verify casualty reports .
" Clearly , we 're facing a major humanitarian crisis , " said Red Cross spokesman Sebastian Brack , adding his organization is mobilizing trucks , medical and supplies and food .
The Swat Taliban are estimated to have up to 7,000 fighters — many with training and battle experience — equipped with rocket - propelled grenades , explosives and automatic weapons .
They are up against some 15,000 Pakistani troops who until recent days had been confined to their barracks under the peace deal .
The Defence force has released details of two major combat operations targeting the Taliban in southern Afghanistan .
Special Forces soldiers are said to have killed around 80 Taliban fighters in a series of running battles over three weeks .
And other soldiers involved in mentoring the Afghan National Army have cleared an area where Taliban insurgents killed Australian Corporal Mathew Hopkins last month .
Defence Minister Joel Fitzgibbon has been with the troops to commemorate Anzac Day at their base in Taren Kowt .
Mr Fitzgibbon says the battles show the fight is worth continuing .
" I think too often they hear the bad news , particularly when we suffer fatal casualties , I think these briefings are important to demonstrate that we are making real progress , " he said .
The latest battle , amongst the opium poppies just 12 kilometres from Australia 's main base at Taren Kowt , is being hailed as a major blow to the Taliban .
When Australian soldiers caught three insurgents trying to lay a mine on a trail they moved in .
But the Taliban did not just melt away , with around 40 of them moving in to join the fight .
The Australians called in their own reinforcements and hit back hard .
They were on the same sort of mission as the one that claimed the life of Corporal Mathew Hopkins last month .
Lieutenant Colonel Shane Gabriel from the Mentoring Task Force says the incident occurred in an area which previously had a heavy Taliban presence .
" This was a very significant action .
It resulted in numerous insurgent casualties it has pushed them back from an area where they thought they enjoyed relative freedom of action , " he said .
" It has put a very large hole in their plans . "
The Taliban used a safe house to make their stand but the Australians called in an American fighter bomber for support .
When 10 Taliban tried to escape they were cut off by Australian Special Forces who killed some before discovering a large store of weapons and roadside bombs .
Lieutenant Colonel Gabriel says the battle has weakened the insurgent presence in the area .
" This action certainly has had a significant blow to the insurgent efforts to try and prosecute their operations in Uruzgan province , " he said .
He also paid tribute to Corporal Hopkins and said Anzac Day was a time that all Australians should remember those that had laid down their lives for their country .
Local commanders say the battle was a breakthrough because it has given them control of a key countryside and pushed the Taliban further away from civilians nearby .
Taliban pushed back
Special forces soldiers had an even bigger victory last month further south , in the neighbouring Helmand province .
In an operation dubbed ' Blue Sword ' they say they killed an estimated 80 Taliban fighters .
However it was in this operation , on March 19 , that Sergeant Brett Till was killed and four other soldiers wounded .
General Mark Kelly , Commander of Middle East operations , said the operation lasted for 26 days , with the troops in battle for up to nine hours a day .
" The key objective of the operation was to disrupt the insurgents in northern Helmand province in order to support Afghan National Security Force and coalition framework security operations , " he said .
" To break down this insurgency domination of these particular areas we now can see those voids being filled by Afghan security forces as well as other coalition [ troops ] . "
On one day alone forces discovered 14 improvised bombs .
Major General Kelly says the Australians also killed a key Taliban bomb maker , Mullah Abdul Bahri .

The blogger at What I'm Seeing is a prolific photographer of San Francisco 's rapid transit system , and thus has fallen afoul of its imaginary no -photos policy , with a threatened arrest :
Before I could get the 1st shot off , Fare Inspector # 32 started marching towards me , hands in the air , yelling at me to " STOP TAKING PICTURES !! "
So I put away camera , walked towards him and answered his statement with a question .
I asked him if he could site me the specific Muni code that prohibited a Translink Card carrying passenger from taking pictures of Muni Personal on Muni Property .
He could not .
Instead he responded that I " needed his permission " and demanded to see my " credentials " and the pictures on my camera .
He added that in fact , if I was unwilling to turn over possession of my camera to him he would seize my camera and have me arrested .
The shocking scale of sexual and physical abuse in educational institutions in Ireland run by the Catholic church was revealed today in a report describing how thousands of boys and girls were raped , abused and exploited by the religious brothers and nuns who were supposed to look after them .
The 2,600 - page report by Ireland 's Commission to Inquire Into Child Abuse found that for decades rape was " endemic " in more than 250 Irish Catholic care institutions from the 1930s to the 1990s , and that the church in Ireland protected paedophiles in its ranks from arrest .
" A climate of fear , created by pervasive , excessive and arbitrary punishment , permeated most of the institutions and all those run for boys .
Children lived with the daily terror of not knowing where the next beating was coming from , " it said .
Children in industrial schools and reformatories were treated more like convicts and slaves than people with human rights , it said .
Rape was particularly common in boys homes and industrial schools run by the Christian Brothers .
There were angry scenes outside the hotel in Dublin where the report was launched this afternoon after about 20 former residents of industrial schools were prevented from attending the press conference .
Speaking outside the hotel , John Kelly of the Irish Survivors of Child Abuse group , Soca , said : " We were treated as criminals as children when we were sent to these places and even now … there were Garda officers on call to arrest us if we tried to get in [ to the press conference ] .
It was an absolute disgrace . "
Kelly described the failure of the report to recommend criminal prosecutions as a complete whitewash .
The five - volume report confirmed allegations from thousands of former pupils from the institutions .
The Ryan Commission said that beatings in institutions run by both priests and nuns were commonplace .
" In some schools a high level of ritualised beating was routine ...
Girls were struck with implements designed to maximise pain and were struck on all parts of the body , " the report said .
It also criticised the failure of the Irish state , most notably the department of education , for allowing the abuse and exploitation to continue for decades .
The department aided this culture " through infrequent , toothless inspectors " that always deferred to the Catholic 's church 's authority , the report said .
The inspections even failed to ensure that children were adequately fed , clothed and educated .
The commission proposed 21 ways the Irish government could recognise past wrongs , including building a permanent memorial , providing counselling and education to victims and improving child protection services .
After the revelations of systematic clerical abuse , Pope Benedict was challenged to hold a Vatican inquiry into the role of Catholic religious orders in Ireland 's orphanages and industrial schools .
Irish Soca said it was now up to the Vatican to investigate the scandal further .
Kelly said : " Now that the Ryan commission is finished we call upon Pope Benedict to convene a special consistory court to fully investigate the activities of Catholic religious orders in Ireland .
Among other things , such a court could establish the whereabouts of Irish state assets that were misappropriated over many years by the religious orders and make restitution to the Irish state exchequer . "
Kelly said Irish Soca was disappointed that members of the religious orders who abused children , and the government officials who turned a blind eye to abuse in places like the Artane industrial school , would not be prosecuted .
The commission investigated more than 100 schools run by Catholic religious orders – the majority by the Christian Brothers and Sisters of Mercy .
The commission 's original judge , Justice Mary Laffoy , resigned from her post in 2003 over claims that the department of education , which was in charge of inspecting the orphanages and industrial schools , was holding back documents from her inquiry .
Nine - tenths of the bill for compensating victims of the institutionalised abuse will be shouldered by Irish taxpayers rather than the church .
In June 2002 , a special deal between the Catholic hierarchy and the government of Bertie Ahern , agreed that the Church would pay only € 128 m in compensation .
The overall cost of compensation , according to official figures , will be € 1.3bn .
A second damning report , due to be published by the end of June , will detail the abuse of hundreds of children in the Dublin archdiocese from 1940 onwards .
More than 100 priests are facing allegations and 400 people have been identified as victims .
" These are God 's children .
We are proud to look after her , " said Ijaz Hussain , the shrine 's government - employed custodian , as Nadia shrieked unintelligibly and put coins in a battered wooden box at her side .
According to local legend , infertile women who pray at Shah Daula 's shrine will be granted children , but at a terrible price .
The first child will be born microcephalic and must be given to the shrine , or else any further children will have the same deformity .
Hussain said Nadia was just a young child when she was dumped at the shrine 20 years ago in the dead of the night .
Her parents were never traced , he says .
" Since that day we have taken care of her , she is like family to us .
People come here for prayers and seek fulfilment of their desires but they are respectful towards her , " added Hussain , 56 .
Pakistan 's government says it has tried to crack down on exploitation of the " chuhas " ( Urdu for rats ) and says it plans to set up a shelter in Gujrat to rehabilitate them .
The shrine stopped officially accepting microcephalics in the 1960s when the government took over the site .
But not only does it still keep Nadia at its gate , the town 's beggar masters also keep the superstition alive .
" Get lost !
I do n't want to talk to you , " shouted a bearded beggar master in Gujrat 's main bus station , grabbing a microcephalic woman by the hand and leading her through the crowds when asked to comment on his actions .
Bus passengers gave the woman money , as many believe it is bad luck not to .
Another microcephalic man stood with his handler in the wilting afternoon heat , staring into space .
The high incidence of microcephalics in Gujrat , an industrial city of around one million people , has long been a bone of contention .
The popular belief among many Pakistanis -- that cruel beggar gangs clamp the children 's heads in infancy -- is strongly denied by government and advocacy groups , who say there is no evidence to support this .
Recent medical studies say the most likely cause is that the normally rare recessive genes behind many microcephaly cases crop up with greater frequency because of the common custom of marrying cousins in Pakistan .
But finding the cause is easier than stamping out the exploitation of " rat children " in the name of religion , says Pir Nasiruddaula , a descendant of the saint who has written several books on the shrine .
"
The myth of the chuhas has been exploited by beggar mafias and religious groups , " said Nasiruddaula , a former science professor in his 70s .
" They roam the villages and if the real chuha is born they give them some money and they take them , " he said .
" But what kind of saint would really curse issueless women with the ' blessing ' of deformed children ?
" Rakhshan Sohail , of the Punjab provincial government 's Child Protection and Welfare Bureau , said his department planned to establish a centre in Gujrat to stamp out exploitation of microcephalics .
" Some of these children , the handicapped ones especially , are accompanied by relatives , " he told AFP .
" But begging gangs also look for poor parents who will sell them because they are a burden to feed and shelter .
" Sohail said his department had busted more than 30 gangs across the province involved in exploiting street children , some of which had broken the limbs of children so that they would earn more as beggars .
But the " rat children " are symptomatic of hardships faced by up to 100,000 street children nationwide -- and an economic crisis caused by spiralling fuel and food prices is hurting his department 's efforts , he said .
" It 's a critical issue , " he said .
" When people are living on less than a dollar a day , they are more likely to put their children on the roads and make them beg .

Despite the voluminous empirical literature on the social psychology of juries , very little research has centered on racial or ethnic issues .
Indeed , there has been no previous research on Hispanics or on minority groups other than blacks .
The present study involved an innovative methodology high in both experimental and mundane realism , incorporating a procedure whereby participants believed that they were actually on a jury whose decisions would really affect a defendant .
Six - person juries , of varied sex and ethnic composition , deliberated and made decisions in cases involving Hispanic or Anglo defendants .
The results highlight the importance and saliency of ethnic factors in jury research and underscore the efficacy of the methodology employed .

PARIS —
Is online gambling coming in from the cold ?
When the U.S. Congress cracked down on Internet betting in 2006 , the big , publicly traded European companies that had dominated the business closed up shop in the United States .
Growth in the booming industry shifted away from these companies , once the darlings of the stock market , to private operators in offshore locations like Antigua and the Isle of Man .
But now , executives of some of the European companies whisper excitedly that they may soon get a second chance in the United States .
Meanwhile , a number of European countries that have long maintained barriers are moving , under pressure from regulators , to legalize , and tax , online gambling .
“ There ’s still a lot of gambling going on , where there ’s no revenue coming in to the governments , ” said Gavin Kelleher , an analyst at the research firm H2 Gambling Capital in Ireland .
“ They realize they could use the revenue . ”
The biggest potential change would be in the United States , where , perhaps within days , Representative Barney Frank , Democrat of Massachusetts , is expected to introduce legislation aimed at overturning the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act .
After coming to Washington , D.C. , earlier this month to discuss his possible candidacy with the National Republican Congressional Committee , former Carolina Panthers star safety Mike Minter has decided to pass on the race , a spokeswoman said last week .
Minter had contemplated challenging freshman Rep. Larry Kissell ( D ) in his Charlotte - based district .
While Kissell took 55 percent against then - Rep. Robin Hayes ( R ) last November , President Barack Obama carried the district with just 52 percent .
Some Republicans believed that Minter , who is black , would have performed well and would have been able to cut into Kissell ’s base in the district , which has a nearly 27 percent black population .
You may have noticed that a couple weeks ago I was worried that the GOP had actually managed to recruit a top tier candidate somewhere -- and in a crucial race no less .
Well - liked ex-football star , Mike Minter , was making noises about running against Larry Kissell in North Carolina .
He went up to DC and met with Pete Sessions and his crew of desperate losers at the NRCC .
Kissell does n't have much money and the NRCC promised Minter that they 'd break open the piggy bank if he ran .
Friday we reported the rumor that Minter was so unimpressed with the NRCC that he actually changed his mind about running !
Well , today Roll Call confirmed the rumor , although they did n't mention that Minter thought Sessions was the stupidest honky glad - hander he'd ever met in his life .
The NRCC has been trying to recruit viable candidates in Republican - leaning -- and even solidly red-- districts , but they keep getting the doors slammed in their face .
Idaho Treasurer Ron Crane backed off running against the weakest Democrat in the House , Blue Dog Walt Minnick , in a district where Obama only won 36 % of the vote .
McCain also won in the central Florida district represented by Suzanne Kosmas but the head of the Florida Republican Party , Jim Greer , begged off even after the NRCC told him that he 's the only Republican with a shot at beating her .
State Rep Adam Hasner was sniffing around Ron Klein 's district but the second he figured out that Klein was n't going to run for the Senate , he stopped taking the NRCC 's calls .
And any hopes the GOP had to take back the huge New Jersey CD that stretches from the Philly suburbs through Burlington and Ocean counties to the Atlantic Ocean , were sunk when prospective self - funding multimillionaire John Culbertson begged off .
Instead the Republicans are going to wind up with a gaggle of KKK and lunatic fringe nutcases as their 2010 candidates which will further weaken the already dim prospects of statewide candidates for the Senate like Richard Burr ( ID ) , Jim Bunning ( KY ) , Charie Crist or Marco Rubio ( FL ) , Rob Portman ( OH ) , Roy Blunt ( MO ) and the rest of their sad - sack cases .

U.S. housing market a victim of Government bad decisions .
Every decision has consequences .
Most decisions are thought about for the short term ; failing to look at the long term effects on the planet , world , country , economies or your home .
Many years ago , when Alan Greenspan was Chairman of the Federal Reserve , financial policies were written that encouraged us with ways to save and spend our money .
During this era , your home was considered a form of savings , instead of actual money in the bank or tucked away in a shoebox .
At that time , your home was a good place to save your money and supported the American dream to own our own home .
Decisions in years past originated within our U.S. Congress that helped contribute to the current housing / automotive crises .
We are now feeling some of the long term effects of that decision .
During the early 90 ’s Congress changed the income tax deduction that Americans could claim on their 1040 income tax return .
We could no longer deduct interest on bank loans - only the deduction of interest on our home mortgages .
So for example , the car we financed - that costs as much as the price of a home 20 years ago , the interest was no longer a tax deduction .
This now created the potential for two major U.S. economic sectors to be affected by a simple decision to increase our taxes .
We are now living that reality .
Once the interest deduction was lost , greedy new businesses emerged with new ideas to give us easy money to buy our cars , toys , etc . .
But the catch was to use the equity in our houses - our former “ savings account ” .
The “ easy money loop hole ” allowed the American people to still receive an interest tax deduction .
This all worked fine until all equity was eroded caused by 2nd and 3rd mortgages and at the same time housing value decreases occurred throughout the United States .
The housing crises had to happen .
The housing glut and fewer qualified buyers are some of the consequences of bad decisions ; resulting in homes for sale on the market for extended periods of time .
Primarily because Congress made a change in our income tax deductions in a feeble attempt to increase taxes .
The vision of Former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan to consider our homes as another safe and solid form of saving is a thing of the past .
We all lose .
Not only did the U.S. housing market suffer , look at the failing automotive industry .
Any increase in tax revenue obtained from the loss of the interest deduction on automobile loans is negligible compared to the billions of tax payer dollars used to bailout General Motors and Chrysler .
Our country was founded by wise people that had the foresight to plan for our future .
Decisions were based upon sound and grounded principles .
Their foresight stood the test of time for over two centuries .
Our elected leaders of today took less than ten years to cripple our financial strength .
So are there no wise men and women in government today ?
Every two to four years our country posts job openings for key people to run our government .
I encourage those wise and unselfish people to send in their resumes and run for an elected office .

Baghdad will burn , the resistance leader warns .
“ If we hear from the Americans they are not capable of supporting us . . . within six hours we are going to establish our groups to fight against the corrupt government , ” says the commander , a portly man with gold rings and lemon - colored robes who , perhaps understandably , spoke on condition of anonymity .
“ There will be a war in Baghdad . ”
The commander and another insurgent leader interviewed for this story belong to the secret world of Sunni Muslim tribesmen and old military officers who laid down their arms and helped bring relative peace to Iraq in the last two years .
They decided to try to fight the Shiite religious parties in control of the government through political channels instead -- but they never renounced the insurgency .
Now the dormant insurgent groups , with men , weapons and networks intact , are approaching their moment of truth .
If their efforts to enter the mainstream fail , it appears almost inevitable that they will take up arms again , either after national elections early next year or sooner .
Advertisement
With U.S. forces preparing to withdraw from Iraqi cities next month , insurgent groups see no sign of progress on their demands for the Americans to guarantee their entry into the political system and protect them from the parties in power .
As the insurgents watched and waited , they saw the government continue to jail their fighters , despite their decision to hold their fire .
Likewise , they noticed the inability , or unwillingness , of U.S. troops to stop a crackdown against leaders of the Awakening movement , their Sunni brethren who left the insurgency for formal partnerships with the Americans .
The disenchantment of the Sunnis also could have implications for Afghanistan , where the U.S. military hopes to reproduce the success of its alliance with the Awakening movement by reaching out to moderate Taliban elements .
But the fate of the Awakening members and the inactive insurgent groups could cause Taliban fighters to think twice before embarking on a similar path .
“ Perceptions can be hard to predict , but in principle it could reduce Taliban willingness to realign with us in Afghanistan if we fail to protect our friends in Iraq , ” said Stephen Biddle , a defense expert at the Council on Foreign Relations .
Advertisement
In the end , the distrust between the Shiites and Sunnis involved may be too strong to overcome .
The Iraqi government views the armed groups as a Trojan horse for Saddam Hussein ’s Baath Party to return to power and are adamant about blocking a creeping coup from inside Baghdad ’s government .
For their part , the insurgent leaders see a government that is a proxy for neighboring Shiite - led Iran .
A U.S. military official , speaking on condition of anonymity , says military and U.S. Embassy personnel are frustrated by their inability to reconcile the government and armed groups .
They worry that it ’s only a matter of time before insurgents renew their uprising .
“ When they finally realize America is an impotent force , or acting like one , are they going to give up and say it ’s useless and return to armed conflict to topple the government ? ” the official asked .
“ Are they going to take up arms against the coalition as well ? ”
Contacts between armed groups and the Americans have revolved around insurgent commanders ’ demands for protection from arrests and harassment by the Iraqi government , the restoration of military officers to their old jobs and help in entering politics .
The Americans have not given any firm responses .
Advertisement
Squished in a tiny chair , the Sunni commander , who has as many as 12,000 fighters at his disposal , speaks bluntly about what will happen if the Americans ca n’t deliver .
“ Our last option is to go back to resistance , to fighting .
We gave our word to the coalition forces , but this is our last option , ” says the former military intelligence general , who led fighters in Salahuddin province after the U.S. - led invasion in 2003 .
He says that all options will be on the table as the Americans draw down .
He makes it clear that because of the U.S. military , his group is hoping for a peaceful resolution , but that that could quickly change .
“ If the Americans leave Baghdad in 24 hours , the street belongs to the resistance and the people .
The people are boiling .
They understand now the government is representative of Iran , ” he says .
Advertisement
The insurgent commander , who heads a group called the Iraqi Liberation Army , describes stopping his war against the Americans at the end of 2007 .
He had already turned his guns on the group Al Qaeda in Iraq that year .
After being wounded in battle , he was picked up by U.S. forces and treated on one of their bases .
They did n’t realize he was on their wanted list .
Soon after his release , talks were brokered with the Americans and a truce was struck .
“ Our deal was to be friends , not enemies .
I believe if we put our hands with those people , it is better than the religious parties .
They are human beings .
We trust them , ” the commander says .
“ We gave orders to stop violence against the U.S. forces .
We started negotiations with them . ”
But the commander complains that as his alliance with the Americans emerged , Shiite religious parties in the government started trying to arrest him .
Advertisement
The commander gestures to the man sitting next to him as his link to the U.S. military .
Abu Fatima , a slight figure in a gray suit , belongs to an armed group in the north , estimated to have 2,000 to 5,000 fighters .
Abu Fatima says he helped to persuade armed groups to put down their weapons in late 2007 and early 2008 and created a loose political association that the Iraqi Liberation Army and other groups are backing .
But the truce and formation of their party have brought little tangible benefit , he says .
He notes “ the betrayal of the Awakening ” and talks about the wariness of some resistance leaders to rally behind the truce and endorse elections .
“ In fact , some groups have met with us to come under our banner to stop fighting .
They ask us , ‘ What did the Americans do [ for us ] ? ’
This question has become the most embarrassing question I hear .
Advertisement
“ I can get around questions about politics and religions except this one .
. . .
I ’m stumped and embarrassed .
I do n’t have an answer , ” Abu Fatima says .
“ I say , ‘ Do n’t lay down your weapons , ’ because otherwise I would be dishonest to them .
I ’ve told Americans , ‘ If you keep alienating the people , all the Iraqis will fight them , even the government . ’ ”

A new cop show called Mentalist has been one of the big hits of this season ’s television fare .
It features Simon Baker as a former fortune teller turned honest by renouncing his former fraudulent practice and now working with an unlikely bunch of California Bureau of Investigation officers to catch the bad guys .
What caught my eye , however , was the title of the show , which is broken into what the writers believe to be the syllables of Mentalist :
/ ’men – tuh — list / noun
Okay , the second syllable is actually /t / plus schwa , but I do n’t have a keyboard with a schwa , so you understand what I mean by the / - uh / .
Unless you are familiar with the popular lore about syllables , it might be hard to imagine how the program managed to syllabify this way .
Mentalist is a word with a stem from the Latin word , mens ( mind ) , along with a couple of suffixes , - al ( meaning relating to or characterized by ) , and –ist ( meaning one who performs a specific action ) attached to it .
These three morphemes produce : a person who is characterized by performing specific actions relating to the mind .
The /s/ of mens is the Latin nominative singular form and ment is the genitive form from which mentalist is constructed .
One would assume that any knowledge of word construction would suggest that the syllables of mentalist should be :
/ ment –uhl —ist / noun
This syllabification preserves the structural integrity of the component parts of the word .
There is little pedagically useful basis for splitting it into / men–tuh — list / .
Men and list are familiar English words , but are totally unrelated to the meaning of menatalist .
In fact , it ’s counterproductive to suggest that they have anything at all to do with this word .
Since my curiosity was aroused , it seemed obvious for me to check some standard dictionaries to see how they syllabify mentalist .
They agree with the TV program ’s / men – tuh — list / , which suggests that this version of syllabification is not about morphemes at all .
It ’s about the way English words are split at the ends of lines in conventional writing .
Even though the TV program couched it as the way the word is pronounced , the components simply are oral syllables and it does n’t seem to matter that they distort historical and morphological meanings .
Despite the pedagogical usefulness for students to know when and how to use the suffixes like –al and –ist , these useful productive morphemes are abandoned , probably because they do n’t look nice when we split words at the ends of lines .
That strikes me as a great deal to sacrifice about the opportunity to learn and use language .
This was not my first encounter with lay views of syllabification .
My first interest came many years ago , when my older son was in third grade .
He brought home one of those ominous notes from his teacher telling me that Tim was failing in reading and that she wanted to have a conference with me about it .
I dutifully made an appointment and met her in her classroom after school .
“ What ’s his problem ? ” I asked .
“ He does n’t know his syllables , ” she replied , adding , “ If he does n’t know his syllables , he ’ll never learn to read . ”
This struck me as odd , because I naively thought that the point of reading was to get meaning out of the text .
But I decided to probe this further , asking , “ How do you know that Tim does n’t know his syllables ? ”
She pulled out his test paper , which had Tim ’s name scrawled at the top and a series of numbers under it , like this :
1. 1
2. 1
3. 1
4. 1
5. 1
etc .
This was n’t exactly enlightening , so when I asked her what it meant , she told me that her pupils ' task was to listen to her pronounce a word , then write down the number of syllables they heard in each word , and Tim was consistently one syllable short .
Either he had a serious math problem or he was hearing her words very differently .
When I asked her how she had defined a syllable for the class , she was dumbfounded at my ignorance and told me , “ I teach the children that a syllable is a word containing a vowel sound . ”
My next question , as you might have guessed by now , was “ what are the words that you pronounced ? ”
They were , lemon , butter , cotton , bottle , and bottom .
“ Hmm , ” I said , “ let ’s pronounce these words together . ”
For each word we pronounced one vowel in unison , the first vowel in each word , followed by the syllabic consonants m , r , n. l , and m .
I tried to explain to the teacher that these were syllabic continuants , not vowels , but she would have none of this .
Losing patience myself , I demonstrated the sound of car starting it ’s engine , / r - r - r - r - r - r -r / , seven syllabic continuants with no vowels .
My performance made an even worse impression on her .
Then I produced the syllabic continuant sounds , / m - m-m / and / l - l - l / , asking her how many syllables she could hear .
Still no recognition and by now she was angry and wanted to get rid of me fast , so she terminated the interview .
To her , I was just one more doting parent trying to convince her that my child was brighter than she judged , which was probably true , for as it turned out , my son was an excellent reader .
He read books at home and he must have learned something from my home instructions about the sounds of language .
Sadly , he knew more than his teacher knew about syllables .
I did n’t get anywhere with this third grade teacher , but I made a bit more progress with the publisher of the reading materials she was using .
After I explained the problem to the company , they hired me to help them revise some of their reading instruction materials .
I have long since lost track of the field of reading instruction and the publisher is no longer in business ( I like to think it was n’t because of me ) .

Although truth is often even stranger than fiction , some topics are so enmeshed in both that discovering the truth is like panning for gold .
The military installation in the Nevada desert known as Area 51 has been the matrix for conspiracy theories and UFO sightings for decades and tops the list of controversial and very heated topics .
Some new light may now shine through as some of the workers from mysterious base finally speak out .
New York ’s Intrepid Sea - Air - Space Museum tells part of the Area 51 story .
On display is An A - 12 Oxcart , which was a spy plane tested at the notorious secret military base in Nevada .
Oxcart was the moniker applied to the CIA A - 12 program that was originally intended to succeed the U - 2 in conducting over flights to the Soviet Union .
After the U - 2 incident of 1960 , Eisenhower suspended Soviet airspace violations , but the flight trials continued .
The Los Angeles Times Magazine interviewed five men who worked at the military facility known as Area 51 in an attempt to get to the truth .
They are more willing to talk now because in 2007 the CIA declassified certain information concerning the A - 12 Oxcart .
All of the men interviewed related fascinating stories about life at the mysterious base , including how the military responded to security breaches involving secret projects .
Their responses to the legends arising from the military base were also quite interesting .
One of the legends surrounding Area 51 concerns the belief that the base is connected to other “ secret sites ” via underground tunnels and remote railroad networks .
There is some truth to this as verified by Thornton “ T.D. ” Barnes , aged 72 , who was an engineer at Area 51 .
He told The Los Angeles Times that he conducted much of his work in underground chambers .
In his own words :
“ Three test - cell facilities were connected by railroad , but everything else was underground . ”
Air Force Col .
Hugh “ Slip ” Slater , the base ’s commander in the 1960s , suggested that many of the UFO sightings around Area 51 were among the 2,850 Oxcart test flights .
It had a disk - like fuselage and flew at speeds of over 2,000 mph .
The plane ’s titanium body was highly reflective , which also may have thrown anyone off who caught a glimpse of it .
Slater said :
“ When commercial pilots would report a UFO around Area 51 , they ’d be met by FBI agents who ’d make them sign nondisclosure forms . ”
Project Blue Book was an Air Force operation whose sole function was to log such incidents from all around the country .
By the time the Oxcart program was terminated in December 1969 , it had received 12,618 reported sightings , 701 of which remained classified as “ unidentified . ”
Currently , the CIA maintains a searchable database of declassified Oxcart information .
Majestic 12 ( also known as Majic 12 , Majestic Trust , M12 , MJ 12 , MJ XII or Majority 12 ) is the purported code name of a secret committee of scientists , military leaders , and government officials , supposedly formed in 1947 by an executive order of U.S. President Harry S. Truman .
The purpose of the committee was to investigate UFO activity in the aftermath of the Roswell incident .
This infamous incident concerns the alleged crash of an alien spaceship near Roswell , New Mexico , in July of 1947 .
The existence of this committee forms the bulwark of the theory of an ongoing government cover - up of UFO information .
Is there evidence to support the existence of this committee ?
There indeed seems to be something at least debatable in the form of a collection of documents discovered back in 1984 .
The original MJ - 12 documents state that :
“ The Majestic 12 group … was established by order of President Truman on 24 September , … 1947 , upon recommendation by Dr. Vannevar Bush and Secretary of Defense James Forrestal . ”
Some agencies insist that documents suggesting the existence of this committee are hoaxes .
The FBI investigated the documents , and concluded they were forgeries , based primarily on an opinion rendered by AFOSI , the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations .
Opinions among UFO researchers are divided .
Some argue the documents may be genuine while others contend they are phony , primarily due to errors in formatting and chronology .
Still others argue that the documents ( as well as UFOs ) do not exist .
So what is the truth about Area 51 ?
Why ca n’t we know it ?
Will it ever really be known ?
The answers to all of these questions may well be blowing in the wind as Bob Dylan used to say , but if they are , do we really want to know ?

At the Lake : A Summertime Holiday Retreat
Paintings by : Amy Bennett
Are you heading to the lake for a holiday retreat this summer ?
If so , you just might might want to rent a canoe for the best views of the scenery , and especially for people - watching .
According to Amy Bennett ’s
At the Lake series of paintings , a summertime return to the great outdoors is a great opportunity to peek in on the neighbors , and it just might have some things to teach us about human nature .
Amy Bennett ’s
At the Lake paintings were made from a huge L - shaped model of a strip of lakefront .
The land was constructed from styrofoam , the water from resin , the trees from wire and foam , and the sky was painted on a backdrop .
There are a few miniature houses and cabins , but most of the emphasis is on the landscape .
The paintings were created with a perspective that appears to place the viewer in a boat , or perhaps as a bird even a little higher up , witnessing peoples ’ goings - on along the shoreline .
The At the Lake series attempts to capture images of people who are being uninhibited , natural and honest .

It seems that Traders love today ’s NFP data .
Let ’s take a closer look at the actual numbers to see what we can tease out :
- Nonfarm payroll employment decline in April ( - 539,000 ) ;
- Total recession job losses ( December 2007 forward ) now total 5.7 million ;
- That is 6.5 million job losses per year on an annualized basis ;
- Private - sector employment fell by 611,000 ; the differential between NFP and private sector employment is primarily new hires for the 2010 Census ;
- U3 Unemployment rose from 8.5 to 8.9 % ; unemployment is now at a 25 - year high ;
- U6 Unemployment , the broadest measure of “ labor underutilization ” rose to 15.8 % ; This is up 77.5 % ( 6.6 percentage points ) from a year ago ;
– Birth Death adjustment added 226 k to the total of employed workers , ( April is a pretty big month for this historically )
- Temporary Help Services was down 3.4 % ; Year - to - year loss was nearly 29 % .
Total Temporary
Help losses are now over 910,000 ( - 34 percent ) since December 2006 .
- All sectors saw job losses except Education , health services and government ;
- Downward revisions made to February and April were for a net loss of 66 , ooo positions ;
But few of us spare a thought for what is going on inside our bodies when we look in the mirror .
Shocking new research has revealed that 80 per cent of Brits are still putting themselves at risk from coronary heart disease by eating too much saturated fat .
Experts say a staggering 3,500 lives could be saved every year if everyone reduced their ' bad fat ' intake to the recommended 20g per day for women and 30g for men .

Found in fatty cuts of meat like streaky bacon , as well as butter , whole milk and cheese - it may seem tough to slash the sat fats without banning all your favourite foods .
But independent dietary body
The Fat Panel says that a few small changes - such as swapping whole milk for skimmed , using low - fat spreads instead of butter and back bacon in place of streaky can make a big difference .
Marinol is prescribed for treating vomiting in chemotherapy patients and other uses .
It provides relief , not a high .
NY Daily News reports that incoming CDC Chief Thomas Freidman is " in favor of developing a synthetic marijuana spray to be used for medicinal purposes . "
That 's good news , I suppose , but what really caught my attention about the story was its repetition of the bizarre and wildly false assertion that synthetic THC does n’t get you high :
Says who ?
The first thing anyone who 's ever taken Marinol will tell you is that the stuff gets you blasted for several hours .
In fact , that 's one of the primary reason patients prefer the herbal alternative .
With marijuana , you can control your dose more effectively to achieve the desired effect .
The spray was developed for the exact same reason , thus by suggesting that Marinol does n’t get you high , the NY Daily News completely misses the point of why a spray even exists .
It 's ridiculous .
We 've heard this crap before and I just do n’t understand why anyone would struggle with the concept that a pure THC pill would make you high as hell .
I suppose it's a convenient claim for pharmaceutical execs trying to separate their product from its controversial context and it's certainly convenient for drug warriors desperately endeavoring to explain why one is medicine and the other is poison .
But it 's bullshit and it should n’t take a scientist to deduce that you will not remain sober after swallowing concentrated THC .
That 's like saying heroin gets you high but synthetic opiates do n't .
Hilariously , there 's a side column of " relevant articles " on the page with the top item titled Marijuana Potency Higher Than Ever .
We 're actually supposed to be intrigued and perhaps alarmed by the fact that domestic marijuana potency now averages 10 % THC , meanwhile the FDA has long approved a 100 % THC pill that 's proven to be completely safe in every way , except that some people think it 's a little too strong and want weed instead .
It 's amazing the lengths some people will take to rationalize the mindless paradox of arresting medical marijuana patients while simultaneously trying to sell them potent THC pills .
I am willing to bet that pretty much my entire female readership would buy this product .
Time to get Thomas Bangalter on the phone .
See you Monday !
In our experience , it ’s safe to say there are a lot of people in the media with personality issues . *
There are nebbishes and cranks and control freaks and neurotics and even — we hear — some people who could be described as Total Cocks .
But there are only a handful of people who live up to the sophomoric term “ tool ” quite the way ABC reporter Jake Tapper does .
For starters :
His big break was selling out the story of a date he had with Monica Lewinsky .
He dated a Miss America contestant , once called a college - age reporter a “ pussy ” and , at the beginning of his career , reportedly handed a Salon reporter a wad of his chewed gum , telling her it would be “ worth something someday . ”
We ’re not trying to be mean or anything , or saying he ’s a bad person .
It ’s just true :
The man is a tool .
If you need further evidence , Howard Kurtz ’s profile of him in today ’s Washington Post provides several more examples of his stunning tool - osity .
• “ He was a garden - variety liberal in college , sporting an earring and a ponytail .
Tapper also became a cartoonist for the student paper , drawing such characters as a woman who rips out a man ’s heart while breaking up with him . ”
• “ He spent three years as a publicist for the firm Powell Tate , flacking for such clients as Hooters .
Tapper also freelanced for The Washington Post , holding forth on such topics as ‘ Stairmaster butt ’ and how caller ID ‘has single - handedly changed the rules of romance . ’ ”
• “ He ’s not one of the wussy , blow - dried TV reporters , ” says conservative commentator Tucker Carlson , a longtime friend .
Uh -huh .
Later : “ Certain networks , newspapers and magazines leaned on the scales a little bit [ toward Obama ] ” Tapper says over a vanilla latte at Starbucks .
• From a former editor : “ You would hear from him in the middle of the night if he thought a headline misrepresented his story . ”
• “ Tapper , who festoons his Facebook page with baby pictures … ”
We rest our case .
Pick him up and lock him down , VH1 !
UPDATE : From the Daily Intel mailbag : “ You know , he also authored ‘ Body Slam : The Jesse Ventura Story ’ and for years was toting around an unpublished manuscript for something he ’d written called ‘ The Guy - ble ’ ? ”

Why Do Married Men Make So Much Money ?
By Bryan Caplan
If you ’ve ever played around with wage or income data , you ’ve probably noticed that married men make a lot more money than every other combo of gender and status .
If your econometric model allows marriage to affect men’s and women ’s earnings differently , you quickly explain a big chunk of the male - female and black - white gaps .
But if you step away from the stats and think about the labor market , this huge marriage effect is a puzzle .
What exactly is going on ?
I just ran across an interesting twin study , “ Are All the Good Men Married ? , ” that poses and answers this question .
The punchline :
Our estimates suggest that marriage increases men ’s wages by as much as 27 % , and that little , if any , of the cross-sectional relationship between marriage and wages is due to selection .
Despite my fondness for twin studies , in this case I think I ’d be more convinced by longitudinal data for a big sample of singletons .
But even there , might n’t men be marrying on the basis of their imminent prospects ?

The HP LaserJet desktop printer was a game - changer the moment it debuted in Atlanta at Spring Comdex 1984 , then the computing industry 's premier trade conference , now but a memory .
Since then the LaserJet line has accounted for more than 100 million unit sales ... and earned itself a spot on the Hollywood walk of infamy .
HP this week marked the LaserJet 's 25th anniversary with a celebration at the company 's facility in Boise , Idaho , where the original was assembled .
( That the milestone was n't included in my " 2009 's 25 Geekiest 25th Anniversaries " can only be called a grievous oversight . )
From an article in the Idaho Statesman :
" The LaserJet stole the show in Atlanta ( in ' 84 ) , " said Von Hansen , an engineer in Boise who was part of the development team .
" We knew we had something , but we never dreamed it would be this big . "
It 's HP 's most successful product ever , Hansen said .
Laser printers were not new in 1984 .
They were invented by Xerox in 1969 , but they were big machines with enormous price tags .
Xerox , IBM , and Hewlett - Packard offered laser printers starting at about $ 100,000 each .
The first LaserJet printed 300 dots per inch - smoothing graphics dramatically - and allowed desktop publishers to mix fonts on a single page .
Its cost was just $ 3,500 .
Hansen also tells the newspaper of a fortuitous airborne meeting with some guy named Gates :
On a flight home from New Orleans in February , 1984 Hansen found himself seated in coach , across the aisle from Microsoft founder Bill Gates , then a mogul - in - the - making .
The chance meeting led to years of support from Microsoft for LaserJet products , Hansen said .
" They had just come out with Word , and Gates just loved this product . "
Bill Gates in coach ; now there 's an image .
Finding coverage of that Comdex in online archives has been a bit of a challenge , but here is a short review of the LaserJet from a 1984 edition of Creative Computing :
At Comdex , HP also introduced another revolutionary printer , dubbed the LaserJet .
Eight times faster than a typical daisywheel printer , the LaserJet brings laser technology to offices and small business at a list price of $ 3,495 .
The machine can reproduce eight pages per minute , while maintaining print quality nearly indistinguishable from copy produced on an electronic typewriter .
Graphics resolution of the LaserJet can provide nearly typeset quality , with 300 X 300 dots per inch .
The LaserJet is more easily compared to a copy machine than to other computer printers .
In fact , it makes use of a disposable electro - photographic cartridge OEMed from Canon , which is actually an off - the - shelf copy machine component .
Each cartridge is good for approximately 3000 pages of printing and costs $ 100 .
That first LaserJet was not without significant limitations , of course , as noted in this Wikipedia entry :
It featured an 8 MHz processor and the Courier typeface .
It was controlled using PCL3 .
Due to the high cost of memory , the first LaserJet only had 128 kilobytes of memory , and a portion of that was reserved for use by the print engine .
This rendered the LaserJet nearly useless for direct graphical image printing , with it only capable of printing a low - resolution 75 - dpi image about 1 inch square before running out of memory ( larger graphics were printed by having the printer driver stream the image to the printer in real - time as the rasterizor printed the page ) .
It took approximately two minutes for the first page to print out .
You can read what HP has to say about the first LaserJet here .
And , origami fans will want to check out this 6 - sided view of the machine .
As for that Hollywood connection , the HP LaserJet 4 would receive credit for a Hollywood star turn in the 1999 classic Office Space -- immortalizing the machine 's nonsensical error message " PC Load Letter " -- and inspiring T - shirts both basic and complete with the full NSFW movie quotation .

Police are searching for details about a fight at Angels Stadium on Monday night that led to the death of a Buena Park man .
About 8:45 p.m. Monday , as crowds were leaving the stadium after the Angels ' opening - day game against the Oakland As , witnesses saw 27 - year - old Brian Powers fighting with another man near a stairwell in the right - field pavilion , according to the Anaheim Police Department .
During the fight , witnesses said , a third man approached Powers from behind and punched him in the head , making him fall and strike his head on a concrete step .
Powers was rushed to UC Irvine Medical Center , where he was pronounced brain dead around midnight Tuesday , said Anaheim Police Sgt. Rick Martinez .
" We 're asking the public 's help to find out what the fight was about , " Martinez said .
The male suspects , who fled before police arrived , are described as being between 25 - 30 years old with goatees .
Police are reviewing security videos that may have captured the attack .
Witnesses are asked to call Anaheim police at ( 714 ) 765-1944 .

When people find out I make games for a living , their first response is " coooool " .
The next question is almost always " So you program games , then ? " , to which I answer " no " .
Then comes the confusing explanation of what a game designer does .
After being asked what a game designer does , my usual answer is , " I write documents that no one reads . "
Yeah , it 's a funny answer .
And as any game designer will tell you , it frequently rings true .
There 's two big reasons for that -- besides that all the other game developers are lazy .
Our documents are organized in a way that makes it difficult finding the pertinent information and designers tend to write way more than they need to .
The tools are the thing
Today , I 'll take a look at the first reason : the tools .
Like any good carpenter , good tools make the difference between a crappy product and something you 'd actually feel good about selling .
Most designers use a couple different tools for creating , editing and balancing game design documents .
These tools fall into a few categories :
Text editing
Spreadsheet
Image Editing
Text editing is the primary tool .
The text editor is what glues all the other design docs together .
Microsoft
Word is the most commonly used .
It 's on most systems , and is pretty easy to use .
Text editing is what I 'm going to be talking about , and showing you the alternatives to Microsoft Word , and the strengths and weaknesses of each method .
Requirements
There are a few requirements for a text editing tool that game designers need .
Otherwise , Notepad would do just fine .
We need our editor to do a bunch of other crap though , so we 've got to use something a little fancier .
So here 's the list of requirements that I use to judge the appropriateness of any kind of text editor for designing games :
Ease of Access
This is how easy it is to get to the document and edit it .
Some are only available in file folders ( Word ) .
Others are available and editable online ( Wiki ) .
Importability of Excel
It does n't have to be Excel specifically .
As a designer , you 're going to be creating a lot of tables of different times .
Some will have auto calculated formulas .
Others will have images and descriptions and specifications .
How easy is it to get that data from a spreadsheet to a table in your primary design doc ?
Images are great .
When used as a background , they help sell the design .
When used in place of text ( as often as you can ! ) they help teach the rest of your team exactly what you meant when you were designing your mechanic .
Ease of Editing
This is how easy it is to do your job .
Do you have to learn a new language to program your text , or can you use a plain old WYSIWYG editor to input your data ?
Source Protection
Possibly the most important requirement .
How do you control access to editing , and old versions ?
Gilbert V. Levin , Ph.D. 
The Brains Behind the New , Low - Calorie Sugar , D - Tagatose Dr. Gilbert V. Levin , inventor and holder of more than 50 patents , is an environmental engineer with a Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University .
In 1967 , Dr. Levin founded Biospherics , Inc. , a bioengineering firm which has since blossomed into a multi- disciplined entity whose main theme is innovation .
Most recently , Biospherics ( now Spherix Incorporated ) announced the development of a revolutionary new low - calorie sweetener , tagatose , which is expected to hit the food market with a bang in 2003 .
FoodTechSource spoke with Dr. Levin , who invented the life detection experiment placed aboard the 1976 Mars Viking 1 and Viking 2 landers , for a glimpse at the processes involved in developing such an innovative product and bringing it to market .
FoodTechSource : What is D- tagatose ?
Gilbert Levin , Ph.D. : Tagatose is a natural sugar which appears in nature in small quantities .
It s a very simple six - carbon sugar , or hexose , that is nearly identical to the six - carbon hexose fructose .
It differs in that it is inverted at one carbon center the hydroxyl ion is on the opposite side , as is the hydrogen ion , from the molecular configuration of fructose .
And this conveys to it the characteristic that it is not wholly metabolized by humans .
Or any animals .
FTS : It tastes sweet , like sugar ?
Levin :
Yes , it is a sugar and it does taste like sugar ; it is 92 % as sweet as table sugar so it makes for essentially a 1:1 substitution .
The big advantage of it is that it is of the same bulk as table sugar .
The sweeteners that are generally in use now as low calorie sweeteners are high - intensity sweeteners .
A tiny pinch supplies all the sweetness that is required .
That s fine if you re making beverages , in which case the bulk is supplied by water .
But if you re baking a cake , where the bulk is say 35 % sugar , you cant make it by just adding a little pinch of something .
So we will be addressing those markets which are relatively unaddressed now : baked goods ; chocolate candies , which are 50 to 60 % sugar ; gum , which is 50 to 60 % sugar ; catsup , which is 35 % sugar ; ice cream ; frozen desserts ; pies ; anything where the bulk of sugar is an important ingredient .
FTS : How did your company first become interested in the development of tagatose ?
Levin :
One of the early projects at Biospherics was the development of an experiment for NASA to look for microbial life on Mars .
And this experiment did fly on the 1976 Viking missions .
In the course of developing the experiment I had to design a nutrient which we were going to squirt onto Martian soil and then see whether there was a reaction .
The production of gas indicated metabolism .
In developing that nutrient I first looked at the conventional form of glucose as an ingredient because every living thing we know of eats glucose .
Then it dawned on me : suppose Martian bugs , if they exist , are different from Earth bugs ....
The glucose we eat and metabolize is all the D- , or right - handed , configuration .
But there is a left - handed version of the molecule , known as L - glucose , which exists but which life forms on Earth do not metabolize .
So , I thought ,  Boy , I better send both kinds of glucose to Mars to make sure I dont miss any life that might be there .
And while developing that it occurred to me if we cant digest L - glucose , and if its sweet , maybe it could be used as a low - calorie sweetener for humans .
 One of the early projects at Biospherics was the development of an experiment for NASA to look for microbial life on Mars . 
FTS : Can it be ?
Levin :
It turns out that L - glucose would be excellent as a low - calorie sweetener , as would some of the other L - sugars we hold patents on .
But we were never able to make it cheaply enough to think about a commercial market .
FTS : When did you stumble across tagatose ?
Levin :
At about that same time we realized how closely D - tagatose resembled L - fructose which was also a good candidate but we couldnt make that cheaply , either .
So , we decided to try D - tagatose , and we found in rat feeding studies that it was very , very low in caloric content .
We secured a patent in 1988 and continued development on our own until  96 , when we licensed the process for use of tagatose in foods and beverages to a Danish company .
On April 11 , 2001 , they obtained GRAS ( Generally Recognized As Safe ) status for tagatose , which is required by the FDA for sales in the U.S. FTS : I understand tagatose has uses other than just with food and beverage , correct ?
Levin : Yes .
It has multiple uses as a drug or a drug adjuvant .
Principally , it seems to be very good in treating type 2 diabetes .
A couple of small clinical trials were run by the University of Maryland School of Medicine using diabetics .
The outcomes were quite good so we are now seeking to develop it for that purpose as well .
Those rights we still retain .
FTS : Are you going to be pursuing the pharmaceutical angle on this ?
That requires a whole different set of approvals , doesnt it ?.
Levin : Correct .
And there you are talking a billion dollars and ten years investment .
We re looking for some big partner to take that on .
FTS : Expenses of a billion dollars ?!
Levin :
That s what a typical drug development cycle runs .
It could run somewhere between $ 500 million and $ 1 billion and take up to ten years .
All the studies , the safety evaluations , the clinical trials to show efficacy ; its a very big deal .
FTS : What about marketing D - tagatose as a nutriceutical ?
Levin :
It will be an excellent nutriceutical and we have convinced our licensee to sell it as such .
Diabetics can eat it without experiencing any rise in blood sugar for the first time they will have a real sugar they can eat .
It also protects against spikes in blood sugar levels even if a diabetic eats something containing glucose hours later that was shown in the University of Maryland studies .
We are also looking at its use to preserve human organs , such as the liver , during transplant .
You have to store these organs , and in studies that were done at ETH , the Swiss Federal Institute , D - tagatose was shown to protect liver cells against attack from heavy metals and very toxic materials .
So , the inventor has filed for a patent on that , and we obtained an exclusive license .
 Diabetics can eat D - tagatose without experiencing any rise in blood glucose levels . 
FTS : Goodness ....
Anything else ?
Levin :
Well , we just today received notice of allowance for a patent which we will surely get on the use of tagatose to increase fertility and to produce heavier fetuses .
This is based on tests done with rats those taking D - tagatose had larger fetuses , and a higher number that were viable , than those which did not take it .
FTS : Is this a nutriceutical application ?
Levin :
No , this would be a pharmaceutical application .
It would be prescribed under a doctors care and it would be an extremely high dosage .
The normal dose that you re going to eat in your candies and cakes would not apply here .
FTS : That is quite a long series of claims .
Levin :
There is more .
The Danes have discovered that tagatose is a prebiotic meaning it fosters so - called good microorganisms in the intestines and decreases the population of bad ones , such as E. coli O157:H7 .
It aids the digestive process .
In addition , it produces short chain fatty acids in particular butyrate , a naturally occurring compound that has been cited in several publications as fighting against colon cancer .
Understand , we are not making that claim , but nonetheless tagatose produces butyrate and people have made such claims for butyrate .
FTS : So , it has tremendous promise as a nutriceutical ?
Levin : Yes .
And we had some trouble initially convincing our licensee to look at that because when we first began the research , nutriceuticals had a bad name .
But now everybodys into them .
FTS : What problems , if any , have you encountered during the development of this product ?
Levin :
Well , I would not say it was a problem , but our licensee took a very conservative route to obtain GRAS status for its product .
They appointed an internationally renowned group of scientists to form an expert panel to review the data .
And they not only provided the panel with all the data we had developed over a ten - year period , but made many new studies .
And , of course , we made our studies on humans at the University of Maryland available , which I think was the first time any sweetener actually had human studies the FDA doesnt require human studies for foods .
So , Arla Foods took a very long path , but it was worth it because normally when a unique food product like ours is introduced it comes under attack .
Arla wanted to be in the strongest possible defense posture to say , no , weve done all the testing and so on .
FTS : Was there a reason you went overseas for the licensing deal ?
Levin : Yes .
We couldnt get any American companies to take it on .
American companies are geared toward short - term growth .
They immediately thought it would mean at least a five - year development period , and most CEOs are only in for five years , with their retirements geared to their profitability .
So , a lot of them think why should I do this for the next guy ?
FTS : It didnt have anything to do with going up against Monsanto ?
Levin :
No , I gave Monsanto an opportunity and they declined it .
FTS : So , you havent run into any problems with people suggesting it is just another sweetener and Monsanto is too big to mess with ?
Levin :
Oh yes , we had this guy on Barrons who came out with an editorial against it when we first got our patent he said its ridiculous , a phony balloon , we dont need another sweetener because weve got aspartame ... he didnt understand were talking about a whole different market from aspartame , and a much larger market in baked goods .
 Tagatose addresses a much larger market than aspartame you cant bake a pie with NutraSweet ! 
FTS : What is the difference between aspartame and tagatose ?
Levin :
You just cant make a pie with NutraSweet !
You cant make ice cream .
If you do you need another bulking agent to take the place of the sugar you are keeping out .
And there is only one bulking agent polydextrose , by Pfizer and it hasnt been very popular because it has an aftertaste .
FTS : Is that the aftertaste people complain about with Nutrasweet ?
Levin :
No , aspartame has an aftertaste of its own , as well .
FTS : So , basically then , aspartame and tagatose have different attributes which lend themselves to different markets .
Levin :
For the most part .
However , we never thought this product could be used in soft drinks because on an equal sweetness basis it is much more expensive than aspartame .
But the Danes did some experiments and they found out that if you take a tiny bit of tagatose and place it into these diet sodas made with aspartame , it makes the cola taste better .
So , they filed for a patent on the synergy of tagatose with the high - intensity sweeteners and they have gotten considerable interest on the part of several major soda manufacturers .
So it looks like we will compete with them in that market , as well .
FTS : How important was it for you to obtain GRAS status ?
Levin :
It was very important , because even though we knew we were going to get the GRAS , the Danes would not commit to building a manufacturing plant until GRAS were obtained .
So now with that having happened , they are moving forward with their plans to commercialize .
You cant sell it until you build the plant and make it .
FTS : When do you expect that to take place ?
Levin :
It is our hope we cant really predict what they are going to do we will be on the market within about two years .
FTS : What is involved in going from the R&D stage to the production stage ?
Levin :
What we did , as soon as we signed a tentative licensing agreement with them , we went over to Denmark and helped them construct a pilot plant .
We designed it and had our guys help them put it up .
They ran the pilot plant for a year before they decided they were really going to sign on , firmly .
It was a question of optimizing the process to go from pilot - scale production to full - scale .
They have fully designed the plant now , they have also located a site where they are going to put it .
We re just anxious for them to go ahead and start the brick work .
FTS : Will you be marketing overseas ?
Levin :
Now that they have GRAS in the US they are going ahead to get GRAS , or its equivalent , in all the major European countries and around the world .
FTS : Do you expect they might run into problems with the European Union regulations ?
Levin : I think the EU is developing regulations essentially the same as the FDAs .
But in addition there is a European Committee on Food Additives ; it will meet in June and at that time will consider making a recommendation on tagatose .
FTS : Spherix is obviously very firmly entrenched in biotechnology .
What s on your horizon ?
Levin : A very bright future .
We are launching a new product called FlyCracker , which is a safe - for - humans pesticide .
It s being marketed now for use against flies in stables , barns , food processing plants , poultry plants ... any enclosed - environment plant .
This is a simple powder that gets sprinkled around the periphery of the area and prevents any fly larvae from pupating , so that no eggs develop .
We think it is a very important product because it is perfectly safe for humans and for the animals .
 We have developed expertise in small molecule carbohydrates ; theres a theme to our biotech program . 
Why has n’t Skype really taken off in the US ?
Let me get a few things straight first .
I do not work for and am in no way affiliated with Skype .
But , Skype is great .
It ’s free , it ’s easy to use , and it ’s clear as a bell when talking on it .
Conference calls are easy to setup and run .
Video calls are clear , not perfect , but clear and sound and look good .
Also , it ’s becoming more and more available .
There is a Skype app for the iPhone as well as other mobile phones and it ’s even on the PSP .
In addition , they have very inexpensive rates for having your own phone number and making calls to regular phones .
Like I said , Skype is great .
So what is the deal ?
Why is n’t 100 % of the US on Skype ?
What are we waiting for ?
I ’ve read that about 70 % of the US is already on broadband .
And that number is on the rise .
Last time I checked , we are in a recession and money is tight .
Skype is free for Skype - to - Skype calls .
And Skype is cheap , cheap , cheap for Skype calls to regular phones and cell phones .
So what is holding us back ?
One thing could be availability .
Skype is mostly limited to the home PC .
Yes , there is an iPhone app in addition to applications for other mobile phones .
The problem with the iPhone app is that it cannot run in the background .
You have to open it to use it .
You almost have to purposely coordinate with someone to make a free Skype call .
Kinda defeats the purpose , right ?
Also related to availability is the fact that most people ’s home PC is not in a place where they hang out the most .
Say you ’re chillin with your significant other or your family .
You ’d have to excuse yourself from the room to go have a Skype call .
It ’s a bit of a pain in the ass .
Another thing holding people back is that unless you have a microphone on your laptop , you have to purchase another piece of equipment .
Purchasing a headset or webcam with a microphone is not expensive , but it is a purchase that most people will probably put very low on their budget totem poll .
But I really do n’t think availability or equipment is the real issue .
In fact , I ’m not sure what the real issue is .
I love Skype but I do n’t use it as much as I should .
I ’ve got it on my home PC , my personal laptop , and on my iPhone .
Yet , I almost never use it .
I keep telling myself that the reason I never use it is because none of my friends are on it .
How weak is that excuse ?
Perhaps if I was on it and always encouraged everyone I know to get on it , they would .
The number of Skype users has grown every year .
The number of Skype calls have grown every year .
Skype is being used all over the place … and yes , including on Oprah .
Europe has taken to Skype and been using it extensively for years .
Now it ’s our time .
If you start using Skype , I will too .
Let ’s get this thing going and start saving our cellular minutes .
Let ’s cancel our home phones and just use Skype .
It ’s just takes a few people to encourage a few more people then next thing you know , we ’re all talking for free .
I want to talk for free … do n’t you ?

LOS ANGELES , May 6 ( UPI ) -- " The Station Agent " collaborators Tom McCarthy and Peter Dinklage are set to work together again on the HBO fantasy pilot " Game of Thrones . "
The Hollywood Reporter said McCarthy has signed on to direct Dinklage in " Thrones , " a small - screen adaptation of George R.R. Martin 's popular " Songs of Fire and Ice " novels .

David Benioff and D.B. Weiss wrote the pilot script and will serve as executive producers .
Shooting on " Thrones " is slated to begin in the fall in Belfast , Northern Ireland , the entertainment industry trade newspaper said .
Google confirmed Monday that it is going to start adding a map of local findings to search results for things like “ pizza , ” “ burger ” and “ dentist , ” something that Google watchers have been buzzing about for months .
Google already does this if you specify your location , such as when you type “ pizza San Jose . ”
But it has been debating whether or not to tweak its algorithm to assume someone wants a map of nearby pizzerias if they just type “ pizza . ”
Paul Levine , the former general manager for Yahoo ’s local search division , said in an online discussion last week that the practice has been around for years , and that the search engines will infer a user ’s location based on their IP address , which is the string of numbers that identifies your computer to your Internet service provider .
IP addresses tend to correspond to geographic areas .
In the past , however , search engines have been concerned that some people would be uncomfortable that Google or Yahoo or Microsoft could figure out their location .
That concern appears to be fading as location - based services become more common .
“ Google would n’t be doing this unless it was confident that it was right about what people want , ” said Greg Sterling , of Sterling Market Intelligence .

Reports from Japan say that a new supercomputer processor has taken the crown of world 's fastest by not just beating , but obliterating the old record .
Fujitsu 's eight - core SPARC64 VIIIfx Venus CPU was clocked at 128 billion computations per second , which destroyed the previous Intel - held record by a factor of 2.5 .
Energy efficient
The new processor is both smaller and more energy - efficient than its predecessors thanks to smaller core components .
The 128 - gigaflops chip is based on 45nm circuitry , compared to Intel 's 90nm processes on the Itanium 2 chips that had held the record .
However , the US firm says it is also moving to 45nm for the next Itanium , so Fujitsu appears to have a fight on its hands in the brewing supercomputer war .
Update : Looks like we have some debate in the comments below , partly because the Xbitlabs source appears to be down , thereby making corroborating data a little thin on the ground .
Suffice it to say , we 've given you what detail we can gather on a weekend and there 'll be scope to return to the Venus CPU when Fujitsu spills all the beans in future .

FerFal ,
This topic is timely as we are having a discussion on the Life After the Oil Crash Forum about starting micro businesses based on the top items needed after a crash .
Can you give us an idea of what items / services people want the most post crash .
Here 's a link to the discussion .
http://www.doomers.us/forum2/index.php/topic,40122.0.html.
Thanks in advance !
Of course you have the basics : food , water , shelter and medicine .
( Renting real estate will become a good business , by the way )
Problem with the food market is , it ’s as old as mankind itself , you can hardly compete with the big firms .
The smaller producer will find himself out of his league unless he has a couple hundred acres .
It ’s better to try to exploit the “ small mom and pop ” thing , find the marketing niche , organic food .
But this is very tricky .
I mean most people I know that grow food small scale know well enough its for them and not profitable as a business idea .
This is a common mistake among the survivalist community if you ask me .
What I started calling the “ Little house on the Prairie “ syndrome .
Guys , the only way you ’ll go back to 1800 is if you build a time machine .
Serious .
Barrel maker , carriage builder , carriage wheel repairer , making horse shoes for a living … making a fortune selling candles .
Even trapper was suggested somewhere .
What can I tell you ?
I do n’t see that here .
I ’ve researched and talked to others on eastern Europe and Africa and nope , not the kind of thing that will get you serious money .
Some of the lists going around the various forums are simply lists of skills used a couple hundred years ago , very wild west like .
But again , it ’s wishful thinking , and not something I see reflected here or in other places where SHTF .
Even gun smithing .
Gunsmithing is something that will certainly go DOWN , not up .
People will have guns for defense but spend as little money as possible .
No more tacticool 2000 USD 1911 for many .
Those are “ nice to have ” , and “ nice to have ” doens ’t cut it for SHTF market .
They wont spend what little money they have on something like that , at least MOST people wont .
This is the kind of subject that could go on forever .
Serious , the dynamics of the post SHTF market could fill libraries .
My friend in USA asked for bit of advice regarding business ideas the other day .
He told me a bit about what he had in mind , and at some point he said he had a buddy that offered him a percentage on a car sound system installation shop , also doing tainted glasses and car alarm .
He said that he did n’t think people would want to spend money on an fancy sound system during the depression .
We talked about how car alarms and security film for windows would go up in demand .
Also tainted for security reasons .
When we got to the sound system part , he asked what I thought about that .
I told him “ well … there ’s a few things people want when SHTF : “ Booze , religion , drugs , prostitutes and gambling .. and a loud car ”
I told him that its common here to see total rust buckets from the 70’s with maybe 1000 bucks worth of sound system .
Maybe more expensive than the car itself .
Of course any business can fail , but if his friend does things right and is a smart business man , he has a fair success chance .
My friend say “ Man , peoples are stupid ”
I told him “ YES , dude , they are ”
But why , why would a poor guy spend his hard earned money , the little he has , on something like that ?
Because that ’s the way people are !
Maybe the guy has n’t got a week worth of food and water OR cash , but he ’s gladly going to spend it on drugs , or a fancy sound system , simply because it makes him feel less miserable .
That ’s valuable folks , ESPECIALLY when SHTF and getting depressed and feeling miserable is so easy .
It ’s what I like to call “ affordable luxuries ” .
I see it here all the time , and you see it in other poor nations .
They ca n’t afford the fancy car anymore , but they can afford the expensive tires or sound system .
A loud sound system can be turned up the volume .. wake up everyone … everyone sees you have the fancy gadget … ego boost for our poor guy .
See the mentality I ’m talking about ?
Something similar happens with cell phones .
Selling cell phones is a pretty nice gig during depression .
It ’s an “ affordable luxury ” .
I do n’t have a home of my own , or a car , “ but take a look at my nice ( toy ) phone ” .
The guy / girl already feels better about himself .
Same happens for jewelry .
Most women can’t afford the gold anymore , and it ’s too dangerous even if they can .
But there ’s still silver , and “ quirurgic steel ” jewelry is becoming more and more popular .
Affordable , looks good , shiny , wont get stolen in 10 minutes .
Research the market and promote it well and you have a winning combination .
Forget the old days , at least as business ideas .
Recognize the new needs and the new society you are dealing with and what they want / need .
There ’s how you start a real post SHTF business .

AVUS Performance have released their refined flat black Audi A5 , naming it the A5 Coupe Matte Black .
They wanted to keep it simple because of all the controversy with their last project , the Audi RS6 named White Power .
The German car tuning house aimed at giving this Audi the complete package which includes performance mods , improved handling , and a customized exterior .
Starting with the engine , it comes with Audi ’s 3.0 liter V6 TDI diesel which has an upgraded ECU , boosting the horsepower to 275 from the stock 235 hp , while the torque was also increased from 370 lb - ft to 442 lb - ft .
A brand new set of adjustable KW coilovers were installed to improve the handling and make the wheels fit flush with the fender .
Limited edition 21 - inch wheels from Jofiel were fitted measuring 9.5×21 in the front and 11×21 in the rear .
To match the wheels , the Audi A5 was wrapped in matte black foil while minor parts such as the front grille , rear diffuser , and mirror covers were painted to match the body .
AVUS was definitely able to achieve the stealth look with this model , and they even threw on a set of S5 LED tail lights to make it extra unique .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
Banks are socking away funds for future loan losses at a record clip .
But at the sickliest institutions , problem loans are rising even faster .
On Monday , Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) became the latest big bank to report a stronger - than - expected quarterly profit , posting net income of $ 4.2 billion , or 44 cents a share .
Analysts had expected a profit of just 4 cents a share .
Like its rivals Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) , JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) and Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) , Charlotte - based BofA pointed to strong fixed - income trading results and a big rise in earnings from its mortgage business .
BofA managed to post the big profit even as it set aside more than $ 6 billion to cover future loan losses .
The bank 's loan loss reserve now stands at $ 30 billion -- double its year - ago level .
BofA expects more borrowers will fall behind on payments or default on their loans as job losses deepen and the economy struggles through its worst recession in decades .
" We understand that we continue to face extremely difficult challenges primarily from deteriorating credit quality driven by weakness in the economy and growing unemployment , " CEO Ken Lewis said in a statement Monday morning .
Yet as much money as BofA is putting away , both it and Citi -- the two big banks that have received multiple infusions of federal aid over the past year -- are reporting sharp rises in problem loans , particularly on their big credit card portfolios .
BofA posted a $ 1.8 billion loss in its global cards business in the latest quarter .
These high credit costs could weigh on the banks ' earnings for many quarters -- and perhaps even affect the regulatory stress tests whose results are due to be revealed in coming weeks .
Not keeping pace
While BofA has doubled its loan loss reserve , nonperforming assets -- loans that are no longer producing income as borrowers fall behind on payments -- have more than tripled , reflecting the weakening economy and the acquisition of troubled Countrywide and Merrill Lynch .
As a result , BofA 's loan loss reserve now covers just 121 % of its nonperforming loans -- down from 203 % a year ago .
That means the bank has a thinning cushion just as the industry braces for rising losses on commercial and industrial loans , as well as continuing declines in residential real estate .
Another bank with a thin cushion is Citi , which reported an unexpected $ 1.6 billion first - quarter profit Friday even as credit costs doubled from a year ago .
Though Citi's loan loss reserve has jumped 78 % from a year earlier , nonperforming assets have more than doubled over the same span .
As a result , Citi 's loan - loss coverage ratio has slipped to 121 % , from 177 % a year earlier .
In contrast , the stronger big banks -- JPMorgan , which posted a $ 2.1 billion first - quarter profit last Thursday , and Wells Fargo , which said earlier this month it expects to make $ 3 billion in the quarter -- have healthier coverage ratios , thanks to extensive reserve building .
At JPMorgan , for instance , nonperforming assets have jumped to $ 11 billion from $ 4 billion in the span of a year .
But the bank has been bulking up its reserves at a similar pace .
As a result , JPMorgan 's loss reserves at the end of the first quarter amounted to 241 % of nonperforming assets -- double the coverage at Citi and BofA , although down from 271 % a year ago .
And Wells Fargo 's reserve ratios have risen significantly over the past year , in large measure due to a $ 37 billion writedown of bad loans associated with its Dec. 31 acquisition of Charlotte - based lender Wachovia .
Wells ' reserves were 255 % of nonperforming assets at the end of the first quarter , according to estimates by analysts at Fox - Pitt Kelton , up from 134 % a year earlier .
( The bank has yet to report its full results for the first quarter . )
While coverage ratios are far from the only indicator of a bank 's health heading into a prolonged period of economic distress , they are likely to be one factor in the stress tests being conducted by federal regulators .
The Federal Reserve and Treasury are expected to begin informing the 19 big banks taking the tests of their results in coming weeks .
Those that with lower scores are expected to be forced to raise capital , though the terms and the timing are n't clear .
Concerns about the health of the banking sector helped to send shares of most big banks down in midday trading Monday .
Still , even BofA -- the biggest loser Monday with a 15 % decline -- has experienced a stunning rally since the sector hit its recent low in early March .
At their lows Monday , BofA shares had tripled off their March 6 floor .

Die Bekämpfung des Terrorismus dient als Argument , die Sicherheitsgesetze zu verschärfen .
Dabei geraten zunehmend unverdächtige Bürger in den Blick der Sicherheitsbehörden und die Grundprinzipien der Verfassung sind in Gefahr , warnt der liberale Sicherheits - und Innenexperte Baum .
Er fordert : Der Staat darf das Augenmaß nicht verlieren .
tagesschau.de : Ist die Geschichte des Grundgesetzes eine Erfolgsgeschichte ?
Gerhart Baum ( FDP ) : " Unverdächtige Bürger geraten in den Blick der Sicherheitsbehörden . "
Baum : Ja .
Wir leben als Deutsche bewusst und gewollt das erste Mal in einer wirklichen Demokratie .
Es ist eine geglückte Demokratie , die wir aufgebaut haben .
– bei allen Gefährdungen und Mängeln .
tagesschau.de : Sie sagen " wir " – brauchten die Deutschen nicht Anschubhilfe von den Alliierten ?
Baum :
In gewisser Weise ja .
Die Freiheit ist uns gebracht worden , wir haben sie nicht erkämpft .
Erkämpft haben die Freiheit 1989 die Deutschen in der früheren DDR .
tagesschau.de : Da Sie es gerade thematisieren : Bis zu Wiedervereinigung war das Grundgesetz ja vorläufig .
Hätte man nicht nach 1989 das gemeinsame Grundgesetz dem Volk noch einmal zur Abstimmung vorlegen müssen ?
Baum : Ja und nein .
Das ging alles so schnell und der Druck war groß , zu Ergebnissen zu kommen , so dass ich Verständnis dafür habe , dass man das nicht gemacht hat .
Etwas Besseres hätten wir nicht bekommen .
Gerhart Baum Der liberale Politiker Gerhart Baum ( * 1932 ) war von 1978 bis 1982 Bundesinnenminister .
Von 1972 bis 1994 war er Bundestagsabgeordneter .
Seitdem engagiert er sich auf anderer Ebene für die Menschenwürde .
So legte er 2003 mit Sabine Leutheusser - Schnarrenber und Burkhard Hirsch erfolgreich Verfassungsbeschwerde gegen den " Großen Lauschangriff " ein .
Erfolgreich waren auch Verfassungsbeschwerden gegen das Luftsicherheitsgesetz und die Online - Durchsuchung in Nordrhein - Westfalen .
Glücklich über das sittliche Leitbild
tagesschau.de : Sie sprachen von Gefährdungen des Grundgesetzes .
Welche neuralgischen Punkte sehen Sie im Grundgesetz ?
Baum :
Ich bin sehr glücklich , dass wir zum ersten Mal eine Verfassung haben , die auf einem sittlichen Leitbild beruht , dem Prinzip der Menschenwürde .
Wir haben einklagbare Grundrechte ; wir haben ein Verfassungsgericht , das über die Verfassungskonformität wacht .
Das sind Errungenschaften , die es uns ermöglichen , der zunehmenden Erosion der Grundrechte – vor allem im Bereich der inneren Sicherheit – entgegenzuwirken .
tagesschau.de : Sie meinen die Gesetzgebung zur Bekämpfung von Terrorismus und Kriminalität ?
Baum :
Wir erleben zurzeit eine Verlagerung vom Prinzip der Freiheit hin zur Sicherheit – und zwar auf Kosten des Grundprinzips unserer Verfassung , der Menschenwürde .
Das heißt , unverdächtige Bürger geraten in den Blick der Sicherheitsbehörden .
Das ist eine Tendenz , die ich bekämpfe .
Es geht auch nicht , dass der Staat bei der Bekämpfung von Kriminalität das Augenmaß verliert .
Es gibt eine fatale Tendenz : Sicherheit wird zum Selbstzweck und wird der Freiheit untergeordnet .
Die Grenzen der Verfassung überschritten
tagesschau.de : Können Sie Beispiele nennen ?
Baum :
Wir haben eine Serie von Verfassungsgerichtsurteilen erstritten , die der Politik deutlich gemacht haben , dass sie die Grenzen der Verfassung überschritten hat .
Der Lauschangriff in Wohnungen ist eingeschränkt worden .
Der Kernbereich der Privatheit muss respektiert werden .
Der Zugriff auf Computer , also die Online - Durchsuchung , ist an rechtsstaatliche Kriterien gebunden worden .
Der Abschuss von Passagiermaschinen mit unschuldigen , unbeteiligten Menschen an Bord ist verboten worden .
Jetzt laufen die Beschwerden gegen Vorratsdatenspeicherung und gegen die neuen Befugnisse des Bundeskriminalamtes .
tagesschau.de : Sie haben einige Ihrer Erfolge hinsichtlich der Auslegung des Grundgesetzes genannt .
Wann ist etwas schief gelaufen ?
Baum : Nicht bestanden worden ist die Bewährungsprobe im Fall des Asylrechts .
Der fundamentale Grundsatz , dass politisch Verfolgte Asyl genießen , ist in den 90er Jahren ausgehöhlt worden .
Die Politik ist der Volksstimmung gegen Asylbewerber gefolgt .
Der fundamentale Grundsatz gilt in der Praxis nicht mehr .
tagesschau.de : Ist unser Grundgesetz durch das Zusammenwachsen Europas , den Lissabon - Vertrag , in Gefahr ?
Baum : Ja. Das könnte passieren .
Ich bin ein überzeugter Befürworter der europäischen Vereinigung .
Ich sehe aber die Gefahr , dass die strikte Grundrechtsorientierung - eine Reaktion auf die Nazi-Barbarei - abgeschwächt werden könnte .
Der Gründungsmythos unseres Grundgesetzes ist eindeutig die tiefe Zäsur zur Nazi-Diktatur .
In anderen europäischen Demokratien ist das nicht so .
Unsere Verfassungsväter waren alle geprägt von dieser schrecklichen Lebenserfahrung .
Keine europäische Zivilgesellschaft
tagesschau.de : Beziehen
Sie sich damit auf die Gefahr , dass wir das Grundrecht auf Verfassungsbeschwerde verlieren , das sie eingangs betont haben ?
Baum : Ja , es gibt die Gefahr , dass unser Verfassungsgericht nicht mehr diese Rolle spielt .
Dazu kommt , dass der Europäische Gerichtshof seine Bewährung in Grundrechtsfragen noch nicht bestanden hat .
Die Gefahr für die Grundrechtsorientierung habe ich schon genannt .
Eine dritte Gefahr besteht darin , dass es keine europäische Zivilgesellschaft gibt , die an der europäischen Gesetzgebung mitwirken könnte .
Es gibt keine gewachsene europäische Öffentlichkeit , ganz anders als in den Nationalstaaten .
tagesschau.de :
Wenn es nur nach Ihnen ginge : Welchen Paragraphen würden Sie dem Grundgesetz hinzufügen , welchen würden Sie ändern ?
Baum : Ich würde das Grundgesetz nicht mit Änderungen überziehen .
Die Tendenz , alles ins Grundgesetz zu schreiben , was eigentlich reine Politik ist , halte ich für falsch .
Das Grundgesetz muss interpretiert werden im Geiste von 1949 .
Zum Beispiel brauchen wir kein ausdrückliches Grundrecht auf Datenschutz , denn wir haben eine wunderbare Verfassungsrechtsprechung dazu .
Mein Wunsch : Wir sollten das Grundrecht auf politische Asyl mindestens teilweise wiederherstellen .
Und wir sollten auch die Änderungen des Grundgesetzes durch die Notstandsgesetze aus den 60er Jahren überprüfen .
Das Interview führte Nea Matzen , tagesschau.de
Wednesday Intel took the wraps off the next iteration of its Xeon server line , the Nehalem EX , which will debut in the second half of this year .
Nehalem EX has up to 8 cores , which gives a total of 16 threads per socket ( with hyperthreading ) .
That 's a lot of threads in one socket , so it 's good that Intel outfitted the chip with plenty of I/O and memory bandwidth in the form of four QPI links and two integrated memory controllers .
Also helping to keep the cores fed is a 24MB cache .
The whole thing weighs in at 2.3 billion transistors , which is even larger than the record - breaking 2 billion - transistor " Tukwila " Itanium that Intel unveiled in February of last year .
At the time , the quad - core Tukwila was Intel 's largest processor , and the fact that an x86 part has caught up with it in size and will launch ahead of it ( Tukwila is delayed yet again ) says something about where Xeon is headed .
Nehalem EX will pack quite a performance wallop when it drops later this year , continuing x86's decades - long march into the very high end of the server market .
I interpret recent remarks by IBM that x86 virtualization is n't ready for use in real mission - critical applications in light of this reality .
Not that Nehalem - EX - based systems are an immediate threat to IBM 's POWER line , but since the company sells systems based on both chips it will continue to take pains to stress the advantages of its own high - end hardware in the face of feature and performance increases from Intel .
Drawing this distinction was particularly important this time around , since IBM participated in the Nehalem - EX reveal to tout a 64 - core , 128 - thread server of its own based on the new processor .
Here 's the full Nehalem - EX feature bullet list :
Intel Nehalem Architecture built on Intel 's unique 45 nm high -k metal gate technology process
Up to 8 cores per processor
Up to 16 threads per processor with Intel� Hyper- threading
Scalability up to eight sockets via Quick Path Interconnects and greater with third - party node controllers
QuickPath Architecture with four high - bandwidth links
24MB of shared cache
Integrated memory controllers
Intel Turbo Boost Technology
Intel scalable memory buffer and scalable memory interconnects
Up to 9 x the memory bandwidth of previous generation
Support for up to 16 memory slots per processor socket
Advanced RAS capabilities including MCA Recovery
2.3 billion transistors
On the AMD side of the fence , the six - core Istanbul will launch next week and will take on Intel 's six - core Dunnington Xeon .
Because Dunnington is a drop - in replacement for Intel 's legacy , pre-QPI Xeon parts — it was introduced as a sort of stop - gap for the Xeon line while we waited for Nehalem to go multisocket — it'll be a much easier target for Istanbul than QPI - enabled , bandwidth - heavy Nehalem - EX .
The latter chip will be well out of reach of Istanbul in terms of performance .
" AND , OH YES , I'M MAD AS A FRIGGIN ' HATTER " Anyone who 's tried to read the drivel penned over the decades by Peggy Noonan , or has been forced to listen to the " eloquent " speeches she 's written for presidents and such , knows the feeling of trying helplessly to puzzle out :
Is she just dumber than spit , or is she completely out of her pea- pickin ' mind ?
" We ’re not talking fringe activists here ; we ’re talking U.S. senators .
The truth is that lunatics have been running this particular asylum for years . "

A note on identity politics
The attacks on Sonia Sotomayor are getting crazier by the minute .
The pronunciation of her name is unnatural .
Her fondness for Puerto Rican cuisine -- sorry , her " claimed " fondness ( you never know ) -- may cloud her impartiality .
She does n't have enough money in her retirement account .
But is this any crazier , when you come down to it , than the Cult of Bush that ruled much of Washington for years ?
It was positive , not negative ( though there was plenty of that too ) , but it was similarly about identity politics -- you were supposed to support Bush , not because of how he did his job , but because he was , drumroll , a regular guy .
Remember Peggy Noonan : I was asked this week why the president seems so attractive to the heartland , to what used to be called Middle America .
A big question .
I found my mind going to this word : normal .
Mr. Bush is the triumph of the seemingly average American man .
He 's normal .
He thinks in a sort of common - sense way .
He speaks the language of business and sports and politics .
You know him .
He 's not exotic .
But if there 's a fire on the block , he ’ll run out and help .
He 'll help direct the rig to the right house and count the kids coming out and say , “ Where 's Sally ? ”
He 's responsible .
He 's not an intellectual .
Of course , a year and a half later there really was a fire on the block — actually a flood in New Orleans , but basically the same thing — and what he actually said was , “ Brownie , you ’re doing a heck of a job . ”
But I digress .
The thing that is really driving conservatives crazy , I think , is that their identity politics just is n’t working like it used to .
Their whole approach has been based on the belief that Americans vote as if they live in Mayberry , and fear and hate anyone who looks a bit different ; now that the country just is n’t like that , they ’ve gone mad .
" He thinks in a sort of common - sense way " ?
" He speaks the language of business and sports and politics " ?

Same as they ever were
Obama is a socialist / fascist ; Sonia Sotomayor is a racist , and La Raza is the KKK ; there ’s an evil plot against Republican car dealers .
The GOP is sounding a bit , well , demented these days .
But here ’s the thing : it always did .
A few trips down memory lane :
Senator Tom Coburn :
In a tape recently released by Brad Carson , Coburn ’s Democratic opponent for the Senate race there , Coburn is heard warning the good clean citizens of Oklahoma of the great lesbian threat to their state .
On the tape , Coburn tells how a campaign worker form Coalgate , Okla . , told him that lesbianism is “ so rampant in some of the schools in southeast Oklahoma that they ’ll only let one girl go to the bathroom . "
Senator James Inhofe :
Why did the UN cook up the idea of global warming ?
To “ shut down the machine called America . ”
In fact , we learned , global warming is a plot to destroy the US economy and to initiate one - world government–a goal not only of the UN but of the American political left more broadly .
Establishing his Christian credentials , Inhofe invoked Romans 1:25 ( For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie , and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator , who is blessed forever ) to suggest that taking steps to ameliorate global warming would constitute a form of idol worship .
We ’re not talking fringe activists here ; we ’re talking U.S. senators .
The truth is that lunatics have been running this particular asylum for years .
But in a classic case of emperor ’s new clothes , it was n’t acceptable to notice this until the lunatics lost power .
For the record :
#
I have been left mostly speechless ( as some of you may have noticed ) by the , um , " intellectual " climate of what now passes for political discourse in this great country of ours .
As usual , I have my ups and downs with the people on Our Side , but what 's struck me dumb is the total abandonment of even the slimmest pretense of sense or sanity by the Other Side .
I loved Howie 's piece yesterday ( " Cornyn Denounces Limbaugh and Liddy Denounces . . . Women , " with a really terrific batch of comments ) about what appears to be a pullback among Official Republicans , notably Texas Sen.
John Cornyn ( chairman of the GOP's Senate campaign committee ) , hardly a voice of moderation himself ( as I understand it , he has been a principal architect of the GOP 's " All No All the Time " strategy , and is more than anyone else responsible for keeping Al Franken from taking the Senate seat to which he was elected -- for the simple reason that , as he realized , heprevent it ) , from the cliff over which , they finally understand , the - official Party , that passel of raving lunatics ringled by the Daddy of the Dittoheads , is leading them .
In part , I loved the piece because Howie is a lot more confident than I am about where the country is in all of this .
Not only do I share commenter Balakirev 's concern about the irreducible 24 percent " base " that appears to be willing to follow Rush and Glenn and the crazies over the cliff , I think the 24 percent figure seriously understates the portion of the public that 's susceptible to the reign of craziness .
Even if they 're no immediate threat to regain power , I worry that 30 or even 40 percent of the country in the thrall of ignorance and insanity makes for a powderkeg that could blow up what 's left of our democracy .
One of the things I 've been trying to dope out is what part sheer stupidity plays , and what part evident insanity .
One should never underestimate the stupidity factor .
Both Howie and I have written frequently about the stupidification of America , which he believes is the result of a careful right - wing master plan to turn the American educational system into poop for the conscious purpose of turning masses of Americans into retards who will cheer madly at the wackiest inanities passed off as policy prescriptions .
Me , I 'm not so sure about the careful planning .
I think if you elevate stupidity to a virtue , and make heroes of enough dimwits whose nitwittitude is theirvirtue , you 'll wind up at the same point , especially if you have enough " opinion leaders " -- in particular the kind who claim to get their guidance straight from God -- who have as their educational goal making their offspring as smart as they are .
Throw in ruthless manipulators like Lee Atwater and Karl Rove , and the rest is history -- history , from Reagan through Little George .
I 've been trying for months to write something on this subject , and failing .
So I was greatly cheered by a pair of delicious posts this week on Paul Krugman 's NYT blog , " Conscience of a Liberal . "
The one I really loved was this one from Wednesday : Paul is , of course , being kind to our Peggy .
There is n't a word in her paean to her beloved George W. , unless you count the declaration that her boy " is n't an intellectual , " that does n't mark her as the dumbest life form in the history of creation .
( The " is n't an intellectual " comment merely marks her as someone implacably hostile to the thought process . )
This is a man who , ever .
He seems to have discovered at Yale , surrounded by all those smart kids , that thinking was n't his forte , and that trying was only going to get him into trouble .
Out of sheer laziness , mixed with the arrogance of a subhuman blob who believed himself as entitled as he is ignorant , he willed himself into an ignoramus , and that ought to be literally unforgivable -- not praised by pseudo - populists like drooling Peggy .
Uh , yeah , I suppose , but he knows only the tiniest , most superficial bit about sports , and nothing whatsoever about business or politics , unless you count " how to fake it . " Maybe I 'm just slow to adapt , but I do n't believe that Noonanism has been banished from American discourse .
Yeah , I saw Karl Rove , the master of this form of political manipulation in our time , pulling back from his earlier ritual smears of Judge Sotomayor .
But I do n't believe for a moment that he 's lost faith in those tactics , or that they wo n't work just fine another time : " [ ] is the triumph of the seemingly average American man .
He ’s normal .
" As I suggested above , I 'm less than persuaded by John Cornyn 's sudden conversion to reason in the matter of the Sotomayor nomination .
Can the arch - loon in Cornyn really be put to rest so easily ?
Captain Courage he 's not .
I guffawed at the contribution of another commenter on Howie 's post yesterday , Comrade E.B. Misfit : " Coryn 's apology to el Rushbo in 3 ....2....1... " Um , yeah , Comrade , I hear you .
I mentioned that Paul Krugman had written a second blogpost on this subject , and I would be remiss not to direct your attention to it as well :
Thanks for that little stroll down Craziness Lane , Paul .
I still can't help considering that if only , say , 40 percent of the insane blithering being blithered about Judge Sotomayor , by people who ought to know better ( and , yes , some who probably do n't ) , is being absorbed by the public , that still represents a staggering quantity of psychotic lies and filth .
The world is anxiously awaiting word from Senator Doctortom Coburn ( who like his unlamented colleague , former Senate Majority Leader Doctorbill Frist , is a physician , but more importantly is a beyond - certifiable kook , proud to be known as " Doctor No " for his tireless one - man crusade of obstructionism in the Senate ) as to whether he will run for reelection .
If he does n't , can we expect that the Oklahoma Republican cult has someone of comparable , er , stature to slot in ?
We know that Oklahoma Democrats have nothing better to throw at the seat than unspeakable DINO Rep. Dan Boren . ]

Why they are like oil and water .
As everyone knows , there has been a recent spate of books attacking Christian belief and religion in general .
Some of these books are little more than screeds , long on vituperation but short on reasoning , long on name - calling but short on competence , long on righteous indignation but short on good sense ; for the most part they are driven by hatred rather than logic .
Of course there are others that are intellectually more respectable — for example Walter Sinnott - Armstrong 's contribution to God ?
A Debate Between a Christian and an Atheist [ 1 ] and Michael Tooley 's contribution to Knowledge of God . [ 2 ]
Nearly all of these books have been written by philosophical naturalists .
I believe it 's extremely important to see that naturalism itself , despite the smug and arrogant tone of the so - called New Atheists , is in very serious philosophical hot water : one can't sensibly believe it .
Naturalism is the idea that there is no such person as God or anything like God ; we might think of it as high - octane atheism or perhaps atheism - plus .
It is possible to be an atheist without rising to the lofty heights ( or descending to the murky depths ) of naturalism .
Aristotle , the ancient Stoics , and Hegel ( in at least certain stages ) could properly claim to be atheists , but they could n't properly claim to be naturalists : each endorses something ( Aristotle 's Prime Mover , the Stoics ' Nous , Hegel 's Absolute ) no self - respecting naturalist could tolerate .
These days naturalism is extremely fashionable in the academy ; some say it is contemporary academic orthodoxy .
Given the vogue for various forms of postmodern anti-realism and relativism , that may be a bit strong .
Still , naturalism is certainly widespread , and it is set forth in such recent popular books as Richard Dawkins '
The Blind Watchmaker , Daniel Dennett 's Darwin's Dangerous Idea , and many others .
Naturalists like to wrap themselves in the mantle of science , as if science in some way supports , endorses , underwrites , implies , or anyway is unusually ...
IT 系の企業とひとくちに言っても、オラクルやサイボウズのようなパッケージソフトベンダー、NTTデータや野村総合研究所のようなSIer、ヤフーやデジタルガレージのようなネット系など、さまざまな業種があります。業種ごと仕事が違うように、平均年収に違いはあるのでしょうか？
実は先日、講師として呼ばれたとあるキャリアセミナーで、こうしたITの業種別に平均年齢や平均年収を示した資料を目にして、とても興味を引かれました。やはり他人の収入は気になるものですよね。
その資料は残念ながら参加者が多くて枚数が足りず、自分の分を持って帰れませんでした。でも、上場企業の平均年齢や平均給与は、例えばYahoo!ファイナンスなどで検索すれば見ることのできる公開された情報です。そこで、自分で情報をまとめてみることにしました。
以下の情報はすべ てYahoo !
ファイナンスで情報・通信とサービスの分野から情報を抜粋して、僕の独断で細かい業種別に分類、まとめたものです。
SIer、システム開発、コンサルティング
まずはシステムインテグレーション、システム開発、コンサルティング系の企業をざっくりとまとめてみました。従業員数は連結ではなく単独の数字を採用しています、年収の単位は千円です。
会社名 従業員数 平均年齢 平均年収 ( 株 ) キューブシステム【2335】 376 30.2 4,740 ソーバル(株) 【2186 】 941 30.2 4,750 ( 株) 東計電算【4746 】 690 33.5 5,200 データリンクス(株) 【2145 】 324 34.6 5,370 ( 株 ) コア【2359 】 1,123 34.9 5,370 ( 株)日本システムディベロップメント【9759 】

3,309 39.8 7,500 伊藤忠テクノソリューションズ(株) 【4739 】 3,943 35.8 7,560 ウルシステムズ(株) 【3798 】 134 34.8 7,760 ( 株) 大塚商会 【4768 】 6,736 36.2 7,820 ( 株) ＮＴＴデータ【9613 】 9,354 35.8 8,060 新日鉄ソリューションズ(株)
【2327 】 2,412 37 8,110 日本ユニシス(株) 【8056 】 4,490 41.4 8,400 ( 株) 野村総合研究所【4307 】 5,030 37 11,730 平均 2204 36 6807
この業種の特徴は、企業の従業員数が比較的多いことでしょう。平均従業員数は2204人。平均年齢は36才、平均年収は680万円というところ。年収は野村総合研究所だけが飛び抜けて1000万円を超えていますが、それは例外としても500万円弱から800万円強まで、それなりにばらつきがあるようですね。
SIer、システム開発はIT系企業のなかでもボリュームゾーンになるので、これを基準としてほかの業種を見ていきましょう。
ネット系 、Web 2.0系企業
ヤフーやエキサイト、グリーにドリコムといった、ネット系、Web 2.0系企業はどうでしょうか？

従業員数の平均は519人ですが、ヤフーと楽天だけが3500人と2000人という飛び抜けた数字で全体を押し上げています。この2社を抜いて平均を求めてみると234人と約半分にまで減り、ベンチャーらしい規模の人数になります。平均年齢は32才で明らかに若さがあふれる企業ばかりといえますね。まあ、デジタルガレージだけは平均年齢が40才台ですが。
そして気になる平均年収は580万円（データのない楽天を抜いて計算しています）。若い人が多いせいもあるとは思いますが、SIer、開発系と比べて100万円ほど安めに抑えられていますね。ここでも年収900万円とデジタルガレージだけ飛び抜けています。これを抜いて計算すると実は550万円台となります。華やかでお金持ちのイメージが強いネット系企業ですが、お金持ちなのは一部の偉い人たちだけで、社員の皆さんがたっぷり給料をもらっているかというとそうでもないようです。
SEO
SEO を主な業務とする企業3社についても比べてみましょう。

3社とも平均年齢が20才代というのは前述のネット系企業以上の若さで、SEOという業態そのものの若さをも示しているようですね。また、平均年収もアウンコンサルティングは370万円、ほかの2社も430万円と450万円ですから、SIerやネット系企業よりも安く抑えられていることが分かります。
パッケージソフトベン ダ
続いてはパッケージソフトベンダを見ていきましょう。ジャストシステムやトレンドマイクロ、ソースネクストといったコンシューマビジネスでよく知られている会社から、オラクルやソフトブレーン、NTTデータイントラマートなど企業向けの企業まで、パッケージという観点でひとくくりにしています。

目に付くのは、日本オラクルの平均年収が930万円を超えている、というところでしょうか。それ以外は、平均年収が500万円から690万円のレンジで、SIer、開発系とくらべてもそれほど大きな違いはなさそうです。平均年齢は34才、平均年収は620万円弱ですから、平均年収でみると意外にもSIer系よりも低いのですね。
ISP 、データセンタ
ニフティ、ペーパーボーイ＆コー、さくらインターネットなどのデータセンター業務などを行っている企業も見てみましょう。

人数で見ると、インターネットイニシアティブが最も多くて700人、ニフティが630人ですが、あとは100人から300人前後の規模の企業で、平均年収は570万円。業務上つながりの深いネット系企業と平均年収が同程度なのは偶然の一致なのでしょうか。
携帯関連
続いては携帯関連ビジネスです。開発系とコンテンツ系をまとめてしまっていますが、インデックス、アクセスなどが有名どころ。

人数でいうとアクセスの553人が飛び抜けていますね。こことインデックス以外は100人以下のこじんまりとした所帯。平均年収は570万円。IT系はこのあたりに平均年収が揃いがちのようです。
ゲーム
いまや世界に誇る日本のカルチャー、ゲーム業界をささえる企業群です。ちなみに任天堂は株式市場で「その他製品」という分類になっているため、「情報通信、サービス」を対象にした今回の集計には入っていません。しかし公開されている情報を見ると任天堂の平均年収は980万円。すごいですね。

In their analysis , the Colorado researchers said the preliminary evidence was circumstantial ; the bones confirmed that the body was male , Caucasian , 19 to 22 years old , and about 5 feet 8 inches tall  all a match for Mr. Ruess .
The jaw and eye sockets were largely intact , and so a facial reconstruction came next .
It closely matched photographs of Mr. Ruess taken by Ms. Lange , a photographer probably best known for her images of migrant workers during the Depression .
Finally , DNA extracted from the bones showed a 25 percent match with nephews and nieces of Mr. Ruess , the exact amount that would be expected in that family relationship .
The conclusion , said Kenneth Krauter , a professor of molecular , cellular and developmental biology at Colorado , was “ irrefutable . ”
How the remains were found at all is an astonishing tale in its own right .
That story begins in the early 1970s , when Aneth Nez broke a 37 - year silence to tell his family about being witness to a dark incident in the 1930s .
He told them that while sitting on a ridge , he watched three Ute boys chase down and kill a young white man .
After the killers took the victim ’s two mules , Mr. Nez , out of respect , buried the body , he told his granddaughter , Daisy Johnson , but was too afraid to talk about it .

Last year , Ms. Johnson told the story to her younger brother , Denny Bellson , and together , on May 25 , they went to the general area their grandfather had talked about .
Mr. Bellson , speaking in the conference call , said he saw a saddle first probably his grandfather ’s , which , in the Navajo tradition , he would have disposed of because it had been contaminated by coming in contact with the blood of the dead .
Then , Mr. Bellson said , he saw the bones , jammed down into a rock crevice .
“ The skull was in pieces , ” he said .
But he said he also saw that it was indented , as though caved in , which fit with his grandfather ’s tale .
One of Mr. Ruess ’s nephews , Brian Ruess , said in a telephone interview that he had grown up with open - ended versions of his uncle ’s story , with each family member drawn to speculate .
Some wanted to think their uncle had fallen in love with a Navajo girl and intentionally disappeared into the desert .
Brian Ruess said he had always imagined his uncle being swept away while crossing the Colorado River .
For more than a hundred years , the Democratic symbol has been the donkey .
Depending on your outlook , it reflects either a humble reliability , or a certain braying stubbornness .
But in a sharp recent change , the symbol of the Republican Party is now the microphone .
Its symbolism is more obvious .
High - profile conservative leadership -- or at least the most visible opposition to President Barack Obama -- is n't coming from Republican politicians , who are pioneering new ways to look befuddled .
Republican governors hoping for a look in 2012 tried looking for ways to refuse part of the federal stimulus money -- while Republican members of their own state legislatures tried to assure the world that the governors did n't mean it , and the states would take anything they could get .
Other GOP governors declared their eagerness to take whatever cash Louisiana , Alaska and South Carolina did n't want .
Republican congressional leaders have been having some trouble breaking through , although they 've been congratulating themselves on their unanimity in saying no .
Getting out their own message has been a little harder , but House Minority Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia has a bold new idea : a Web site .
" The message has not yet been delivered , " Cantor told Politico.com , " but we 'll continue to work at that . "
Losing ground , conservatism has taken to the air .
The vacuum is being filled by the vacuum tube .
Rush Limbaugh has not only exacted obedience from party leaders -- Republicans who say anything disrespectful about him , including party chairman Michael Steele , have to apologize -- but he claims a constantly wider role .
Depicting himself as the Republican " last man standing , " he 's challenged the president to a debate , declaring , " If you can wipe me out in a debate .$ ?.$?. do you realize you will own the United States of America ?
You will have no opposition . "
At least not from elected Republicans .
Meanwhile , as Republican identification numbers fall , Fox News ratings are jumping .
Bill O'Reilly , Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck are seeing their numbers boom , while GOP congressional leaders might be found in the Witness Protection Program .
Trying to stir up the troops on a charge that the president bowed while shaking hands with the Saudi king -- and you can see how the GOP leaders have their finger on what 's worrying Americans -- the folks from the National Republican Senatorial Committee knew exactly how to get credibility with their mailing list .
" Please take a moment , " urged the NRSC 's fund - raising letter , " to view the video from Sean Hannity 's show on Fox News last night and decide for yourself if the White House 's explanation should be believed . "
Republican political leaders looking for a place to build their futures know exactly where to go .
Karl Rove went directly from the Bush White House to consulting and commenting with Fox , and except for being less able to order someone waterboarded , his party prominence is unchanged .
While Mitt Romney is beginning to haunt the living rooms of Iowa and New Hampshire , Mike Huckabee has gotten his own Fox talk show , which could be a more direct route to the 2012 nomination .
Today conservatives are planning to hold Tea Bag parties around the country , protesting Obama proposals to raise taxes on the highest incomes .
Actual Republican politicians are far off on the edge of the tea tray , but Fox News , in the words of The Washington Post 's Howie Kurtz , " practically seems to be a co-sponsor . "
Beck , Hannity , Neil Cavuto and Greta van Susteren have been promoting the event on their shows , and each plans to appear at a Tea Bag party somewhere in the country .
GOP politicians ' roles are low profile , but as Hannity excitedly promised his audience , " Do n't forget , we 're going to have Joe the Plumber . "
The old Republican elephant was getting to be a kind of bulky symbol for the party , carrying all kinds of awkward environmental implications .
Besides , an elephant covers a lot of territory , and may not really fit the party 's increasingly narrow base .
The new symbol at least offers what Republicans desperately need : a voice .
They 'll find out soon whether a microphone is the same as a message .

Wednesday , May 27 , 2009 WASHINGTON —
The Obama administration has blocked Israel 's request for advanced U.S. - origin attack helicopters .
" During the recent war , Israel made considerable use of the Longbow , and there were high civilian casualties in the Gaza Strip , " a source close to the administration said .
The sources said Israel has sought to purchase up to six new AH - 64Ds in an effort to bolster conventional and counter - insurgency capabilities .
They said Israel wants to replenish its fleet after the loss of two Apache helicopters in the 2006 war with Hizbullah .
Also In This Edition The Israel Air Force has also requested U.S. permission to integrate the Spike extended - range anti-tank missile into the AH - 64D , Middle East Newsline reported .
Spike ER , developed by the state - owned Rafael Advanced Defense Systems , has a range of eight kilometers and was installed on the Eurocopter Tiger and AgustaWestland A129 helicopters .
The sources said the deployment of Spike would require integration into the Longbow 's millimeter - wave fire control and acquisition system .
They said this would require permission from both Boeing and the U.S. government .
Israel 's Defense Ministry and air force have discussed procurement of additional Longbows with the U.S. firm Boeing .
But the sources said the Longbow as well as other defense requests have been shelved by the administration amid its review of the potential use of American weapons platforms by Israel .
During his visit to the United States , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also sought to win approval from the Defense Department for the installation of Israeli - origin electronic warfare systems in the Joint Strike Fighter .
Netanyahu was said to have met Defense Secretary Robert Gates in a review of Israeli defense programs with the United States .
Defense Minister Ehud Barak was scheduled to meet Gates in Washington in early June .
COMMENT LETTER TO THE EDITOR
Comments I sincerely hope that Obama does not shut out our greatest information source in the middle east .
To not support Israel is to slap the Jewish state in the face in the time when the threat is the greatest .

Cold hearted orb that rules the night ,
Removes the colours from our sight .
Red is grey and yellow white ,
But we decide which is right .
And which is an illusion ?
Thus begins the second official Moody Blues album , Days of Future Passed , which was released in 1967 on the Deram subsidiary of London Records .
The first Moody Blues album , The Magnificent Moodies , was produced by Denny Cordell , and released in 1965 .
It presented them as an r&b band , led by Denny Laine .
It was this band that created what is perhaps my favorite single of all time , the unforgettable “ Go Now , ” and from which Laine soon departed .
The Moody Blues , now led by Justin Hayward and John Lodge , returned with Days of Future Passed , and it could n’t have been more different from the first album .
Here we have what was the first of a series of concept albums from the band , who had now abandoned their r&b stylings for a lush , symphonic pop sound that foreshadowed the arrival of progressive rock .
The music on the album is credited to Redwave - Knight .
The Knight in question was Peter Knight , the conductor of the London Festival Orchestra , the band ’s collaborators on this project .
Knight wrote orchestrations based on ideas from various band members , who went under the collective name of Redwave .
The poems that open and close the album , though uncredited on the album itself , were written by Moodies drummer Graeme Edge .
Days of Future Passed , which is a song cycle about a single day in the life of a man , spawned two huge hit singles , which remain mainstays on radio , and in hearts of people everywhere .
“ Tuesday Afternoon ” is an edited version of “ The Afternoon : Forever Afternoon ( Tuesday ? ) , ” which opens side two .
The day ends , as does the album , with “ The Night : Nights in White Satin , ” perhaps the Moodies most indelible point of reference .
My colleague here at Popdose , Scott Malchus , recent wrote a lovely essay which was inspired by “ Nights in White Satin . ”
For better or worse , this is the album that really put the Moody Blues on the map .
For me , although I admire a number of songs from subsequent albums , this is their only album that hangs together for me , and it does so beautifully .
Breathe deep the gathering gloom ,
Watch lights fade from every room .
Bedsitter people look back and lament ,
Another day ’s useless energy spent .

When I was a kid , Starlog was my connection to the world of geek media .
The internet as we know it was still many years away , so there were no pirated videos being sent all over the world , and no leaked rumors flying all over the world in ten minutes .
Yes , we had to get our geek news the old - fashioned way : monthly magazines .
Now comes the news that Starlog is ending its magazine publication , becoming online - only .
I feel somewhat responsible , since I have n't bought a copy of it since I was in high school , and that was longer ago than I care to remember .
I 've picked up copies in bookstores now and then and leafed through them , remembering how I used to devour them the moment they arrived in the mailbox .
But then I 've put the copies back on the rack , because I 'd already seen pretty much everything they had to show me .
It 's the way of all things , I realize : adapt or perish .
I should n't feel bad about a company having problems — I do n't know any of the people involved , and would n't even recognize their names .
Yet I feel almost the way I did when , say , DeForest Kelley and James Doohan passed away : I did n't know them personally , but they were a part of my youth , and they 're gone .
Obviously it 's sadder when a person dies than when a magazine stops being published , but it 's jarring just the same .
So I 'll be spending some of my free time today remembering the large stack of back issues that sat on the shelf next to my bed until my mom made me clean it up , and the way the articles and photos about upcoming movies would captivate me .
Goodbye , Starlog .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Britain ’s defense minister made an unusual public apology on Thursday , admitting Britain had taken part in the “ rendition ” of suspects detained in Iraq after denying it for years .
Britain's Defence Minister John Hutton is seen listening to speeches during the Labour Party Conference in Manchester , northern England , in this September 22 , 2008 file photo .
Hutton made an unusual public apology on Thursday , admitting that Britain had taken part in the " rendition " of suspects held in Iraq when it had previously always denied doing so .
REUTERS / Phil Noble / Files
In a lengthy statement to parliament , Defense Secretary John Hutton confirmed that Britain handed over two suspects captured in Iraq in 2004 to U.S. custody and that they were subsequently transferred to Afghanistan , breaching U.S. - British agreements .
The Ministry of Defense has been repeatedly asked over the past five years about its involvement in rendition , the unlawful transfer of suspects to a third country , and consistently denied it played any role in the U.S. - administered program .
“ I regret that it is now clear that inaccurate information on this particular issue has been given to the House by my department on a small number of occasions , ” Hutton said .
“ I want to apologize to the House for these errors . ”
Two men seized by British troops in Iraq in February 2004 were transferred to U.S. detention and later flown to Afghanistan , where they remain in U.S. custody .
Both are said to be members of Laskhar - e - Taiba , a Pakistan - based group with links to al Qaeda .
Human rights groups said Hutton ’s admission amounted to a “ major U - turn ” that called into question the government ’s previous denials and whether its position now was believable .
“ For years now the British government has been tossing us miserable scraps of information about its involvement in illegal renditions in Pakistan , Diego Garcia and now Afghanistan , ” said Clara Gutteridge , an investigator with Reprieve , a charity that campaigns for the release of detainees at Guantanamo Bay .
“ Enough is enough .
The British government must come clean and reveal exactly who it has captured , what has been done to them and where they are now , ” she said .
“ I ’m afraid this is only the tip of the renditions iceberg . ”
PUBLIC INQUIRY
Hutton said the United States had provided assurances that the suspects , who are categorized as “ unlawful enemy combatants , ” were being properly treated in Afghanistan .
Asked about the legal implications of Hutton ’s apology , a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense said there was nothing illegal about Britain ’s involvement in the rendition process .
The Americans , he said , had breached a long - standing agreement that those captured by British forces in Iraq would not be transferred out of Iraq without prior consultation .
“ We are all equally culpable in this , ” he said .
However , human rights lawyers and members of parliament suggested the Ministry of Defense was trying to play down the extent of the problem , and said there were no guarantees that Britain had not been complicit in illegal renditions .
Extraordinary rendition , which involves transferring suspects to a third country where there is no prohibition on the use of torture during interrogation , goes a step further than rendition and is considered illegal by Britain .
Andrew Tyrie , an MP looking into extraordinary rendition , said it was time the government held a full inquiry .
“ U.S. assurances that it does not use torture are unreliable , ” he said .
“ Given that all previous assurances have been baseless , we can have no confidence in the ones we are being given now . ”
If you think that all the wheezing , coughing and watery - eyed symptoms that you are experiencing is entirely due to your being Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœgenetically prone to allergiesÃ¢â‚¬â „¢ , think again .
The culprit might be the city where you are living .
So what is it about a particular place which makes it more allergy - prone than others ?
Basically , it is factors like high pollen content , mold counts and the level of pollution which triggers the allergy attack in an individual .
The ABCÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s of Allergies : What You Need to Know about Allergy Attacks ?
Before letting you know about the top allergy - prone cities in the United States , let us first take at the basic facts about allergies .
First , why do you get them ?
Ã‚ Experts believe that allergies tend to be inherited from oneÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s parents .
As your body gets exposed to allergens , its defense gets weakened which in turn triggers an allergic reaction .
These allergens can intrude on your body through your nose , mouth and lungs .
Second , what exactly are the elements which are considered to be allergens ?
This includes :
Airborne grass , tree , weed , pollen
Dust mites
Mold spores
Pollen
Pet dander
Remember that even if you are born with allergic tendencies , you are not automatically prone to having an allergic reaction .
As in the case of pet dander , it may take several years for you to be sensitive to a specific allergen .
Aside from inheriting allergic - prone genes from your parents , your allergic reaction will also get triggered if you are usually around pesky allergens , and when your body comes in contact with allergens your immune system tells you to stay away from .
Finally , what are the symptoms of an allergic reaction ?
Sneezing , having a stuffed nose , coughing , itchy throat , watery eyes , and having dark circles under the eyes from sinus pressure are just some of the symptoms that you should watch out for .
A Look at the Top 10 Allergy - Prone Cities in the United States
As mentioned earlier , your allergic reactions will definitely get triggered if you live in a place where allergens are usually around .
So which places in the United States are considered to be the most allergy - prone cities ?
Take a look at the following list :
1.Ã‚ City : Lexington , Kentucky
Worst Season : Ã‚ Spring
Top Allergens : Pollens
According to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America or AAFA , Lexington has a worse than average pollen score at 100 .
It means that thereÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a daily average of 300 grains per cubic meter of pollen which pollutes the air on a daily basis if you live in this city .
[ Pollen allergy ]
Kentucky also has a worse than average medicine utilization factor , as well as board certified allergists per patient .
From a rank of 52 in 2007 , the ranking of Lexington as the allergy capital of the nation is ranked by the AAFA has jumped to number one in 2008 .
2.Ã‚ City : Little Rock , Arkansas
Worst Season : Fall
Top Allergens : Weeds , pollen , mold spores
Last year , the AAFA ranked Little Rock , Arkansas to be the 9th most allergy - prone city in the country .
Ã‚
What makes the city of Little Rock especially prone to triggering allergies in people is the weeds pollen .
However , the main culprit seems to be its mold level , which is higher than average as compared to other cities .
Molds actually grow on rotting logs , grasses and compost piles Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ but the worse thing is that they spread when their spores become airborne .
[ Mold allergy symptoms ]
3.Ã‚ City : Greensboro , North Carolina
Worst Season : Fall
Top Allergens : Grass , tree and weed pollens
According to the AAFA , the city of Greensboro in North Carolina is the most miserable city for fall allergies .
As the name of the city implies , there are a lot of Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœgreensÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ that you need to deal with if you live in Greensboro , North Carolina and all that lush color will trigger allergy attacks .
Watch out for ragweed , weed , and grass pollens during the fall .
This is especially an allergic - reaction trigger because the city has more than 170 parks which produce enough ragweed Ã¢â‚¬â€œ enough to make the typical allergy - sufferer miserable .
4.Ã‚ City : Greenville , South Carolina
Worst Season : Fall
Top Allergens : Grass , tree and weed pollens
Much like Greensboro , Greensville in South Carolina is not as good a city to live in for those who are prone to allergy attacks .
Fall is the worst season of all because the city is a lush landscape of greenery at this time of the year .
The things which make the city a haven for nature lovers may just be the bane of allergy - sufferers , especially those who are dealing with asthma attacks as a kid .
5.Ã‚ City : Raleigh - Durham , North Carolina
Worst Season : Spring
Top Allergens : Weeds or weed pollens
Based from the AAFA data , the city of Raleigh - Durham has an average pollen count Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ which makes it easy to conclude that there is one other culprit which serves as the cityÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s worst allergen : weeds .
Raleigh - Durham has plenty of weak leaf , yellow nut sedge and yellow Indian grass which grow abundantly Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ so when spring season comes , you need to take into account this fact if you would not like to suffer from allergy attacks .
6.Ã‚ City : Jackson , Mississippi
Worst Season : Fall
Top Allergens : Grass , weed
If you have allergic reactions to grass , weed and pollen , remember that they usually circulate at around 10 in the morning to 12 noon .
Ã‚ Experts recommend staying indoors during these hours to minimize your allergic reaction Ã¢â‚¬â€œ no matter where you live .
However , if you are from Jackson , Mississippi Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ this is actually not a haven for allergy - sufferers , especially those who have a bad reaction to Bermuda Grass and ragweed .
The city is rich in these two allergens .
So if you are suffering from allergic reactions , the best way to counteract this is by staying away from the outdoors during the time of the day when such allergens are airborne .
7.Ã‚ City : Grand Rapids , Michigan
Worst Season : Fall
Top Allergens :
Weed or weed pollens
Yet another city which is not really a good place to be during the fall season is Grand Rapids in Michigan .
Ragweed , plantains and nettle are the worst allergens Ã¢â‚¬â€œ especially during the autumn season .
If you would like to fight off a possible allergic reaction and you really need to be outdoors , make sure to take a quick shower and change your clothes after enjoying a day outdoors .
8.Ã‚ City : Knoxville , Tennessee
Worst Season : Spring
Top Allergens : Mold spores , weeds and grass pollens
Knoxville , Tennessee was ranked as the 6th worst city to be for those who are prone to allergies Ã¢â‚¬â€œ especially during the spring season [ Spring allergies ] .
Despite having an average pollen count , they do have a worse than average medicine utilization for allergens .
What makes Knoxville a particularly bad city to live in for those who are suffering from allergic reactions is the presence of garden sorrel and a grass called redtop .
9.Ã‚ City : Wichita , Kansas
Worst Season : Fall
Top Allergens : Mold spores , weed or weed pollens
You may want to say that you Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢re not in Kansas anymore if you live in the city of Wichita and you have allergic reactions .
Ragweed and chenopods are the culprit elements and during the fall , weeds and molds provide plenty of airborne allergens for an allergic - prone Kansas resident to be particularly unhappy .
10.Ã ‚ City : Madison , Wisconsin
Worst Season : Fall
Top Allergens : Weeds or weed pollens
There are plenty of allergens to travel around when you live in Madison , Wisconsin .
Ã‚ Amaranth , pigweed , tumbleweed and the occasional mold are the items which trigger allergic reactions to individuals .
If you live in these allergy - prone cities and you do nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t see yourself moving in the near future , then you should always consult your doctor about how you can stay away from allergens when walking outdoors so that you can enjoy either the fall or the spring season without having to cough , sneeze or wheeze your way through it .

" Terrorism does n't just blow up buildings ; it blasts every other issue off the political map .
The spectre of terrorism - real and exaggerated - has become a shield of impunity , protecting governments around the world from scrutiny for their human rights abuses "
- Naomi Klein
" If you listen to the politicians , you might think we are all terrorists "
- Loesje ( International - originally Dutch - free speech organization )
" Our position is clear and frank ...
We consider the military occupation of our land a terrorist act "
- Yasser Arafat
So , with the war in Sri Lanka now over and the Tamils having been crushed and brought to their knees , I 'd like to ask just one question :
Are we happy now ?
With the Tamils ' decades - long struggle for self - determination quashed and their dreams of an independent homeland shattered , are we fully satisfied ?
Should we give ourselves a pat on the back ?
Because there 's no denying that this result is largely due to us here in the freedom - loving West .
Specifically , I 'm referring to how the governments of Canada , America , Australia and the European Union all decided to take sides in this civil war - this brutal ethnic civil war .
Not only did we impose an embargo on one side - the Tamil minority - while fully supporting the other - the Sinhalese majority - but we even went as far as to label the Tamils as " terrorists " , while actively working to shut down all of their overseas funding and their ability to arm themselves .
Both sides may have clearly been guilty of committing some pretty heinous atrocities , but for some reason we decided that the best thing to do was to condemn the one side , while cheering on and supporting the other .
Worst of all , we sided with the wrong side .
The LTTE
I 'm not about to try and argue that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) , or Tamil Tigers , were / are a cuddly democratic bunch ( few liberation movements are ) , nor am I about to defend their use of suicide bombings against civilian targets or their forced recruitment of child soldiers .
However , I will most definitely argue that the Tamils have every right to a homeland of their own on the island of Sri Lanka .
Casualties of 9/11
The truth is that by the beginning of this decade the Tamils had , in fact , already won a homeland for themselves in the north and east of the island .
The two sides had fought to a stalemate , signed a ceasefire and entered into peace talks .
But one very significant event on the other side of the world changed all of this - an event that had absolutely nothing to do with Sri Lanka .
I 'm talking about 9/11 .
In the wake of the attacks on New York and Washington and in the rush to launch an all - out " Global War On Terror " , Western countries , under intense pressure from America , took specific aim at the Tamil Tigers .
How they figured their so - called War On Terror had anything to do with a civil war on a small island in the Indian Ocean is beyond me , but the consequences were devastating to the Tamil 's cause .
With one side in this conflict now fully armed and the other embargoed and isolated - with all of their overseas fundraising shut down - the eventual result was inevitable .
Now , 9/11 or no 9/11 , picking the Sri Lankan government as " the good guys " and labeling the Tamils alone as " terrorists " was not only ridiculous when you consider the historical causes of the war ( that is , that the Tamils rose up after years of oppression , persecution and some outright massacres ) , but it was also quite ridiculous when you consider the war crimes carried out by the Sri Lankan military during the course of the war : the mass slaughter of civilians , particularly in the early stages of the conflict ; the death squads ; the killing of aid workers ; etc .
All of this is well documented , yet somehow we in the West decided to label the Tamils alone as terrorists .
Truly incomprehensible nonsense .
Then there 's the fact that the Tamils - living largely in a concentrated area of the island and making up between 15 to 20 % of the total population - obviously have as much of a right to self - determination as the people of France , Germany , Portugal , Holland , Hungary , Poland , Ireland or Greece .
Or the people of Kosovo , East Timor , Tibet , Palestine , Chechnya or Kurdistan , for that matter .
An Inalienable Right ... For Some
Which raises an obvious question :
Why do we here in the West pick and choose who has an inalienable right to self - determination ( the people of Kosovo , East Timor , Ukraine , Lithuania , Slovenia , Croatia , etc. ) and who does n't ( the Chechens , the Kurds , the Tamils of Sri Lanka , etc. ) ?
And where do we get off labeling those who we 've deemed undeserving of their own homeland as " terrorists " ?
As I argued in an earlier piece , The Blame The Victims Rant ( Up with the strong , down with the weak ) , the armies of the nations we in the West have decided to support are often guilty of committing much worse atrocities than the rebel groups we 've arbitrarily decided to label as " terrorists " .
It is government forces that carpet bomb rebel held areas .
It is government forces that often wage scorched - earth policies , killing thousands - or tens of thousands - of innocents .
But we 're , for some strange reason , totally fixated upon any and all rebel bombings .
Now , if these rebel attacks are aimed at innocent civilians then there 's no denying that we 're talking about war crimes , but my point is that the government forces are usually far more guilty of these crimes .
What 's up with the hypocrisy ?
That 's what I really want to know .
Some will say : " But the government forces never intentionally kill innocent civilians " .
To which I say :
What a load of naive , simple - minded bullshit .
From Dresden to Hiroshima , and from Vietnam to Chechnya , military forces know damn well who they 're targeting when they carpet bomb , or nuke , civilian areas from above .
Or , as we 've watched in recent months in Sri Lanka , government forces know exactly what they 're doing when they rain down rockets and mortars on civilian areas , causing horrific civilian casualties .
The UN now believes that nearly 7,000 civilians may have been killed , and another 13,000 injured , in just the past 4 to 5 months of the Sri Lankan army 's all - out push for victory .
Twisted and Absurd
If the West 's decision to pick one side in a civil war seems quite arbitrary and more than a little farcical , that 's because it is .
But this is nothing new and it's , of course , hardly limited to just us here in the West :
The Russians slaughtered at least 200,000 Chechen civilians in a few short years in a scorched - earth campaign , but , according to them , and some here in the West , it was the Chechens who were , by some bizarre form of twisted logic , the actual " terrorists " for wanting an independent homeland .
The Indonesians caused the deaths of 200,000 people over a 20 - year period in East Timor , yet , according to the Indonesians , it was the Timorese who were , in fact , the real " terrorists " .
The Soviets invaded and occupied Afghanistan back in 1979 , but when the Afghans decided to resist the Russians labeled them as , you guessed it , " terrorists " .
Further back , when the Irish fought a guerrilla war for their independence , between 1919 - 1921 , they were written - off as nothing but " murdering terrorists " by the occupying British , who themselves most certainly could have been tagged with that label .
And , let 's not forget that , in more recent times , the Americans invaded and occupied Iraq , resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqis , but , of course , it was those who fought back in defense of their country who were labeled the " evil terrorists " .
It 's really quite absurd when you stop to think about it .
And this list could go on and on and ...
A Job Well Done ?
So , again I ask , with the Tamils of Sri Lanka losing their de facto independence of the past two decades and the Sinhalese majority once more in absolute control of the whole island , are we happy ?
Are we satisfied ?
Are we proud of ourselves for helping put the Tamils back in their place ?
Just because we deserve our liberty and freedom , that does n't mean the Tamils deserve theirs , right ?
Again , the situation leading up to the civil war there may be well - documented and few ( outside of Sri Lankan ) would disagree that the Tamils had just cause in rising up , but as long as we can continue convincing ourselves that they were nothing more than sinister " terrorists " then we can go on fantasizing that justice has been done .
Right ?
And the fate of the Tamils be damned .
Island Paradise
I should mention that during our three - year backpacking trip across Asia earlier this decade , my wife , Sonoko , and I spent three incredible months in Sri Lanka and , while there , we made some really good friends .
Our time there on the island was unequivocally one of the greatest experiences of my life .
In all the years I 've spent traveling , few places have come close to Sri Lanka for sincere warmth and hospitality .
The people of that tropical paradise are simply among the friendliest in the world .
And that goes for both the Sinhalese and the Tamils we got to know .
Of course , every one of our Sinhalese friends would strongly oppose just about everything I 've said above , but that is to be expected .
As in most war zones , they have been bombarded with years of government propaganda and nationalistic claptrap and have predictably become convinced of their own righteousness and victimhood , à la America in the years following 9/11 .
Tragic
Finally , let me just state the obvious : that , with over 80,000 people losing their lives , this war has been absolutely tragic .
However , that does n't mean its conclusion is any reason for celebration .
The fact is , a people who have had their own homeland for the past two decades have just had it stolen away .
All largely due to our unnecessary and unjust involvement .
Freedom , once won , is now , once more , denied .
And this fact makes the whole brutal war even more tragic .
For anyone who believes in justice and self - determination , this is a truly sad outcome indeed .

Three rival Pakistani Taliban groups have agreed to form a united front against international forces in Afghanistan in a move likely to intensify the insurgency just as thousands of extra US soldiers begin pouring into the country as part of Barack Obama 's surge plan .
The Guardian has learned that three of the most powerful warlords in the region have settled their differences and come together under a grouping calling itself Shura Ittihad - ul - Mujahideen , or Council of United Holy Warriors .
Nato officers fear that the new extremist partnership in Waziristan , Pakistan 's tribal area , will significantly increase the cross - border influx of fighters and suicide bombers - a move that could undermine the US president 's Afghanistan strategy before it is formulated .
The unity among the militants comes after a call by Mullah Omar , the cleric who leads the Afghan Taliban , telling Pakistani militants to stop fighting at home in order to join the battle to " liberate Afghanistan from the occupation forces " .
The Pakistani Taliban movement was split between a powerful group led by the warlord Baitullah Mehsud and his bitter rivals , Maulvi Nazir and Gul Bahadur .
While Mehsud has targeted Pakistan itself in a campaign of violence and is accused of being behind the assassination of the former prime minister Benazir Bhutto , Nazir and Bahadur sent men to fight alongside other insurgents in Afghanistan .
The move potentially provides short - term relief in Pakistan but imperils Nato forces , especially those stationed in southern and eastern Afghanistan , including the British , close to the Pakistani border .
" It 's of concern to us when we see a grouping like that , " said a western security official in Pakistan .
" This ca n't be ignored . "
Fears of an increase in fighting come as the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) warned yesterday that civilians would face the brunt of any increase in violence in Afghanistan .
Ordinary Afghans were now more at risk from the fighting than at any time since the start of the war in 2001 , said Pierre Kraehenbuehl , director of operations for the ICRC .
Violence in Afghanistan intensified last year with some 5,000 people killed , including more than 2,100 civilians , a 40 % increase on the previous year , the UN reported last month .
Pakistan was already under intense western pressure to act against extremists based in its tribal area .
A western military adviser , also based in Pakistan , said a Pakistani Taliban alliance would cement the grip of the militants over Waziristan .
The region is also home to Afghan Taliban and al - Qaida , who use Waziristan and other parts of the tribal area as a haven to regroup and launch attacks against Afghan and Nato forces .
" No insurgency has ever been destroyed as long as the sanctuaries are still alive .
If the sanctuaries are gaining more strength , that certainly worries Nato , " said the military adviser .
The Obama administration in Washington has announced 17,000 extra troops for Afghanistan .
American forces will concentrate on areas close to the Pakistani border , which are seen as the most troublesome .
Obama is pressing European countries to also boost their troop numbers .
In an apparent response to the augmented US challenge , Mullah Omar has directed Pakistani militants in Waziristan to halt attacks on Pakistani forces .
Baitullah Mehsud is feared in Pakistan , having led an assault on his own country since 2007 , killing hundreds of soldiers , policemen and ordinary Pakistanis through suicide attacks and other bombings .
But his tactics , influenced by al - Qaida , were controversial even within the Taliban .
" If anybody really wants to wage jihad , he must fight the occupation forces inside Afghanistan , " Mullah Omar told Pakistani militants in a letter .
" Attacks on the Pakistani security forces and killing of fellow Muslims by the militants in the tribal areas and elsewhere in Pakistan is bringing a bad name to mujahideen and harming the war against the US and Nato forces in Afghanistan . "
The Pakistani Taliban recognise Mullah Omar , founder of the Taliban movement in Afghanistan , as their ultimate leader , although operationally they work independently .
" Baitullah Mehsud is now taking on the Americans , " said Talat Masood , a retired Pakistani general turned analyst .
Baitullah Mehsud has recently called off his fighters in two key battles inside Pakistan , with ceasefires declared in Swat valley , in the North West Frontier Province , and Bajaur , another tribal area .
While Pakistani forces claim to have " won " in Bajaur , they show no appetite for taking the war to Waziristan .
Controversially , the Pakistani government has acceded to the militants ' demand for Islamic law in Swat .
Under two secret peace deals signed by Pakistani authorities with the militants last year , covering north and south Waziristan , a truce exists there .
While western countries want to see the Pakistani army take the fight to Waziristan , Pakistani forces have been repeatedly defeated there .
Major General Athar Abbas , chief spokesman for the Pakistan army , said that there was " no plan " to start operations in Waziristan .
" It 's the government that decides these things , " he added .

We ’re all concerned about the Spirit rover , currently stuck in some soft soil on Mars .
But some people are actually working hard to figure out how to rescue the rover .
That includes a 7 - year old boy named Julian who sent this drawing in to JPL with his idea of how help Spirit : use the robotic arm as a “ tripod ” to lift the rover up and help move it out of the spot where it is embedded .
Julian , you have a bright future ahead of you as an engineer !
“ We are getting a lot of interesting suggestions from the public , ” said JPL ’s John Callas , MER project manager , “ and we think that ’s wonderful .
It shows people are interested in these rovers .
We certainly are canvassing the full range of possibilities to get Spirit unstuck . ”
And Callas said they are actually planning to use the robotic arm to help get Spirit unstuck , but not quite the way Julian had in mind .
“ We ’re doing a parallel approach , ” Callas told Universe Today , “ doing things both on Earth and on Mars .
Spirit is using her instruments to assess the terrain and the nature of the materials where she is stuck .
Just last night we made the decision to use the robotic arm to look underneath the belly of the rover to see if we can determine how the vehicle is embedded and if it may be high centered on some small rocks under the rover .
We ’ll also look at the wheels to see how the middle wheels are dug in . ”
Callas said this is a technique the robotic arm was never designed to do .
“ So , we tested it first on Opportunity and it worked quite well , so that ’s the plan for what we ’ll do with Spirit this weekend . ”
Spirit has also been busy taking remote sensing images of the surrounding terrain with all its instruments to try to characterize the soils and their properties .
Callas said “ soils ” because there actually appears to be two different types of materials where the rover is stuck , with a different type of soil on the left side of the rover from the right .
The rover team will use the data to create a soil simulant to be used in the JPL test bed , basically a large sandbox where an engineering model of the rover identical to Spirit and Opportunity can be used to simulate Spirit ’s predicament .
There , the team can experiment with how best to get the rover out .
However , the test has been held up because of problems with work station that controls the test facility , but Callas said they are hoping by later today ( Friday ) to get started with the simulations .
They ’ll start by putting the simulated Mars regolith , which is called baghouse dust , ( ground basaltic material , Callas said ) and use enough to test just one wheel of the rover .
“ If it exhibits the same characteristics we ’re seeing on Mars , then we ’ll truck in tons of that material to do the tests with the rover , ” said Callas .
If not , they ’ll have to go back to the drawing board .
Spirit has long been without the use of her right front wheel , which does n’t help the situation , and recently the left middle wheel was jammed , but now appears to be working again .
The one piece of good news is that Mars itself provided a little help by sending a gust of wind Spirit ’s way , cleaning off the solar panels , making more energy available to the rover .
Spirit now has over 80 % of its potential power , with 843 watt hours available , as opposed to earlier where the rover was operating at less than 200 watt hours .
Callas said he is optimistic about getting Spirit unstuck .
“ We saw that even on the last drive that the rover was still moving , even though it was only fractionally , based on the wheel spin .
So , that tells us material is still being transported underneath the wheels .
Given enough time and enough wheel spinning we should be able to get out .
If that changes , if we get a situation where we have a hundred per cent slip , then we ’re in trouble .
But we ’re not at that point yet , — even if we ’re at 99.9 % , that makes a big difference between 100 % . ”
And if this latest attempt does n’t work , Callas says they have some other ideas up their robotic arm sleeves .
“ There are some exotic things we would consider if the more traditional methods do n’t work , ” he said .
We have a lot of arrows in our quiver , or tools in our toolbelt to try first . ”
And they always have Julian to rely on , too .

( CNN ) -- Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom has dismissed an allegation that he was behind the death of a lawyer who left a video blaming the president if anything happened to him .
A video with Rodrigo Rosenberg appears on YouTube in which he accuses Guatemala 's leader in his death .
The lawyer , Rodrigo Rosenberg , was shot and killed Sunday while riding a bicycle in Guatemala City .
On Monday , a video surfaced in which Rosenberg -- seated behind a desk and calmly speaking into a microphone -- linked Colom and an aide to his death .
" If you are watching this message , " Rosenberg said on the video , " it is because I was assassinated by President Alvaro Colom , with help from Gustavo Alejos , " the president 's private secretary .
Rosenberg mentions a third person who he believes would have been involved in his death and also mentions those three people as well as the president 's wife in connection with two killings last month .
In a broadcast to the nation Monday night , Colom denied any connection .
" We categorically reject the accusations that pretend to tie the president , first lady and private secretary as those responsible for this assassination , " Colom said .
A dated and signed transcript of the video's content indicates Rosenberg made the recording last week .
It surfaced Monday after his funeral , and was posted on YouTube and distributed to other media outlets by the newspaper El Periodico de Guatemala .
Rosenberg 's video said he was targeted for talking about the death of prominent businessman Khalil Musa and his daughter in April .
They were killed , Rosenberg said , because they had refused to participate in acts of corruption as the president wanted .
Rosenberg said he had been speaking out about his belief that Colom and others were behind the slaying .
Carlos Castresana Fernandez , the head of a U.N. - Guatemalan commission set up to investigate corruption and political violence , told CNN that his agency will support an investigation by the country 's attorney general .
" We must be sure the investigation is a proper one and are demanding of the government to take the necessary distance -- to be sure there are no influences over the investigators that could make questions of the reliability of the investigation itself , " he said .
Castresana 's organization , the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala , was set up because of an " almost complete failure " of the country 's legal system following a decades - long civil war that ended in 1996 .
He said the facts were " serious enough " that his organization was assisting prosecutors to mount a transparent investigation .
Radio journalist Mario David Garcia told CNN en Español on Tuesday that Rosenberg was supposed to detail his allegations Monday afternoon on Garcia 's program , " Hablando Claro " ( Speaking Clearly ) .
Garcia , also an attorney , said Rosenberg came by his office last week to talk about the allegations against the president .
Garcia said he asked for proof .
In the video , Rosenberg wears a blue - gray suit , white shirt and solid sky - blue tie .
A blue cloth backdrop drapes the wall behind him and a large red broadcast - type microphone sits on the table in front of him .
He speaks in a calm , deliberate voice and mentions that he is the 47 - year - old father of " four divine children , with the best brother that you could ask of life , with incredible friends and very much wanting to live in his country . "
But he adds that he could not have lived with himself if he had not come forth with the accusations .
Mario Gonzalez , manager of the business Musa owned , told CNN en Español that Rosenberg relayed to him Friday afternoon his plan to release the information to the media .
Rosenberg knew he was targeted , Gonzalez said .
" He felt threatened , " Gonzalez said .
" [ But ] he was not afraid .
He had been threatened but he knew that sooner or later he would be killed .
' They are going to kill me , ' he said . "
The lawyer 's niece , Mariela Rosenberg , said her uncle learned to accept his fate .
" He had many threats , " she told CNN en Español , " and when he saw it was inevitable , he taped a video . "
In addition to Colom 's broadcast address , the government posted a seven - point statement on its
Web site rejecting the assertions and saying the claims were meant to create " political chaos . "
In the posting , Colom 's administration blamed Rosenberg 's death on organized crime and welcomed international assistance in the investigation .
" The government of Guatemala categorically condemns the hostile , malicious way some sections of the population are using these events in order to create political instability in the country , " it said .
" The murder of lawyer Rosenberg as well as the recording and written declaration distributed have to be analyzed very carefully , " the government said , " because the murder as well as the accusations are very serious offenses that are severely punishable by the law and are attempts against the state of law and democracy . "
Some analysts say they have no knowledge of Colom or others in his inner circle being involved in the killings , but point to Guatemala 's history of corruption and large - scale involvement in the drug trade .
" Guatemala has been particularly known for the complicity of the government with the dark forces of the nation , " said Larry Birns , director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs , a Washington policy institute .
In his video , Rosenberg bemoans the " narcos , assassins and thieves " who have taken over the country .
" Those thieves are sinking all of Guatemala , " he said .
" They kill people like dogs . "
About 200,000 people have been killed in Guatemala since 1970 , mostly as a result of organized crime and drug - trade violence , Birns said .
The violence has gotten worse , he said , since Mexican President Felipe Calderon started waging war on that nation 's drug cartels a couple of years ago .
Mexico shares a 541 - mile ( 871 - kilometer ) border with Guatemala and many Mexican narcotraffickers moved their operations to the neighboring country .
Guatemala is also known for money - laundering .
" There is n't a single serious banker in this country , " Rosenberg said in the video .
" There is n't a single correct banker in this country . "
Peter Hakim , president of the Washington - based Inter - American Dialogue think tank , said Guatemala has a reputation for corruption and the drug trade .
" It is a country where one of two presidents ends up being seriously charged with corruption , " he said .
The government also offers scant public services .
" Guatemala has the lowest tax collection , the lowest government expenditures of any country in Latin America , " Hakim said .
Colom was elected in November 2007 on a promise to lessen Guatemala 's horrendous poverty .
It has n't worked out that way .
" He proved to be a disappointment , " Birns said .

The British invented concentration camps , in South Africa during the Boer War .
They were described by their architects as humanitarian institutions designed to protect the widows and abandoned wives and mothers of white Boers from the potential depredations of the natives .
They were , of course , places of extraordinary cruelty and neglect where tens of thousands died .
This reflects the tendency for liberal ideals to transform into their opposites under capitalism , a tendency whichhave sometimes been inclined to describe in terms of the literary tropes of ' the dialectic ' ( which tropes they have absurdly taken to be in some sense a ' science ' , and one with cosmological implications at that ) .
It happens that institutions of terror and cruelty have so often been organised under a humanitarian remit that one is inclined to wonder if the values that supposedly gave rise to them are , ' dialectically ' , interpenetrated with their opposites .
And here it comes up again .
The terms of humanitarianism turn out to have crucial national anddimensions ( this will be vaguely familiar to British watchers of the news , whoused to being told about ' Britons ' who died in a particular calamity ) .
constructs what it refers to as ' refugee camps ' , to contain the victims of its war , who happen to be its supposed racial enemies .
And in these camps there will be a quarter of a million people without the necessities of survival , being raped and beaten and humiliated because they are Tamils .
The government turns away aid ( just as the Bush administration did during Katrina ) , and justifies it on the grounds that aid is an affront to the dignity of the victims who do n't need charity .
The spectral ' international community ' is advised that ' standards ' are being maintained .
But even if this were true , these ' standards ' are being applied to a programme of obliteration , a programme carried out with intent to destroy the resistance of the Tamil community to its ' inclusion ' insovereignty .
This is a kind of neoliberal ' humanitarianism ' : if we can destroy any figment of radical statist opposition to the Sri Lankan national unit , we can promote growth and ultimately benefit those poor Tamil farmers while we 're at it .
Of course this promise is a lie , but surely the point is that such promises are routinely made to accomodate people to exploitation and immiseration .
The recent success of the Congress Party in the Indian elections depended in part on their promise that with some modest pro-poor initiatives and opposition to communalism , the country would experience GDP growth that would lift all boats .
On such ostensibly humanitarian edifices , enormous works of extraction and exploitation are constructed .
And if , in some cases , it requires the imposition of technologies of authority originating in ' Old Europe ' , who is going to be sentimental enough to oppose it ?
If necessary , I should think , a healthy round of executions would be appropriate , for the good of the victims if nothing else .
Labels : ' humanitarian intervention ' , british empire , concentration camps , dialectics , liberal imperialism , sri lanka , tamil tigers , the liberal defense of murder
Having had other break - ins in the past , Mr Taylor was determined not to let this thief get away .
And the fleeing burglar , who realised he was being followed , made an equally determined effort to get away during the ensuing chase of nearly 50 miles .

Scientology Spokesman Confirms Xenu Story

Scientology Spokesman Tommy Davis Confirms Xenu Story
Los Angeles , CA - After years of dismissing the story as false , Scientology spokesman Tommy Davis has confirmed that the story of mankind 's origins involving an alien overlord named Xenu is indeed authentic Scientology teaching .
In the exclusive interview with KESQ News Channel 3 reporter [ 1 ] , Nathan Baca , Scientology spokesman Tommy Davis was asked about the story of Xenu , known to senior Scientologists as part of " Operating Thetan Level III " , or " OT III " for short .
Davis denied the story at first ( as he has done in the past ) , stating that these were claims " forwarded by anti-Scientologists . "
When Baca began reading from a book written by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard that mentions the Xenu story , Davis became defensive , admitting that the story is indeed authentic , but confidential .
He then accused Nathan Baca of religious hate , saying that a non-Scientologist asking about Scientology 's core beliefs is an " offensive concept " , and that Baca was " just forwarding an agenda of hate . "
Tommy Davis previously denied the Xenu story , asking CNN reporter John Roberts if it " sounded ridiculous " and saying the story was " unrecognisable " to him [ 3 ] .
The Xenu story has also been denied by actor Tom Cruise and other famous Scientologists [ 6 ] .
In that same interview with John Roberts , Davis claimed that anti-Scientology protesters known as " Anonymous " had sent death threats and bomb threats to Scientology " orgs " around the world .
When Roberts revealed that the FBI had told CNN that they had no reason to believe Anonymous was responsible for the alleged threats , Mr. Davis stuttered , and claimed that the alleged threats were being investigated by local law enforcement .
The organization is well - known for aggressive public relations and media handling tactics , such as claiming threats of violence against itself .
New York journalist , Paulette Cooper , the author of the famous critical book " The Scandal of Scientology " , was framed for making bomb threats by Scientology in the 1970's .
" Operation Freakout " was revealed by the FBI after raids on Scientology headquarters in Washington and Los Angeles in which were seized detailed plans for the false bomb threats .
In 2007 , the Church of Scientology in the UK alleged that the BBC sent " terrorist death threats " to the organization [ 5 ] .
A leaked recording exists of Hubbard giving a lecture [ 2 ] on OT III , as well as a hand - written document summarizing the Xenu story written in Hubbard 's own handwriting [ 4 ] .
Hubbard instructed his followers not to mention OT III to any non-Scientologist and Scientologists who themselves have not reached the level , ostensibly because Hubbard wrote that people are liable to fall victim to pneumonia and die if exposed to the Xenu story before they have completed the preparatory steps in Scientology .
Scientologists pay up to $ 350,000 to reach OT III .
Those that reach OT III are required to have a safe in their home and to transport the OT III materials in a locked briefcase [ 7 ] .

PALMDALE , Calif . - Officials say a boy playing " cops and robbers " with a toy handgun has been shot and wounded by a Los Angeles County sheriff 's deputy .
The boy was shot Sunday night in Palmdale , about 80 kilometres north of Los Angeles . .
Deputy Jeff Gordon says the boy was hospitalized in stable condition and is expected to survive .
His age and identity were not immediately released .
Gordon says deputies were responding to reports that someone was riding a bicycle and brandishing a handgun .
Police spotted the rider and ordered him to drop the weapon , but instead , Gordon says he pointed it at the deputies .
One deputy fired a shot and hit the boy in the upper body .
I remember being fascinated by personality tests as a kid .
I think it all started when I took a test in elementary school about what career I should be in , and from then I was hooked .
I discovered other tests that told me about myself based ozsn my favorite color , tests which described my personality based on my food choices , etc .
It did n’t matter that I did n’t know anything about mental bias and the Forer effect , it all sounded true to me at the time .
Since then I ’ve learned much more about psychology , my personality and various validated psychological tests to determine facets of my personality type .
I always felt like there was something missing from the standard ones I took though , even though they were largely accurate .
I ’ve recently discovered a test that cleared up some of my personal confusion , and wanted to share it with you – along with some of my other favorite free online personality tests .
[ reddit-me ]
The irony of discussing online surveys immediately following my article about not wasting time online is not lost on me = ) .
I do n’t believe these are a waste of time though – I ’ve tried many surveys , and these are the best ones I ’ve found to truly learn more about yourself .
Also , RSS and Email Readers – I ’ve included a lot of media in this article .
You may need to come view the article on SidSavara.com to see them .
I apologize for any inconvenience =)
Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory ( ZTPI )
Two versions of the test :
The full ZTPI as created by Dr. Zimbardo on his website .
An abridged , ZTPI from USA Today .
Both gave me similar results , but I highly suggest taking the full one if you have 15 - 20 minutes .
Background Information :
I recently discovered this test after watching Dr. Zimbardo present the test and his findings at the Commonweatlh Club .
Here ’s a short , 2 minute introduction to Zimbardo ’s work :
The ZTPI , along with Dr. Zimbardo ’s perspective on issues dealing with time are discussed at length in his book , The Time Paradox .
Zimbardo contends that all of our significant choices , all our important decisions we make are determined by our perspective on time .
After taking the test , and discussing the results some of my friends had when they took the test , I agree .
It is the first test where I ever had a result that was an extreme case .
Spoiler Alert : I should warn you , if you ’re interested in taking the test you should do so before reading the next paragraph .
It contains spoilers about some of the questions on the test and what the answers suggest , which could bias your response based on how you want your results to turn out .
To take the test , check out the full ZTPI here .
Alternatively , here is a shorter ZTPI from USA Today .
Both gave me similar results , but I highly suggest taking the full one if you have 15 - 20 minutes .
Dr. Zimbardo divides our time perspectives up into 5 main categories , as discussed in his research from 1999 ( PDF ) , Putting Time in Perspective : A Valid , Reliable Individual - Differences Metric :
Past Negative –
This reflects a generally negative view of the past .
Items that come into play here are thoughts such as “ I think about the bad things have have happened to me in the past . ”
“ I think about the good things that I have missed out on in my life , ” and “ I often think of what I should have done differently in my life . ”

“ I think about the good things that I have missed out on in my life , ” and “ I often think of what I should have done differently in my life . ”
Past Positive –
This reflects a warm , sentimental attitude towards the past .
Items that come into play here include thoughts such as : “ It gives me pleasure to think about the past , ” “ I get nostalgic about my childhood , ” and “ I enjoy stories about how things used to be in the ‘ good old times . ' ”

Present Hedonistic –
As the name suggests , this factor reflects a hedonistic , risk taking attitude towards time and life .
It suggests an orientation toward present pleasure with little concern for future consequences .
Typical items include : “ I do things impulsively , ” ” I often follow my heart more than my head , ” and “ When listening to my favorite music , I often lose all track of time . ”

Typical items include : “ My life is controlled by forces I can not influence , ” “ You ca n’t really plan for the future because things change so much ” and “ Often luck pays off better than hard work . ”

Future –
This factor reflects a general future orientation .
Typical items include : “ I am able to resist temptations when I know there is work to be done . , ” and “ I complete projects on time by making steady progress . ”
The Future category is where my result was , quite literally , off their chart .
I took it a second time , and had very similar results in all 5 categories – including an extreme result for future orientation .

Project Implicit
Versions of the Test :
Multiple tests available at Project Implicit Tests
Background Informatin :
Many personality tests only work if you answer honestly , and are easy to cheat by answering the way we idealize ourselves to be .
That ’s why this test fascinates me : it ’s based on research by researches at Harvard , the University of Virginia and the University of Washington to measure implicit biases .
Here ’s how they describe it :
[ M]ost studies available at Project Implicit examine thoughts and feelings that exist either outside of conscious awareness or outside of conscious control .
The primary goals of Project Implicit are to provide a safe , secure , and well - designed virtual environment to investigate psychological issues and , at the same time , provide visitors and participants with an experience that is both educational and engaging .
– Background Information about Project Implicit
The experiment involves showing you different sets of words , and asking you to push one key on your keboard if the word is associated with side “ A ” , and another if the word is associated with side “ B ” .
So for example , Side A might be career , while Side B is family .
Then they ’ll have you do Side A is Male , Side B Female .
Those are fairly straightforward .
The interesting part of the experiment comes when they then say Side A is either Male or Career , and B is either Female or Family – and then finally , switch it up ( Side A is Male or Family , Side B is Female or Career ) .
Based on the cognitive dissonance provided by your own mental bias , the test shows you what kinds of implicit biases we all hold by looking at your reaction time .
The very first time I did it I was surprised at my own results , and noticed even while I was taking the tests that I have implicit biases , because of my slower reaction time .
This video shows Alan Alda discussing the test with some of the researchers , as well as his and their results .
What I found especially interesting is the researchers discussing how they have taken the test so many times , and even wrote the questions to test for bias : and their results continue to show their implicit biases !
Jung Topology / Myer ’s Briggs Type Indicator ( MBTI )
Versions of the Test :
I prefer the first one .
The Keirsey Temperament Sorter - II is very limited now in the free version , which I did not like , since they only provide partial results .
The one question test is interesting , and fairly accurate .
Background Information :
Arguably the most popular personality test of all .
From Wikipedia :
The Myers - Briggs Type Indicator ( MBTI ) assessment is a psychometric questionnaire designed to measure psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions .
These preferences were extrapolated from the typological theories originated by Carl Gustav Jung , as published in his 1921 book Psychological Types ( English edition , 1923 ) . [ … ]
The Myers - Briggs typology model regards personality type as similar to left or right handedness : individuals are either born with , or develop , certain preferred ways of thinking and acting .
The MBTI sorts some of these psychological differences into four opposite pairs , or “ dichotomies , ” with a resulting 16 possible psychological types .
None of these types is “ better ” or “ worse ” ; however , Briggs and Myers theorized that individuals naturally prefer one overall combination of type differences . [… ]
In the same way that writing with the left hand is hard work for a right - hander , so people tend to find using their opposite psychological preferences more difficult , even if they can become more proficient ( and therefore behaviorally flexible ) with practice and development .
– Myers - Briggs Type Indicator at Wikipedia
Knowing your Myers - Briggs
Type ( and especially knowing those of your peers ) helps you understand what motivates you and your peers .
Each type has characteristics that determine how we perceive the world , each other , and the actions of others .
Knowing the type of person you are interacting with enables you to see the situation from their point of view , and understand what types of things are most relevant and important to them as stakeholders in a particular situation .
It can also help you understand why you find some people frustrating ( and I ’m sure , why some people find me frustrating = ) )
Briefly , there are four different axes that are measured by the MBTI :
Dichotomies Extraversion Introversion Sensing iNtuition Thinking Feeling Judging Perceiving
From these 4 traits , we can come up with 16 different types ( 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 16 ) as described below ( links take you to type descriptions on Wikipedia ) :
ISTJ ISFJ INFJ INTJ Inspector Protector Counselor Mastermind ISTP ISFP INFP INTP Crafter Composer Healer Architect ESTP ESFP ENFP ENTP Promoter Performer Champion Inventor ESTJ ESFJ ENFJ ENTJ Supervisor Provider Teacher Field Marshal
Here ’s a brief introduction to the MBTI , though they do not discuss the 16 types in detail .
I mostly just love it for the cool little animations
This is my favorite treatment I found of the 16 MBTI types – Myers - Briggs , explained with The Simpsons .
Each type is explained in detail , with an example from The Simpsons ( though The Simpsons characters may not be fully representative of what each type is )
If you want to dig in further , the Wikipedia discussion is excellent .
Other Tests
I ’ve found some other tests that I found interesting ( Big - 5 and its variants , RHETI ) , but ultimately many other personality tests are highly correlated with the MBTI .
After trying out a number of them , I felt that the MBTI was the most relevant to me personally .
If you ’d like to try some of the other ones , here they are :

( CNN ) --
Law enforcement officials in southern California searched urgently Wednesday for a 3 - year - old boy who was kidnapped at gunpoint during a weekend home invasion .
Briant Rodriguez , 3 , was taken by armed men during a home invasion in San Bernardino , Caifornia , police say .
Two men broke into a house in the San Bernardino area on Sunday and tied up the boy , Briant Rodriguez , his mother and other siblings .
They ransacked the house and fled with the boy , authorities said .
One of the children freed himself and untied the rest of the family , CNN affiliate KTLA reported .
The boy 's father was at work at the time , KTLA said .
An Amber Alert was issued late Sunday .
Sheriff 's deputies in San Bernardino County released composite sketches of the suspects during a news conference on Tuesday .
Watch how the boy was taken at gunpoint »
Sheriff 's officials said they placed the boy 's picture on billboards along the U.S. - Mexican border and have followed up on half of 80 or so leads from the Amber Alert tip - line .
Federal , state and local authorities are working the investigation , which is sparing no expense , Sgt. Doug Hubbard .
said .
" Every type of known technology is working on this case , " he added .
Officials said the kidnappers have not contacted authorities or the parents .
Do n't Miss Active Amber Alerts
At the news conference , the boy 's mother , Maria Millan , held her son's T - shirt and begged that he be released .
" My son , my son , my pretty son , " she said .
Millan said she told the kidnappers " I do n't owe you a thing " and has said she did n't know the men .
There has been speculation that the boy 's abduction was a case of mistaken identity or carried out by people involved with organized crime .
Authorities say they have found no motive in the case , and they are not ruling out any possibility .
They said the parents are not suspects .
Hubbard , the sheriff 's department 's lead investigator in the case , said " the family obviously has been very distraught . "
" Every second that goes by for us is critical , " Hubbard said of the round - the - clock and robust investigation .
He also added that in his 20 - year career he has never experienced a case where a home - invasion robbery resulted in a kidnapping .
Briant is described in the Amber Alert as a Hispanic male who was last seen wearing a yellow shirt with blue sleeves and blue - striped shorts with two different colors of blue .
The boy 's hair is longer than shoulder length .
Both suspected kidnappers are Hispanic males -- one 5 - feet , 5 inches tall , between the ages of 18 and 20 with a thin build , unknown hair and eye color , last seen wearing a black baseball hat , blue jeans and green T - shirt .
The other is 5 - foot - 10 , around age 24 with a thin build , black boots , a black shirt and a bandanna .

* Dollar index drops to lowest in almost 5 months
* Sterling at highest in more than 6 mths , above $ 1.5800
* Dollar falls to 2 - month low vs yen
* Fed says it considered buying more securities
By Satomi Noguchi
TOKYO , May 21 ( Reuters ) -
The dollar fell to its lowest in almost five months against a basket of currencies on Thursday , extending a slide from the previous day after the Federal Reserve said it considered buying more securities at its last policy meeting .
The dollar hit a more than six - month low versus the pound and a two - month trough against the yen as an increase in the Fed ’s purchases of mortgage agency and government securities would inject more dollars into the global financial system .
“ The Fed said exactly what the market wanted to hear so it could sell the dollar , although it ’s too early to say whether it ’s a decisive trend that will hurt the dollar , ” said a portfolio manager at a Japanese asset management firm .
“ The dollar ’s current drop comes as fears ease about credit and dollar funding , but traders are watching if the focus shifts to a decrease in the value of the dollar expected to come sooner or later , ” the manager said .
The dollar had rallied against a basket of currencies as investors rushed to secure cash in dollars during the height of the financial crisis .
In March the dollar index , a gauge of the greenback ’s performance against six major currencies , reached its highest since April 2006 .
But the index retreated to 80.897 on Thursday , its lowest since early January .
That was partly due to improved risk appetite as investors have turned more optimistic on views that the worst of the global financial crisis has passed .
An appetite for risk in other currencies improved after U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Wednesday the U.S. financial system was “ starting to heal ” , crediting an array of emergency government programmes for helping ease a crisis sparked by a surge in mortgage defaults .
[ ID :nN20501612 ]
Sterling rose as high as $ 1.5817 , its highest since early November , before retreating to $ 1.5770 GBP= D4 , up 0.2 percent from late New York trade on Wednesday .
The euro was little changed from late U.S. trade at $ 1.3775 EUR= , staying near Wednesday 's high of $ 1.3831 on trading platform EBS , its highest since early January .
The dollar fell as low as 94.28 yen on trading platform EBS , its lowest since March , before rebounding slightly to 94.50 yen JPY= , down 0.4 percent .
The euro fell 0.6 percent to 130.15 yen EURJPY=R .
“ Dollar / yen is simply catching up other currency pairs in broad dollar selling .
A fall in U.S. Treasury yields the previous day is also encouraging the dollar ’s drop against the yen , ” said Hideaki Inoue , chief manager of forex trading at Mitsubishi UFJ Trust Bank .
U.S. Treasuries rallied on Wednesday after the release of the minutes from the Fed policy meeting .
[ ID :nN20492043 ]
Benchmark 10 - year Treasury yields faced downward pressure around 3.19 percent US10YT=RR after falling about 6 basis points the previous day .
Investors will look to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia ’s index of business activity in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region at 1400 GMT and weekly data on claims for jobless benefits at 1230 GMT for more signs that the economy ’s deterioration is slowing .
“ The dollar and the yen could fall against other currencies and stocks are likely to rally if the Philadelphia Fed ’s survey shows some improvement , warming up risk appetite further , ” said Masafumi Yamamoto , head of FX strategy Japan at Royal Bank of Scotland .
Economists expect weekly jobless claims to have slightly decreased but remained at a highly recessionary level of 630,000 .
A Reuters poll produced a median forecast for a reading of - 18 for the Philadelphia Fed ’s index in May , improving from the April reading of - 24.4 . [ ECI / US ]
The Bank of Japan began a two - day policy board meeting on Thursday .
But traders said the event is unlikely to have much impact because the central bank is widely expected to keep its interest rates near zero .

ATTACKS ON HOMELESS ATTACKS ON HOMELESS
Maryland became the first state Thursday to cover homeless people in its hate crimes law .
Under the law , signed by Democratic Gov. Martin O'Malley , an attack can result in a harsher penalty if evidence shows the attacker acted because the victim was homeless .
The Maryland law also covers race , religious belief , national origin , disability , gender and sexual orientation .
" This is a very symbolic and practical step in addressing violence against homeless people , " says Michael Stoops of the National Coalition for the Homeless .
Similar bills are being considered in Washington , D.C. , and California .
A few states have passed related measures .
In 2006 , Maine allowed judges to impose harsher sentences for crimes against the homeless .
Last year , Alaska added them to its vulnerable - victims law , which allows for increased penalties .
The FBI tracks hate crimes , but because the homeless are not a protected class , it has no figures for attacks on them .
Stoops ' group began tracking crimes against the homeless a decade ago .
Using police interviews and news reports , it documented a rising trend , from 60 attacks in 1999 to 160 in 2007 ; 217 of the 774 total incidents were fatal .
One death occurred on Valentine 's Day last year , when a homeless man was beaten to death while sleeping in an alley in Frederick , Md. " They are vulnerable . …
They 're easy targets , " says Maryland Sen .
Alex Mooney , the bill 's sponsor .
A conservative Republican , he opposed an earlier bill to add sexual orientation as a protected class .
He says he became convinced that the homeless should be covered after seeing video of " punk kids taking baseball bats " to homeless people in Florida .
" It was pretty gruesome . "
David Friedman of the Anti-Defamation League , a group that fights prejudice against Jews , says the homeless need help but do n't belong as a protected class because hate crime laws are based on " immutable " characteristics such as race or ethnicity , not temporary status such as homelessness .
Congress is considering a bill that would add gender , disability and sexual orientation , but not homelessness , to the federal hate crimes law .
Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson , D - Texas , plans to reintroduce legislation that would add the homeless as a protected class if attacked on federal property .

Windows 7 HDD and SSD performance benchmarked : whips Vista
Benchmarking Windows 7 ‘s performance with various hard - drives and SSDs may not sound like much fun , but when you consider how many people will end up using the new OS once it officially launches you can at least see its uses .
HotHardware have been testing out Windows 7 and contrasting it with Vista ’s performance , and the good news is that the new platform bests its predecessor , particularly when it comes to SSDs .
The full performance results , which see the two OSes tested on various models of platter - based drive and solid - state drive , span several pages , but the takeaway result is that Microsoft have pulled their act together in Windows 7 .
SSDs in particular showed up to a 35 - percent improvement in read performance and up to a 23 - percent improvement in write performance .
Standard hard - drives showed a less significant change , but according to HotHardware the overall feel of Windows 7 is a snappier , more responsive platform .
That certainly seems to accord with the talk we ’ve heard from testers using the public beta .

Google Earth Mash - Up Shows Best Areas for Renewable Energy Projects
April 1st , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
You might think that renewable energy developers have few problems convincing towns to let them move in .
But things can get surprisingly tricky when it comes to wildlife protection , according to a new map from the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Audubon Society .
The Google Maps mash - up shows which renewable energy project locations are likely to provoke a fight based on the location of wilderness areas , areas where roads are banned , national parks , wildlife refuges , areas under consideration for wilderness protection , and areas that lack legal protection but contain endangered species .
The map is a useful primer for companies , but inspection of the sites is obviously required to find out if development is suitable .
While the NRDC ’s mash - up is mainly intended for alternative energy developers , it is also useful for oil and gas prospectors as well as potential coal mine installations .
As the NRDC ’s website notes , “ Knowing the location of sensitive lands is the first step toward ensuring that new projects and new transmission lines are built in the right way . ”

How much would it take for you to ditch your set ?
How about a cool mil -- or more ?
A
recent study found that it would take $ 1 million for someone to be willing to give up TV for the rest of their lives .
Guess what ?
If you decided to give up TV and invested the money you saved , you would get that $ 1 million -- and probably a lot more .
People rarely consider the cost of watching TV , and when they do , they usually focus on the cost of their monthly cable bill .
The truth is that there are a wide variety of costs associated directly and indirectly with having a TV .
Here are some areas where your TV drains your finances :
TV
: The cost of your TV can range anywhere from a few hundred dollars to several thousand if you decide to go for the newer plasma flat screen TVs .
Take this cost and multiply it by several times , since you will likely own far more than one TV during your lifetime .
Entertainment cabinet system
: Most people do n't consider this cost when purchasing a TV , but you need a stand or entertainment cabinet on which to display your TV and other components of your entertainment system .
This will cost anywhere from a few hundred dollars on up , depending on how fancy you decide to go .
You can also assume that you will replace this at least once during your lifetime .
Cable
: Once they have a TV , most people are n't satisfied watching only the free basic channels .
Most will subscribe to a cable or satellite package that will cost them anywhere from $ 20 a month for bare - bones cable channels to well over $ 100 a month .
Pay - per-view
: There are an increasing number of special pay - per- view sporting and entertainment events now found on TV .
You might spend nothing to over $ 100 a month on these , depending on your viewing habits .
Movies
: In addition to cable , most people are going to want to watch movies .
That means either purchasing the DVDs or renting them from a service such as NetFlix and paying a monthly fee .
DVD/DVR
: In order to watch the movies that you rent , you are going to need a decent DVD player .
This will cost at least a few hundred dollars .
And again , you 'll likely replace this a minimum of several times over your lifetime as technologies change and better quality devices are created .
You also may buy recording devices or DVRs like Tivo and related accessories to catch all of your favorite shows .
Gaming system
: If you are into video games , you will purchase a gaming system to use .
These can cost anywhere from a couple hundred dollars on up .
You will also likely buy a number of these over your lifetime as the systems improve .
Games
: If you purchase a gaming system , you will also need to purchase or rent games to play on that system .
This can get quite costly , as most people want a variety of different games to play .
It can easily run more than $ 100 a month if you purchase multiple games .
Energy
: You will need to pay for the electricity to run the TV and other related electronics .
This will vary greatly , depending on the type of TV you have and how much energy costs where you live , but it will likely be a minimum of $ 10 a month and possibly much more .
Commercials
: A huge hidden cost of TV that people never consider are all the commercials they watch .
The commercials are there to get you to buy products -- and they are effective .
Economist Juliet Schor estimated that for every hour of TV a person watches each week , he or she will increase his or her annual spending by about $ 200 , according to a 1999 article in the Spokane , Wash . ,
Spokesman - Review
.
In 2005 , Nielsen Media Research reported that
the average person watched approximately 4.5 hours of TV a day , or 31.5 hours a week .
At $ 200 in extra spending for each hour watched , that means that the average person spends an extra $ 6,300 a year due to TV commercials that they would n't have spent if they did n't watch TV .
Opportunity costs
: Another cost often overlooked when considering the price of watching TV is the opportunities forfeited when you choose viewing over something else .
You could start a business , take on a part - time job or take care of your garden so you do n't have to pay someone else to do it .
Assuming that your time is worth at least the minimum wage of $ 5.85 per hour , your opportunity cost is $ 737 a month if you view the average amount of TV .
So what does this all add up to ?
Say you 're 25 years old and you initially spend $ 2,000 for your TV , DVD player , entertainment cabinet and gaming system after getting your first job .
Add in monthly costs of $ 100 for cable , $ 10 for electricity use , $ 20 for renting movies , $ 25 for buying games and $ 20 for an occasional pay - per - view event , and you 're looking at $ 175 a month .
Add in another $ 525 a month extra you spend due to the influence of commercials if you are the average person , and you are costing yourself $ 700 a month watching TV .
If you instead invested this money and received a return of 8 % compounded annually over 45 years until you 're 70 years old , you would have more than $ 3.7 million in your account .
That is actually a conservative number , as additional upgrades in equipment were not included .
Not to mention potential repair costs .
It 's also more than likely that many of the services will rise in price over time and new TV - related services will be introduced .
And the calculation does not even take into account the potential additional opportunity cost , which could be a significant amount of money .
Your actual lifetime TV costs will vary from the above assumptions depending on how you watch TV and what services you use .
You can make an estimate of your total costs for watching TV by plugging the relevant numbers into a
basic compounding calculator .
While it 's probably unrealistic that you will give up your TV entirely , the above numbers should make you consider how much money your TV - watching habits are costing you .
Even some small changes could have a huge benefit on your overall finances .

Scientists pinpoint how very low concentrations of the herbicide and other chemicals in Roundup formulations kill human cells , strengthening the case for phasing them out , and banning all further releases of Roundup - tolerant GM crops .
( Image by Unknown Owner ) Details DMCA
Dr. Mae -Wan Ho and Brett Cherry
This article was submitted to the USDA on behalf of ISIS
Four different Roundup formulations of the herbicide glyphosate manufactured by Monsanto are highly toxic to human cells , and at concentrations far below the recommended agricultural use levels .
Researchers at the Institute of Biology in Caen , France published their latest results in the current issue of Chemical Research in Toxicology [ 1 ] .
Roundup formulations are lethal cocktails
The four Roundup formulations are mixtures of glyphosate with various adjuvants .
( An adjuvant is ‘ helper ' substance added to aid the effect of the active ingredient . )
The Roundup formulations are currently the top non-selective herbicides worldwide and increasing , as more than 75 percent of genetically modified ( GM ) crops are Roundup tolerant .
Glyphosate and its major metabolite , aminomethylphosphonic acid ( AMPA ) are main contaminants in rivers .
The adjuvants , not often measured in the environment , are usually considered ‘ inert ' and protected as trade secret in manufacturing .
Among them , the predominant one is polyethoxylated tallow amine ( POEA ) .
POEA is used as a surfactant in Roundup formulations to improve solubility and penetration into plants .
Three human cell lines were tested : primary cell line HUVEC from umbilical cord vein epithelium , embryonic cell line 293 derived from kidney , and placenta cell line JEG3 .
All cells died within 24 hours of exposure to the Roundup formulations .
The Roundup formulations ( Rs ) contain different amounts of the active ingredient glyphosate : Roundup Express , 7.2 g/L ( R7.2 ) ; Roundup Bioforce , 360 g/L ( R360 ) ; Roundup Grand Travaux , 400 g/L ( R400 ) ; and Roundup Grand Travaux Plus , 450 g/L ( R450 ) .
They were compared with glyphosate ( G ) , AMPA , and POEA .
All Roundup formulations in the study , along with individual chemical ingredients , were tested at concentrations from10 ppm ( parts per million ) to 2 percent ( the recommended agricultural usage level ) , which means that the Roundup formulations were diluted up to 100 000 times or more .
The researchers found that the presence of the other chemical ingredients in Roundup formulations , such as POEA , actually amplified glyphosate 's toxic effects .
The toxicities of the Roundup formulations were not proportional to the amount of glyphosate they contained , and are most likely due to POEA and other as yet undisclosed ingredient ( s ) present in all the formulations .
POEA by itself is much more toxic than the Roundup formulations , while AMPA is more toxic than glyphosate .
Multiple targets in toxicity
The researchers tested Rs , G , AMPA , and POEA for effects on three targets that could kill the cell : damage to the cell membrane , poisoning of the mitochondria ( site of energy metabolism ) , and programmed cell death that results in fragmentation of the DNA in the cell nucleus .
They measured specific enzyme markers at different concentrations for each damage at 24 h of exposure , and also obtained images of the cell cultures under the microscope .
All Rs , as well as G , caused cells to die ; the results are the same for all human cell types , but at different concentrations .
Thus , R400 , the most toxic formulation , killed all cells at 20 ppm , which is equivalent to 8 ppm in G .
However , 4 - 10 ppm G alone is non-toxic , its toxicity begins around 1 percent ( 10 000 ppm ) , and is not connected with the cell membrane .
The R formulations damage the cell membrane , and also poison the mitochondria .
In contrast , G poisons the mitochondria without damaging the cell membrane
Unexpectedly , R400 is more toxic than R450 , the latter in turn more harmful than R360 , R7.2 and G .
However , the toxicities are not proportional to the concentration of G present .
The cell killing power of R7.2 was almost the same as that of R360 , and these results are consistent across all cell lines .
This suggests other unknown substances are involved in the toxic effects .
Thus AMPA and POEA also kill cells by poisoning the mitochondria and damaging the cell membrane .
POEA is so potent that it begins to damage the cell membrane in HUVEC and poison the mitochondria in 2 93 and JEG3 at 1 ppm .
Roundup formulations are more toxic than either G or AMPA .
AMPA itself destroys the cell membrane , however , which G does not do , though it is 3 - 8 times more toxic for the mitochondria than AMPA .
But as cell membrane damage is more serious for the cell , AMPA is more toxic than G , while POEA is the most toxic of all .
What happens when these ingredients are combined ?
The researchers found that for HUVEC and 293 cells , combinations of G and POEA , G and AMPA , AMPA and POEA were all more toxic than the same concentration of the single ingredients .

One problem I see quite often in the #git channel on Freenode is that beginners get confused as to why a file does n’t disappear from history when they place it into their . gitignore file .
The answer to this is quite simple !
When you tell Git to ignore files , it ’s going to only stop watching changes for that file , and nothing else .
This means that the history will still remember the file and have it .
If you want to remove a file from the repository , but keep it in your working directory , simply use :
git rm -- cached < file >
However , this will still keep the file in history .
If you actually want to remove it from history , you really have two options : rewrite your repository ’s commits , or start over .
Both options really suck , and that ’s for a good reason :
Git tries hard not to lose your data .
Just like with rebasing , Git forces you to think about these kinds of options since they are destructive operations .
If you did actually want to remove a file from history , git filter - branch is the hacksaw you ’re looking for .
Definitely read up on its manpage before using it , since it will literally rewrite your project ’s commits .
This actually is a great tool for some actions , and can do all sorts of stuff like totally removing an author ’s commits to moving the project root folder around .
The command to remove a file from all revisions is :
git filter - branch -- index - filter ' git rm -- cached < file > '

Scientists who reviewed hobbit research at a symposium here last week said that a consensus had emerged among experts in support of the initial interpretation that H. floresiensis is a distinct hominid species much more primitive than H. sapiens .
On display for the first time at the meeting was a cast of the skull and bones of a H. floresiensis , probably an adult female .
Several researchers showed images of hobbit brain casts in comparison with those of deformed human brains .
They said this refuted what they called the “ sick hobbit hypothesis . ”
They also reported telling shoulder and wrist differences between humans and the island inhabitants .
Even so , skeptics have not capitulated .
They note that most of the participants at the symposium had worked closely with the Australian and Indonesian scientists who made the discovery in 2003 and complain that their objections have been largely ignored by the news media and organizations financing research on the hobbits .

Some prominent paleoanthropologists are reserving judgment , among them Richard Leakey , the noted hominid fossil hunter who is chairman of the Turkana Basin Institute at Stony Brook University .
Like other undecided scientists , he cited the need to find more skeletons at other sites , especially a few more skulls .
Mr. Leakey conceded , however , that the recent research “ greatly strengthened the possibility ” that the Flores specimens represented a new species .
At the symposium , Michael J. Morwood , an archaeologist at the University of Wollongong in Australia who was one of the discoverers , said that further investigations of stone tools had determined that hominids arrived at Flores as early as 880,000 years ago and “ it is reasonable to assume that those were ancestors of the hobbits . ”
But none of their bones have been uncovered , so they remain unidentified , and no modern human remains have been found there earlier than 11,000 years ago .

Among other things , this post covers the sticky footer issues , positioning elements at bottom of a div , on having layout , aligning labels and inputs , auto top and bottom padding , z - index and more .
You may want to take a look at the following related posts :
Div A Before Div B
@leewillis77 writes :
I currently have div B before div A in the HTML , and div B has float .
I want to reproduce this , but with div A before div B in the HTML .
As long as both div B and div A have fixed widths , which when added together is less than or equal to the width of its parent , then it does n’t matter which of them comes first in the HTML !
Equally important to mention is that if div A and div B do not have a fixed with , then they should , because floating elements without widths is a recipe for trouble .
@ilove2design writes :
I must admit , the “ sticky footer ” CSS problem was damn annoying until I found some solutions on the Web .
Agreed !
The “ sticky footer ” pure - CSS solutions out there are pretty darn clever and come in handy regularly .
Here are two :
The both share one weakness , though , in that they require the footer to be a fixed pixel height , which is occasionally problematic .
Generally , I just go bigger than necessary and give the text plenty of room to grow .
Positioning Elements At Bottom Of Div
@_Zapp writes :
How do you position stuff at the bottom of a div with ( or without ) position absolute and relative , so that it will look the same on all browsers .
When you give an element relative positioning , that limits the scope of absolute positioning on all its child elements .
This is one of my favorite techniques in CSS Web design .
I go over it in more detail here , but let ’s take a quick look .
< div id =" parent " >
Lorem ipsum .... < p id =" child " >* Just a little footnote </ p> </div >
# parent { position : relative ; padding - bottom : 20 px ; } #child { position : absolute ; bottom : 0 ; right : 0 ; }
Just a quick note , the bottom / right combo needs hasLayout in IE 6 to work right .
Positioning Of Divs , Despite Source Order
Alex Ross writes :
Div top , middle , bottom .
Top goes below content .
I think what you are getting at here is having the header of a website come after the main content in the HTML markup yet appear to be on top , where a header belongs .
Part of the power that CSS gives us is that our designs do n’t have to be source - order - dependent , like table - based layouts do .
Here is how I would do it :
< div id =" page - wrap " > < div id =" main - content " ></div > < div id =" header " ></div > </div >
# page - wrap { padding - top : 100 px ; position : relative ; } #header { position : absolute ; top : 0 ; left : 0 ; width : 100 % ; }
This could potentially bring SEO benefits , especially if loads of content in the header are pushing down more important page content .
See an example of this , where I talk about putting excessive navigation below the content .
Centering Inside Resizeable Area
@olliepee writes :
I always have mental problems centering an automatically resizable div inside a 100 % - width div .
Divs default to 100 % wide , so if you have a div within a div without setting a specific width , that inside div will be the same width as its parent .
If you do set a width for the inside div , you can make sure it ’s centered with the ol’ classic centering trick .
div { margin : 0 auto ; }
On Having Layout
@devolute writes :
Forgetting to apply zoom : 1 ; on everything in the IE conditional style sheet .
If anyone has n’t heard of this , applying zoom : 1 ; to elements is a way to force elements to gain the proprietary hasLayout property in IE browsers .
This can fix a number of ( truly ) weird bugs in IE .
Read more about it here .
Aligning Labels And Inputs
@ofaurax writes :
Correct alignment of a form ’s “ label - input ” .
I ’ve not found a definitive solution in pure CSS .
Both labels and inputs ( all the various types ) are inline elements by default .
Doing things like making them block - level elements and floating them can be very useful and help you avoid “ unnecessary ” markup .
However , I think that ’s the first step towards cross - browser inconsistency .
I have pretty decent luck many times leaving them as inline elements and using the vertical - align : middle ; property to keep things inline .
Then wrap the label / input pairs in divs to cause the necessary line breaks .
This is particularly useful with radio buttons and checkboxes .
Also remember that if only IE is giving you grief , you can use conditional style sheets and relative positioning to nudge particular elements into place .
Text With Gradient Background
@pannpann writes :
Creating background gradients inside dynamic numbers / letters .
Typically , text in Web design can be set to a solid color , and that ’s it .
If you ’d like a gradient effect over real Web text , a couple of methods are floating around .
One is to lay a transparent PNG on top of the text that darkens a portion of it .
Web Designer
Wall has a tutorial on this , but note that this causes the potentially serious usability problem of not being able to highlight the text .
If progressive enhancement is your game , Jay Robinson has a demo on how you can use WebKit ’s proprietary - webkit - background - clip to achieve this .
Another slightly more laborious method would be to create all 10 digits as graphics , and then create unique CSS classes for each digit .
Then use markup like < span class = “ one ” >1</ span >< span class = “ two ” > 2</ span > to present the letter 12 , and use CSS image replacement to replace the 1 and 2 with your custom graphics .
Auto Top And Bottom Padding
@_Naz writes :
Trying to make a div auto - center in your browser !
ugh !
still cant get it to pad auto top and bottom !
Unfortunately , vertical centering in CSS is a lot more difficult than horizontal centering .
If you know the exact height of your div ( that is , you set it yourself ) , you can use absolute positioning to get it done .
div { position : absolute ; left : 0 ; top : 50 % ; margin - top : - 100 px ; /* half of div's height */ height : 200 px ; }
If you do n’t know the height , as painful as it is to say , using a table and the vertical - align property of table cells can get it done .
If you ’d like to explore other methods , the ThemeForest blog has a nice roundup of different methods .
Position Absolute With Text Wrap ?
@HerrWulf writes :
Been having difficulties positioning a div to the bottom - right , with text wrapping around it …
This is an interesting one .
Of course we can position a div to the bottom - right with absolute positioning as described above .
But as soon as we do that , the div is “ removed from the flow ” of the document , meaning that regular text in the parent div will ignore its placement and go right over it .
I ’m struggling to think of a really great solution for this …
So if anyone has something , please share it in the comments .
One short - term , hacky solution would be to force some sensibly placed line breaks in the text at the bottom that would make it seem like it ’s wrapping at default font sizes .
Or place the image inline and floated to the right , but in the middle of the text , towards the bottom of it .
Separate Or Multiple CSS Files ?
@scottradcliff writes :
What is your preferred method of using CSS ?
A few separate files ( e.g. type.css , layout.css , etc. ) or one large file ?
The only circumstance in which I like to break out CSS into multiple files is when the CSS is totally unique to a certain page , and loading it for every other page would be useless .
Like if you have an “ About ” page that has unique styling , I ’d load the default style.css , and then load an about.css file after it to override anything that it needs .
I do n’t like breaking CSS into layout.css , typography.css , etc. just because that is n’t how I think .
When I look at the footer on a website , I want to look at all the CSS for that region in one place , not have to open two different files .
That is just how my mind works , but I do n’t have any particular problem with doing it the other way .
Super - efficent nerds will yell at you for requiring unnecessary HTTP requests to load extra CSS files , which can slow things down .
And so , to be extra fast , you should load only one CSS file and one JavaScript file per page .
They would be right , of course , if speed were the only consideration .
Practicality , though , counts for a lot in my book .
And let ’s face it , for most of the websites that we work on , half a zillionth of a second does n’t matter as much as the budget .
Z-index And Drop - Downs
@andrewturner writes :
The hardest issue I ’ve been working on was one last week , where I was stuck with an issue relating to z - index and drop - down menus
I ’m surprised at how often problems with this come up .
Most drop - down menus rely on some combination of absolute and relative positioning .
Once elements have this , they become part of the z - index “ flow , ” so giving them high values will usually get them on top of whatever you need them to be on top of .
The big exception , which seems to come up incredibly often , is when you need to overlay Flash content .
Usually the solution here is to make sure that the Flash content is embedded with wmode=transparent .
SWFObject can help with this and offers numerous other advantages .
Customizing Radio Buttons And Checkboxes
Anonymous Email writes :
For some time , I have been trying to create custom combo boxes and checkboxes for my forms based on images .
I followed some tutorials with no good results , and I have n’t yet found a solution .
What is a clean way to get this done ?
With pure CSS , there is no way to truly customize radio and checkbox inputs , at least not by replacing them with custom graphics .
JavaScript comes to the rescue , though , by hiding them and replacing them with custom elements .
Those custom elements will have click handlers on them that visually replicate a radio button being on or off , and invisibly updating the “ real ” hidden form element .
This jQuery plug - in does a nice job of it .
No JavaScript Tooltips
@firewalker06 writes :
How can we get a tooltip effect that can be used in any browser and without JavaScript ?
CSS Globe had an article way back that does a good job of explaining it .
It definitely can be done , and I ’ll explain briefly here .
You can count on the : hover effect on anchor links in any browser , so you ’ll want to use that .
Within the anchor link , you can have a < span > element which by default is set to display : none ; .
Then , with the hover CSS , you can display the span .
a span { display : none ; } a:hover span { display : block ; position : absolute ; float : left ; white - space : nowrap ; top:- 2.2em ; left :.5 em ; background : # fffcd1 ; border : 1 px solid # 444 ; color : #444 ; padding : 1px 5 px ; z - index : 10 ; }
These values display a box with the width it needs to appear above and to the right of the link , much like browser defaults .
But you can customize this however you ’d like .
But make sure not to use a title attribute on the link , otherwise both would show up on hover and would look weird .
So , this effect should purely be an added bonus and not valuable required content because it wo n’t be very “ accessible . ”
That wraps up another installment of Ask SM !
If you have questions to ask , refer to the top of this article on ways to submit them .
Reporting on that case has been restricted but foreign news outlets have carried stories about it , with versions of those stories appearing on websites accessible from the UK .
Some bloggers have picked up the stories and may be within their rights to publish while national newspapers cannot .
The court order imposing the reporting restrictions says that it only applies to people who know about the restriction .
There is no central database of reporting restrictions , so while newspapers are informed of restrictions , bloggers generally are not , opening a legal loophole for their possible publishing of restricted information .
" The order does , in principle , apply to ' bloggers ' because it applies to all persons who know that the order has been made , " said James McBurney of Pinsent Masons , the law firm behind OUT - LAW .
COM .
" Bloggers , along with any other person or corporation are therefore prohibited from publishing any of the restricted material , but only if they know that it is in place to start with , which is where the difficulty arises : how are they supposed to know about it ? "
One way people could find out about it is through the local authority involved in the case .
It has the right to disseminate the Order , which would in turn bring it into force on anyone receiving it .
The local authority would not discuss its dissemination of the Order .
" The major national and regional newspapers will almost certainly be served by [ the council ] , however there is unlikely to be any wider service of the Order and I am unaware of any website or other information service which provides information on reporting restrictions which might be in place , " said McBurney .
" It is therefore almost certain that the average man on the street will be completely unaware of the reporting restriction order . "
The Google News service republishes headlines and opening sentences of news stories to its users .
A search for the name of the child in Google News , which was well publicised in coverage of the case before the Order , brings up the foreign stories carrying the forbidden information .
McBurney said that Google could be held responsible for that publishing of forbidden information .
" In terms of internet search engines , and any other entity involved in the chain of publication and distribution of the material , they too can theoretically be held liable for any user generated content on their webpage which publishes defamatory material , or material which is in breach of a court order and therefore in contempt of court , " said McBurney .
" Liability may also extend to publishers who link another , foreign site , the content of which would be a contempt of court in the UK . "
Google said that it removes pages on request when shown the court order the pages allegedly violate .
" We investigate removal requests based on court order violations once the court order ( and the pages they want us to remove that allegedly infringe on the court order ) have been brought to our attention , " said a Google spokesman .
" To date , we have not received a court order relating to [ this ] case . "
McBurney said that publishers and bloggers should take down material from a case once they find out that it is the subject of a reporting restriction .
" This is a difficult area to police , but such orders do remain realistic ( and necessary ) in the internet age , " he said .
" But they do rely on responsible and expeditious actions by ISPs and bloggers when and if they become aware of the existence of reporting restrictions and material on their website which potentially breaches the terms of reporting restrictions orders . "
Upstate New York County Planning Garbage - to - Gas Plant
April 2nd , 2009 by Dave Tyler
New York ’s Ontario County is exploring the possibility of turning garbage into gas at the county ’s landfill .
The county is debating whether to let Casella Waste Systems , which runs the landfill in the town of Seneca , build a $ 5 million pilot plant there .
If the pilot proves successful , a $ 100 million plant could eventually be built on the site , reports the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle .
The idea will be debated at a public hearing tonight .
[ social_buttons ]
Currently the landfill takes in about 2,200 tons of trash a day from 33 counties , other states and Canada .
The paper ( full disclosure : I worked for the D&C for more than seven years ) reports the project has stirred passions on both sides of the issue .
Supporters say it would mark the county as a leader in reducing the amount of trash in landfills , create jobs and potentially generate revenue through the sale of the methanol that would be created .
Opponents say that because of the mix of trash that gets dumped in landfills , burning it creates the risk of toxins being released into the air and water , along with other problems .
Casella says it could turn one ton of recycling scrap ( leftovers that ca n’t be reused ) into 100 gallons of methanol or diesel fuel for every hour the plant operates .
There ’s a well - done graphic explaining the process in the paper edition of the story , but it does n’t seem to be online .
Lowell , Ind. , was considering a similar plant , but vocal opposition has placed that project in limbo .
Plasma - based gasification technologies are being explored in Florida , too .
General Motors has also been investigating the process .
The Ontario County debate will provide an interesting test case .
With landfill space at a premium communities are under pressure to find ways of dealing with their trash .
Will this approach take hold ?

LEXINGTON PARK , Md. —
Some sexual experimentation landed a southern Maryland woman in a hospital with injuries tough to imagine and even more difficult to forget .
Maryland State Police airlifted the 27 - year - old woman to Prince George ’s County Hospital Center early Sunday morning after she was injured in an incident involving a sex toy attached to a saber saw blade , TheBayNet.com first reported .
The saw cut through the plastic toy and wounded the woman , according to TheBayNet.com .
The injuries were severe enough for medevac , but the woman was released from the hospital Monday and is recovering from her unusual injuries .
Investigators talked to the woman , who told them she suffered the injuries during a consensual act and that she and her partner were trying something new and no crime was committed , the sheriff ’s office said .
URL : The man who called 911 about the incident admitted attaching the sex toy to the saw and then using the high - powered , homemade device on his partner , according to the St. Mary ’s County Sheriff ’s Office .

Holy fucking shit .
I cannot imagine having my cunt sawed into and then having to be motherfucking MEDEVACED for that shit .
You know what , no .
I take that back .
I CAN imagine it .
That is one of many reasons why my vagina remains unsawed even as I type .
I once had a play partner lurch at me in the hallway of his home with a handheld electric saw going full blast and he grabbed me by the neck , grinning manically .
This would have been a terrifying proposition , as this individual was well known for being a crazy motherfucker .
However , I remained calm .
I ’d met his girlfriend , you see .
“ Dude , ” I said , calmly , even as my toes were barely touching the floor and the saw shrieked and chittered near my head “ … I know this is an idle threat .
Your girlfriend would kick your ASS if you got blood on this rug , man . ”
He paused , and sighed , turning off the saw .
“ Yeah , she would . ”
I ’m as open to kinks as the next totally open - minded pervert .
Wait - wait — Who am I kidding .
I am FAR more accepting than most pervs when it comes to kink .
Perverts can be some judgemental motherfuckers .
But really ?
Powertools ?
When you see this shit on websites , mostly this is done by engineers and riggers and people for whim building fucked up scary looking machinery is a workaday concern .
Not some dude who did n’t get the memo that a toy attached to a blade will do its fucking JOB and cut though the toy .
Seriously ?
LAME .

Lamport : " The Future of Computing : Logic or Biology ? "
" We understand automobiles .

Bill O'Reilly must be feeling a bit sensitive these days about the ongoing mockery of his work over at Comedy Central in the form of Jon Stewart 's Daily Show and Stephen Colbert 's show , which is essentially a running parody of O'Reilly anyway .
Last night , he even deigned to respond -- first , to Stewart , with smug , self - serving BS , and then to Colbert by attempting comedy .
Which , as you can see , might be funny to someone with long - term dementia , but otherwise ... well , Bill , do n't quit your day job .
Actually , the self - serving crap was really quite funny :
O'Reilly : Like Mr. Stewart , we like to poke a little fun -- but we 're not hateful .
Unlike Jon , we give the entire story , because our audience wants that .
That gave me quite a chuckle .
Description
This article is from the Space FAQ , by Jon Leech leech@cs.unc.edu and Mark Bradford tla@surly.org with numerous contributions by others .
53 Why does the shuttle roll just after liftoff ?
The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks
( kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov ) .
The " Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual , " ASC G&C 2102 ,
says :
" During the vertical rise phase , the launch pad attitude is
commanded until an I - loaded V ( rel ) sufficient to assure launch tower
clearance is achieved .
Then , the tilt maneuver ( roll program )
orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a
negative q-alpha , which in turn alleviates structural loading .
Other
advantages with this attitude are performance gain , decreased abort
maneuver complexity , improved S - band look angles , and crew view of
the horizon .
The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining
downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff ( MECO ) target
in second stage . "
This really is a good answer , but it 's couched in NASA jargon .
I 'll try
to interpret .
1 ) We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling .
2 ) Then , we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack
between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere ( the
" relative wind " ) and the chord of the wings ( the imaginary line
between the leading edge and the trailing edge ) is a slightly
negative angle ( " a negative q- alpha " ) .
This causes a little bit of
" downward " force ( toward the belly of the Orbiter , or the +
Z
direction ) and this force " alleviates structural loading . "
We have to be careful about those wings -- they 're about the
most " delicate " part of the vehicle .
3 ) The new attitude ( after the roll ) also allows us to carry more
mass to orbit , or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass , or
to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be
the case if we did n't roll ( " performance gain " ) .
4 ) The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated
flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort
maneuvers , the Return To Launch Site ( " decreased abort maneuver
complexity " ) .
5 ) The new attitude improves the ability for ground - based radio
antennae to have a good line - of - sight signal with the S - band radio
antennae on the Orbiter ( " improved S - band look angles " ) .
6 ) The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon , which is a
helpful ( but not mandatory ) part of piloting any flying machine .
7 ) The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is
more nearly parallel with the ground , and the nose to the east
( usually ) .
This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity
in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit .
Remember :
velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction .
The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its
velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit .
This all begs the question , " Why is n't the launch pad oriented to give
this nice attitude to begin with ?
Why does the Shuttle need to roll to
achieve that attitude ? "
The answer is that the pads were leftovers
from the Apollo days .
The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one
for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust , one for the Space Shuttle Main
Engine exhaust .
( You can see the effects of this on any daytime
launch .
The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage , and the SSME exhaust is
fluffy white steam .
Watch for the difference between the " top "
[ Orbiter side ] and the " bottom " [ External Tank side ] of the stack . )
The
access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented
basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's .
( A side note : the
Saturn V's also had a roll program .
Do n't ask me why -- I 'm a Shuttle
guy . )
I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics .
He added that the " roll
maneuver " is really a maneuver in all three axes : roll , pitch and yaw .

Heather Southerland had just gotten in her car after an evening visit with a girlfriend in Leesville , La .
As she drove away , a green Ford Bronco pulled close behind her , flashing its lights .
Southerland , 24 , turned onto a deserted side street .
“ The man got out of his Bronco and said , ‘ Leesville Police Department , undercover narcotics , step out of the car , ' ” she recalls .
He ordered her to walk backwards toward him and put her hands on the trunk of her vehicle .
She asked to see his badge — and he refused .
“ He said I did n’t need to see his badge , ” she says .
“ I knew right then something extremely bad was about to happen . ”
It did .
Seconds later , as she tried to flee , the man grabbed her and raped her at knifepoint .
Impersonating a cop is one of the oldest criminal ruses around ; with a bubble light , fake badge and a lot of attitude , it is n’t difficult to get a potential victim to let their guard down for a moment .
What is startling is that such incidents happen more often than many people imagine — and that in the age of the Internet , where badges and uniforms are readily available , it has never been easier to pull off .
While no national statistics are kept , earlier this year the Chicago Sun - Times ran a series on fake cops that documented how in the past three years there had been more than 1,000 cases in the Chicago area alone of people posing as police to commit a variety of crimes .
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
The series produced such an outcry that the Illinois legislature is considering a set of laws increasing the penalties for those caught impersonating a cop .
“ It ’s frightening if you ’re driving at night and you have to worry whether the car behind you with the flashing lights is a real police car , ” says Sgt. Brian Carr of the Houston police , whose own department last month arrested a man who allegedly masqueraded as a cop to try to enter a woman ’s apartment .
The man had allegedly used fake police decals on as many as 15 different vehicles over the years .
A series of high - profile cases across the country highlights the danger .
On Long Island , Reginald Gousse is now on trial for the 2005 murder of assistant bank branch manager James Gottlieb , 49 , who was shot after Gousse , who has pleaded not guilty , allegedly pretended to be a police officer and pulled him over .
The mortally wounded Gottlieb told a witness , “ I stopped because I thought it was a cop . ”
Meanwhile , in Blacksburg , S.C. , Charles Connor is accused of going into a convenience store last September in a police - style khaki shirt with a two - way radio and a gun on his hip and telling owner Nick Patel that he was a North Carolina cop .
As police tell it , for 90 minutes he hung out in the store , chatting with Patel until they were alone .
Then he demanded all his money .
Patel , married with two children , turned over $ 5,168 .
Then , police say , Connor , a former corrections officer who has pleaded not guilty , shot Patel in the head .
“ Connor knew enough to convincingly pretend to be a police officer , ” says Cherokee County Sheriff Bill Blanton .
“ When someone poses as an officer , they automatically gain the trust of their victim . ”
Sometimes a moment ’s compliance is all the fake cop is looking for .
According to authorities , last September Luz Heredia , 53 , of Melrose Park , Ill. , was in a car on her way to her factory job with two coworkers when a man approached and flashed a badge .
Moments later he allegedly grabbed Heredia , who had six grandkids , and pulled her from the vehicle , saying , “ You ’re coming with me . ”
He forced her into his SUV .
Less than two hours later she was found sexually assaulted and beaten ; she died five days later .
( Jorge Dominguez , 28 , has been charged in the crime and has pleaded not guilty . )
“ My mother had her gut instinct , ” says Heredia ’s daughter Lina Hernandez .
“ But she did n’t want to go against the law . ”
The impostors often have a habit of playing their roles repeatedly until they get caught .
In the Southerland case that did n’t take long .
As she was being driven to the police station Southerland noticed a green Bronco , similar to the one driven by her assailant .
Cops checked up on the vehicle , which was registered to Chad Elliott , 31 , a welder .
They ultimately linked Elliott to an earlier incident in which a man posing as a police officer had raped a 19 - year - old woman on the outskirts of town after stopping her on the pretext of checking to see if she had been drinking .
Elliott pleaded guilty to forcible rape in both attacks and was sentenced to 50 years in prison .
“ The level of force he used seemed to increase every time , ” says Chief Det. Marvin Hilton .
“ I think if he had continued , he would have killed someone . ”
Wendy Cohen knows the price of being one victim too late .
Her daughter Lacy Miller , 20 , was abducted , sexually assaulted and murdered in January 2003 .
Police believe Jason Clausen used a flashing hazard light to waylay Miller as she drove home in Fort Collins , Colo . , late one night .
“ If he had n’t had the lights , she ’d still be here because he could n’t have pulled her over , ” says Cohen .
Authorities say that in the two weeks before Miller ’s murder , Clausen , 25 , who had tried and failed to become a real sheriff ’s deputy , had twice faked being a cop .
In one instance he had used his police - style lights to pull a woman over but had fled when she asked for identification .
In another he was caught masquerading as an officer near a motel that had been robbed .
( Clausen pleaded guilty to first - degree murder and was sentenced to life without parole . )
“ He had the police paraphernalia — a badge , guns and the red lights , ” says Larimer County Sheriff Jim Alderden .
“ Maybe Lacy ’s murder would have been preventable had a tougher law been on the books . ”
Seeking to close that loophole , Cohen started a petition drive that in 2004 helped to form a new set of statutes , known popularly as Lacy ’s Law , that have significantly strengthened the sanctions against fake cops .
Whereas using police - type lights without proper authority was formerly only a traffic infraction , it is now a criminal matter .
And anyone caught breaking the law , even trespassing , while pretending to be a police officer can now be charged with a felony .
But Southerland believes that perhaps the best defense is even greater wariness ( see box , page 66 ) .
“ Women especially should not stop their cars , let alone get out of them , when they are not absolutely certain the person flagging them down is a police officer , ” she says .
“ This opened my eyes to a lot of things .
I thought I was a careful person . ”

PITTSBURGH -- Yanni is forcing the Washington Capitals and Pittsburgh Penguins to play two playoff games in as many nights , and Capitals owner Ted Leonsis does n't like it .
Three events in eight days at Mellon Arena required the NHL to schedule the Capitals and Penguins to play Game 4 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series in Pittsburgh on Friday night and Game 5 at the Verizon Center in Washington on Saturday .
" You do n't want to play back - to - back , " Capitals general manager George McPhee said .
" Neither team wanted it . "
The teams are playing every other day during the series except for the back - to - back games .
Normally , the teams would have played Friday in Pittsburgh , Sunday in Washington and Tuesday [ if necessary ] in Pittsburgh , but the concert conflict ruled out Tuesday .
Instead , Game 6 would be played Monday night in Pittsburgh , the third game between the teams in four days .
A WWE wrestling event this past Tuesday and a Dane Cook show on Thursday in Pittsburgh also factored into the NHL schedule .
" It is a shame that both teams will have to play back to back games ... because the Pittsburgh building -- against NHL rules -- booked a series of concerts and forced the league to alter the playoff schedule , " Leonsis wrote recently on his blog , Ted 's Take .
" This is bad for the league , both fan bases and for the players .
" The playoffs are very intense and physical and players need time to recoup .
No one is advantaged by playing back to back games so no one can complain but it is unfortunate that the Yanni concert takes precedence over high quality NHL playoff hockey . "
The Penguins did not immediately respond to Leonsis ' comments .
" We saw the schedule , " Penguins captain Sidney Crosby said Friday .
" That 's the way it is . "
Leonsis has a reason to dislike playing two games in two days .
Last season , the Capitals played on successive days in their first - round series against Philadelphia and lost Game 7 in Washington , 3 - 2 in overtime , a day after winning Game 6 on the road .
There have been no other back - to - back games so far in the first two rounds of the NHL playoffs , although they have occurred fairly regularly in past years .
Last season , teams played on back - to - back nights five times .
The Penguins ' Max Talbot said he did n't think it was a big deal .
" Whatever teams wins [ Game 4 ] will have the momentum going into Game 5 , which is good , " he said .
" I like it . "
According to NBC's
Web site , the first two games of the Stanley Cup finals are scheduled for Friday , June 5 and Saturday , June 6 , although -- unlike the Capitals - Penguins games -- they would be played in the same city .

All smokers have one thing in common .
All of them want to stop , but they can ’t .
There are countless methods to stop smoking , but most of you will avoid them or fail after a short period of time .
But , there is one method that actually works .
First of all , why smokers smoke ?
The answer is simple .
They smoke because they cannot stop .
Teenagers start to smoke due to simple reasons as well .
Boys want to look tough like macho men and women want to look like ladies .
In essence , both of them want to look older , and a cigarette looks just right for that application .
Ask any smoker you want , would he or she recommend to a child to smoke and the answer will be the same , no !
As such , smoking is an addiction which must be prevented or stopped .
How you can stop smoking today
The main thing to know is that quit smoking is extremely easy .
First , you must be relaxed while doing so .
For example , a Sydney mobile massage can help you get relaxed before you actually start the process .
Never try to stop while under stress , or it will have a negative effect .
The next main thing is to realize that smoking does n’t have any advantages .
You wo n’t look tough , you do n’t enjoy a cigarette and it does n’t relax you .
As a matter of fact , cigarettes will make you nervous and feel south .
Now when you now that smoking does n’t give you anything , choose time and date when you will finally stop smoking .
Put out the last cigarette and say that it was your last one .
Immediately you will feel happy and you wo n’t think about cigarettes anymore .
This is a great time due to the fact you have just become a non-smoker !
Now , you will have to stay a non-smoker .
Do not avoid other smokers , never carry cigarettes with you nor try to feel the smoke of the smokers .
In addition , do not use substitutes either .
There is no need of that because you do not smoke .
Also , do not look at smokers like they have something they have and you want .
They actually want something you already have .
They want to quit smoking .
Summary
In simple words , cigarettes do not give you anything , but they take everything from you .
As soon as you stop smoking , you will see the world as it actually looks like .
It is a much better place than when you are a smoker .
An offshoot of The Daily Show ( 1996 ) , The Colbert Report ( the Ts in Colbert and in Report are silent ) is a parody of shows like " The O'Reilly Factor " .
Colbert begins the show with teasers about the show 's content and then the credits go by , with a giant eagle and the stars and stripes featured predominantly .
Colbert will pepper commentaries with phrases like , " Look , I do n't have time to read books " , or , " President Bush is n't a head thinker , he 's a gut thinker . "
Aspects of talking head programs are exaggerated and Colbert presents a host overwhelmed by his own importance .
Guests do not walk on - stage but are seated at a small table to the side .
Colbert runs over to them , encouraging the audience to applaud and high five him as he passes .
He is then likely to begin an interview by asking a guest something like , " Explain evolution in twenty seconds " , or " Is n't everyone who disagrees with the President guilty of treason ? "
Colbert is also very clear about our number one threat , " Bears " .

Our Joe Weisenthal warned you and now New York Times media columnist David Carr is catching on : Washington is inching closer to a newspaper bailout of some sort .
First Senator John Kerry hosted a hearing on the " Future Of Journalism . "
Then , ending his keynote at the annual White House correspondents dinner last weekend , President Obama said " a government without newspapers , a government without a tough and vibrant media of all sorts is not an option for the United States of America . ”
Ack !
We 're not about to stock up on our supply of Lipton 's or anything , but a newspaper bailout of any sort is a completely terrible idea .
The reasons should be obvious , but just in case , here are a few of the easiest - to - remember reasons you can use on your hidebound , nostalgic friends :
Hello !
Newspapers are outdated businesses based on outdated tech .
How outdated ?
Printing the New York Times costs twice as much as it would for the paper to send every subscriber a free Amazon Kindle .
Despite that , the New York Times still prints away because it makes most of its profits from the physical paper because it can tell advertisers people read page C8 without having to show proof .
On their own , newspapers have shown no ability to move online or develop sustainable post - monopoly businesses .
Why should the government tip the competitive balance against media outlets -- yes , such as this one -- that are actually innovating new ways to spread news and show ads ?
Newspapers hurt the environment .
The more newspapers die , the less trees have to .
Also , newspaper delivery trucks do n't exactly run on carbon - free cold fusion .
Just because newspapers go away does n't means sources will .
Watergate broke because an FBI agent , aka Deep Throat , did n't like the way Nixon politicized the FBI -- not because Woodward and Bernstein sleuthed it out .
Source will always find the biggest megaphone they can to get their views out .
Newspapers are n't close to too big to fail .
Reflections of a Newsosaur writes that newspapers " collectively employ a mere 0.2 percent of the nation ’s labor force and generate only 0.36 percent of the gross national product . "
Tiny !
Bonus arguments , in case your " friends " remain unconvinced :
In mid-April 2009 , a lower court dismissed a District Court of Manhattan case , in part because the plaintiff ’s argument against Columbia University ’s Women ’s Studies Department rested on grounds that were nonsensical .
The view , the court said , that “ feminism is a religion , ” is obviously wrong .
As the Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of the District Court of Manhattan reportedly stated :
Although the Magistrate Judge did not reach the merits , it bears noting that plaintiffs ’ central claim is that feminism is a religion and that alleged federal and state approval of or aid to Columbia ’s Institute for Research on Women and Gender therefore constitute a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment .
Feminism is no more a religion than physics , and at least the core of the complaint therefore is frivolous .
As reported in the Chronicle of Higher Education :
Mr. Den Hollander ’s lawsuit argued that Columbia ’s program in women ’s studies taught feminism that amounted to a religion for a host of reasons , including its promotion of various lifestyle decisions , as well as beliefs “ based on the teachings of certain prophet - like individuals , such as Betty Friedan . ”
Such feminism is irrational , the lawsuit said , because it “ propagates the belief that females are divine princesses and men are minions of Satan , a proposition for which there is no proof , only faith . ”
Headlined in varying ways ( from “ Roy Den Hollander ’s War on Feminism ” to “ Lone Fighter of Bigotry Against Men ” ) , reports of the decision are eliciting a wide range of comments .
Remarks about the stupidity of the plaintiff ’s argument on one hand ; and about Women ’s Studies as ideological nonsense on the other .
Arguments for and against Men ’s Studies on one hand ( yes , there is a pro-feminist Men ’s Studies institutionalized at some institutions ) ; and for and against renaming Women ’s Studies “ Gender Studies ” ( and for the view that the case is prima facie evidence for the ongoing need for Women ’s Studies and / or Feminist Studies per se ) on the other hand .
What the debate seems to be less interested in is argumentation about religion itself , yet this is key .
And this is especially so when what renders the “ core of the complaint … frivolous ” lies there .
What is Religion , Anyway ?
Of course , not all definitions of religion are “ legal definitions . ”
What is troubling , of course , is that all definitions of religion can be marshaled in legal argumentation , both frivolous and otherwise .
Expert witness testimony — in person , or through decontextualized citation of scholarly works — abounds .
Feminist critique of marriage , for example , has been quoted in court cases seeking marriage equality by those opposed to same - sex marriage .
We are not in control of how our words will be used .
Indeed , ordinary language remarks become part of argumentation whether scholarly or legal ; “ He was very religious about golf , ” for example , became a part of anthropologist Clifford Geertz ’s well known and influential definitional strategy in The Interpretation of Cultures .
And certainly , Bruce Lincoln ’s definition of religion in his work Holy Terrors rejects the idea that astrophysics is religion ( on the grounds of the absence of a notion of transcendence ) ; might Judge Kaplan have drawn on those arguments ?
Of course , Judge Kaplan did not , but he might have cited either point ; or litigators might have drawn on these views .
What is scary is that many definitions of religion offered in the scholarly realm could indeed include feminism ; insofar as it meets some of the functions of religion .
The breadth of functional definitions allows scholars to focus on the ways , say , Marxism or psychoanalysis might serve as religions in 20th - and 21st - century culture .
While some scholars ( Peter Berger is an example , in his 1969 appendix to The Sacred Canopy , as is Melford Spiro ) argue against such functional definitions , others find them useful in classrooms and scholarly argumentation .
Is sports a religion , some ask ?
( Yes , some answer , baseball is .
Or NASCAR . )
What are quasi-religions ?
Pseudo - religions ?
Answers to questions about what counts as “ a religion ” or “ religion ” or even “ religious ” abound .
As early as 1912 , James Leuba was able to catalog 48 different definitions of religion ; doubtless one could list many more today .
Given this range of possibilities , what definition of religion should we adopt ?
In trying to decide , we are both chastened and comforted by the words of sociologist Milton Yinger : “ Any definition of religion is likely to be satisfactory only to its author . ” *
And yet , definitions of religion matter .
And not just for theorists in colleges and universities across the globe .
Not just for ministers and rabbis and imams and religious functionaries of various sorts .
Not just for those who are asked what exactly they mean when they utter the now banal phrase “ I ’m spiritual , but not religious . ”
What the word denotes matters to the Internal Revenue Service , for example .
And , it matters to the courts that have sought ( and continue to seek ) to ensure that the United States remains true to relevant Constitutional matters , most especially those of the First Amendment ( both the disestablishment and the freedom of religion ) .
Why ?
Here ’s the text of the First Amendment :
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances .
Yes , what the word “ religion ” means in this context matters .
The phrase “ in this context ” is crucial .
That there are very real consequences of definitions ( themselves social products ) is why the word “ matters ” — sometimes definitions have material consequences .
Legal definitions of religion , like many legal matters , are clarified across time in case law .
Over the past several decades , the Supreme Court has addressed itself to the question of what religion “ is ” a number of times .
Decades ago , the Supreme Court determined what the characteristics of religion were that would allow conscientious objectors to stand on the grounds of religion ; in its ruling , the Court moved away from requiring institutional participation or allegiance to theism , for example , and instead emphasized a sincerity of belief and an impact on the believer ’s life “ comparable with or parallel to ” beliefs in God .
More recently , the Supreme Court has considered whether “ secular humanism ” is , or is not , a religion .
( For a discussion of the various relevant case law see here , and for an analysis of the international relevance of this topic , see here and here . )
The plaintiff in the recently dismissed case was making a specious case rooted in a frivolous legal argument .
His views are repugnant .
Yet , in raising the issue once again of what religion is , he served an important role .
While frivolous and meanspirited , his spewing reminds us that the contest is not done .
We remain a nation where not all are convinced by the simple argument that women , too , are fully human and that we , like men , are the legitimate topic of academic inquiry .
We remain a nation where it does matter how we define religion .
Critical engagement with the various contexts within which we ( especially in Western culture but increasingly globally ) have struggled to understand religion , both as phenomenon and as a category , is as crucial to the our world as Women ’s Studies ( and feminist work more generally ) .

Although the U.S. is not in imminent danger of attack from any country , President Obama ’s first budget further expands the Pentagon ’s already dominant global operations .
Not even the prospect of a $ 3.1 trillion combined budget deficit for this year and next deters him .
Let them chop the budget for black colleges and police officer death benefits , the Pentagon and its contractors continue to feast at the champagne - and - caviar table .
It ’s not as though for eight years the Bush Pentagon had n’t nearly outspent the rest of the world combined on designing deadlier weapons and employing them in illegal wars .
Obama ’s new $ 664 billion Pentagon budget is $ 21 billion higher ( four percent ) than the final Bush budget .
It includes $ 65 billion for Afghanistan and $ 61 billion for Iraq .
Why ?
Well , here ’s what Defense Secy .
Robert Gates told the Naval War College April 17th : “ The U.S. must not take its current dominance for granted …its battle fleet , by one estimate , is still larger than the next 13 navies combined --- and 11 of those 13 navies are U.S. allies or partners . ”
( Get that ?
“ Larger than the next 13 navies combined . ”
What ’s more , nearly every world power is our buddy .
So where ’s the urgent need to spend billions on expansion ?
And notice his use of the word “ dominance . ” )
Gates went on to boast , “ In terms of capabilities , the over - match is even greater .
No country in the rest of the world has anything close to the reach and firepower to match a carrier strike group .
And the U.S. has and will maintain 11 at least until 2040 . ”
Gates seeks an incredible 2,400 new Joint Strike Fighter planes when the U.S. already is undisputed master of the skies .
Think of that : 2,400 warplanes in the absence of an enemy !
At 100 million bucks a pop , that air armada will cost taxpayers over $ 240 billion .
As Sheldon Filger wrote in the May 16 Huffington Post of the Pentagon ’s fiscal 2009 outlay : “ This stratospheric expendure is equivalent to the combined totals for the next 25 largest military budgets on the planet . ”

SAN FRANCISCO  Millions of Americans have trimmed expenses because they have had their jobs or hours cut , or fear they will .
But a subset of savers are reducing costs not just with purpose , but with relish .
These are the gleefully frugal .
“ I ’m enjoying this , ” said Becky Martin , 52 , who has cut up her 10 credit cards , borrows movies from the library instead of renting them , and grows her own fruits and vegetables  even though her family is comfortable .
Ms. Martin is a real estate investor , her husband is a plastic surgeon , and their home sits on the 12th hole of a Cincinnati country club .
“ It ’s a chance to pass along the frugal lifestyle that my mother gave to me , ” she says , noting that her sensibilities seem to be rubbing off not just on her sons , but also on her husband .
“ We ’re on the same page financially for the first time in years , and it ’s fabulous . ”

Mathematicians crack the Kervaire invariant problem .
Doughnuts and coffee cups — topologically equivalent ?
Thinkstock
A team of three has solved a 45 - year - old problem in the mathematics of topology .
The Kervaire invariant problem is " one of the major outstanding problems in algebraic and geometric topology " says fellow mathematician Nick Kuhn , at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville .
" Most people thought it would never be solved in their lifetime , " adds Mark Hovey , an algebraic topologist at Wesleyan University in Middletown , Connecticut .
" Many people have thought they 've solved it but have been wrong . "
" The solution to this problem seems to indicate new and deep connections between topology on the one hand and algebra and number theory on the other , " says mathematician Allen Hatcher of Cornell University in Ithaca , New York .
" The exploration of these new connections will enrich the subject for years to come . "
Although it looks at face value to be extremely abstruse , the mathematics involved in the solution might be relevant to quantum theory and string theory , not to mention brane theory , which has been invoked to explore some issues in Big Bang cosmology .
Topological teaser
Mike Hopkins of Harvard University , Douglas Ravenel of the University of Rochester in New York and Mike Hill of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville announced their solution to the problem at a conference in Edinburgh , UK , on 21 April .
“ Many people have thought they 've solved it but have been wrong . ”

Algebraic topology is a way of describing the properties that objects with the same topology have in common .
Topologically equivalent objects are objects that can be converted into each other by deforming but not tearing them : a sphere and an eggshell , for example , or a doughnut and a coffee cup .
Such objects might be curves , surfaces or higher - dimensional entities , collectively called manifolds .
Algebraic topology classifies them according to certain invariant quantities related to their geometry .
It is " about a relationship between numbers and shapes " , says Hopkins .
In 1960 French mathematician Michel Kervaire identified such an invariant for smooth manifolds of dimension n .
This Kervaire invariant was in general equal to zero .
But it quickly became clear that manifolds with a Kervaire invariant equal to 1 exist in dimensions 2 , 6 and 14 , and examples for dimensions 30 and 62 were found within a few years .
These numbers share the characteristic that they are all equal to a power of 2 minus 2 ( for example , 30 = 25 –2 ) .
In 1969 , Princeton mathematician William Browder showed that there can be no manifolds with non-zero Kervaire invariants outside these special dimensions .
But what mathematicians really wanted was a general proof of whether the invariant was equal to 1 or 0 for all such values of n .
Brane science
This is what Hopkins and his colleagues have now found — and they say that the Kervaire invariant is always zero for all n greater than 126 .
That is in line with what mathematicians intuitively expected .
The case of 126 itself is still ambiguous .
The maths used for this solution has been developed by Hopkins , who Hovey calls " clearly the leading algebraic topologist of the day " , and others .
" The work is based on new conceptual ideas , " says Hovey , who adds , " I 'm very confident it is correct . "
ADVERTISEMENT
" In some respects the solution of the Kervaire invariant problem is like the proof of Fermat 's last theorem in the 1990s , " says Hatcher .
" The importance lies with the new tools , techniques and insights that were developed to get the solution . "
Because the new approach involves looking at topological problems of a manifold from the perspective of a space that has one more dimension , it is analogous to the use of one - dimensional strings as the basis of zero- dimensional ( point - like ) fundamental particles .
Similarly , it has become popular for cosmologists to study the behaviour of space - time from the perspective of higher - dimensional ' branes ' that interact with one another .
This is why studying the Kervaire invariant problem might offer useful mathematical techniques to fundamental physics .

A team of physicists and engineers have demonstrated all - fibre quantum logic , where single photons are generated and used to perform the controlled - NOT quantum logic gate in optical fibres with high fidelity .
The only quantum technology in practical use today is quantum cryptography and is currently limited in the distance over which secure communication may occur .
More sophisticated quantum networks will require multiple nodes with the ability to implement small - scale quantum processing in order to increase the range of quantum communications .
Such networks will rely on optical fibre links , making fibre - based photon generation and information processing of key technological importance .
Jeremy O'Brien , Professor of Physics and Electrical Engineering at Bristol University and colleagues , have shown it is possible for a high - fidelity fibre controlled - NOT gate to operate with fibre heralded single - photon sources .
Professor O'Brien speaking about the research , said : " On the basis of a simple model we are able to conclude that imperfections are primarily due to the photon sources , meaning that the gate itself works with very high fidelity . "
" Such all fibre quantum information processing will likely have important applications in future quantum networks . "
All - fibre quantum information processing could be used in less mature quantum technologies such as computing , communication and advanced measurement , as well as in the fundamental science of quantum optics .

There ’s been a debate going on for a few years about whether the big rise in income inequality in the U.S. over the past three decades has been at least partly a political phenomenon or purely an economic one .
The first camp , whose members include political scientist Larry Bartels and economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez ( pdf ) , argues that decisions about taxing and government spending made since the early 1980s have increased the disparity of incomes .
The second , which consists of the vast majority of economists who study such things ( although more have been drifting toward the Bartels - Piketty - Saez camp in recent years ) , contends that globalization and technological advance have increased the rewards to the most skilled and reduced pay for those whose work can be done by machines or lower - paid workers overseas .
Since globalization and technological advance are good things , the increase in inequality thus is n’t really something we ’d want to stop .
Well now , after looking at the data about the country ’s 400 highest earners and reading the comments by pneogy and shepherdwong , I am ready to offer an important new theory ( well , not entirely new ) :
The rise in income inequality over the past 30 years has to a significant extent been the product of a series of asset - price bubbles .
Whenever the market ( be it the market in stocks , junk bonds , real estate , whatever ) booms , the share of income going to those at the very top increases .
When the boom goes bust , that share drops somewhat , but then it comes roaring back even higher with the next asset bubble .
It ’s not the same people raking it in every time — there ’s lots of turnover in the top 400 — but skimming the top off of asset bubbles appears to have become the leading way to get rich in these United States in the past three decades .
These asset bubbles were n’t pure bubbles .
Prices always began rising for some real economic reason , then got out of hand .
So in this accounting , the rise in income inequality would be partly based on economic fundamentals , partly on financial market excess .
Which brings to mind UCLA finance professor Richard Roll ’s famous ( among the cognoscenti , which you will join if you read The Myth of the Rational Market , which goes on sale June 9 ) 1987 presidential address to the American Finance Association ( pdf ) .
Roll looked at stock market movements from 1982 to 1987 and tried to account for them using economic data , industry data and company - specific news .
Those factors explained less than 40 % of the movements , leading Roll to surmise that either there was lots of private data out there moving markets that he had n’t been able to get his hands on , or many stock market fluctuations were irrational .
“ It would be nice , ” he wrote , “ to have a method for detecting the difference . ”

This is from 16 April and as far as I know there 's no mention of this in the English press , so I 'll sum up part of the article .
You can also see it automatically translated by Google here .
Bergen is Norway 's second - largest city and looks cute as a button .
If you 've ever wanted to move to Norway to work in the IT or other sector but are intimidated by the thought of living in another language , do n't worry ; Norwegian is easier than you might think .
The consulting company Avenir will create a test laboratory for open and free software in Bergen .
The idea is that the large IT environment in the rainy city will experiment with open source and free software , in order to be ahead when the time comes to exploit this type of technology .
The City of Bergen , Bergen University College ( HiB ) , University of Bergen ( UiB ) , Dnb NOR ( Norway 's largest financial services group ) , NextGenTel and EDB Business Partner are some of those that will play a role in the laboratory , to find solutions that can later be sold .
The environment will establish a separate " community " that will have access to a virtual version of the lab via the internet and their results will be made public so that others can learn from their experiences .
The Director in Avenir Bergen Tor -Erik Stakset said that Gartner predicts that 80 percent of all IT solutions will be based on open source by 2012 .
" Portions of this technology are so well - developed that in many areas it surpasses the traditional suppliers ' products in performance , usability and customization features , " said Stakset .
The City of Bergen will be a participant , and is looking forward to the collaboration .
" Use of free software can in some cases contribute to increased cooperation and recirculation of solutions across the civic and public sector .
Taking part in an " open - source lab " is a measure that could contribute to this , " said Lars Tveit , director for competition and development in the city , in a press release .
The goal is to develop cost - effective and reliable solutions for users .
Various options will be studied and tested in Avenir 's new laboratory in Bryggen in Bergen .
This is an innovation where customers , users and suppliers can tailor and test out new solutions together based on their existing IT systems .
The laboratory will be self - operating , available via the internet and free to use .
A portal will also be established where the results of the tests are published publicly , in addition to a separate group that want to exchange their knowledge .
Another article here on the same subject has some more info :
The press release ( also in Norwegian ) by the company can be seen here ( automatically translated here ) .
This embracing open source is nothing new for Bergen : here 's an article from 2004 on city authorities replacing core Windows and Unix systems with Linux , and here 's something from 2003 on a similar theme but involving the university there .
Arisman is said to be co-operating with the authorities
Thai police have arrested the leader of the protests which forced the cancellation of a major Asian summit .
Arisman Pongruengrong was detained as Thai PM Abhisit Vejjajiva vowed to prosecute the protesters whose campaign he said had tipped into illegality .
Later , the government declared a state of emergency across Bangkok and the surrounding areas , state TV reported .
On Saturday demonstrators calling for his resignation stormed the summit venue in the seaside resort of Pattaya .
Mr Arisman , who spearheaded the protests by supporters of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra , was arrested after returning to his home in Bangkok on Sunday .
He was charged with inciting protesters to kidnap the prime minister and cause unrest , police said .
A police spokesman said he was co-operating with the authorities .
" There will be further arrests , but right now the police are gathering evidence , " the spokesman added .
We will continue to protest in Bangkok until Abhisit resigns
Jakrapob Penkair
Opposition leader
Fiasco deepens
Thai stalemate Correspondents say the storming of the Pattaya conference centre was deeply embarrassing for Mr Abhisit .
There was little resistance from the security forces .
The tactics of the pro-Thaksin activists mirror those of their royalist rivals last year : they too paralysed government activity by targeting key venues .
The BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok says there is no question the pro-Thaksin protesters broke the law .
But , our correspondent adds , the problem is that Mr Abhisit rode to power on the back of protests that were just as illegal , and the PM may look hypocritical if he only goes after the red- shirted protesters who embarrassed him .
' We have won ' " The next three to four days will be crucial for the government to prove itself in restoring peace and order in the country , " Mr Abhisit said on TV on Sunday .
Abhisit Vejjajiva has suffered a major embarrassment " The government will take action against those who were involved in the incident yesterday without bias . "
Another protest leader , Jakrapob Penkair , said in Bangkok that the movement against Mr Abhisit had won a victory .
" We have won , we have stopped them from holding a summit , " he said .
" But we have not achieved our goal yet .
We will continue to protest in Bangkok until Abhisit resigns . "
Pre-summit street protests in the capital this week drew up to 100,000 people .
Mr Thaksin himself , who remains in self - imposed exile to avoid a two - year jail term for corruption , has welcomed the protest in Pattaya .
" I thank the Red Shirts in Pattaya who showed strength , " he told a rally of supporters in Bangkok by telephone late on Saturday .
" In the next few days we will see real change . "
Officials say months of turmoil have lost the country $ 6bn in tourist revenue , just as the economy is taking a hit from collapsing exports .

The Supreme Court overturned a long - standing ruling that stops police from initiating questions unless a defendant 's lawyer is present , a move that will make it easier for prosecutors to interrogate suspects .
The high court , in a 5 - 4 ruling , overturned the 1986 Michigan v. Jackson ruling , which said police may not initiate questioning of a defendant who has a lawyer or has asked for one unless the attorney is present .

Astonishing :
“ Brooksley Born , the former U.S. commodities regulator who lost the fight to police over - the- counter derivatives a decade ago , said the banks that caused the financial crisis are trying to stop the overhaul of the market .
“ Special interests in the financial - services industry are beginning to advocate a return to business as usual and to argue against any need for serious reform , ” Born said today as she accepted a Profile in Courage award from the John F. Kennedy Library .
If changes are n’t made “ we will be haunted by our failure for years to come , ” she said .
As the chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 1998 , Born warned that the unregulated contracts posed a serious danger to the global financial system and moved to address changes in how swaps based on interest rates , commodities or currencies were traded .
She was stopped by Alan Greenspan , Arthur Levitt and Robert Rubin , who all argued the market could regulate itself .
Lax oversight contributed to the failures last year of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and American International Group Inc. , leading to the seizure of credit markets and causing more than $ 1.4 trillion in writedowns amid the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has promised that the U.S. will for the first time regulate over - the - counter derivatives , which are a major source of bank profits . ”
True or false :
“ Pregnant women never commit suicide , they just do n’t do it because it ’s against human nature ”
This is what experts declared to a murder trial jury in 1993 after the death of an 38 weeks pregnant woman .
Because of this declaration , Eddy Gifoyle , who found his wife hanging in the garage is serving a life sentence for the murder of his pregnant wife .

Amazing that this actually happened in the UK , the cradle off perinatal psychiatry …
Only 10 years later the article : suicide : the major cause of maternal death was published by Margeret Oates in the British Journal of Psychiatry .
More pregnant and postpartum mothers die because of suicide than die from infection , high blood pressure and hemorrhage combined .
Furthermore depressive and anxiety states are very common during pregnancy .
In Rotterdam we do have a large in and outpatients clinic to treat all these perinatal conditions .
Untreated depression and anxiety during pregnancy is not only harmful for the mother but also for the unborn child ( it ’s the potential next generation of patients suffering from psychiatric disorders ) .

Amid so much other news , a Senate vote last week to allow loaded guns in national parks slipped under the media radar .
The vote shows how the political cause of gun control is as dead as a mounted moose .
By 67 - 29 , the Senate passed Oklahoma Republican Tom Coburn 's amendment to let law - abiding visitors carry legal firearms into national parks .
This overturns a 1983 federal rule requiring that firearms be kept unloaded and in an inaccessible place such as a trunk of a car .

What 's the Deal with Google 's Delayed Competitions ?
Added by viorel on May 27 , 2009 | Visited by 5722 | Voted by 26 persons
Two competitions of the number one search engine have been delayed without any acknowledgement of the reasons explaining the hold - up .
Does it have something to do with the brain drain that Google currently faces and attempts to take measures for preventing it or is there a problem with the \ " department of ideas\ " ?
One of the recent major problems that affected millions of Google users worldwide was the crash of Google\ 's service .
During the same period the company \'s major competitions started fading away .
It might be that the Internet giant spends a lot of time taking over the world instead of managing its projects and keeping its promise .
It is worth mentioning that the two major contests had the goal of exploring the wisdom of users around the globe .
By mixing the ideas of the crowd with its advanced technology , Google wanted to develop something totally new , but it seems that things went the wrong path and got lost .
First
The first project was dubbed Project 10 to the 100th , which was created to motivate people to provide ideas that , according to the company \'s blog , would have the power to \" change the world by helping as many people as possible . \ "
This competition was set back in September 2008 .
It also aimed to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Google .
According to the rules of the competition , the semifinalists of the project should have been announced at the end of January 2009 .
Initially the company \'s idea was to engage the public and make the project as popular as possible .
Afterwards the goal was to narrow the number of the semifinalists down to a maximum of 5 and in the end give away $ 10 million to the most creative and productive ideas .
At first someone might think that $ 10 million would go to one winner , but the truth is that the money would have been distributed among the finalists .
The official website of the project says that Google staff continues examining over 150,000 entries that users from five continents have sent .
Taneem Talukdar , a systems design engineer , mentioned that the contest is overdue and that \ " There \'s been some grumbling . \ "
Second
The difference between the previous competition and the second one ( that is to be described below ) lies in the level of ambition , with the second project being somewhat less go - getting .
It was named the Android Developer Challenge .
The competition engages participants to send their application for the open - source mobile platform Android , developed by Google .
In summer and spring of 2008 the Mountain View company hosted a similar contest .
Google awarded the 20 winners of the competition with $ 5 million in prizes .
During the same time period Google announced that it was looking forward to set up another contest , the winners of which would be granted another $ 5 million .
The starting point of the competition was expected to be somewhere \ " after the second half of 2008 \ " .
But up till now Google hesitated to launch the competition , which discouraged a number of developers .
After all of the above mentioned , Google says it knows of the discontent .
On its blog , Google\ 's workers wrote about the problems linked with the delay of the competitions .
The company \'s spokespeople stated that the two contests that started last year were on hold .
According to Jamie Yood , one of Google\ 's spokespeople , the Internet giant had \ " over - optimistic assumptions \ " regarding its Project 10 to the 100th .
\ " We\ 've never managed a project like this and it \'s taken more time than we ever imagined possible , \ " said Yood in an e-mail .
Still the company did not give any details explaining the reason for the delay of the Android developer competition .
Possible Reasons
A lot of suppositions have been posted online by users .
Some of them consider that the reason lies in the fact that Google is short of funding , others believe that staffing has something to do with the problem .
A number of users assume that the delay is linked with legal issues regarding the necessity to translate entries from a variety of languages ( since the competition was international ) .
There was even strong criticism about the delays .
\ " Something so [ sic ] important as saving the world should not be done in a rush , \ " wrote in a comment one of the users frustrated with the problems around Google\ 's contests .
Some believe that Project 10 to the 100th is nothing but a marketing trick .
There \'s even a presumption that the work is taken over by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .
CENTRAL FALLS , Rhode Island ( CNN ) --
A no-frills bar called Goober 's , just north of Providence , Rhode Island , is probably the last place you 'd expect to find a debate over cutting - edge addiction therapy .
But this is where Walter Kent , a retired mechanic , spends his Fridays .
He helps in the kitchen and hangs out in the bar , catching up with old friends .
Walter Kent talks to Dr. Sanjay Gupta about how the drug naltrexone has helped keep him sober .
Most addiction specialists would call this playing with fire , or worse .
That 's because for more than 30 years , Kent was a hard - core alcoholic .
His drinks of choice were Heineken beer and Jacob Ginger brandy , but anything with alcohol would do .
" It 's like a little kid wanting a piece of candy .
You see it , you want the taste of it . "
He closes his eyes and sniffs the air , remembering the feeling .
" You can be by yourself , and all of a sudden get even a hint of alcohol , just the smell of it , and say , ' Oh , I need a drink . '
That sensation is not something you can get rid of . "
But today , Kent is n't tempted in the least .
He says the credit goes to a prescription medication -- a pill called naltrexone .
It 's part of a new generation of anti-addiction drugs that may turn the world of rehab on its head .
Dr. Mark Willenbring , who oversees scientific research at the National Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse , says alcoholism has reached a point similar to one depression reached 30 years ago -- when the development of Prozac and other antidepressants took mental health care out of the asylum and put it in homes and doctors ' offices .
" There will be a ' Prozac moment , ' " Willenbring says , " when primary care doctors start handling functional alcoholics . "
Watch Dr. Gupta :
Are you an alcoholic quiz »
Among the findings that are causing excitement :
' Addiction : Life on the Edge ' Dr. Sanjay Gupta follows a mother , a writer , a student and a husband .
Each is an addict on a journey through recovery and relapse .
Sat & Sun , 8 p.m. ET on CNN see full schedule »
• A study led by Dr. Bankole Johnson of the University of Virginia found that topiramate ( Topamax ) -- already used to treat epilepsy and migraines -- reduced the number of days on which alcoholics drank heavily , by 25 percent more than among alcoholics who got just therapy .
• A federally funded study known as COMBINE compared cognitive - behavioral therapy alone with therapy along with naltrexone .
Patients receiving both were more likely to stay abstinent and drank less if they did relapse .
These findings highlight what 's become increasingly clear : Addiction is a brain disease , not just a failure of willpower .
Naltrexone and topiramate have slightly different mechanisms , but both seem to block the release of brain chemicals that are linked to pleasure and excitement .
Unlike earlier drugs used to treat alcoholics , neither is addictive or carries significant side effects .
It does appear that each might work better in certain subgroups -- topiramate for repeat relapsers , and naltrexone in people with a strong family history of alcoholism .
Interactive : Addiction 's lure to the brain »
Johnson is a paid consultant to the company that makes Topamax , but his study appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association and he says other medications can also work well .
" I think everybody who 's an alcoholic should be given medication if they 're willing to take it , " he says .
" It 's been shown over and over with research studies that effects of medicine are over and above that of therapy .
And if you 're not getting the medicine , it 's a bit like having one hand tied behind your back . "
Before he found naltrexone , Kent had tried to quit drinking more times than he can remember .
" I was the kind of person who only drank if he was alone or with somebody .
Other than that , it was never a problem , " he jokes now .
He did two stints in residential rehab programs and went to countless AA meetings , but nothing worked .
Kent is a giant of a man -- he stands a broad - shouldered 6 feet 5 inches tall , and has two sons who played professional basketball in Israel -- but for most of his life , he could n't find the strength to put down the bottle .
Watch Dr. Gupta :
Can a pill help you go cold turkey ? »
It got worse in 2000 , after an injury from falling off a ladder forced him to stop working .
Depressed and in pain , with time on his hands , Kent began boozing from 8 o'clock in the morning , every morning .
It went on a few months until his wife , a woman he'd known since grammar school , handed him an ad from a newspaper and an ultimatum : " She said , ' You 're killing the marriage , and you 're killing yourself , ' " Kent said . " '
Get help or I 'm gone . ' "
The ad was recruiting alcoholics for research at Roger Williams Hospital , part of Brown University .
Kent signed up .
It was part of the COMBINE study .
Kent got 16 weekly visits and also something most addicts never hear about : medication .
This time , he stayed sober , even after his doctor took him off naltrexone .
That was more than eight years ago .
Watch Walter Kent talk about his struggle with alcohol »
Despite studies showing effectiveness , established rehab programs have been slow to adopt the use of medication .
At Hazelden in Minneapolis , Minnesota , a small proportion of patients receive anti-addiction drugs , but medical director Dr. Kevin Clark says the traditional model -- based on intensive therapy and the 12 steps popularized by Alcoholics Anonymous -- is still best .
" It is a disease of the brain , but it 's a multifaceted disease .
It has a spiritual component , a behavioral component to it , " says Clark .
" Our experience tells us that having the network of support and recovery is what really makes the difference . "
John Schwarzlose , executive director of the Betty Ford Center , echoes that but takes a more stringent approach .
No patients at Betty Ford receive anti-addiction drugs as part of treatment , although a handful of long - time addicts may be referred to a prescribing physician once their stay is over .
" Where we battle with [ the National Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse ] is when they say we have trials of a new drug , and then proclaim this is a treatment for alcoholism , " says Schwarzlose .
" They 're smart people , but they 're missing how complex this disease is . "
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Addiction
Schwarzlose argues that Willenbring and Johnson are using the wrong measure of success .
He says abstinence is the only true measuring stick -- that an alcoholic who is drinking less is just at a way station on the road to relapse .
" Naltrexone has reduced drinking , but once you 're addicted , there is no such thing as ' OK ' drinking .
This is one of those cases where there 's a real schism between the research and actual practice . "
This attitude frustrates Willenbring , who estimates that in the United States only one addict in 10 has even heard about medication options .
" In most cases , the treatment is entirely nonmedical .
Most people are not even told about the medications that are available for treating alcohol dependence , and I think that 's a crime . "
Still , medication is slowly creeping into mainstream addiction therapy .
One big advocate is Percy Menzies , a pharmacist and former sales representative for DuPont , which developed naltrexone .
His St. Louis , Missouri - based Recovery Centers for America treats patients in an on - site hospital , then refers them to outside physicians for follow - up treatment .
Along with therapy , virtually every patient is given Vivitrol , a long - lasting form of naltrexone that 's given monthly by injection .
Kent says naltrexone saved his life .
When the COMBINE program was over , Kent 's doctor told him to call if he felt the old need for a drink coming back .
But it never came .
" I have yet to go back and say , ' I have an urge for a drink , ' " says Kent , lounging in Goober's .
" [ My friends ] will offer , ' You want a drink ? '
And I say , ' No , I 'm fine .
I 'll have a soda . '
I 'm fine with that .
Because when there 's no urge , no craving , it does n't bother me .
I 'm living proof this can happen . "

With the family living in two station wagons , much of Emmanuel ’s childhood was spent touring Australia with his family , playing rhythm guitar , and rarely going to school .
The family found it difficult living on the road ; they were poor and were often hungry , never settling in one place .
His father would often drive ahead , organize interviews , advertising and finding the local music shop where they'd have an impromptu concert the next day .

His doctor told Marvin “ Henchi ” Graves not to be a hero , just a fan .
Graves was aiming to be just that Monday night after a Denver Nuggets fan gave up his suite at the Pepsi Center to allow the 64 - year - old Graves to watch the team take on the Los Angeles Lakers .
The fan , Dan Cook , made his offer after reading about Graves in The Denver Post .
Graves , who has terminal cancer , is one of two lead singers in the Freddi - Henchi R&B Band .
Now living at HospiceCare of Boulder and Broomfield Counties , Graves on Sunday asked that his feeding tube be removed .
He also expressed a simple desire : to see the Nuggets play Game 4 of the Western Conference finals .
Several offers from ticket holders flooded the hospice Monday .
The one that made the most sense was the one offering the suite , said George Stark , a physician at the hospice .
“ He ’ll have a nurse and his partner with him , ” Stark said .
“ This worked for everyone .
“ I told him that he is under no obligation to go or even stay very long .
It was just important to just be able to go . ”
Graves said Monday afternoon he was overwhelmed at the offers for tickets .
“ I really appreciated it , ” he said .
“ This is something . ”
Only a few successful agencies made it through the long selection process to the official meetings at 2012's offices in Canary Wharf , but then discovered that they would need to become a tier - three sponsor at a cost of nearly £ 10 m if they wanted to develop the London 2012 official ad campaign .
Following this revelation two major advertising groups have told The Sunday Telegraph that they are now not interested in pitching for the account , although they refused to be named .
The winning agency is unlikely to have to pay an up - front fee but it will have to agree to do millions of pounds of work in exchange for being named as an official sponsor of the games .
A spokesman for 2012 confirmed that it was looking at getting a marketing services partner " on board " as a tier - three sponsor .
He added that other sponsors had made " value in kind " deals including chewing gum brand Trident , technology group Airwave , Boston Consulting Group and solicitors Freshfields .
Some ad industry sources claim that the marketing benefits of having an agency associated with the Olympics are limited and not sufficient enough to justify the financial commitment .
Say what you like about the Bank of England , in launching its first £ 2bn purchase of government bonds today it is definitely ahead of the curve .
Even the US Federal Reserve , which has been several steps ahead of our central bank for most of this crisis , has yet to press the button on this form of QE .
The Fed has been buying up corporate bonds for several months , but the Chairman , Ben Bernanke has so far resisted calls to buy US government debt .
Does he know something that Mervyn King does n't ?
When asked , Ben Bernanke says he has no ideological objection to buying government debt - he simply thinks that right now , it 's more effective to tackle the corporate credit shortage directly .
There are several reasons the Bank can't follow his lead .
One is simply that the US corporate bond market is much , much bigger relative to the size of the economy than ours is .
If the Bank of England tried to buy £ 75 bn - worth of corporate bonds it would find itself buying up roughly the entire market .
It would then be in the uncomfortable position of being the sole purchaser of the debt of some of Britain 's biggest companies .
( Incidentally , the pool of corporate assets to buy would expand greatly if they could buy up syndicated loans as well .
They may do that some time in the future but that 's not on the cards right now . )
Our central bank is also concerned about taking too much corporate risk onto its balance sheet .
That does n't seem to be much of a worry to the Fed ( though some at Threadneedle Street wonder why not ) .
As I mentioned last week , the danger in taking on too much private sector risk is that you push up the risk premium on government debt , raising borrowing rates for everyone and defeating the whole exercise .
Of course there is the opposite risk , which you might call the price of QE 's success .
What if the policy succeeds - the economy recovers , interest rates go up , bond prices fall and the Bank ends up selling these assets back at a loss ?
In a sense , that is an inherent part of the policy .
It would certainly come as no surprise to Bank officials .
That is why the Bank of England had to obtain an indemnity from the Treasury to make these purchases through a special subsidiary - the Asset Purchase Facility .
Any paper loss on these assets when they are sold back to the market will have to be made good by the Treasury , so there is n't a hole in the Bank of England 's accounts .
But it 's part of the oddity of QE that the loss to the taxpayer , in this case , will also be the taxpayer 's gain .
For who will have benefited more from the initial fall in gilt yields than the government itself ?
Think about it .
For the next three months , the Bank of England 's going to be buying up more medium - term gilts than the government is issuing .
For decency 's sake , the Bank has to wait until the debt has been on the market for all of a week , but the effect is the same .
If those purchases push up the price of gilts , that will make it cheaper for the government to borrow during this period than it would otherwise have been .
That means the debt will cost us taxpayers less .
If and when gilt prices fall again , the Bank of England may have to sell them at a loss .
But that loss is the mirror image of the earlier gain .
You never know , we might even come out ahead .
And we'd no longer be in a recession .
It 's a little Alice in Wonderland perhaps , but that 's the nature of QE .
Algeria is one of the Middle Eastern North African nations that has the scientific and technological capacity to develop nuclear weapons if legal , political and other barriers to nuclear weapons proliferation decline and lose their efficacy .
“ Algeria has the expertise and the means to produce nuclear weapons ” should it decide to do so , said independent researcher Mark Gorwitz , and he added that it might be able to accomplish the task in just a couple of years .
Mr. Gorwitz prepared an updated open source bibliography of Algerian nuclear science and engineering publications , which is posted here ( pdf ) .

Wolfram Alpha is not a search engine .
In a talk at Harvard Law School , Stephen Wolfram , a well - known mathematician , scientist and entrepreneur , gave a demonstration of his soon - to - be released Web service which promises to answer all sorts of questions .
The service , called Wolfram Alpha , had technology bloggers abuzz that a rival to Google was about to hit the Web .
While search engines like Google , by and large , find things that already exist on the Internet —
Web sites , photos , videos , blogs — Wolfram Alpha answers questions , often by doing complex , and new computations .
It ’s hard to judge a product from a demo , but by the looks of it , Wolfram Alpha is impressive .
What can it do ?
It can describe places , like Lexington , Mass. , by its vital statistics , such as location , population , weather , etc .
It can compare Lexington with Moscow .
If you type “ LDL 180 , ” it will tell you the percentile of the population with higher or lower cholesterol and show you the answer on a chart .
If you tell “ LDL 180 male 45 , ” it will adjust the chart for gender and age group .
It can chart the life expectancy of a male age 40 in Italy or tell you who was president of Brazil in 1928 .
There was a lot more , but it was hard to make out on a choppy Webcast , where the video kept cutting out .
( For those interested in watching the presentation , a replay of the Web cast will be available soon on the Berkman ’s Center site . )
But Jonathan Zittrain , a law professor at Harvard and the co-founder of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society , who organized Mr. Wolfram ’s talk described the service as a powerful “ computable almanac . ”
“ It aspires to the depth and breadth of a traditional almanac , ” Mr. Zittrain said .
“ And it allows people to juxtapose data , to take a set of facts and relate them to other facts in new ways .
You can compare population trends to the amount of fish consumed and correlate it to mortality rate . ”
Mr. Wolfram said the service is built on four pillars : a massive amount of data , that his company has collected from various sources ; a computational engine built on top of Mathematica , one of Mr. Wolfram ’s prior inventions ; a system for understanding queries ; and technology to display results in interesting ways .
Mr. Wolfram said the project was still in its early stages but was mature enough to begin making it available to users , something his company , Wolfram Research , plans to do next month .
While Wolfram Alpha is not a Web search engine , it is possible it will compete with Google or other existing services like Wikipedia , for certain kinds of questions .
Incidentally , in the middle of Mr. Wolfram ’s presentation , Google announced a new search feature that makes it easy to find and compare data from public sources like the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics .

The Business Software Alliance is out today with their annual report on global piracy in 2008 .
The data shows declining numbers in many countries ( the report covers 110 countries ) , though there is an overall increase due to very high rates in parts of the world .
Two keys – first , it points to the growing importance of open source software , which the report says commands 15 percent of the market …
68 % of the countries that the BSA tracks that have ratified the WIPO Copyright Treaty have shown no change or only a minor increase or decrease in software piracy rates .
The three countries that showed a significant decrease are Russia ( which only ratified in February ) , China ( which ratified in 2007 ) , and Qatar ( which ratified in 2005 ) .
Russia and China are important markets , yet their numbers remain very high ( 68 % in Russia and 80 % in China ) and few would argue that the big declines are as a result of anti-circumvention legislation .
Moreover , the average software piracy rate among WCT ratifying countries is 62 % and , as mentioned , only five countries that have ratified the WCT have software piracy rates lower than Canada's .
The Republic of Kazakhstan in Central Asia is in the process of building the world 's first alien embassy according to some local media reports .
If these reports are to be believed , the authorities have already allocated a large plot of land in the city of Almaty for this ambitious project .
Facilities to be built within the complex will include a guesthouse , theatre and translation service .
A purpose built UFO landing pad and checkpoint will be attached to the embassy .
Kazakhstan 's government believes open contact with aliens is imminent and by being the first nation to specifically create such facilities they are convinced they will reap enormous financial and economic rewards .
The Kazakhstan Government also see this as a chance to demonstrate their nations forward thinking policies .
Currently it is generally accepted that aliens are making use of an underwater UFO base in the Caspian Sea which Kazakhstan borders .
Fuad Gasimov , the head of neighbouring Azerbaijan 's national Aerospace Agency has confirmed this to be the case and has gone on record stating the old USSR constantly monitored alien spaceships regularly entering the water but kept this a military secret .
Gasimov himself was involved in this secret monitoring of UFOs when a department heat at the USSR 's science academy .
In addition to this , numerous UFO sightings occur in Kazakhstan where it is believed aliens take an interest in their massive natural resources .
As recently as last year a UFO was reported as having crashed into a river in Kazakhstan .
The head of Kazakhstan 's space agency , Talgat Musabayev , is said to be heavily involved in the embassy project .
Musabayev is an ex-cosmonaut who has spent many hours in space and is an ex-colleague of Gasimov .
It is believed that he possesses a large amount of information on the aliens currently visiting earth .
Kazakhstan 's acceptance of the reality of alien visitors to earth has won it the admiration of many ufologists , especially those in the west , who wonder when their countries will follow this example .

David Richards is preparing to re-enter the Formula 1 arena after lodging an entry under the Prodrive banner with the FIA for the 2010 world championship .
The team is the third new entry to formally apply for one of the three places currently available on the 2010 grid , with Campos Meta1 and Team US F1 having already submitted their entries .
Lola is also expected to submit an entry before the end of today 's cut - off .
Richards ' decision to enter F1 now has been prompted by the fact that a drive to forge a budget cap in the sport has one again made it commercially viable for his company to be competitive - conditions Richards has consistently held over entering F1 .
" We are very appreciative of the support we have been given in putting together our entry , not least by both the FIA and FOM , " said Richards .
" With the help of Dar Capital , in raising the finance , coupled with our understanding of the latest proposals to assist new teams , we now feel the conditions are right to formally request the FIA for an entry .
" The level of next year 's cost cap has risen substantially since we originally considered entering .
However everyone appears committed to major reductions in future years and when one takes into account the transition proposals for new teams we are confident that we now have the opportunity to be both commercially viable and competitive .
" As we have said all along , we do n't want to be in Formula 1 just to make up the numbers . "
Prodrive 's entry comes 18 months after its last attempt to enter F1 was scuppered by the ban on customer chassis ; the team having negotiated a deal to source cars from McLaren .
The link with McLaren could remain this time around in the form of a technical partnership , although details of the engine package are still yet to be revealed .
Force India has similar ties to McLaren in the current season , and uses engines from Mercedes - Benz .
Finance for the project has been assisted by Middle - East - based finance , logistics and property company Dar , which formed the backbone of the Richards - led conglomerate that paid $ 925 million for a majority stake in Aston Martin in 2007 .
Assuming that the team 's entry is accepted , it will mark Richards ' return to the F1 paddock for the first time since 2004 , when he was stood down as team principal of BAR following the team 's purchase by Honda .
Prior to his three - year stint with BAR he 'd served for one year as director of Benetton F1 in 1997 .
Sometimes beautiful images are generated serendipitously ; think of snowflakes or Lissajous curves .
Today I got one when I encoded an animation of the back dials of my Antikythera mechanism emulator with the CamStudio lossless codec ( v1.4 ) .
When I played back the movie with the VLC media player ( v0.9.9 ) a bug in the player ( or the codec or the video driver ) gave me a black background and a series of overlaid images with the stark colors of the gears .
I think the bug is related to the alpha channel , which I use for partially obscuring the gears behind the translucent dial face .
I found the result eerily beautiful .
True to its form , the image proved devilishly difficult to capture .
No matter what method I used for capturing and saving it , the image would only appear on my computer and only in the screen area and size corresponding to the original location of the media player .
Saving the image in a file format that did not support transparency resulted in a black rectangle .
In the end I gave up and ( horror of horrors ) I photographed my computer 's screen .
Enjoy !
This morning I saw the trap .
In the trap was my new mouse … poor mouse .

( CNN ) --
A former professional football player and his ex-girlfriend have been charged in the killing of her wealthy boyfriend for money , a breakthrough in a cold case dating to 1994 .

“ My wish has remained unchanged , it is to return to my village , to die and be buried there , ” Mohammed told IOL .
OCCUPIED WEST BANK — Mohammed al - Saghir Abu Sharar was 37 when the Hagana and other Jewish terrorist gangs attacked al - Dawayema , a village located 18 kilometers northwest of Al - Khalil ( Hebron ) in 1948 .
“ When they came they started killing the civilian population en mass , men , women and children , ” recalls Mohammed , now nearly 100 - year - old .
“ They killed anyone they saw .
They broke the heads of children and cut open the bellies of women with bayonets .
They even raped some women before murdering them . ”
Mohammed said one of the bloodiest chapters of that day took place in the mosque .
“ It was Friday and many elderly people had already gone to the local mosque for the congregational prayer , ” he remembers .
“ About two hours before the prayers , around 10:00 or 10:30 a.m. , a number of vehicles carrying gunmen arrived .
They sprayed everyone with bullets , killing all the 75 elderly people .
Not a single one survived , ” he added with tears in his eyes .
“ They then started going into the houses , killing entire families .
The killings forced people to flee eastward .
However , the Hagana men pursued the fleeing civilians , killing more people . ”
In his book “ All That Remains , ” Walid al - Khalid , a Palestinian historian of impeccable credentials , wrote that al - Dawayema had a population of 3710 in 1945 .
The world marks on May 15 the “ Nakba Day , ” when Israel was created on the rubble of their country .
On April 18 , 1948 , Palestinian Tiberius was captured by Menachem Begin ’s Irgun militant group , putting its 5,500 Palestinian residents in flight .
On April 22 , Haifa fell to the Zionist militants and 70,000 Palestinians fled .
On April 25 , Irgun began bombarding civilian sectors of Jaffa , terrifying the 750,000 inhabitants into panicky flight .
On May 14 , the day before the creation of Israel , Jaffa completely surrendered to the much better - equipped Zionist militants and only about 4,500 of its population remained .
No Shelter Mohammed , who now lives with his family at the small village of al - Majd , about 7 kilometers southwest of al - Dawayema , says dozens of families had sought shelter at a big cave called “ Turel Zagh ” .
“ The Jews told them to come out and get into a row and start to walk .
And when they started walking , they sprayed them with machinegun fire from two sides , ” he adds .
“ One woman , the wife of Mir’ie Freih , survived the massacre by pretending to be dead . ”
Mohammed said the victims of the massacre were later buried inside the Bir al - Sahra and Bir al - Sil wells .
His testimony was corroborated by Israeli historians and researchers relying on the de-classified archives of the Israeli army and interviews with veteran soldiers .
Israeli historian Benny Morris had interviewed a participant in the massacre who told him that about 80 to 100 people , including women and children , were killed by “ the first wave of conquerors . ”
In 1984 , an Israeli journalist interviewed the former Mukhtar ( village notable ) of al - Dawayema , Hasan Mahmoud Ihdeib , and took him back to the site for the first time since the massacre .
Ihdeib told him about the people killed in the mosque and the families
slaughtered at the cave , showing him the cistern where the bodies had been buried .
A few days later , the Israeli journalist brought workers who dug and discovered bones and skulls .
In 1955 , the Jewish settlement of Amatzya was built on the ruins of al - Dawayema .
Aharon Zisling , Israel ’s first agriculture minister , had likened the massacre , codenamed “ Operation Yo’av ” , to Nazi crimes .
Living Memory
A few years ago , Mohammed and his family visited the ruinous cite of his village where his father , mother , grandfather and their ancestors are buried .
“ I stood their crying .
I saw our home , badly dilapidated .
I saw the chamber where my father used to receive guests .
I saw the abandoned wells of water . ”
The century - old Palestinian still hopes he would be allowed to live in his old home village .
“ My wish has remained unchanged , it is to return to my village , to die and be buried there . ”
Asked further if he would accept compensation for his lost property , he lapsed into a moment of silence before answering .
“ It is not a matter of property and compensation , ” he said .
“ This is my country , my history , my home , my childhood memories .
My forefathers and foremothers are buried there .
Would you trade the grave of your father for all the money in the world ? ”
New analysis looks at the question :
Do whales and humans compete for fish ?
Fishermen calling for a resumption of whaling to restore commercial fish stocks are taking the wrong approach , argue researchers writing in the journal Science .
Analyzing data on fish catch and whale abundance off the coast of northwestern Africa and the Caribbean , Leah R. Gerber and colleagues show that fishermen remove far more fish than whales consume , undermining the agreement by whaling nations that whales are driving depletion of fisheries .
Humpback whale in Alaska
“ Today , the majority of fish stocks and many whale populations are seriously depleted , but most available evidence points toward human overexploitation as the root of the problem , ” write the authors .
“ When developing tropical countries are encouraged to focus on the notion that ‘ whales eat fish , ’ they risk being diverted from addressing the real problems that their own fisheries face , primarily , overexploitation of their marine resources by distant - water fleets . ”
The authors recommend applying ecosystem management concepts to managing whale populations and argue that science , rather than politics , should be an integral component of these discussions .
“ Couched in terms of ‘ ecosystem management , ’ whaling countries , including Japan , advocate the culling of whales as a solution to recover overexploited fish stocks and to increase fishery yield .
Some developing countries , which may benefit economically and politically by supporting pro-whaling nations at the International Whaling Commission , have also supported the ‘ whales - eat - fish ’ assertion . ”
Fishermen take more fish than whales
“ An effort must be made to actively engage scientists and managers from countries that support Japan ’s claims to help them investigate this issue within an ecosystem context in their own regions .
In many cases , fisheries officers in tropical areas , such as the Caribbean , do not necessarily believe the whales - eat - fish arguments .
Rather , the arguments are endorsed for reasons
related to their aid relationship with Japan , especially in the fisheries sector . ”
A voter in Ladakh shows his election ink mark
The fifth and final stage of voting in India 's month - long marathon general elections has concluded .
Counting of votes is scheduled for Saturday and a new parliament has to be constituted by 2 June .
The main fight is between the ruling Congress party - led alliance and parties led by the BJP , which are pitted against a host of regional opposition .
An outright majority is unlikely for any of the parties and analysts say it will be a coalition with many players .
Calcutta violence
The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi says the final phase could well prove decisive as the swing state of Tamil Nadu , with nearly 40 parliamentary seats , has heavily influenced central politics in the past few elections .
Chris Morris , BBC News in Chennai ( Madras )
Voters were out early in the middle of Chennai , queuing up to cast their ballots .
There was a flurry of excitement and a media scrum at Stella Maris College when the leader of the AIADMK , Jayalalitha , turned up to cast her vote .
Some people here think her party could sweep the polls in Tamil Nadu - which would make it one of the kingmakers of the next national government .
Jayalalitha was looking and sounding confident .
She said she has had feelers from various parties but she 'll wait until results are announced on Saturday before deciding on her next move .
The other main party , the DMK , which swept the state last time , still insists that it will do well .
Polling day in pictures Tamil Nadu : Kingmaker state Voters in the states of Punjab , Jammu and Kashmir , Himachal Pradesh , Uttarakhand , Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal cast their ballots on Wednesday , the final day of voting .
Polls were also held in the centrally - administered territories of Chandigarh and Pondicherry .
The BBC's Subir Bhaumik in Calcutta said there were clashes in seven places in and around the city , with one person reported dead and 17 injured .
There were similar clashes there in last week 's voting phase .
All 39 constituencies in the southern state of Tamil Nadu voted on Wednesday .
Tamil Nadu - where voters tend to hand big victories to one or other of the state 's two main parties - is expected to play a crucial role in the formation of the government in the coalition talks that are almost certain to follow the election .
The last five governments have been formed with the winners in Tamil Nadu .
Former state chief minister , J Jayalalitha , head of the AIADMK party and one of India 's most colourful and controversial politicians , cast her vote in the state capital Chennai ( Madras ) and complained of election irregularities .

E-REV will appeal to a niche , but if GM has that niche to itself 5 % of car sales is a lot of cars .
Until Gas prices get back over $ 4 E- REV even with subsidies will be too expensive for 10 years just too much stuff packed in a car .
The bigger niche which is more like 30 % of car market is the 2 car family 's second car .
One gas car for longer trips , one BEV for around town .
It is too early to do this , because we are 3 years away from any meaningful E - REV or BEV production capacity , but a $ 1 tax on gasoline with that money going to pay for tax credits to buy AMERICAN MADE ELECTRIC CARS is the ticket to get us to stop buying our energy from our enemies and having an american economy to build cars and new energy development .
Then in 20 years , though we 'll be leaving our children trillions of dollars in debt , we 'll at least have an american economy and free energy to power our cars and industry ( assuming we spend 20 years building wind , solar , geothermal , hydro and nuclear power plants ) .
Then maybe America will have a future .
Otherwise we will continue the path that leads to our middle class being on par with India and China .
I am a programmer and our VP told us the other day that all commpanies will continue to cut cuts and send jobs offshore .
It is n't going to stop with programmers and engineers , it will continue with all office non customer - facing jobs until us 80,000 a year professionals beg for our jobs back at 20,000 a year .
A friend hugs a son of Kevin McDaid at the scene of the murder of Kevin McDaid in Coleraine
Locals claimed a loyalist “ lynch mob ” descended on the Heights area of Coleraine in taxis and cars intent on killing a Catholic .
The fatal assault on community worker Kevin McDaid ( 46 ) , described as “ someone who would do anything for anybody ” , has left the close - knit community completely stunned .
A plasterer by trade but interested in building community relations , Kevin McDaid strived to make the area a better place for those living in the socially deprived , mixed estate .
He was attacked while trying to prevent his children from being caught up in the trouble that flared following Sunday ’s Rangers and Celtic football matches .
Throughout yesterday a steady stream of ashen - faced mourners arrived at the police cordon at the edge of terraced row where Mr McDaid , his wife Evelyn and three of their four sons lived .
Most people could n’t comprehend what happened .
Kevin Mr McDaid , described as hard - working and popular , was beaten and jumped on about the head just yards from his house at Somerset Drive .
He managed to stagger a few yards but collapsed and died almost on his back doorstep .
His eldest son Ryan ( 22 ) who had seen the attack found him lying on the ground .
Fighting back tears he said his father ’s face had been totally battered , all his teeth were knocked out and he was bleeding badly .
He said : “ I was there when it happened .
We heard screaming and shouting and Damien Fleming was lying on the ground .
There was a gang of about 70 people arrived , they came up in cars and taxis and jumped out .
“ We were totally outnumbered .
There was nothing we could do , they were local UDA members . ”

Pimps are not the business partners they purport to be .
They typically take every penny the girls earn .
They work the girls seven nights a week .
They sometimes tattoo their girls the way ranchers brand their cattle , and they back up their business model with fists and threats .
“ If you do n’t earn enough money , you get beat , ” said Jasmine , an African - American who has turned her life around with the help of Covenant House , an organization that works with children on the street .
“ If you say something you ’re not supposed to , you get beat .
If you stay too long with a customer , you get beat .
And if you try to leave the pimp , you get beat . ”
The business model of pimping is remarkably similar whether in Atlanta or Calcutta : take vulnerable , disposable girls whom nobody cares about , use a mix of “ friendship , ” humiliation , beatings , narcotics and threats to break the girls and induce 100 percent compliance , and then rent out their body parts .
It ’s not solely violence that keeps the girls working for their pimps .
Jasmine fled an abusive home at age 13 , and she said she  like most girls  stayed with the pimp mostly because of his emotional manipulation .
“ I thought he loved me , so I wanted to be around him , ” she said .
That ’s common .
Girls who are starved of self - esteem finally meet a man who showers them with gifts , drugs and dollops of affection .
That , and a lack of alternatives , keeps them working for him  and if that is n’t enough , he shoves a gun in the girl ’s mouth and threatens to kill her .
Solutions are complicated and involve broader efforts to overcome urban poverty , including improving schools and attempting to shore up the family structure .
But a first step is to stop treating these teenagers as criminals and focusing instead on arresting the pimps and the customers  and the corrupt cops .

I 've been thinking about getting a pressure cooker .
I 'd like to be able to buy large amounts of fruits and vegetables at the peak of their season ( when the cost is lowest ) and can them in jars for use during the rest of the year .
A pressure cooker would also make using dried beans more convenient , and would be a great tool when I have a garden someday .
I know a cheap pressure cooker only costs $ 100 and would save me much more than that over time , but there 's a problem ... I do n't have $ 100 .
This is the poor man 's dilemma .
To acquire money - saving tools takes money .
To acquire money - saving skills takes money .
To increase income through investments takes money .
And for someone living paycheck to paycheck , extra money is hard to come by .
So what can you do when you really want something but do n't have the money ?
In particular , what can you do when you know that object or skill will ultimately save you money , if only you had the money to acquire it ?
Check under the couch cushions , break open the piggy bank , or try this ...
1 . Make a list of the items you want in order of greatest need or greatest return on investment .
Focus on saving for the things you need most , and do n't get sidetracked by the lesser or cheaper items .
For example , if buying a car would enable you to obtain a better paying job farther away from your home , do n't waste your savings on the $ 100 pair of designer jeans that wo n't increase your salary no matter how good you look in them .
2 . Get creative with ways to increase your savings .
Keep a change jar .
Anytime you pay in cash , put your change in a jar .
Eventually , the change will add up .

Use your weekends and evenings to do odd jobs .
Mow your neighbors ' lawns .
Babysit .

Sell something .
Hold a garage sale .
Put little used items on Craigslist or Ebay .

After you 've paid off a debt , keep making the payment for that debt ... to yourself .
When you 've paid off your car , pay a monthly car payment to your savings account .
Hopefully , by the time you need a new car , you 'll have a significant down payment saved up .

Temporarily increase frugality .
You can ramp up your ability to save for a short time by going without luxuries or vices until you 've saved up enough .
Cut back on unnecessary expenditures like dining out , movies , alcoholic beverages , soft drinks , and dessert .
Find a deal .
In the meantime , borrow .
Use your tax return
6 . As a last resort , consider a loan .
Good tips for everyone ... including me
3.Consider buying the item used , or at least on sale .
The cheaper you can find the item , the less you need to save up .
4 . Do you have a friend with the same item who would loan it to you until you can buy your own ?

My father has his tax deductions perfected so that my parents rarely get a tax return .
If you need more money upfront ( and hate lending money to the government like my dad does ) , that 's a good strategy .
But I prefer to think of my tax return like a savings program .
It 's automatically deducted from my paycheck so I do n't spend it , but eventually I 'll get it back .
The key , though , is to make sure you invest your tax return in something useful rather than looking at it as a windfall that you can blow .
Spend your tax return on an item that will save you money or a skill that will increase your income , or invest it in a long term savings program .
In general , if you can avoid going into debt , you should .
But if your investment will earn you far more money over time than you would spend on interest , a loan is a reasonable option .
For example , going into debt to increase your level of education is a smart investment in the long run .
My family is far from poor .
My husband has a very good job - good enough that I can stay home with my kids with little financial sacrifice .
During normal times ( when we have n't been making two house payments for almost a year ) , I would plop down $ 100 for a pressure cooker in a heartbeat .
( Okay , maybe not in a heartbeat - I 've always had a thrifty streak - but after careful consideration and months of desiring something , I 'd definitely buy it . )
But right now , money is still very tight , my husband has another computer conference next month , and then we 're heading home to Kentucky / Tennessee to see our parents .
$ 100 feels like a lot of money to part with right now .
I know I 'll buy that pressure cooker eventually , but for now , I 'm content to wait and save - keeping my change , selling off things we no longer need , and cutting back unnecessary expenses - until I can really afford what I want .
The grep command is regarded as one of the most essential building blocks of command line automation .
It is a search tool that can be used to perform basic text filtering and processing tasks on files and streams .
Although it is deceptively simple , it can sometimes take the challenge out of finding the proverbial needle in a haystack .
In this article , I 'm going to show you several examples of how it can be used to perform real - world tasks .
The most common and basic scenario of grep usage is a text search .
It can be used to find instances of a word or phrase in files and text streams .
You can invoke it at the command line by typing the command name , the search query , and the target files in which to search .
To find the word " needle " in the haystack .
txt file , I use the following command :
$ grep needle haystack.
txt
This will cause grep to display any line from haystack .
txt that contains the text " needle " .
In this example , it 's important to note that grep is matching the raw characters and not the word .
It will , for example , also show lines that include " needless " and other words that contain " needle " .
You can instruct grep to search for the query text as a word by using the -w parameter .
This will limit the output to lines in which the query text is surrounded on both sides by any combination of spaces , punctuation , or line breaks .
$ grep -w needle haystack.
txt
Grep can also be used to find text in multiple files at once .
If you specify a glob or multiple files as the target of the search , grep will look in all of them and the output will tell you where each search result was found .
$ grep -w needle haystacks /*. txt
The filename will appear at the beginning of each line of output , followed by a colon and the matched line .
You can tell grep to hide the filenames by including the -h parameter .
If you just want a list of the files and you do n't want the matched text , just use the -l parameter .
Taking grep to the next level with regular expressions
The real power of the grep command can be unlocked by using regular expression ( regex ) syntax , a simple language for describing the generalized structure of text content .
It can be used for finding text that is not always the same , but has a predictable pattern .
An introduction to regex syntax is beyond the scope of this article , but you can find handy reference guides in many places on the Internet .
In the following example , I will search my IRC logs and extract the 10 most recent links :
$ grep - wo http://.* channel.log | tail
The -o parameter tells grep to only display the actual match .
This means that the output will show just the URLs and not the entire line in which each one was found .
At the end of the grep command , we pipe the contents into tail , a command that displays only the end of the text stream .
By default , tail will show ten lines .
Next , I want to see how many things I have said in IRC .
My nick is " segphault , " but I also use " segphone " when I 'm connected from my smartphone .
I want to find all lines that are sent by either of those nicks and then count the total :
$ grep -c " ^< segph( ault|one ) > " channel.log
When grep receives the -c parameter , it will not display the matches or the matched lines .
Instead , it will display a number which indicates how many lines were matched .
The query is enclosed in quotation marks because it contains special characters that would be misinterpreted by the command line shell .
The quotation marks are not part of the search .
If you want to perform a query that uses quotation marks , you have to escape them or wrap it in single quotes .
In our last example , we will look for lines that contain shouting .
To do this , we want to search the logs for any line that has a word that is entirely capitalized .
To reduce the number of false positives from acronyms , we only want to match all - caps words that are five characters or more .
$ grep -w " [ A - Z ] + {5 , } " channel.log

Jenson Button has given Brawn GP 's new car , the BGP 001 , its first shakedown at Silverstone today .
Just hours after Honda confirmed that it was selling the outfit to team principal Ross Brawn , the white , yellow and black car took its first exploratory laps around Silverstone .
The car , which was put together even though the team had no guarantee over their future , features a wide low nose , and highly sculpted sidepods .
The run is the first time the Brackley - based team have been in action since Honda announced in December that it was quitting F1 .
Since then , the team have concluded an engine - supply deal with Mercedes - Benz , and confirmed drivers Button and Rubens Barrichello .
Following today 's shakedown , the team will move to Barcelona in Spain for their first serious test , before another run-out at Jerez the following week .
In that remarkable speech last week , the former vice - president was also able to say :
And when they see the American government caught up in arguments about interrogations , or whether foreign terrorists have constitutional rights , they do n’t stand back in awe of our legal system and wonder whether they had misjudged us all along .
Instead the terrorists see just what they were hoping for  our unity gone , our resolve shaken , our leaders distracted .
In short , they see weakness and opportunity .
As a reader noted , Cheney seems to forget that he is no longer one of the country 's executive leaders .
So at this point , he , by his own argument , is the one destroying " unity , " " distracting " the new president , and " shaking " our resolve .
By his own logic , he is now refuting his own position .
Obama 's mandate on these questions was and is very clear .
It was debated in the election campaign and the commitment to end Cheney 's torture regime was actually embraced by both candidates , including the candidate of his own party .
I think Cheney has every right to speak out , and thereby reveal both the hollowness of his arguments and his direct responsibility for war crimes .
But Cheney does n't .
By his own logic , he should shut up and wait to be prosecuted by a united government under one supreme leader .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

What is a Preferred Stock
Preferred Stock has been available to investors alongside common stock from the beginning but many retail investors do n’t even know what it is ( or how to invest in it ) .
Sometimes called preferred shares , these stocks do n’t have voting rights but have priority over common stock in dividend payout and also in the case that the company goes bankrupt .
Features of Preferred Stock
Normally , the main reason why people buy preferred shares is due to its preferred treatment when it comes to dividends .
Other features include :
Preferred shareholders are compensated before common stock holders in the event of a company ’s liquadation
Preferred shares usually come with a fixed dividend amount , but it can sometimes be a variable rate
They usually do n’t come with voting rights , although some come with rights as well
Disadvantages
Some say that preferred stock has the disadvantage of bonds as well as common stock but do n’t have the advantages of any .
They argue that like bonds , prefers do n’t grow in value when the company does well but unlike bonds , the value of a preferred can go down because there are no maturity dates .
( remember that bonds prices go down when interest rate go up , but the prices usually creep back up as maturity dates approaches ) .
How Do I Buy Preferred Stock
In general , a brokerage account gives you access to publicly listed preferred stock , which is only limited to financial institutions , REITs and public utilities .
They trade like common stock so you can buy and sell whenever markets are open .
What this Mean for Us
I remember my dad buying preferred shares when I was young .
Ultimately , he was buying them because it provided a good income stream as long as he had the capital to hold it forever ( if needed ) .
If he needed to sell it , the interest rates better not be rising because it would kill the value of his shares .
Owning preferred shares is also better than owning bonds if the interest rates are the same in a tax perspective .
IRS taxes bond ’s interest at the income tax rate , while dividends are taxed at a maximum of 15 % .

People are n't the only ones who 've got rhythm .
Two reports published online on April 30th in Current Biology , a Cell Press publication , reveal that birds - and parrots in particular - can also bob their heads , tap their feet , and sway their bodies along to a musical beat .
The findings show that a very basic aspect of the human response to music is shared with other species , according to the researchers .
" We 've discovered a cockatoo [ named Snowball ] that dances to the beat of human music , " said Aniruddh Patel of The Neurosciences Institute in San Diego , lead author of one of the studies .
" Using a controlled experiment , we 've shown that if the music speeds up or slows down across a wide range , he adjusts the tempo of his dancing to stay synchronized to the beat . "
One of Snowball 's favorite dancing tunes is none other than the Backstreet Boys ' " Everybody . "
" For a long time , people have thought that the ability to move to a beat was unique to humans , " added Adena Schachner of Harvard University , who led the other study .
" After all , there is no convincing evidence that our closest relatives , chimpanzees and other apes , can keep a beat , and there is similarly no evidence that our pet dogs and cats can line up their actions with a musical beat , in spite of extensive experience with humans .
In this work , however , we found that entrainment [ to music ] is not uniquely human ; we find strong evidence for it in birds , specifically in parrots . "
Before this discovery , " scientists who studied music and the brain thought that moving to a musical beat might be a uniquely human ability because we do n't commonly see other animals moving rhythmically to music , " Patel agreed .
In fact , as far as they know , birds in the wild do n't move in time with sounds , leaving many scientists to think that this ability might be an evolutionary specialization of the human brain for music cognition .
But that may not be so , the new studies suggest .
They now suspect that the parrots ' ability can be traced to another capacity they share with people : vocal learning or mimicry .
Indeed , Schachner 's group searched YouTube for videos of dancing animals .
Of more than 1,000 videos that turned up , only those of vocal mimics - representing 14 parrot species and one species of elephant - showed evidence that they could really get into the groove .
That result is in keeping with the notion , first proposed by Patel , that entrainment to a musical beat relies on the neural circuitry for complex vocal learning , which requires a tight link between auditory and motor circuits in the brain , they said .
" A natural question about these results is whether they generalize to other parrots , or more broadly , to other vocal - learning species , " including songbirds , dolphins , elephants , and pinnipeds , a group including walruses and seals , Patel said .
The findings in birds also offer new insight into humans ' relationship to music .
" Why humans produce and enjoy music is an evolutionary puzzle , " Schachner 's team wrote .
" Although many theories have been proposed , little empirical evidence speaks to the issue .
In particular , debate continues over the idea that the human music capacity was not selected for directly , but arose as the byproduct of other cognitive mechanisms .
By supporting the idea that entrainment emerged as a byproduct of vocal mimicry in avian species , the current findings lend plausibility to the idea that the human entrainment capacity evolved as a byproduct of our capacity for vocal mimicry . "

A former Wall Street investment banker with no public housing experience has been selected to lead the New York City Housing Authority , a sprawling bureaucracy struggling to overcome a financial crisis and a lingering controversy over elevator safety .
At City Hall on Wednesday , Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg introduced the agency ’s new chairman , John B. Rhea , the former managing director of the Lehman Brothers global consumer retail group .
He has also been an executive at JPMorgan Chase , where he completed more than $ 50 billion worth of transactions overseeing corporate finance as well as mergers and acquisitions , city officials said .
Such credentials , the mayor said , will help ensure the long - term fiscal stability of an agency that has a current operating budget deficit of $ 45.1 million .
The city ’s public housing system , the largest in the country , has been reeling in recent years from a lack of government financial support .
Among those critical of the mayor ’s choice were five City Council members who said that at such a crucial time for the agency , a chairman with proven experience in affordable housing management was needed .
They also expressed disappointment that council members were not consulted in the selection .
THE Illinois Institute of Technology ( IIT ) has always exemplified efficient design .
Ludwig Mies van der Rohe , a master modernist , filled its Chicago campus with simple rectangular buildings .
Critics quipped that IIT 's only church spire was the chimney of its power plant .
It is fitting , then , that IIT should herald a new era of efficiency .
With the help of the Galvin Electricity Initiative , it is adopting the electric grid of the future .
The hope is that the rest of the country will soon have one , too .
Electrocrats have been plugging the “ smart grid ” for years .
Now others have joined them .
Barack Obama 's stimulus package contains about $ 4.5 billion in grants for smart - grid investments and regional demonstrations .
GE is promoting the smart grid with ads that show a scarecrow singing “ If I only had a brain ” from “ The Wizard of Oz ” while bouncing along an old power line .
In January Mr Obama declared that a smart grid could “ save us money , protect our power sources from blackout or attack , and deliver clean , alternative forms of energy to every corner of our nation ” — grand goals indeed .
America 's power system has changed remarkably little over the past century , with centralised utilities delivering electricity to passive consumers .
A smart grid would use digital technology to collect , communicate and react to data , making the system more efficient and reliable .
For example , sensors would help utilities locate problems and fix them quickly — power cuts now cost businesses more than $ 100 billion each year .
A nimble grid would integrate electricity from both predictable sources , such as coal , and fickle ones , such as the sun and wind .
Meters , to monitor both use and prices , would give consumers more control over their electricity bill .
Advocates predict that some consumption would move to cheaper , off - peak hours , easing congestion and reducing the need for new infrastructure .
Consumers would save money and emissions would fall .
Installing smart meters in 25 % of American homes , GE estimates , would be equivalent to removing 1.7 m cars from the roads .
Plug - in hybrids , meanwhile , could charge at night , when demand is low , and even pump power back to the grid while parked during the day .
The pilot at IIT is one of many .
Xcel Energy , a utility , is transforming Boulder , Colorado , into what it calls the world 's first “ smart grid ” city .
The smart grid , however , should not be confined to pilots .
But the problem is figuring out how to scale up .
Advocates have many tasks , not least of which is convincing consumers that a smart grid will lower their costs , not raise them .
Changing regulations , meanwhile , is even thornier .
For utilities , reducing consumption means reducing revenues , hardly an appealing prospect .
The stimulus encourages rewarding utilities for efficiency , but it is local commissions that must change the rules , and they may be wary of what is still seen as a risky investment .
Illinois 's regulatory commission approved the installation of up to 200,000 smart meters in 2009 .
Wider investments , however , await a two - year cost - benefit study .
At the national level , standards are needed so that innovations can interact seamlessly .
The National Institute of Standards and Technology , part of the Commerce Department , is expected to present only a rough framework by the summer .
The momentum for a smart grid continues to build .
But God , as Mies liked to say , is in the details .
( See Corrections & Amplifications item below . )
The downturn in home prices has left about 20 % of U.S. homeowners owing more on a mortgage than their homes are worth , according to one new study , signaling additional challenges to the Obama administration 's efforts to stabilize the housing market .
The increase in the number of such " underwater " borrowers comes amid signs that falling prices are making homes more affordable for first - time buyers and others who have been shut out of the housing market .
But falling prices also make it more difficult for homeowners who get into financial trouble to refinance or sell their homes , and for others to take advantage of lower interest rates .
For instance , fewer will qualify to take advantage of a key component of the Obama administration 's plan to stabilize the housing market .
Under the plan , announced in February , as many as five million homeowners whose loans are owned or guaranteed by government - controlled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can refinance their mortgages , but only if the mortgage loan is a maximum of 105 % of the home 's value .
Government officials are considering an increase in that limit .
" It 's a question that we 're looking at , " said James Lockhart , director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency , which regulates Fannie and Freddie .
It 's a — pardon the expression — timeless saying :
" You can always make more money , but you can't make more time . "
The staunch followup to that tends to be that you can make better use of time .
Like 10,000 pebbles
I 've been thinking a lot lately about tiny — even " microscopic " — shifts in my daily activities that add up big in the long run .
For example , one of my faves on the computer is setting up PhraseExpress text macros to auto - paste frequently - used snippets of text , cutting down 10 secs of typing into a 1 - second keystroke on each pass .
Not to mention the memory overhead of needing to recall each snippet .
When each instance is viewed in isolation , that 's not very much .
But multiply that over weeks , and the savings are phenomenal .
Another one of my fave habits is to batch - process documents : I stack stuff I need to scan and archive into a shoebox , then every couple of weeks or so , I put on lovely music like Philip Glass and start an intense half - hour to an hour of filing them all .
This removes the overhead of switching between tasks , since each time I do this , I need to arrange the scanner and documents , and go through a series of steps that are simply more efficient when done in one " swell foop " than piecemeal .
Having such concentration also adds to getting the task done effectively .
It 's economy of scale applied domestically .
Like any healthy habit , these involve repetition .
But the smart kind .
A fair exchange ?
Spending money to save time is a must for resourceful people , since there are some things which just about anyone can do , like raking leaves or mowing the lawn .
However , if you have creative inspiration or life dreams that only you understand ( at least so far ) , there 's no way you can transfer your innermost tasks to have them carried out , let alone communicate them to another person .
More importantly , while someone you 've paid is doing what you consider a boring task ( and do n't feel bad — it 's a fair exchange of money for your focus ) , you 're in a position to generate even more wealth , whether it 's rolling in net dough or spending quality time with family .
In fact , one commonplace but no less important money - for - time exchange is paying a babysitter so you can enjoy a night on the town with your sweetie .
The thought that you love your kid less because of this is absurd .
On a grander scale , books and blogs on " outsourcing your life " have gotten popular , with many copycats tagging on Tim Ferriss ' coattails .
While you 'll never want to entrust some personal tasks to others , the next time you feel time - crunched about a recurring activity that someone else could do — especially if it feels like a tiresome déjà vu — consider doing what I call a CLE , or " Cheap Lightweight Experiment " to test if more life automation may be right for you .
Whether it 's hiring someone to do manual labor or using the Amazon Mechanical Turk to " hive - mind " some info you need , there are plenty of options .
Spend a few bucks and observe the results .
Usefun
I challenge you to : get stuff you 're used to doing in an hour … done in 45 minutes or less .
This could very well mean your work , due to a higher sense of structure and ordered tasks there .
But it could just as easily be a household chore or other recurring activity at home .
This does n't mean you 'll rush through it carelessly .
It means you either become more intense about finding shortcuts or not doing / ignoring unnecessary parts ( and there almost always are if you look really closely ) , or delegating / outsourcing it to someone else entirely .
I find practicing this every day of my existence not only makes me sharper , it helps me to have more useful fun — what I often portmanteau as " usefun " — because events are more memorable .
My comprehension and self - awareness increases .
I care more , and I 'm far better off than , say , someone who is n't just riddled with distractions , but is merely doing an " OK " job and not looking to get more out of all those little slices of time that pass us each day .
That 's such a sloppy waste , especially when there are so many opportunities to invest in a tool or pay a person to help us make better use of our time .
In turn , when you 're stretched out and relaxing — whether it's in our bed or on the beach — you 'll feel that much better about it .
You 've optimized what needs to be tight , and now you can enjoy the slack .
A matter of perspective
As tough as it can be to avoid when you 're in a jam , penny - pinching at the expense of feeling freer is n't really saving money at all .
It 's like hoarding a small treasure in a locked room when there 's so much gold to discover outside the door , as scary as it may seem .
Do you regularly and consciously spend money to save time ?
Or is something you 're still afraid of ?
And if you have questions about my specific processes , please ask !

Go into any busy coffee shop and you are likely to see people engrossed in conversation , waving their hands around .
A man at the counter describes the coffee he wants to buy – in a mug , not a to - go cup – and his hand takes a familiar shape , as if he were already holding the cozy mug .
Nearby , two sisters laugh , as one tells a story about a trip to the barrier reef and all of the fish that she saw , her hands wiggling and darting in an invisible sea in front of her .
The drive to gesture when speaking is fundamental to human nature .
If you have thought about why we gesture you probably assumed that we gesture to help others understand what we are saying .
Pretending to hold a ceramic mug can help the barista understand exactly which mug you want .
Showing how the fish darted to and fro can help your sister get a more vivid picture of what the reef looked like to you .
But might gesture also serve another purpose ?
Many scientists now think that gestures can help the person making them -- that moving your hands can help you think .
Researchers have become increasingly interested in the connection between the body and thought – in the ways that our physical body shapes abstract mental processes .
Gesture is at the center of this discussion .
Now the debate is moving into learning , with new research on how students learn to solve math problems in the classroom .
To understand the research , consider a math problem like 3+2 +8 =___+8 .
A student might make a “ v ” shape under the 2 and 3 with their pointer finger and middle finger , as they try to understand the concept of “ grouping ” – adding adjacent numbers together , a technique that can be used to solve the problem .
Previous research has shown that students who are asked to gesture while talking about math problems are better at learning how to do them .
This is true whether the students are told what gestures to make , or whether the gestures are spontaneous .
Now researchers are asking how .
The new study -- by Dr. Susan Goldin - Meadow and Zachary Mitchell of the University of Chicago , and Dr. Susan Wagner - Cook of the University of Iowa – focused on third and fourth graders solving a problem that required grouping .
Students who are coached to make the “ v ” gesture when solving a math problem like 3+2+8 = ___+8 learn how to solve the problem better .
But students also do a better job even if they were coached to make the “ v ” shape under the wrong pair of numbers .
The very act of making the “ v ” shape introduces the concept of “ grouping ” to the student , through the body itself .
But what , exactly , was the process that made this possible ?
During the study , all of the students memorized the sentence “ I want to make one side equal to the other side . ”
They were then asked to say the sentence out loud when they were give a problem to solve .
The authors suggest that students who also gestured attempted to make sense of both the speech and gesture in a way that brought the two meanings together .
This process , they suggest , could crystallize the new concept of “ grouping ” in the student ’s mind .
The same process could occur in any situation where the person who is speaking and gesturing is also trying to understand – be it remembering details of a past event , or figuring out how to put together an Ikea shelf .
The study has important implications for the field of cognitive psychology .
Historically , the field has viewed concepts , the basic elements of thought , as abstract representations that do not rely on the physicality of the body .
This notion , called Cartesian Dualism , is now being challenged by another school of thought , called Embodied Cognition .
Embodied Cognition views concepts as bodily representations with bases in perception , action and emotion .
There is much evidence supporting the Embodied Cognition view .
However , until now there has never been a detailed , experimentally supported account of how embodiment through gesture plays a role in learning new concepts .
The study also has more practical implications for teaching , suggesting that teachers can help students learn new concepts by teaching them gestures .
The results from this study may not generalize directly to the gestures you may see in your neighborhood coffeeshop .
But the next time you are in a conversation with a gesturing friend , it may be interesting to ponder how those moving hands are subtly shaping her thoughts , as well as yours .

Aerial photographs of Mingora this week showed deserted streets
Pakistan 's army says it has regained control of the Swat valley 's main town , Mingora , after Taliban rebels decided not to put up a pitched battle .
Army spokesman Maj Gen Athar Abbas told the BBC that the centre of Mingora was under military control , although there were still skirmishes on the outskirts .
Fighting intensified a week ago as troops moved in , advancing house by house against the rebels .
Journalists are banned from the area so it is hard to verify army reports .
Hundreds of people have been killed and more than two million have fled the Swat valley since the operation against the Taliban was launched after a peace deal broke down earlier this month .

The army 's latest declaration comes days after a lethal bombing in Lahore , which was later claimed by Taliban as revenge for the Swat operations .
Although the military has always had bases in Mingora , the city was in effect under Taliban control in recent weeks .
The army reported taking key intersections a week ago and fighting is said to have been fierce in the city which was only recently home to more than 300,000 people .
' More fight '
" They [ the Taliban ] had prepared Mingora city ... with bunkers but when they realised that they were being encircled and the noose was tightening , they decided not to give a pitched battle , " said Gen Abbas .

But he emphasised he was only talking about Mingora and said there was " much more fight[ing ] " to be done in the valley .
Work , he added , was already beginning to restore essential services to Mingora .
The city hospital was being re-opened , he said , with a team of 21 doctors and adequate medical supplies .
Gas had also been restored and some mobile generators had been provided for the water system .
It would take at least two weeks to restore the electricity network , the general said .
As the army aims to clear Taliban strongholds and supply depots in Swat 's mountains , soldiers are battling militants in towns where many thousands of civilians are believed to be hiding .
The government has also advised residents to leave the town of Charbagh , a Taliban stronghold 20 miles ( 32 km ) north of Swat , in advance of an attempt by the military to move in there , AFP reported , quoting unnamed military sources .
Following the attack in Lahore , and in Peshawar a day later , Pakistan increased its reward for a Taliban chief to 50 m rupees ( $ 600,000 , £ 372,000 ) .
The figure is more than 10 times the original bounty for radical cleric Maulana Fazlullah - believed to be the architect of a two - year uprising in the Swat valley intended to enforce Sharia law .

Appeals - of probationary orders that were final
In re Shaun R. ( H035112 , Sixth Dist. , 9/29/10 ) Cal.App.4th
The phrase " all previous Orders of the Court ... remain in full force " does not operate to revive a previous order that had become final and was therefore nonappealable .
" It does not turn an otherwise nonappealable order into an appealable order . "
Appeals - appeal following summary denial of writ petition
People v. Jahansson ( H034446 , Sixth Dist. , 9/30/10 ) Cal.App.4th
People could appeal grant of suppression motion after previous writ petition was summarily denied .
Disagrees with People v. Carrington ( 1974 ) 40 Cal.App.3d 647 ( DA had to elect between writ review and appeal ) , and agrees with People v. Allison ( 1988 ) 202 Cal.
App.3d 1084 .
Summary denial is not a " decision " within meaning of Penal Code section 1538.5 ( j ) .
Child molestation - no specific child
People v. Phillips ( B221932 , Second Dist. , 10/5/10 ) Cal.App.4th
Evidence supported conviction for violating Penal Code section 647.6 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( annoying or molesting a child ) even though there was no evidence masturbation was directed at a specific child .
Defendant was masturbating in his car , parked in front of a school .
He was seen by a girl who walked by his car .
Confessions - midstream Miranda
People v. Camino ( G041887 , Fourth Dist. ,
10/4/10 ) Cal.App.4th
Substantial evidence supported trial court 's ruling that police did not use a deliberate two - step strategy to violate Miranda .
See Oregon v. Elstad ( 1985 ) 470 U.S. 298 ; Missouri v. Seibert ( 2004 ) 542 U.S. 600 .
Credits - retroactive application of Penal Code section 4019
People v. Rasmussen ( A125942 , First Dist. , 11/9/10 ) Cal.App.4th
Penal Code section 4019 amendment that increases conduct credits against sentence is properly applied retroactively .
Court notes that Supreme Court has granted review on several cases raising this issue .
Death penalty - issues
People v. Russell ( S075875 , 11/15/10 , CA S.Ct. ) Cal.4th
Issues : lying - in - wait theory of murder ; denial of jury view ; interference with deliberations and jury coercion ; consciousness of guilt instruction ; unanimity instruction on theory of murder ; denial of admission of defendant 's statements ( by defendant ) ; excusal of jurors ; victim impact evidence ; uncharged acts ; double - counting specials as aggravators ; circumstances of crime as aggravator ; penalty phase instructional challenges .
Full affirmance .
Discovery - of CI identity
Davis v. Superior Court ( B216345 , Second Dist. , 7/22/10 ) Cal.App.4th
Disclosure of confidential informant is not mandatory even when informant was percipient witness but court had duty to hold in camera hearing to determine if CI can given exculpatory evidence .
" [ T ] he balance between the public interest in protecting the flow of information to law enforcement officers and Davis 's right to prepare his defense is struck by having an in camera hearing prior to any disclosure . "
Drugs - transportation of medical marijuana
People v. Wayman ( G042582 , Fourth Dist. ,
10/15/10 ) Cal.App.4th
Jury properly instructed on transportation of medical marijuana when it was told that defendant must be a qualified user under the CUA ( Compassionate Use Act ) , and the circumstances of his transportation had to demonstrate he was transporting the marijuana for his own medical use , and that the quantity transported and the method , timing , and distance of the transportation had to be reasonably related to defendant 's current medical needs .
( CALCRIM 2361 . )
Drunk driving - admission of refusal to take PAS test
People v. Jackson ( A128782 , First Dist. ,
11/12/10 ) Cal.App.4th
Trial court erred in admitting evidence that defendant refused to take a preliminary alcohol screening ( PAS ) test .
The statute itself provides that the test is voluntary and police are required to so inform a detained driver .
However , because the jury was told the defendant had a right to refuse , and evidence of guilt was substantial , error was harmless .
Fees - court facilities fee
People v. Cortez ( G042891 , Fourth Dist. ,
11/10/10 ) Cal.App.4th
Court facilities fee under Government Code section 70373 properly imposed on each of six convictions .
Because they are not criminal penalties , ex post facto prohibition is not violated .
Fleeing scene of accident - GBI enhancement
People v. Valdez ( G042837 , Fourth Dist. ,
10/12/10 ) Cal.App.4th
In prosecution for fleeing scene of injury accident ( Veh. Code sec. 20001 ( a ) ) , conviction may not be enhanced with great bodily injury enhancement ( Pen. Code sec .

Gangs - jury instruction error
People v. Aranda ( D055701 , Fourth Dist. ,
10/6/10 ) Cal.App.4th
Trial court 's failure to include reference to DA 's burden of proof ( beyond reasonable doubt ) in " active participation in street gang ) charge was prejudicial .
Habeas corpus - federal - remand after grant on non-federal grounds
Wilson v. Corcoran ( US S.Ct. , 10 -91 , 11/8/10 ) U.S .
Seventh Circuit granted habeas relief to state prisoner without finding federal law violation .

11/5/10 ) Cal.App.4th
Victim 's 911 call reporting that her husband shot at her properly admitted at trial under hearsay spontaneous exception of Evidence Code section 1240 when victim failed to appear .
No violation of Sixth Amendment confrontation clause as interpreted by Crawford v. Washington ( 2004 ) 541 U.S. 36 and Davis v. Washington ( 2006 ) 547 U.S. 813 because statement was nontestimonial .
Follows People v. Cage ( 2007 ) 40 Cal.4th 965 ; People v. Romero ( 2008 ) 44 Cal.4th 386 .
Homicide - vicarious liability for shooting when co-defendant killed by another
People v. Camino ( G041887 , Fourth Dist. ,
10/4/10 ) Cal.App.4th
Insufficient evidence to support finding defendant vicariously discharged a gun ( Pen. Code sec . 12022.53 ( e ) ( 1 ) ) because the lone shooter ( and only armed person in defendant 's group ) , who was shot by an unknown person , could not be a principal in his own murder .
( People v. Antick ( 1975 ) 15 Cal.3d 79 , 91 . )
Homicide - failing to instruct on heat - of - passion voluntary manslaughter
People v. Ramirez ( B218413 , Second Dist. ,
11/12/10 ) Cal.App.4th
Trial court erred prejudicially by failing to instruct jury on voluntary manslaughter on a heat of passion theory that defendant shot victim after victim provoked him by punching him .
Even in absence of request , trial court must instruct on general principles of law relevant to issues raised by the evidence .
Obligation includes giving lesser included offenses instructions .
Voluntary manslaughter based on " sudden quarrel or heat of passion " is lesser and necessarily included offense of intentional murder .
( People v. Breverman ( 1998 ) 19 Cal.4th 142 , 153-155 . )
Juveniles - probation condition that minor not approach courthouses
In re E.O. ( H035462 , Sixth Dist. , 9/29/10 ) Cal.App.4th
Santa Clara County Judge Patrick Tondreau 's probation condition that minor , made a ward for possession of a knife on school grounds , not approach or enter courthouses where gang - related cases were being tried is constitutionally overbroad .
Justice Rushing takes Judge Tondreau to task for also making the condition difficult to understand , using an online readability tester , which ranked the wording at a 28.68 year grade level .
Leaving scene - special enhancement instruction
People v. Nordberg ( B218891 , Second Dist. ,
11/8/10 ) Cal.App.4th
Jury should have been instructed that defendant had to have knowledge that accident resulted in injury or was of such nature that one would reasonably anticipate it resulted in injury when defendant was charged with violating Vehicle Code section 20001 ( c ) .
Error harmless because defendant 's own testimony established that she knew knew the accident was of such a nature that it was probable another person had been injured .
Misconduct - prosecutorial - " Golden Rule " closing argument improper - conviction reversed
People v. Vance ( A122777 , First Dist. , 9/29/10 ) Cal.App.4th
" There is a tactic of advocacy , universally condemned across the nation , commonly known as " The Golden Rule " argument .
In its criminal variation , a prosecutor invites the jury to put itself in the victim 's position and imagine what the victim experienced .
This is misconduct , because it is a blatant appeal to the jury 's natural sympathy for the victim .
( See People v. Lopez ( 2008 ) 42 Cal.4th 960 , 969-970 and decisions cited . ) "
Nevertheless , Alameda County DA Ynostrosa made a sustained " Golden Rule " closing argument and disregarded the court 's rulings sustaining defense counsel 's objections .
" Unfortunately , the possible prejudicial effect of the improper comments by the prosecutor was exacerbated by the trial court 's passive reaction to them . "
[ Alameda Superior Court Judge Roy Hashimoto ] .
" The judgment of conviction is reversed .
Pursuant to Business and Professions Code section 6086.7 , subdivision ( a ) ( 2 ) , a copy of this opinion will be sent to the State Bar for such disciplinary action , if any , it may deem appropriate . "
Finally !
Rape - of intoxicated and unconscious woman
People v. Smith ( C061805 , Third Dist. , 11/8/10 ) Cal.App.4th
Trial court 's instructions on rape of intoxicated woman ( CALCRIM 1002 ) is not incomplete or misleading .
It states that a woman must be " so intoxicated that she cannot give legal consent " and defines " reasonable judgment " as being " able to understand and weigh the physical nature of the act , its moral character , and probable consequences . "
Instruction on rape of unconscious woman ( CALCRIM 1003 ) correctly states that " A woman is unconscious of the nature of the act if she is unconscious or asleep or not aware that the act is occurring . "
The evidence supported the charge .
Resisting - resisting executive officer by actual resistance is general intent crime
People v. Rasmussen ( A125942 , First Dist. , 11/9/10 ) Cal.App.4th
Penal Code section 69 ( resisting executive officer by actual resistance ) is a general intent crime , and jury was properly instructed .
There are two ways section 69 can be violated , and here DA proceeded on the second manner , actual resistance .
Restitution - to RIAA for piracy
People v. Kelly ( E048797 , Fourth Dist. ,
10/12/10 ) Cal.App.4th
Recording Industry of America ( RIAA ) could not obtain restitution for piracy from criminal defendants because it was not a direct victim of their crimes .
Restitution - victim's estate
People v. Runyan ( B218863 , Second Dist. , 9/24/10 ) Cal.App.4th
Restitution to victim 's estate was proper .
The estate only existed because of defendant 's killing of victim .
Search & seizure - mother 's consent to search of minor son's room
In re D.C. ( A127228 , First Dist. , 9/24/10 ) Cal.App.4th
Mother of minor had authority to consent to search of minor 's room and to override any objection he raised to search .
Compare Georgia v. Randolph ( 2006 ) 547 U.S. 103 ( search of adult son's room ) .
Search & seizure - prolonged detention
People v. Jahansson ( H034446 , Sixth Dist. , 9/30/10 ) Cal.App.4th
Following People v. Glaser ( 1995 ) 11 Cal.4th 354 , court holds that defendant 's initial detention outside premises to be searched was lawful incident to the probation search of the premises , but continued detention in handcuffs was not reasonable under the Fourth Amendment .
( People v. Stier ( 2008 ) 168 Cal.App.4th 21 .
Sentencing - street terrorism sentence had to be stayed
People v. Duarte ( G041195 , Fourth Dist. , 6/2/10 ) Cal.App.4th
Trial court should have stayed sentence on street terrorism count under Penal Code section 654 because defendant had same intent and objective in count of discharging firearm with gross negligence .
Follows People v. Sanchez ( 2009 ) 179 Cal.App.4th 1297 .
Sentencing - gang - related enhancements
People v. Yang ( C062816 , Third Dist. ,
10/13/10 ) Cal.App.4th
Enhancement for firearm discharge by co-principal causing death in gang - committed felony ( pcs 12022.53 ( d ) & ( e ) ( 1 ) ) does not apply when defendant was not convicted of one of the qualifying offenses enumerated in the statute .
Judgment modified to strike 25 - life enhancement and 10 - year enhancement for gang - committed violent felony , previously imposed but stayed , is imposed instead .
Sex offender registration - after defendant acquitted of sex offenses
People v. Mosley ( G038379 , Fourth Dist. , 9/29/10 ) Cal.App.4th
The restriction forbidding registered sex offenders from living within 2,000 feet of a school or park where chidren gather constitutes punishment and therefore the facts supporting sex offender registration must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt under Apprendi v. New Jersey ( 2000 ) 530 U.S. 466 .
Here the jury acquitted the defendant of any sexual offense and only found him guilty of misdemeanor assault .
Nevertheless Orange County Superior Court Judge David A. Hotter imposed a sex registration requirement .
Distinguishes In re E.J. ( 2010 ) 47 Cal.4th 1258 ( imposition of residency restriction as parole condition ) .
Sexual battery - touching breast
People v. Smith ( C061805 , Third Dist. , 11/8/10 ) Cal.App.4th
Defendant committed crime of sexual battery ( touching intimate part against the will of the person being touched , for purpose of sexual arousal , sexual gratification , or sexual abuse ; Penal Code section 243.4(e ) ( 1 ) ) when he touched breast of woman too intoxicated to resist .
Speedy trial - Penal Code section 1382
People v. Hajjah ( S175307 , CA S.Ct. , 11/4/10 ) Cal.4th
Trial court correctly determined that courtroom 76 miles away was not " available " at 4:15 pm on last day to bring defendant to trial .
Nor did the physical remoteness of the courtroom constitute " good cause " under Penal Code section 1382 to delay defendant 's trial .
As in People v. Engram ( Oct. 25 , 2010 , S176983 ) __ Cal .
App.4th __ , " the lack of any judge or courtroom available to bring this case to trial within the statutory period resulted from chronic court congestion attributable to the state , the trial court properly concluded that good cause did not exist under section 1382 to delay defendant 's trial . "
Dismissal upheld .
Torture - no ineffective assistance in failing to request cultural defense jury instruction
People v. Assad ( C059777 , Third Dist. ,
10/15/10 ) Cal.App.4th
Trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to request jury instruction that would have directed jury to consider whether evidence of defendant 's cultural background ( Syrian ) raised reasonable doubt whether he had requisite intent to inflict torture and aggravated mayhem on his son when he physically disciplined him .
Weapons - possession of firearm after discharge from psych facility
People v. Jason K. ( D055765 , Fourth Dist. , 10/7/10 ) Cal.App.4th
Trial court did not abuse discretion in holding that DA met burden of showing by preponderance of evidence that petitioner would not be likely to use firearms in safe and lawful manner under Welfare & Institutions Code section 8103 ( f ) ( 6 ) , and denying petitioner the right to possess firearms for five years after release from facility where he was detained for psychiatric evaluation under Welfare & Institutions Code section 5150 .
He had checked himself in a few months before and the triggering incident involved a loaded gun and his two - year old child was in the next room .
Court considered effect of McDonald v. City of Chicago ( 2010 ) 130 S.Ct. 3020 ( Second Amendment right to possess firearms ) on the question of the burden of proof , but petitioner did not challenge constitutionality of section 8103 .
Weapons - interpretation of 18 U.S.C. sec. 924(
c)
Abbott v. United States ( 09-479 , U.S. Supreme Court , 11/15/10 ) U.S .
Defendant is subject to highest mandatory minimum sentence specified for conduct in 18 U.S.C. sec 924 ( c ) unless another provision of law directed to such conduct imposes a greater minimum .
North Korea says it will reactivate its Yongbyon nuclear reactor North Korea has ended co-operation with UN nuclear inspectors and ordered them to leave the country , the International Atomic Energy Agency says .
Pyongyang told the IAEA to remove seals and equipment from the Yongbyon reactor and said that it would reactivate its nuclear facilities , the watchdog said .
The White House called on Pyongyang to stop its " provocative threats " .
Russia and China have asked it to reconsider .
The row concerns North Korea 's launch of a long - range rocket on 5 April .
North Korea is angry about a UN statement condemning the launch , which it says was aimed at putting a communications satellite in orbit .
But other nations believe it was testing long - range missile technology , in violation of a UN resolution banning Pyongyang from ballistic missile development .
The communist nation also says it is pulling out of talks on ending its nuclear programme .
' No access '
In a statement , the UN watchdog said North Korea had served notice that it would cease co-operation immediately .
NUCLEAR CRISIS Feb 2007 - North Korea agrees to close its main nuclear reactor in exchange for fuel aid June 2007 - North Korea shuts its main Yongbyon reactor June 2008 - North Korea makes its long - awaited declaration of nuclear assets Oct 2008 - The US removes North Korea from its list of countries which sponsor terrorism Dec 2008 - Pyongyang slows work to dismantle its nuclear programme after a US decision to suspend energy aid Jan 2009 - The North says it is scrapping all military and political deals with the South , accusing it of " hostile intent " 5 April 2009 - Pyongyang launches a rocket carrying what it says is a communications satellite 14 April 2009 - After criticism of the launch from the UN Security Council , North Korea vows to walk out of six - party talks
Engage , appease , oppose ?
N Korea a problem for Obama Timeline : North Korea
" It [ the North ] has requested the removal of all containment and surveillance equipment , following which , IAEA inspectors will no longer be provided access to the facility , " the statement said .
" The inspectors have also been asked to leave ... [ North Korea ] at the earliest possible time . "
In a strongly worded response , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs called on North Korea " to cease its provocative threats and to respect the will of the international community and to honour its international commitments and obligations .
He called the North Korean pledges to withdraw from long - running six - party talks and restart its nuclear programme " a serious step in the wrong direction " .
He defended the UN Security Council statement condemning the rocket launch .
Earlier , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the North 's move " unnecessary " and said she was hoping for opportunities for dialogue instead .
IAEA inspectors went to North Korea following the landmark February 2007 deal , under which it agreed to end its nuclear ambitions in return for aid and political incentives .
Some progress was made - last year North Korea partially disabled its Yongbyon reactor and handed over what it said was a complete declaration of its nuclear activities .
But talks have stalled in recent months , as Washington and Pyongyang accused each other of failing to meet obligations .
' Never again '
Hours after the UN Security Council issued a statement condemning its rocket launch on Monday , North Korea announced it was pulling out of talks - with the US , China , Russia , South Korea and Japan - on the deal .
" We will never again take part in such talks and will not be bound by any agreement reached at the talks , " a foreign ministry statement said .
China and Russia - the North 's neighbours and closest allies - have urged North Korea to reconsider its decision , with Beijing calling for " calm and restraint " .
Analysts say the action from North Korea appears to be an attempt to test the Obama administration and to force it to make fresh concessions .
North Korea carried out a nuclear test in October 2006 .

Nice hack :
Last year , when law professor Joel Reidenberg wanted to show his Fordham University class how readily private information is available on the Internet , he assigned a group project .
It was collecting personal information from the Web about himself .
This year , after U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia made public comments that seemingly may have questioned the need for more protection of private information , Reidenberg assigned the same project .
Except this time Scalia was the subject , the prof explains to the ABA Journal in a telephone interview .
His class turned in a 15 - page dossier that included not only Scalia ’s home address , home phone number and home value , but his food and movie preferences , his wife ’s personal e-mail address and photos of his grandchildren , reports Above the Law .
And , as Scalia himself made clear in a statement to Above the Law , he is n’t happy about the invasion of his privacy :
“ Professor Reidenberg ’s exercise is an example of perfectly legal , abominably poor judgment .
Since he was not teaching a course in judgment , I presume he felt no responsibility to display any , ” the justice says , among other comments .
Sotomayor 's trail of opinions paints a picture of a fair - minded , incisive legal scholar who is unafraid to stake out unpopular but legally meritorious positions .
Right - wingers are going to oppose her nomination with full force - we would be foolish to do it for them .
President Obama ’s nomination of Sonia Sotomayor for the
Supreme Court should shock no one .
What
is surprising is the relative lack of information about Sotomayor and one of
the most perennially controversial Constitutional issues : abortion rights .
In her time on the bench , Sotomayor ’s only major
abortion - related case was Center for Reproductive Law and Policy v. Bush – and her conclusion is n’t
going to warm the hearts of reproductive rights activists .
In that case , the
Center for Reproductive Law and Policy ( now the Center for Reproductive Rights )
challenged the Global Gag Rule , a policy which barred U.S. money from funding
any organization abroad that so much as mentioned abortion as an option or
advocated for abortion rights .
The
Center for Reproductive Law and Policy ( CRLP ) argued that the Gag Rule violated
their First Amendment , Equal Protection and Due Process rights .
On the First Amendment claim , CRLP argued
that the Gag Rule prevented the organization from fully communicating with
international non-governmental organizations ; if non-U.S. - based NGOs worked
with CRLP to advocate for abortion rights in their own countries , they would
lose U.S. funding .
Thus , the Gag Rule’s
speech - chilling effect prevented CRLP , a domestic organization , from carrying
out their mission , thereby curtailing their freedoms of speech and
association .
CRLP also argued that the
Gag Rule violated their Fifth Amendment Equal Protection rights by privileging
anti-abortion views and putting the CRLP on unequal footing when it comes to
domestic competition with anti-choice organizations , and violated CRLP ’s Due
Process rights by , as Sotomayor summarized in her opinion , " failing to give clear notice of what speech and
activities they prohibit and by encouraging arbitrary and discriminatory
enforcement . "
The Second Circuit ruled against CRLP , and Sotomayor was the
judge who penned the decision .
She held
that that a previous case — Planned
Parenthood Federation of America ,
Inc. v. Agency for International Development – " not only controls
this case conceptually ; it presented the same issue . "
In that case :
This
Court rejected the challenge on the merits , finding " no constitutional
rights implicated " by the Policy and the Standard Clause .
Planned
Parenthood , 915 F.2d at 66 .
The Court reasoned that the domestic NGOs
remained free to use their own funds to pursue abortion - related activities in
foreign countries and that " [t ] he harm alleged in the complaint is the
result of choices made by foreign NGOs to take AID ’s money rather than engage
in non-AID funded cooperative efforts with plaintiffs - appellants . "
Id. at 64 .
" Such an incidental effect " on the activities of the domestic NGOs ,
the Court held , did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation .
Id . The Court
concluded that " the Standard Clause does not prohibit
plaintiffs - appellants from exercising their first amendment rights . "
Id .
Moreover , the
Court explained that whatever one might think of the Mexico City Policy ,
" the wisdom of , and motivation behind , this policy are not justiciable
issues , " and the Court found the restrictions to be rationally related to
the " otherwise nonjusticiable decision limiting the class of beneficiaries
of foreign aid . "
Id .
at 64 - 65 .
Having rejected plaintiffs ’ claims on the merits , this Court declined
to address the question of whether plaintiffs had standing under Article III .
Id. at 66 .

The First
Amendment claim was dismissed because the issue had already been decided in the Planned Parenthood case .
The Due Process claim was dismissed for lack
of prudential standing , because CRLP ’s complaint did not fall within the " zone
of interests " protected by the Due Process Clause – it was a third party ( the
foreign NGOs ) , not CRLP , whose rights are constitutionally unclear because of
the Gag Rule .
The Equal Protection claim
was dismissed because the Gag Rule ’s privileging of anti-abortion views did not
infringe upon a fundamental Constitutional right or target a suspect class
( legalese for a classification of groups which have historically been subject
to discrimination , and therefore receive increased scrutiny under the Equal
Protection Clause ) ; further , Sotomayor pointed out that " the Supreme Court has
made clear that the government is free to favor the anti-abortion position over
the pro-choice position , and can do so with public funds . "
The Center for
Reproductive Law and Policy lost the case , and the Global Gag Rule continued to
compromise women ’s health around the globe until Barack Obama took office .
That outcome
disheartened feminists , liberals and reproductive justice advocates , and I wish
it had been decided differently .
But the
decision was n’t necessarily a bad one – and it absolutely should not stop
progressive women ’s rights activists from supporting her nomination .
If anything , CRLP v. Bush highlights precisely why
Sotomayor should , in a sane world , be an easy confirmation :
She sticks to the
rule of law , respects precedent and writes thoughtful and reasoned
opinions .
She was nominated to the
federal district court by George H.W. Bush .
Her decisions are left - leaning insofar as she generally seeks to protect
Constitutional rights by supporting religious freedom and free speech , and she
often sides with the plaintiffs in discrimination cases – hardly " activist "
material .
But she ’s not a liberal dream
by any stretch .
She has some bad First
Amendment cases to her name ( Doninger
v. Niehoff , where she sided with a school that disqualified a student
from running for senior class secretary after the student posted a vulgar
school - related message on her blog ) , and some bad Fourth Amendment ones ( United
States v. Howard , where she held it was constitutional for state
troopers to entice suspects away from their cars in order to allow other
troopers to search the vehicles for drugs ) .
Those cases , though , are the exceptions rather than the rule ; generally ,
Sotomayor follows a fairly consistent Constitutional philosophy , and errs on
the side of maintaining rather than limiting rights .
Given her
history , it ’s hard to grasp why conservatives brand her " a liberal
activist of the first order who thinks her own personal political agenda is
more important than the law as written , " as Wendy
E. Long , counsel to the right - wing Judicial Confirmation Network , put it .
Sotomayor has clearly and consistently
deferred to " the law as written " — she ’s considerably less activist and
dogmatic than Bush ’s two Supreme Court appointees , John Roberts and Samual
Alito .
Unfortunately for conservatives ,
the law as written does affirm the rights to speak without governmental
intervention , to practice your religion freely , to be free from state - sponsored
religious exercises , to maintain your privacy , and to retain certain
protections even if you are a suspected criminal or a criminal defendant .
Sotomayor has embraced free speech rights even where the
speech was abhorrent ( an NYPD officer mailing anonymous bigoted and racist materials
to charities requesting donations ) ; stood up for victims of race , gender , age
and disability discrimination ; and dissented
when the Second Circuit rejected a challenge to the New York law that
disenfranchises convicted felons .
She is
by most accounts an intellectually gifted , hard - working and highly experienced
judge .
So while there is unfortunately
little to go on with regard to her views on abortion rights , we know that
Sotomayor is a smart , capable left - leaning moderate .
She ’s not going to undo
years of a conservative court alone but she is highly qualified and undoubtedly
progressive .
Sotomayor would not have been my first choice , primarily
because my political leanings are far to the left of her legal theory .
But I ’ll be supporting her whole - heartedly .
Her trail of opinions paints a picture of a
fair - minded , incisive legal scholar who is unafraid to stake out unpopular but
legally meritorious positions .
Right - wingers are going to oppose her nomination with full force – we
would be foolish to do it for them .
From Conservapedia
The National Health Service ( NHS ) is the United Kingdom 's nationalized health care system .
It was established in 1948 as part of Clement Attlee 's post - World War II Labour government 's socialist program , and has been supported ( at least publicly ) by politicians of every party since then .
The wealthy in Britain typically use private health insurance , for which there are tax breaks , [ 1 ] while the general public and some politicians use the NHS system . [ 2 ]
As pharmaceutical companies began rationing drugs since 2008 , the British healthcare system faces drug stortages in 2012 .
Officials within their health care system warned about a severe shortage of pharmaceuticals , putting patients ' lives at risk . [ 3 ]
The NHS is nominally funded out of " National Insurance contributions " , a form of personal taxation comparable to the US Social Security system , albeit capped below average earnings .
The NHS revenue stream is , in theory , entirely separate in operation from income tax .
[ 4 ]
In practice , the NHS is funded from general taxation , and is accepted by the British electorate as being funded in this way .
All prescription medicines ( however not over - the - counter ones ) are available for a low standard fee in England .
Prescriptions are entirely free of charge in Wales .
[ 5 ]
NHS treatment is available to all residents of the UK .
Most services , including complex and expensive surgical procedures and drugs , are free at the point of use , and those that are not ( such as the provision of glasses and dental care ) are free to people on low incomes .
This ensures that everyone is able to be treated , no matter what their individual wealth or means may be .
[ 6 ]
" Private " ( i.e. non-NHS ) doctors and hospitals do exist in Britain , but fewer than 10 % of Britons choose to buy private health insurance in preference to using the NHS .
( The big exception to this is in the area of dental care : NHS dentists are relatively difficult to find in many areas , and many people are forced to " go private " , even if uninsured . )
The NHS is Britain 's largest direct and indirect employer with 1.3 million workers .
It is not , despite maverick MEP Daniel Hannan 's assertion , the second largest employer in the world .
[ 7 ]
This cradle - to - grave entitlement costs Britain $ 158 billion ( USD ) per year .
Britain ’s Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron is looking to reform the state - run health - care system , which he called " second - rate " due to the program ’s massive cost and lackluster performance . [ 8 ]
Rationing
Official figures published in 2009 revealed that more than 230,000 patients are being forced to wait more than 18 weeks for hospital treatment .
[ 9 ]
As a result of its comprehensive coverage , the resources of the NHS have been consistently tightly stretched for many years , leading to lengthy waiting lists for everything from dental work to surgery .
This was the case in the 1980s and 1990s in particular .
Since 1997 , the NHS has benefited from substantially increased spending under the Labour Party , but there is a perception among many in Britain that the extra money has not been well spent or delivered appropriate improvements .
Read more about " Delay , Denial and Dilution , The Impact of NHS Rationing on Heart Disease and Cancer . " [ 10 ]
Poor quality care
One million NHS patients have been the victims of appalling care in hospitals across Britain , according to a major report released Aug. 27 , 2009 .
In the last six years , says the Patients Association , hundreds of thousands have suffered from poor standards of nursing , often with ' neglectful , demeaning , painful and sometimes downright cruel ' treatment . [ 11 ]
Many critics , including Daniel Hannan , have expressed serious concern over the failure of the NHS in providing Britain with an acceptable health care .
Criticism included the immense wasteful costs of the NHS , shortage of doctors and other vital employees , lack of available care , and poor quality of facilities and care .
However , in 2009 , according to the OECD 's Health Data report , Britain was found to spend less public money per capita on health provision than the USA , despite NHS care being free at the point of need for all citizens , and the USA system requiring citizens to also pay for private insurance .
Life expectancy in the USA is less than that in Britain . [ 12 ]
NICE
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) proudly boasts of " Developing a series of national clinical guidelines to secure consistent , high quality , evidence based care for patients . "
NICE is responsible for giving advice which effectively rations the supply of government provided treatments and drugs .
It does this by a careful and complicated consideration of Quality Adjusted Life Years ( the QALY ) , taking into account how a particular treatment affects this figure on average .
Ultimately the number of dollars per QALY is what dictates whether a medicine is then made available via the NHS .
These decisions are inevitably controversial at times and some even go so far as to accuse them of denying life saving medication . [ 13 ]
All party support
The NHS is supported by politicians of all parties in the UK , but is widely regarded as the child of the Labour Party , and inspires particular affection in the supporters of this party .
All post World War II governments have consistently supported the National Health Service .
British voters take great pride in what they regard as the free provision of basic human needs such as healthcare and schooling .
Many politicians including Margaret Thatcher have worked to reform the National Health Service and make it more efficient . [ 14 ]
However , perhaps due to its overwhelming size and entrenched popularity , this has continued to be a difficult and controversial task .

( CNN ) -- A U.S. soldier convicted of murdering an Iraqi family spoke out for the first time Thursday , issuing a public apology for his crimes .
Former U.S. soldier Steven Green got life in prison after being convicted of murdering four Iraqis .
Steven Green , who escaped the death penalty this month , told relatives of the victims that he is " truly sorry for what I did in Iraq . "
" I helped to destroy a family and end the lives of four of my fellow human beings , and I wish that I could take it back , but I cannot , " Green said , reading a statement at a victim impact hearing .
" And , as inadequate as this apology is , it is all I can give you . "
The family refused to accept the apology .
Green was found guilty in U.S. District Court in Kentucky of raping a 14 - year - old girl and murdering her , her parents and her 6 - year - old sister in the town of Yusufiya , about 20 miles south of Baghdad , in 2006 .
A jury could not reach a unanimous decision on the death penalty , which means the judge is required under law to impose a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole .
Green will be sentenced September 4 , but the victim impact hearing was held Thursday so surviving members of the al - Janabi family could testify before they return to Iraq .
They decried Green 's sentence and testified about how the heinous crime had shattered their lives and how it will haunt them always .
Green said that he knows " you wish I was dead , and I do not hold that against you .
If I was in your place , I am convinced beyond any doubt that I would feel the same way . "
He added , " I know that I have done evil , and I fear that the wrath of the Lord will come upon me on that day .
But , I hope that you and your family at least can find some comfort in God 's justice . "
The wailing family matriarch , Hajia al - Janabi , lunged at Green as she left the witness stand , denouncing him as a coward , a criminal and a stigma on the United States , according to Louisville 's Courier - Journal newspaper .
Security officers restrained the distressed woman , the newspaper said .
Another family member , Mahdi al - Janabi , said Green had lost the ability to distinguish between terrorists and Iraqi civilians .
Green was tried in a civilian court in Paducah , Kentucky , because he had been discharged from the Army by the time his crimes surfaced .
He was the last of five soldiers who served in the 101st Airborne Division , based at Fort Campbell , Kentucky , to be convicted for the crimes and their subsequent cover-up .
The others -- Spec. James Barker , Sgt. Paul Cortez , Pfc. Jesse Spielman and Pfc. Bryan Howard -- received sentences ranging from 27 months to 110 years , with the possibility of parole in 10 years in the most severe cases .
Green said he now sees the Iraq war as " intrinsically evil , because killing is intrinsically evil . "
He was sorry , he said , that he ever had anything to do with either .

Executive Summary ( für die Guttenbergs unter uns ) : Der Zweck heiligt nicht die Mittel .
In den gestrigen Nachrichtenbeiträgen der Tagesschau hat unser neuer Wirtschaftsminister mit fogendem denkwürdigen Satz seine bisherige Unkenntnis der Gründe des Protests dokumentiert .
„ Es macht mich schon sehr betroffen , wenn pauschal der Eindruck entstehen sollte , dass es Menschen gibt , die sich gegen die Sperrung von kinderpornographischen Inhalten sträuben “
Bemerkenswerterweise kann man dem so wörtlich sogar zustimmen :
Wenn pauschal der Eindruck entstehen sollte , dass die Gegner des vorliegenden Gesetzentwurfs Menschen seien , die sich gegen die Sperrung kinderpornografischer Inhalte sperren , dann machte mich das ebenfalls sehr betroffen .
Nur leider läßt seine Kabinettskollegin von der Leyen keinen Versuch aus , genau diesen Eindruck zu erwecken und befindet sich damit in der CDU in bester Gesellschaft .
Nun , Herr Guttenberg , nehmen
Sie also bitte die beiden folgenden wesentlichen inhaltlichen Kritikpunkte an dem Vorhaben zur Kenntnis :
1 ) Der Gesetzentwurf verstößt in offensichtlicher Weise gegen die Prinzipien des Rechtsstaat und der Gewaltenteilung :
Eine geheime Sperrliste beim BKA , vom BKA erzeugt und geführt und durch das BKA vollstreckt ist methodisch im Bereich totalitärer Staaten anzusiedeln .
Es Bedarf einer richterlichen ständigen Überprüfung aller gelisteten Adressen und einer Auskunfts - und Widerspruchsmöglichkeit , gerade weil wir bereits aus der Erfahrung anderer Staaten wissen , dass die weitaus meisten unterdrückten Websites von unschuldigen Bürgern betrieben werden und ausschliesslich mit völlig legalen Inhalten bestückt sind .
Sich bei der Argumentation für eine solche Liste ausschliesslich auf Informationen des BKAs selbst zu verlassen , zeugt zudem von einer Blauäugigkeit , die demokratiegefährdend ist .
2 ) Das Ausblenden von Webseiten ( durch DNS - Manipulation ) ist gänzlich ungeeignet zur Bekämpfung von Kinderpornografie .
Mit dem Aufstellen von Stoppschildern wird überhaupt nichts bekämpft , es wird nur etwas unzureichend ausgeblendet .
Jeder , der sich auch nur 20 Minuten mit dem Thema ernsthaft befasst weiß :
dass das öffentliche WWW gar nicht der Schauplatz von Kinderpornografie ist
dass das Herausreißen von Seiten aus Telefonbüchern ( DNS ) nicht das gleiche ist wie die Sperrung eines Telefonanschlusses
dass pädophiles Verhalten nicht durch ‚ Anfixen ‘ entsteht
dass bei Bekanntsein von solchen Internetangeboten eine Bekämpfung darin bestünde , dass man die Seiten und das Material vom Netz nimmt und die Schuldigen strafrechtlich verfolgt , und nicht stattdessen ein Stoppschild davor stellt , das die Betreiber warnt und eine Bekämpfung sogar erschweren kann .
darin bestünde , dass man die Seiten und das Material vom Netz nimmt und die Schuldigen strafrechtlich verfolgt , und nicht stattdessen ein Stoppschild davor stellt , das die Betreiber warnt und eine Bekämpfung sogar erschweren kann .
dass der tatsächliche Mißbrauch der Kinder selbst durch die ( hypothetische ) völlige Ausblendung seiner Dokumentationen in keiner Weise bestraft , gesühnt oder auch nur verfolgt wird .
Es ist sehr bedauerlich , dass man dem Gesetzgeber immer öfter die Grundlagen unseres Staates vorhalten muss , wie hier das Verhältnismäßigkeitsprinzip .
Es verlangt von jeder Maßnahme , die in Grundrechte eingreift , dass sie einen legitimen öffentlichen Zweck verfolgt und überdies geeignet , erforderlich und verhältnismäßig im engeren Sinn ( auch „ angemessen “ genannt ) ist .
Es macht mich schon sehr betroffen , wenn pauschal der Eindruck entstehen sollte , dass es Minister gibt , die sich gegen die Einhaltung rechtsstaatlicher Prinzipien sträuben .
Ok , I found this video on making something he calls “ hot ice ” , now immediately you know it ’s not ice but something that looks like ice but
is actually hot .
What he ’s got here is something called “ sodium acetate ” , which you can not only easily buy online but you can also make it at home ( links to where to buy sodium acetate and a video on how to make it are below ) .
I initially thought “ meh , maybe cool but probably not enough to warrant the effort to do this ” , then I saw the sculpting he did with
it by pouring the liquid out which immediately transforms into crystals ( watch the video , you ’ll understand ) and then saw how it actually crystallized as he was pouring it up into the glass , and thought “ ok this is very cool , I like it , I ’m posting this . ”
So here ’s the first video :
Ok , now I ’ve come up with 3 different ways in which you can obtain sodium acetate : you can buy it online in its pure form , you can get it
from hand warmers , or you can make it yourself at home out of baking soda and vinegar .
If I had to pick one I ’d go with the hand warmers because you can just go out to the store and buy them , then cut them open and voila you ’ve got pure sodium acetate .
Here ’s some handwarmers that contain sodium acetate : EZ Heat Reusable Hand Warmers
( contain sodium acetate and water ) .
You could also just buy the pure stuff from an online chemical supply company , I ’ve found a place here that ’ll sell you 100 grams ( should be plenty ) for just $ 8 : Sodium Acetate at ScienceCompany.com .
Now , if you ’ve decided that you want to make your own at home from baking soda and vinegar , here ’s an excellent guide from Instructables.com :

Additional Resources and Further Reading
Transform Hand Warmers to Liquid Ice Sculptures from PopSci.com ( very interesting , they compare sodium acetate to a sort of “ real - world Ice - 9 ” , ice - 9 being the stuff from Kurt Vonnegut ’s novel Cat ’s Cradle that ends up eventually destroying the world ) .
In an opinion piece published today in the European Voice ( Brussels ) , John Holmes noted that while donors have pledged money , the flow of goods is “ wholly inadequate and reconstruction is almost impossible . ”
Roughly 75 per cent of Gaza ’s 1.5 million residents require assistance , but even the most essential imports are subject to intense limitations by Israeli authorities , he pointed out .
“ In Gaza , humanity has taken a back seat to politics .
A measly trickle of items has become the most the world can offer civilians trapped by a political stalemate , ” wrote Mr. Holmes , who serves as Under - Secretary - General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator .
“ While Israel has primary responsibility for this terrible crisis of human dignity , Hamas is also to blame because of the indiscriminate and pointless rocket attacks it committed and allowed for so long , ” he added .
Israel conducted a three - week military offensive in Gaza beginning on 27 December with the stated aim of ending rocket attacks by Hamas and other groups .
The violence killed at least 1,300 Palestinians and wounded some 5,300 , and reduced homes , schools , hospitals and marketplaces to rubble .
Mr. Holmes stressed the need to reopen border crossings to all essential humanitarian and reconstruction goods .
In addition , the relief workers currently applying for authorisation to work in Gaza must be recognised and respected by Hamas and Israel as independent and autonomous actors .
“ Protection , food , water , healthcare and shelter are basic human needs , not bargaining chips , ” he stated .
“ That fact must be recognised by all parties responsible for the immense suffering in Gaza . ”
Walter Shapiro from Politics Daily imagined the first 100 days under President John McCain .
Ross Douthat , newly of the New York Times , pondered the potential of a Dick Cheney run for the Presidency in 2008 .
With the world wrapped up in Obama hagiography , the natural conclusion of Mr. Shapiro 's and Mr. Douthat 's magical thinking is to envision the grandeur of the first 100 days of Dick Cheney 's White House .
The Cheney White House is n't buying into the 100 - day measure of the success of the newly - minted administration , but they 're more than happy to talk up the President 's accomplishments .
White House press secretary Charles Krauthammer described the 100 - day metric as a " lie " at a press briefing Tuesday .
" Measurements of time are a liberal lie designed to undermine the sanctity and security of the State of Israel , " Krauthammer explained .
Even so , a senior official in the Cheney White House spoke to us on the condition of anonymity .
" These are trying times and the President is often swimming upstream against a do - nothing democrat party .
That 's not an excuse .
President Cheney has done more in the first 100 days of his administration than any other president , and under difficult circumstances . "
So how has President Cheney fared ?
What are his accomplishments ?
The unnamed official afforded us with a list inscribed on scrolled vellum and sealed with wax bearing the impression of the Presidential Signet .
Cheney 's most embarrassing moment ?
A London visit nearly turned bad when Cheney reached for the Queen 's hand , forgetting his subdermal venom injectors .
Setting a timetable for the withdrawal of all US combat forces from Iraq and the handover of total authority to the Iraqi government .
50,000 troops are expected to return home by the summer of 2010 and all troops will be moved to Iran by no later than 2011 .
Canceled the new presidential helicopters , saving the taxpayers over $ 15 billion .
Announced plans for a presidential nuclear submarine , a presidential rocket ice sled , a presidential dirigible , and a presidential star gate .
The cost is classified , therefore it does not count .
Passed the Fair Tax , setting all brackets at a flat 15 % tax rate .
Passed the Fairer Tax , reducing the top two tax brackets to 10 % .
Passed the Unbelievably Awesome and Excellently Fair Superior Tax for Hero Patriots of America , which reduced the tax rate of the top 1 % of income earners to , " The amount in silver dollars that can be grasped in a child 's hand . "
Helped craft the Freedom Hands
Act , which will remove all children 's hands by 2012 and stimulate the economy by employing some 80,000 new limb technicians .
It may also prevent them from grasping at precious silver coins earned by honest adult men through hard toil in the pharmaceutical lobbying and gray projects development industries .
President Cheney and Senator Nelson ( R - NE ) marvel at these fat little hands that must have hid in pockets to not be free .
Protected the US automakers from insolvency by purchasing all automaker stock with a holding corporation and overseeing the streamlining of their operations during the economic downturn .
The holding corporation , REDACTED , has currently employed almost 200,000 people in Kyrgyzstan to build popular American brands like The Corbette , Plymouth Vonager , The Cark , Diesel Cark , and new Green Cark Hybrex .
General Morors Toyota Carby and Adult Van will be available soon with factories in REDACTED tribal region .

General Morors Toyota Carby and Adult Van will be available soon with factories in tribal region .
Passed the largest economic stimulus package in US history based entirely on human organ harvesting and bullets .
Lifted the ban on federal funding of stem cell research and redirected all funds and stem cell scientists to a secret medical project based in the Nevada desert .
Terrible screams can be heard for many miles in the cold , starry night .
Resisted the urge and did not invade any new countries , California .
Vector Team Crimson apprehend suspects for interrogation during Operation Franken .
Many critics of the administration , particularly those who have had family members mysteriously disappear recently , were quick to add to the list of Cheney 's achievements .
MSNBC's Chuck Todd , shaking slightly and with the left side of his face paralyzed by a stroke he suffered during a marathon nine hour interview with CIA analysts , offered President Cheney 's handling of Somali pirates earlier in the month .
Four Somali pirates hijacked the ship Maersk Alabama , taking her captain hostage and escaping to a lifeboat .
An American warship soon arrived on the scene , only to find the four pirates had been garroted and the captain was only lightly wounded in both legs and his lesser neck area by envenomed crystal shards fired from some sort of bio gun .
It was later revealed that President Cheney ordered the daring rescue be carried out by Vector Team Crimson , the most elite of the Vector Teams .
As if to underscore the extraordinary nature of President Cheney 's first 100 days in office , Democratic Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska announced that he would be switching to the Republican Party .
Citing " ideological differences " and the recent disappearances of more than 57 Democratic congressmen and women , Senator Nelson wept with what we are told was joy .
Some suspect the switch may have been finally prompted by the arrest of longtime friend Joseph Biden ( D - DE ) for his violations of the Addington - Bybee Act forbidding eye contact with the President .
Whether you think the President is doing a great job or you are one of the critics who believes President Cheney is doing a very good job , you can rest assured that the next 100 days will be as eventful as the first .

There are times when I sit in amazement as the Federal Government grows and grows in size and scope .
And just when I think there has to be some pause in the growth of this beast , yet another entitlement program is proposed .
Yesterday , it was announced that the Federal Government was increasing the number of IRS agents to investigate you and I .
Obama is hiring 800 more IRS agents .
[ link edited for length ]
President Obama anounced today that he is going to “ fundamentally change our approach to unemployment in this country ” .
Now we have the Department of Education combining efforts with the Department of Labor to make it easier for the unemployed ( nearly 9 % and rising despite the continued hiring by the Federal Government ) to receive Pell Grants up to $ 5350 for training and education .
Pell Grants are not paid back , as student loans are .
Pell Grants will become yet another way to redistrubute wealth from those that have produced it .
http://www.breitbart.com/
In addition , the Obama Administration is pressuring states to rewrite their unemployment laws so that instead of searching for a job to continue receiving benefits , you can go to school and continue receiving the benefits .
If this plan makes it to fruition , we will have seen established the entitlement to be paid by the government while going to school .
Obama calls the rules that do not allow you to collect unemployment while going to school and not looking for a job “ senseless ” .
I ask you when will you have seen enough ?
When will you begin to believe that the only objective is a socialized America ?
Do we sit back and allow the Federal Government to create such disarray in the private sector , then “ rescue ” people from that disarray by more and more government intervention ?
Are we unable to see that this path only has one destination : Socialism .
Today 's employment numbers speak volumes about where we are headed .
Government hired the most people in April .
The rest of the economy continues to shrink as the business environment continues to deteriorate .
Those left in business will be forced to pay more to support more as they earn less .
Then we are told that things are going to be better soon .
Once again , I ask what is happening in the economy that is making the business environment more likely to improve ?
More regulation , more taxes , and higher labor costs are on the way .
Do you really believe that by increasing the burden on the private sector economy that we are going to improve the economic conditions here ?
I do not think so .
Quarterly corporate earnings are down .
Way down .
You hear in the media that they are beating estimates .
But to beat an estimate that is 1 / 2 of what last year 's quarterly earnings is not an indicator of an improving economy .
It only tells you the analysts are about as accurate as the weather man , and that neither are paid on the basis of their accuracy .
I have taken the time to go through ValueLine and compare the most recent quarterly earnings for corporations versus their earnings a year ago .
Here are the results by sectors from companies profiled recently in ValueLine :
Electrical Equipment : Up 4 Down 14
Electronics : Up 5 Down 20
Semiconductor : Up 4 Down 30
Semiconductor Equipment : Up 0 Down 15
Computer & Peripherals : Up 7 Down 19
Office Equipment & Supplies : Up1 Down 9
Food Processing : Up 19 Down 19
Grocery Stores : Up 5 Down 4
Food Wholesalers : Up 3 Down 3
Manufactured Housing : Up 0 Down 4
Entertainment Technology : Up 3 Down 13
Reinsurance : Up 2 Down 6
Machinery : Up 11 Down 40
Diversified Companies : Up 8 Down 24
( If you want more information on the analysis above , let me know .
This is my own grunt work through the pages of Value Line )
The only sectors up are food and groceries .
Why ?
We are eating at home more often .
Now we are going to sit back and watch people collect unemployment while they are not looking for work ?
Have you seen enough of where we are heading ?
Or is it too late ?
What are your thoughts ?
Are you ready to subsidize your fellow citizens as they borrow even more funds to go to school while collecting unemployment ?
Or are you asking yourself how you can join their ranks , collect unemployment , borrow some money from the government , and go back to school .
Are you ready to shrug ?
I am .
Is America a Christian Nation ?
What Both Left and Right Get Wrong
tags : Christian nation
Mr. Fea teaches American history at Messiah College in Grantham , Pennsylvania , and is a writer for the History News Service .
Americans love their history , but seldom think historically .
The problem is not that they do n't pay enough attention to history .
Americans spend millions each year on heritage vacations and history books .
Politicians and pundits use history to justify their views .
The problem is a common propensity to mangle the past to suit current needs , a sort of indoctrination by historical example .
Too many believe that the study of distant societies and events is worthless unless it is somehow useful to prove a current point .
So what do they do when the past disappoints ?
Or when historians tell them something in the past that does n't conform to the way they view the world ?
Ideally , when this happens they should follow the evidence and do their best to tell stories that reflect the past in all its complexity .
But this is hard to do .
Consider the current debate over the relationship between Christianity and the founding of the United States .
Over the last two years I 've given several public lectures that tried to answer the question of whether the United States was founded as a Christian nation .
I never know how my audiences will respond to my presentation , especially since I am a Christian who teaches at a church - related college .
But I 'm sure that most are more interested in having their answer to this question confirmed by historical data than in being confronted with a past that they find uncomfortable .
Those who insist that America was founded as a Christian nation run roughshod over the historical record .
They use the words of the Founding Fathers to support Republican jeremiads on the moral decay of American life .
If only this country could return to its Christian roots , they say nostalgically , everything would be okay .
And how do they demonstrate that America was founded as a Christian nation ?
By selectively choosing texts from the writings of the Founders without any effort to explore them in the context of the 18th - century world in which they were written .
Just because John Adams and George Washington quoted from the Bible or made reference to God does not mean that they were trying to construct a Christian nation .
Granted , the Founding Fathers were the products of a Christian culture , but most of them were never comfortable with the beliefs that defined this culture .
Very few of them would qualify for membership in today 's evangelical churches .
Even so , the leaders of the Christian Right have demonstrated that they can find a useable past in the words of the Founders .
A recent survey by Vanderbilt University 's First Amendment Center found that 74 percent of Republicans and 50 percent of Democrats believe that the U.S. Constitution established a Christian nation .
Jerry Falwell and D. James Kennedy , recently deceased evangelical leaders who led in promoting the idea that America is a Christian nation , did their work well .
But before we go too far in condemning the Christian Right on this front , let 's remember that the secular left is not immune to errors of historical thinking .
While evangelicals misinterpret the references to God in the words of the Founding Fathers , their critics simply have no idea what to make of those same quotations .
Since they can't fathom why people today would make religious faith an essential part of their everyday lives , they have little interest in making sense of past worlds where such beliefs were important .
Such approaches to history seldom enable us to better understand the past .
Thinking historically does not mean that people cannot learn from the past -- they should and must .
But they should be careful how they use historical examples .
Exploring the past requires a concern for what it was really like .
The past is like a foreign country .
Those who enter it as guests should try to understand its foreignness in a way that respects our dead ancestors who inhabit it .
We must not invade the past with the goal of remaking it into our own image .
The past may not always be useful when we want to invoke it .
But only when we confront it head - on , without preconceived agendas , will we be able to learn from it and let it transform us .
This is the lesson that both the Christian Right and some of its secular opponents need to take to heart .

craig alan ward - 10/7/2010 No. the bible teaches that satan and his devils are believers and believe with great trembleing and fear .
Just because some one says he believes does not make him christlike .
The founding fathers preached and practiced racism , slavery , and genocide .
Action speaks louder than words .
If anything they were hypocrits .
According to JESUS a hypocrit shall recieve the greater damnation .

This article really sums it up ...
America 's Heritage : Are we a Christian Nation ?
Mississippi Governor Kirk Fordice 's comment that America is a " Christian nation " touched off a storm of controversy in November ( 1992 ) .
Fordice 's comment came during a meeting of Republican leaders after President Bush 's loss to Bill Clinton .
The remark was meant to remind people that Christian principles were important in the formation of our nation and continue to be important to the majority of Americans .
The fact that this statement should cause controversy foretells a coming resurgence of debate over the role of Christianity in determining public policy in America .
It is also foretells a re-examination of our national roots - a focus that is much needed at a crucial juncture in our history .
America has lost the roots of its heritage .
To recover the quality of life we knew as our kind of Western Civilization , we must rediscover the source and determine to re-establish these teachings as guidelines of conduct in every facet of our lives and teach them to our children .
What are those mysterious principles discovered by the Founding Fathers that made this a great country , envied by so many that millions endured hardship to enter and gain the freedoms , safety and opportunities found here and almost nowhere else on earth ?
The answers two generations ago were taught with pride to every child in home , school and church .
But somehow we have lost our way .
It is imperative that we retrace our steps , learn how we became lost and recapture our inheritance through knowledge and dedication .
The United States of America is not a Christian country or state .
The writers of the Constitution said , very wisely , that " Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , prohibiting the free exercise thereof . "
In other words , there will be no state church ( such as the Church of England ) , but the people may worship according to their wishes , anytime and anywhere .
A " country " is a geographical area inhabited by a certain people under a particular political government .
However , the United States of America is a Christian nation .
A nation is an aggregation of people bound together " by common ideals and a common purpose .
A rich inheritance of memories and the desire to preserve those memories ... a nation is a spiritual entity brought into existence by complex historical conditions , by similar traditions and a similar imagination . "
A nation is not produced by a common language , race , religion or geographical outline , but these things may contribute to the unity of a people - a nation .
Several different " nations " make up the Yugoslavia of today .
The Jewish people were a " nation " during the 40 years they wandered in the wilderness but they had no land of their own .
Our Declaration of Independence and Constitution are based on Judeo - Christian teachings .
The textbook of these teachings in the Holy Bible .
It is the " Owners Manual " or " The Book of Instructions " for our nation .
The Founding Fathers and many others in position of authority ever since have recertified that fact .
" America is a Christian nation . "
This does not mean that all the people were or are Christian .
It merely means that there was a Christian consensus and all our founding documents , laws , moral codes and institutions are based on Christian principles from the Bible .

The U.S. is NOT founded on Christian principles or philosophy .
It is founded on HERMETIC principles of the alchemists , passed to Freemasons through the Rosicrucian Brotherhood .
For an in - depth look at these facts , read my essay at :

Granted that we - the nations - speak of each other this way , but is this OBJECTIVELY the character , the political form of government that each nation subscribes to ?
Is it part of their constitution - their governmental makeup ?
Besides , the Lord does n't view ANY nation as " Christian " - only
His people ( wherever they may be ) as a " holy nation " ( Exo 19:6 ; 1 Pet 2:9 ) .
James Renwick Manship - 10/18/2007
In the same way that Saudi Arabia , Iraq and many other countries are labeled as Moslem even though there are Christians and Jews who live within their borders , and Israel is a Jewish nation even though there are Christians and Moslems in their borders , America is a Christian nation that has Moslems , Jews , Buddhists , Hindis , and even Wiccans within its borders .
Sometimes too much " larnin ' " can be an handicap to understanding the truth .
Joseph C. Douglas - 10/12/2007
The author says the " left " is misunderstanding the Christian past too , but of course the author has no evidence to support his claim .
More BS from a GOP parrott I say .
Just another hack with no evidence or arguments to stand on .
This is a load of rubbish .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
This is a very well done article .
Basic and bare - bones , perhaps , but we need that from time to time .
One could only wish that HNN would make at least a minimal attempt to stick to its own stated and purported principles and avoid what Fea calls the " propensity to mangle the past to suit current needs , a sort of indoctrination by historical example . "
A minority of pieces here , but a very large minority - thousands now in total over the life of HNN , are atrocious examples of exactly that .

The writer made it quite clear that * every time * evangelicals try to cherry - pick through the writings of the Founding Fathers to bolster their own views , they are wrong , because the Founding Fathers specifically did not create America to be a Xian country .
He did n't need to post specific examples .
Susan Cohen - 10/2/2007
I have to agree that this was a strikingly " off " note in an otherwise fine article .
Tim Matthewson - 10/1/2007 Alan Dershowitz , Blasphemy , provides abundant evidence of why and how the Christian Right is attempting to hijack the Founding Fathers on behalf of the notion that the US is a Christian nation .
The problems is that the CR is simply wrong , as Dershowitz shows .
Mackie Joseph - Venet Blanton - 10/1/2007
" The problem is a common propensity to mangle the past to suit current needs , a sort of indoctrination by historical example .
Too many believe that the study of distant societies and events is worthless unless it is somehow useful to prove a current point .
" So what do they do when the past disappoints ?
Or when historians tell them something in the past that does n't conform to the way they view the world ?
Ideally , when this happens they should follow the evidence and do their best to tell stories that reflect the past in all its complexity .
But this is hard to do .
" Consider the current debate over the relationship between Christianity and the founding of the United States .
Over the last two years I 've given several public lectures that tried to answer the question of whether the United States was founded as a Christian nation . "
This is a perspicacious observation , is n't it ?
Nonetheless , I am at a lost to understand why we were not given examples of where the evangelicals are wrong .
Why make such a pointed observation but give no concrete examples ?
If our author has lectured on this topic several times over , why not a link to these lectured texts ?
More to the point , why have n't we been given some of the evidentiary content of the arguments already presented elsewhere ?
I feel thoroughly unrequited as a willing reader .
