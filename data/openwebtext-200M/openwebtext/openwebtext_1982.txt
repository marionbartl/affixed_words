Congressman Robert Wexler of Florida announced on Friday that he along with two other members of the House Judiciary Committee , Luis Gutierrez of Illinois and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin , were calling for immediate hearings on the impeachment of Vice President Dick Cheney .
Their joint statement declared , “ These charges are too serious to ignore .
There is credible evidence that the Vice President abused the power of his office , and not only brought us into an unnecessary war but violated the civil liberties and privacy of American citizens .
It is the constitutional duty of Congress to hold impeachment hearings . ”
A statement on the prominent Democrats.com reflects the tragedy of the supplicant , fearful mainstream media at the present time :
“ The three Democrats wrote an op -ed to announce their position , but none of the nation ’s leading newspapers would publish it – just as they refuse to include impeachment in the polls , and just as they refuse to publish their own investigations of the crimes of the Bush Administration .
Why ?
Because the corporate owned media is a wholly - owned subsidiary to the Republican Party , as it has been since the Reagan Revolution of 1980 . ”
Read and re-read the above paragraph as many times as necessary to recognize the true nature of the American media in the first decade of the new millennium .
Just think of how much more copy was expended over the Richard Mellon Scaife driven Whitewater case , the impeachment investigation and trial of Bill Clinton for lying on an affidavit about an extra-marital sex act , along with the fusillade of absurdity about Al Gore released during the 2000 presidential campaign .
Now three House members take their oaths of responsibility seriously enough to begin demanding questions on vital issues such as lying a nation into war on false evidence after secret hearings allocated oil holdings in the nation ready to be attacked , on a blatant act of identifying an intelligence agent by the media with cooperation from members of the administration .
There are also Bill of Rights violations with impunity through conducting numerous unlawful seizures and holding citizens without permitting defendants with right of counsel or provided with charges under which they were being held , as well as numerous Geneva Convention violations through torturing prisoners .
Nothing exceeds the aforementioned issues in importance .
Our entire system of government resides on the most dangerously slender thread until justice can be restored as a regime with an insatiable appetite for power runs amok , leaving the U.S. Constitution and the rule of law in tatters .
Congressman Wexler has indicated that he needs 50,000 signatures to convince his Democratic colleagues that the American people truly support impeachment .
I have added my support .
Have you ?
The good news is that my last visit to Wexler ’s site indicates that over 61,000 interested citizens have voiced their support .
Visit Wexler ’s site and add your support if you have not done so already .
Just contact Congressman Wexler at his site and fill out the needed particulars .

Guitar + Vox +
OhMiBod = Vibrator responding to the sounds of the guitar .
Ever have those days where it you ’re holding two objects and it suddenly * clicks * that they ’re meant to be put together ?
Well a box of toys showed up from OhMiBod and the VOX AmPlug came on the same day , and it suddenly dawned on me that together they could be the perfect combo gift and only ~ $ 100 !
[ There ’s a quick video if below if you do n’t know what i mean . ]
Ok ok , hear me out .
The VOX AmPlug is perfect for electric guitarists who want to hear that beautiful full bodied sound through headphones .
The OhMiBod and the more attractive and enticing new Gspot vibrate to the music connected through a headphone cable …
Connect the two together ~ and its an interesting way to seriously touch someone through the music you PLAY .
We all know girls ca n’t resist a musician ( yes , yes , protest if you must , but we all know its pretty hard ? )
~ this would take that love of musician and his music to a whole new level .
Also , if he is the worst guitar player ever maybe this would be a nice gift for his poor girlfriend .
And for all those groupies you can even plug in more than one …
Come to think of it … this * could * work out nicely for those gamer guys too , hook it up to the output of your XBOX / PC / etc and every shot you take ( or when you get shot ) in a shooter game will have a whole new effect ?
In recent debates the candidates were asked whether they will support the nominee of their party .
Despite increasingly harsh rhetoric between the candidates only two candidates had the courage to put peace before their party and refused to issue blanket support for their party nominee .
Rep. Ron Paul and Rep. Dennis Kucinich responded they would not support the nominee unless the nominee opposed war as an instrument of foreign policy .
This deserves loud applause from the peace movement .
No doubt both candidates will pay a political price for taking such a stand .
They may get the “ Gravel Treatment ” – presidential candidate Mike Gravel was harshly critical of the top tier candidates of the Democratic Party and now is excluded from the debates because the Democratic National Committee no longer considers him a serious candidate and the corporate media , which walks lock - step with the corporate parties , has refused to invite him to any debates .
His campaign has all but disappeared .
Kucinich and Paul face other potential repercussions for putting the life and death issue of war and peace before party loyalty .
Both are incumbent congressmen and if they are unsuccessful in getting their party ’s presidential nomination will seek re-election to Congress .
Will they find themselves with a well - funded primary challenger ?
And , if elected , will they find their committee assignments downgraded ?
Will they be appointed to subcommittee or committee chairmanships or passed over in favor of party loyalists ?
There are many ways for a political party to punish lack of party loyalty .
So , Kucinich and Paul deserve a great deal of credit for publicly standing up for peace before party .
And , Kucinich and Paul did not just come out in opposition to the current disastrous occupation of Iraq .
They came out more broadly for an end to the aggressively interventionist U.S. foreign policy that is dominated by militarism .
This is the type of paradigm shifting policy change that is needed in U.S. foreign policy .

Karl Rove , the architect of so much that has gone so wrong with the Bush administration , announced yesterday that he is leaving the White House to spend more time with his family .
What he did n’t say is that by getting out of town he is also hoping to avoid spending any time at all with Congressional investigators .
Congress should not oblige .
The American public needs to understand the full story of how this White House  with Mr. Rove pulling many of the strings  has spent the last six and a half years improperly and dangerously politicizing the federal government .
Mr. Rove is already defying one Congressional subpoena to testify about the United States attorneys scandal .
He should be made to respond to that one , and should also be subpoenaed to explain his role in several other cases of crass politicization .
President Bush took a risk when he put someone so focused on politics as blood sport at the center of his White House .
Once he did , he had an obligation to ensure that Mr. Rove understood that his job was to promote the interests of the American people  not solely the Republican Party .
Instead , Mr. Rove used his position and power to relentlessly pursue his declared goal of a permanent Republican majority .
Mr. Rove appears to have been deeply involved in the decision to fire nine top federal prosecutors , apparently for either bringing cases that hurt Republicans or refusing to bring cases to punish Democrats .
There is also mounting evidence that he turned nonpartisan agencies into campaign boosters , quite possibly violating federal law .
Earlier this month , Attorney General Alberto Gonzales admitted that Justice Department officials attended political briefings at the White House , some led by Mr. Rove .
Officials at the General Services Administration and Peace Corps , and even six American ambassadors , among others , were also given briefings .
PEOPLE who live close to high - voltage powerlines during childhood are up to five times more likely to develop cancer , according to Australian research .
The Tasmanian study of more than 850 patients adds weight to the link between electromagnetic fields and cancers such as leukaemia , lymphoma and multiple myeloma .
It is still not known whether there is a cause and effect relationship .
Those who lived within 300 metres of a powerline up to the age of five were five times more likely to develop cancer , while those who lived that close to a powerline at any point during their first 15 years were three times more likely to develop cancer as an adult , according to the study published in the Internal Medicine Journal .

Coverage of important Information Security and Information Technology news and events from the research team at S?nnet Beskerming .
PhD Student Claims 200x Improvement for Copper Broadband
A news.com.au article is claiming that an Australian PhD graduate has achieved the seemingly - impossible by developing algorithms to allow a speed gain of up to 200 times over the limit of current copper broadband networks .
It is claimed that the performance increase obtained through the developed algorithms could see speeds of up to 250 megabits per second being reached across copper lines that are currently carrying between one and 20 megabits per second .
In basic terms , that is equivalent to transferring a full dual layer DVD of data in less than five minutes .
With patent applications in the works , Dr John Papandriopoulos could soon find himself the focus of a number of very interested networking companies and government agencies interested in wringing more performance from existing network infrastructure .
Recognition is already being received for the work , with Dr John receiving a Chancellor 's Prize for Excellence for his work - work that apparently only took a year to complete .
What allows the enormous increase in performance is a set of algorithms that reduce the impact and levels of interference / cross talk that competing data streams on the same physical copper line encounter , effectively allowing for greater throughput .
If this technology reaches maturity , it could be another reason for customers to be annoyed at the loss of their copper services when they have had fibre optic services installed .
If the research is also applicable to fibre optic networks , it will have significant effects on what bandwidth is available for consumption for some time to come .

Air travel may be the first industry based on a business model of kidnapping and imprisonment .
It is the least open industry possible .
You are trapped with the airline that controls your home airport or destination .
And now , far worse , you are trapped in their planes for three to five hours .
And why ?
Well , yes , we can blame weather and bad air - traffic control for some of this .
But the essential reason is that that do n’t want to let you loose and lose your fare .
So they hold you captive .
Amazingly , they are allowed it .
And , of course , this yields just the amount of resentment and seething hatred it deserves .
So no one thinks positively of the industry or the brands in it .
It ’s so bad that it ’s making clearly inferior competitors — driving for hours , Amtrak , ferchrissakes , and maybe even soon the bus — look better .
That ’s bad .
The entire industry and its relationship with its entire customer base is broken .
The attempted solutions so far are all nonsolutions : Attempts to regulate and limit our imprisonment — to still obviously unacceptable levels — have failed .
Attempts to sue airlines into civility have not worked .
Even the White House finally recognizes the problem but its solutions are aimed at reducing the flights that are already over subscribed ; gee , that helps .
It ’s time to turn the thinking around .
If , for once , anyone in the industry or the government would think like a customer , the solution would be the reverse of imprisoning us in airplanes until they can take off :
Jets should not be boarded until they have a take - off — and landing — slot .
That leaves us , the passengers , free to walk around in the terminal — and , yes , free to seek competitive means of transport ( other airlines , cars , trains ) or to go home .
In no sane world should we be held in captivity and prevented from that free choice .
We would have the services of airports at hand — which , in the long run , would improve because there ’d be business to be made there ; demand for beers yields supply of beers ( the mixed - nut marketplace shifts from the jet to the terminal ) .
The airlines would compete to make us comfortable to keep us at their gates .
The jets would not be sitting on runways burning incredible amounts of fuel and producing incredible amounts of carbon for hours on end .
Onboard crews would not be stressed dealing with righteously angry customers .
People might actually decide to fly more often .
Oh , yes , this shifts some of the logistical burden of air travel from taxi and air traffic control to the terminals — fine .
It also shifts the pain in this relationship from the powerless customer to the people who are in a position to fix the situation .
If the airlines want to imprison us , they still have the tool of the nonrefundable ticket , though the market will in the long - run dictate whether we choose to pay for this discount with the risk of captivity .
It ’s hard to imagine an industry — other than prisons themselves — that is less open to openness .
It ’s much easier to imagine how media , retail , consumer products , and entertainment can spawn Cluetrain companies .
But if you simply turn around and ask how customers would run these companies , you will get an answer like mine , not like the industry ’s or the government ’s .
The problem is that , deregulation aside , it ’s not a competitive marketplace .
It ’s worse today than telecom .
So it ’s not as if one company can break away from the pack and think like its customers ; it ’s not in control of its relationship with us , end - to - end .
How do we get from here to there ?
The only thing that is new is our empowerment as customers on the internet .
We can coalesce and gang up on the airlines .
There is also market pressure .
The horrid shoddiness of the mainstream airlines is just what has opened up the market for Eos , Silverjet , et al to offer independent , quality competition and take away the big airlines ’ most profitable customers , who are all turning their backs and saying nya - nya - nya to their former wardens as they leave the prison gates .
But , of course , that marketplace is limited .
It ’s a much bigger mess than that .
And it wo n’t be cured until the industry starts thinking like its customers , which will only happen when the customers shout so loudly , now that we can , that the industry ca n’t help but hear .
In the end , the ability of companies to make a business by telling customers what they cannot do is over .
It ’s only a question of when and how it is replaced .
: I should add that when I flew to Austin this week to see Dell , my Continental flights were ontime both ways — though I saw a chart yesterday ( ca n’t find it now ) showing Continental as the current leader in passenger imprisonment .
I was lucky to get a first - class upgrade both ways , which improves one ’s outlook .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The employee who wore what some said was a racially insensitive Halloween costume to a party hosted by a top immigration official is being directed by the Homeland Security Department Secretary to take administrative leave .
Julie Myers , head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement , called the man 's costume " offensive . "
The employee 's leave will continue while a Department inquiry is conducted , according to Secretary Michael Chertoff .
The employee wore a striped prison outfit , dreadlocks and darkened skin make - up to the party hosted by Julie Myers , head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement .
Myers was on a three - judge panel that originally praised the prisoner costume for " originality . "
After some employees complained , Myers apologized for " a few of the costumes , " calling them " inappropriate and offensive . "
She said she and other senior managers " deeply regret that this happened . "
A department photographer took a picture of Myers with the man , but the photograph or photographs , originally posted online , were deleted after it was determined the costume was offensive , ICE spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said .
Asked about the controversy at a press conference Tuesday , Chertoff said Myers was " right to apologize for having this proceeding take place " and said she is reaching out to members of Congress and others to make sure " they understood her unwavering commitment to equality and fairness . "
" Here is the bottom line : People do dumb things , " Chertoff said .
" I get very perturbed when there is anything that is done that suggests that with respect to the enforcement of the law , we are anything other than even - handed .
I have zero tolerance for racism or discrimination in the area of law enforcement .
We have to be tough but we have to be fair .
...
The idea that you are going to come and impersonate someone of another ethnic group , I think , is completely unacceptable . "
Between 50 and 75 people attended the party , which was a fund - raiser for the Combined Federal Campaign , a federal government collection of charities .
Nantel said one employee , whom she declined to identify , was wearing a black - and - white striped prison outfit , dreadlocks and a skin " bronzer " intended " to make him look African - American . "
But , she said , it was not immediately apparent that he was wearing the make - up .
" Most people in the room did n't realize he was wearing make - up at all , " she said .
" It was unintentioned .
The employee did not mean to offend although there were some employees that were rightfully offended by it , " Nantel said .
" There were a couple of people who were offended , " Nantel said .
" When it was confirmed through a conversation with the employee that he was wearing make - up " the employee was counseled and Myers sent out a note to employees apologizing .
" The photo was deleted because there was a determination that the costume was inappropriate , " Nantel said .
In a November 2 email to ICE employees , Myers said , " It is now clear that , however unintended , a few of the costumes were inappropriate and offensive .
While we were all thrilled to be a part of the CFC fund - raising effort , I and the senior management at ICE deeply regret that this happened . "
She reminded all employees to be compliant with the department 's diversity training requirement .
Myers has served as head of ICE since January of 2006 but is still awaiting Senate confirmation .
An ICE congressional liaison said ICE officials briefed congressional staffers about the costume party this week as a courtesy .
But at least one congressional staffer said they approached ICE after receiving an anonymous fax about the incident .
Myers called House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson , a Democrat from Mississippi , about the incident and is expected to meet with him before the end of the week , a Thompson spokeswoman told CNN .
Myers also contacted the National Association of African - Americans in the Department of Homeland Security .
In a letter to NAADHS members , the group 's vice president , Sjon Shavers , said the group " appreciates ( Myers ) reaching out to us so quickly in order to keep us apprised of the matter and we commend her on moving so swiftly toward appropriate corrective action . "
As head of ICE , Myers heads the law enforcement agency charged with enforcing immigration law in the nation 's interior .
It is the second largest investigative agency in the federal government , with more than 15,000 employees , including 6,000 investigators .
Chertoff " supports the actions that Assistant Secretary Myers has taken , " DHS spokeswoman Laura Keehner said .
" We do not tolerate inappropriate behavior at DHS .
" The secretary has asked for an inquiry into the facts surrounding the incident .
Once the facts have been determined , we will take all necessary and appropriate actions . "

Dodd ready to mount filibuster to block telecom immunity Nick Juliano

This &spon Live video of the Senate debate on the FISA update and telecom immunity can be seen on C - Span 2 here .
UPDATE : Filibuster threat succeeds in delaying FISA update consideration until January After nearly 10 hours of discussion Monday , the Senate decided to delay a final vote on a controversial domestic spying bill until the new year , under the threat of a protracted filibuster from Sen.
Chris Dodd .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid spent the afternoon Monday huddling with Senate leaders and fellow Democrats to try to work out a deal to bring to the floor an update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act that included a provision for legal immunity to telecommunications companies that facilitated a warrantless wiretapping scheme that Dodd and other Democrats said was illegal .
" We have tried to work through this process , and it appears quite clear that on this bill we are not going to be able to do that , " Reid said around 7:30 p.m.
Monday , after Senators had spent the day debating propositions of the FISA update .
Dodd spent the day urging his colleagues to block a proposal to shield phone and Internet companies that gave the National Security Agency private call and e-mail records from an unknown number of Americans under the program President Bush authorized after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks .
The 64 - year - old Connecticut senator indicated he would have been willing to keep the floor all night if needed to prevent the immunity provision from moving through the senate .
" I rarely come to the floor with this much anger , " Dodd said .
" I 've never seen contempt of the rule of law such as this . "
Granting immunity to the telecoms -- as President Bush has demanded -- would invalidate some 40 lawsuits that have been filed against telephone and internet companies .
Plaintiffs in those suits say the telecommunications industry acted illegally and ignored the constitution in facilitating warrantless government wiretaps aimed at Americans .
Shortly after noon Monday , the Senate voted 76 - 10 to proceed to invoke cloture on a motion to proceed with regular debate on a proposed FISA update from the Intelligence Committee that includes telecom immunity .
A Judiciary measure without immunity is pending as a substitute amendment .
Dodd controlled much of the action on the floor after debate on the measure began this afternoon , but his filibuster still had not begun in earnest by 7 p.m. as Senate leaders continued to negotiate over how they would handle proposed amendments to the FISA update .
A half - hour later , Reid lamented that senators could not come to an agreement on how to proceed and would have to delay consideration of the FISA update until at least January 15 , when the Senate returns from a recess that is to begin at the end of this week .
The Senate still has a raft of spending and tax bills and other legislation it needs to clear from its plate before the week is over .
Dodd said he hoped the Senate would be able to reach a compromise that would excise the immunity proposal from the FISA update before the chamber re-convenes in January .
If immunity persists in the bill , Dodd said , he would resume his promised filibuster .
Sen . Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) planned to join Dodd in offering an amendment that would strip the immunity provision from the bill .
It is unclear when senators will begin voting on amendments and the bill itself , but Dodd plans to begin his filibuster after a vote on his and Feingold 's amendment , assuming it is not successful .
Dodd aides said they did not expect Monday to play out as it did but were glad to see that the Connecticut senator managed to delay a vote on telecom immunity as long as he had without having to resort to a filibuster .
The 64 - year - old dark - horse presidential candidate is prepared to hold the Senate floor as long as needed once his filibuster begins .
The longest a single senator has ever spoken during a filibuster is just over 24 hours .
Sen .
Ted Kenney ( D - MA ) urged against " amnesty " for the telecom companies because we cannot let the country off the hook simply because they think they 're acting as patriot .
Kennedy invoked a New York Times report that the National Security Agency wanted to become a " powerful , permanent presence " on US communication networks , and he said that 's what would happen if Congress continues to let phone companies off the hook .
" If the phone companies simply do the NSA 's bidding in violation of the law , " Kennedy said , " they create a world in which Americans can never feel confident that their e-mails and phone calls are n't being tapped by government . "
Kennedy also excoriated President Bush 's threat to veto any FISA update that lacks a retroactive immunity provision .
" So if we take the president at his word , he 's willing to let Americans die to protect the phone companies , " Kennedy said , his voice rising in anger .
" The president 's insistence on immunity as a precondition for any FISA reform is yet another example of disrespect for honest dialogue and the rule of law . "
Sen. Diane Feinstein ( D - CA ) , who serves on both the Intelligence and Judiciary committees that reported the FISA update , introduced an amendment Monday she said would " narrow " the grant of immunity to telecom companies .
Feinstein 's amendment would require a FISA court judge review authorization letters the administration sent to telecoms every 45 days to keep the president 's warrantless wiretapping program running .
She also indicated that her support for the Intelligence Committee 's immunity proposal was wavering .
" I 'm not inclined to vote for immunity , unless this amendment is adopted , " Feinstein said .
Dodd canceled planned campaign events in Iowa to be in Washington Monday , but the Senate 's other Democratic presidential candidates were all out on the campaign trail today , and none were in Washington to vote against the cloture motion or stand by Dodd 's expected filibuster .
This despite the fact that all three -- Barack Obama , Hillary Clinton , and Joe Biden -- said they would support Dodd 's filibuster .
other Democratic presidential candidates -- Joe Biden , Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama -- are in Washington today Monday 's consideration of telecom immunity came a day after new reports that the reach of the National Security Agency 's warrantless surveillance efforts extended far beyond fighting terrorism and some were proposed or instituted before 9/11 .
" The administration has claimed that is seeking merely foreign intelligence and that the intelligence is for national security purposes only .
We see now that those claims are a part of a larger and more chilling picture , " said the ACLU 's Caroline Frederickson in a news release , referring to reports that first appeared in the New York Times detailing the NSA 's efforts to tap into domestic communication networks and warrantlessly target calls to Latin America in search of drug dealers .
" Those who have filed the over 40 legitimate cases against the telecom companies deserve their day in court - especially now that what we thought we knew about the companies ' involvement in domestic spying was , perhaps , just the tip of the iceberg , " Fredrickson continued .
" It becomes clearer and clearer just how in the dark Americans are when it comes to the surveillance they are subject to under this administration .
It seems that the more we learn , the less we know . 
Debate over the FISA update began at 10 a.m. Monday , and Dodd began speaking around 11 a.m .
" Believe me when I say if I did not speak today , my conscience would not rest , " Dodd told his colleagues .
He praised the Senate as a chamber in which even a " minority of one " can mount a protest against unacceptable legislation , to counteract the president 's bully pulpit , as he sought to turn his minority into a " majority " of senators against telecom immunity .
Accusing telecommunications companies of " betraying millions of customers trust " by handing over phone records to the government for construction of a massive database , Dodd said blocking lawsuits against the companies would eliminate the last bastion of oversight of the president 's warrantless wiretapping program .
" Was it legal ? "
Dodd asked .
" That I do n't know , but if we pass this bill we will never know . "
The Connecticut senator accused President Bush of usurping the rule of law by asking the country to simply trust that he was n't trampling on citizens ' constitutional rights .
" We say to the president of the United States that a nation of free men and women would never take ' trust me ' for an answer , not even from a perfect president , " Dodd said .
" At these times , I would be a fool to take that offer . "
Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman John Rockefeller ( D - WV ) , whose committee passed a measure that would grant immunity to telecoms , insisted early in Monday 's debate , which is being televised on C - Span 2 , that such immunity was narrowly targeted to telephone and internet companies that facilitated the National Security Agency 's warrantless wiretapping program between Sept. 11 , 2001 , and January of this year , when the FISA court ruled on the program .
Dodd , a dark - horse candidate for the Democratic presidential nod , tried to put a " hold " on any FISA update with telecom immunity , but that request apparently has been ignored by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) .
The 64 - year - old Connecticut Senator plans to filibuster the bill -- the old fashioned way -- when it comes to the floor Monday .
There is no word on how long Dodd 's filibuster will last .
" It looks like the Senate Democratic leadership are not going to be the ones standing firm , " a source familiar with the filibuster plan told RAW STORY .
In the modern Congress , the filibuster has become a de facto tool to require 60 votes in the Senate to pass virtually any piece of important or controversial legislation .
Dodd 's effort Monday would be the first time one Senator actually sought to block a bill by taking to the floor and refusing to yield since former Sen .
Al D'Amato held the floor for 15 hours to protest job losses from his home state of New York to Mexico .
That was in 1992 -- more than 15 years ago .
In 2003 , Republicans cooperatively staged an all - night session to dramatize Democratic efforts to block President Bush 's judicial nominations ; earlier that week Reid held the floor for nearly nine hours to protest the Republicans stunt .
And earlier this year , Reid kept the Senate in session all night to protest Republicans ' refusal to allow a simple majority vote on a measure aimed at withdrawing US troops from Iraq .
Already , Dodd has lined up support from Sens. Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) and Ted Kennedy ( D - MA ) , to whom he plans to yield the floor for 20 - minute " questions " that would allow him to take quick breaks but keep the filibuster going , reports FireDogLake .
Writing at TPM Cafe , Feingold criticizes Reid 's plans to proceed with a measure passed by the Senate Intelligence Committee , which does not include telecom immunity , instead of with a Judiciary Committee measure that has no immunity .
The Intelligence bill will be the base when the Senate begins debate , and the Judiciary measure will be pending as a replacement amendment .
It would require 60 votes to supplant the Intel bill with Judiciary 's version .
" We have a big fight on our hands , and unfortunately , the deck is now stacked against us , " Feingold said .
" Instead of being able to defend improvements that were made in the Judiciary Committee , we are going to have to start all over again to try to salvage the good work that was done to improve the bill . "
Dodd and Feingold plan to offer an amendment to strip telecom immunity from the FISA update .
Speaking on the Senate floor Monday , Feingold criticized the Intelligence Committee 's proposal to grant immunity and accused administration officials of lying to Senators last week during a classified briefing about the proposed FISA updates .
" I am certain that over the course of this week , we will hear a number of arguments about why the Judiciary bill will hamper the fight against terrorism .
Let me say now to my colleagues :
Do not believe everything you hear , " Feingold said .
" Last week I sat with many of you in the secure room in the Capitol , S - 407 , and listened to arguments made by the Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General .
And I can tell you with absolute certainty that several of the examples they gave were simply wrong .
Simply false .
I am happy to have a classified meeting with anyone in this body who wishes to discuss this . "
FDL says comments readers leave there could be read by Sen .
Dodd when he takes to the Senate floor , and it is calling on the Senate 's other presidential candidates -- Joe Biden , Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama -- to stand by their pledges to support Dodd 's filibuster .
" The time for leadership is now , not January 2009 .
...
You want to be our leader ?
Leadership begins by standing with Senator Dodd , " wrote Scarecrow at FDL Monday .
Dodd 's plan to hold up business on the Senate floor comes as the chamber scrambles to pass several important spending bills and other legislation before recessing for the holidays at the end of this week .
DEVELOPING ...
One Friday in August 1962 Warren Thomas , director of Lincoln Park Zoo in Oklahoma City , raised his rifle and took aim at Tusko the elephant .
With a squeeze of the trigger he scored a direct hit on the animal 's rump , firing a cartridge full of the hallucinogenic drug LSD into the animal 's bloodstream .
The dose was 3,000 times what a human might take for recreational purposes , and the results were extraordinary .
Tusko charged around and trumpeted loudly for a few minutes before keeling over dead .
Thomas and his colleagues maintained the mishap was the result of a scientific experiment to investigate whether LSD brought on an unusual condition in which elephants become aggressive and secrete a sticky fluid from their glands .
In a report of the incident submitted to the US journal Science four months later , the team concluded : " It appears that the elephant is highly sensitive to the effects of LSD . "
The case of Tusko the elephant is among 10 of the most bizarre experiments carried out in the quest for knowledge and reported in New Scientist magazine today .
If there is a fine line between madness and genius , many of those involved firmly crossed it .
One experiment in the 1960s saw 10 soldiers board an aircraft for what they believed was a routine training mission from Fort Hunter Liggett airbase in California .
After climbing to around 5,000 feet the plane suddenly lurched to one side and began to fall .
Over the intercom , the pilot announced : " We have an emergency .
An engine has stalled and the landing gear is not functioning .
I 'm going to attempt to ditch in the ocean . "
While the soldiers faced almost certain death , a steward handed out insurance forms and asked the men to complete them , explaining it was necessary for the army to be covered if they died .
Little did the soldiers know they were completely safe .
It was merely an experiment to find out how extreme stress affects cognitive ability , the forms serving as the test .
Once the final soldier had completed his form the pilot announced : " Just kidding about that emergency folks ! "
A later attempt to repeat the experiment with a new group of unwitting volunteers was ruined by one of the previous soldiers , who had penned a warning on a sickbag .
One of the most gruesome experiments to make New Scientist 's list was performed by the Soviet surgeon Vladimir Demikhov .
In 1954 he unveiled a two - headed dog , created in the lab by grafting the head , shoulders and front legs of a puppy on to the neck of a German shepherd dog .
Journalists brought in to examine the creature noted how milk dribbled from the stump of the puppy 's head when it attempted to lap milk .
Occasionally , the two would fight , with the German shepherd trying to shake the puppy off , and the puppy retaliating by biting back .
The unfortunate creation lived for six days , though Dr Demikhov repeated the experiment 19 more times over the next 15 years , with the longest - lived lasting a month .
Although the work was dismissed as a publicity stunt outside the Soviet Union , Dr Demikhov was credited with developing intricate surgical techniques that paved the way for the first human heart transplant .
Several attempts to unravel the mysteries of human nature also make the list .
Clarence Leuba , a psychologist from Yellow Springs ,
Ohio , set out to discover whether laughing when tickled was a learned or spontaneous reaction , and commandeered his newborn son and later daughter into the study .
Then there was Lawrence LeShan , a researcher from Virginia who in 1942 stood in a room of sleeping boys repeating the phrase " My fingernails taste terribly bitter " to see if he could break their nailbiting habit while they slept .
In another experiment , a doctor called Stubbins Ffirth from Philadelphia decided to drink fresh vomit from yellow fever patients to prove it was not a contagious disease .
He claimed to be right when he failed to become ill in 1804 , but scientists have since shown yellow fever is extremely contagious , but has to be transmitted directly into the bloodstream , for example from a mosquito bite .
A similarly flawed experiment by Robert Cornish at the University of California in the 1930s attempted to bring dead animals back to life by tilting them up and down on a seesaw .
The few that did stir back to life momentarily after death were severely brain damaged .
Predictably , sex also appears on the magazine 's list of bizarre experiments .
When investigating the sexual arousal of male turkeys researchers at Penn State University were impressed to see that the birds would attempt to mate with lookalike dummies .
Piece by piece they removed parts of the dummy and found that the males were still highly aroused when presented with no more than a head on a stick .

Conclusion :
Male turkeys aroused by a head on a stick , but not a headless body
KHARTOUM , Sudan —
Thousands of Sudanese , many armed with clubs and knives , rallied today in a central square and demanded the execution of a British teacher convicted of insulting Islam for allowing her students to name a teddy bear " Muhammad . "
In response to the demonstration , teacher Gillian Gibbons was moved from the women 's prison near Khartoum to a secret location for her safety , her lawyer said .
The protesters streamed out of mosques after Friday sermons , as pickup trucks with loudspeakers blared messages against Gibbons , who was sentenced Thursday to 15 days in prison and deportation .
She avoided the more serious punishment of 40 lashes .
They massed in central Martyrs Square outside the presidential palace , where hundreds of riot police were deployed .
They did not try to stop the rally , which lasted about an hour .
" Shame , shame on the U.K. , " protesters chanted .
They called for Gibbons ' execution , saying , " No tolerance : Execution , " and " Kill her , kill her by firing squad . "
Gibbons ' chief lawyer , Kamal al - Gizouli , said she was moved from the prison for her safety for the final nine days of her sentence .
" They moved this lady from the prison department to put her in other hands and in other places to cover her and wait until she completes her imprisonment period , " he said , adding that she was in good health .
" They want , by hook or by crook , to complete these nine days without any difficulties , which would have an impact on their foreign relationship , " he said .
Several hundred protesters , not openly carrying weapons , marched from the square to Unity High School , about a mile away , where Gibbons worked .
They chanted slogans outside the school , which is closed and under heavy security , then headed toward the nearby British Embassy .
They were stopped by security forces two blocks away from the embassy .
The protest arose despite vows by Sudanese security officials the day before , during Gibbons ' trial , that threatened demonstrations after Friday prayers would not take place .
Some of the protesters carried green banners with the name of the Society for Support of the Prophet Muhammad , a previously unknown group .
Many protesters carried clubs , knives and axes — but not automatic weapons , which some have brandished at past government - condoned demonstrations .
That suggested today 's rally was not organized by the government .
A Muslim cleric at Khartoum 's main Martyrs Mosque denounced Gibbons during one sermon , saying she intentionally insulted Islam .
He did not call for protests , however .
" Imprisoning this lady does not satisfy the thirst of Muslims in Sudan .
But we welcome imprisonment and expulsion , " the cleric , Abdul - Jalil Nazeer al - Karouri , a well - known hard - liner , told worshippers .
" This an arrogant woman who came to our country , cashing her salary in dollars , teaching our children hatred of our Prophet Muhammad , " he said .
Britain , meanwhile , pursued diplomatic moves to free Gibbons .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown spoke with a member of her family to convey his regret , his spokeswoman said .
" He set out his concern and the fact that we were doing all we could to secure her release , " spokeswoman Emily Hands told reporters .
Most Britons expressed shock at the verdict by a court in Khartoum , alongside hope it would not raise tensions between Muslims and non-Muslims in Britain .
" One of the good things is the U.K .
Muslims who 've condemned the charge as completely out of proportion , " said Paul Wishart , 37 , a student in London .
" In the past , people have been a bit upset when different atrocities have happened and there has n't been much voice in the U.K.
Islamic population , whereas with this , they 've quickly condemned it . "
Muhammad Abdul Bari , secretary - general of the Muslim Council of Britain , accused the Sudanese authorities of " gross overreaction . "
" This case should have required only simple common sense to resolve .
It is unfortunate that the Sudanese authorities were found wanting in this most basic of qualities , " he said .
The Muslim Public Affairs Committee , a political advocacy group , said the prosecution was " abominable and defies common sense . "
The Federation of Student Islamic Societies , which represents 90,000 Muslim students in Britain and Ireland , called on Sudan 's government to free Gibbons , saying she had not meant to cause offense .
" We are deeply concerned that the verdict to jail a schoolteacher due to what 's likely to be an innocent mistake is gravely disproportionate , " said the group 's president , Ali Alhadithi .
The Ramadhan Foundation , a Muslim youth organization , said Sudanese President Omar al - Bashir should pardon the teacher .
" The Ramadhan Foundation is disappointed and horrified by the conviction of Gillian Gibbons in Sudan , " said spokesman Mohammed Shafiq .
Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams , spiritual leader of the world 's 77 million Anglicans , said Gibbons ' prosecution and conviction was " an absurdly disproportionate response to what is at worst a cultural faux pas . "
Foreign Secretary David Miliband summoned the Sudanese ambassador late Thursday to express Britain 's disappointment with the verdict .
The Foreign Office said Britain would continue diplomatic efforts to achieve " a swift resolution " to the crisis .
Gibbons was arrested Sunday after another staff member at the school complained that she had allowed her 7 - year - old students to name a teddy bear Muhammad .
Giving the name of the Muslim prophet to an animal or a toy could be considered insulting .
The case put Sudan 's government in an embarrassing position — facing the anger of Britain on one side and potential trouble from powerful Islamic hard - liners on the other .
Many saw the 15 - day sentence as an attempt to appease both sides .
In The Times , columnist Bronwen Maddox said the verdict was " something of a fudge ... designed to give a nod to British reproof but also to appease the street . "
Britain 's response — applying diplomatic pressure while extolling ties with Sudan and affirming respect for Islam — had produced mixed results , British commentators concluded .
In an editorial , The Daily Telegraph said Miliband " has tiptoed around the case , avoiding a threat to cut aid and asserting that respect for Islam runs deep in Britain .
Given that much of the government 's financial support goes to the wretched refugees in Darfur and neighboring Chad , Mr. Miliband 's caution is understandable . "
Now , however , the newspaper said , Britain should recall its ambassador in Khartoum and impose sanctions on the Sudanese regime .

Dame Anita brought ethically - sourced products to the High Street
Her family said in a statement she suffered " a major brain haemorrhage " at 1830 BST at St Richard 's Hospital in Chichester , West Sussex .
Her husband , Gordon , and daughters Sam and Justine were all with her .
Dame Anita set up the first Body Shop in Brighton in 1976 .
She pioneered cruelty - free beauty products and turned them into a highly profitable business .
In February she announced she had contracted Hepatitis C from a blood transfusion in 1971 .
She had been taken to hospital on Sunday evening after she collapsed complaining of a headache .
' Force for good '
Prime Minister Gordon Brown paid tribute to Dame Anita , calling her " one of the country 's true pioneers " and an " inspiration " to businesswomen .
He said : " She campaigned for green issues for many years before it became fashionable to do so and inspired millions to the cause by bringing sustainable products to a mass market .
" She will be remembered not only as a great campaigner but also as a great entrepreneur . "
The Body Shop became part of the French company L'Oreal Group in July 2006 but is run independently .
She was an amazing inspiration to those around her
John Sauven
Executive director of Greenpeace
Obituary : Dame Anita Roddick
The daughter of Italian immigrants , Dame Anita became one of Britain 's most successful businesswomen .
She was the first to introduce socially and environmentally responsible business onto the High Street and she was talking about fair trade long before it became a buzz word .
Body Shop - with its ethically - sourced products - was one of the icons of the High Street in the 1980s .
Its fortunes had been hit in recent years as rivals started making similar products , but the retailer fought back and has more than 2,100 stores in 55 countries .
The family 's statement said : " Gordon , Justine and Sam Roddick are very sad to announce that , after suffering a major brain haemorrhage , Anita Roddick died at 6.30 pm this evening at the age of 64 .
" Anita Roddick was admitted to St Richard 's Hospital in Chichester , close to her home , yesterday evening when she collapsed after complaining of a sudden headache .
" Mrs Roddick was admitted to the hospital 's intensive care unit and her husband Gordon and two daughters , Sam and Justine , were with her when she died . "
' Own mortality '
Dame Anita revealed she was suffering from cirrhosis of the liver after contracting Hepatitis C from blood given during the birth of her youngest daughter , Sam .
She said she had unknowingly lived with " this silent killer " for three decades and only found out about it two years ago after a blood test .
" What I can say is that having Hep C means that I live with a sharp sense of my own mortality , which in many ways makes life more vivid and immediate , " Dame Anita said .
We have lost a true champion of the oppressed and persecuted
Kate Allen , Amnesty International
" It makes me even more determined to just get on with things . "
She told BBC News in July she had been having " some tiny heart attacks " , which she put down to " getting in and out of aeroplanes so often " .
" I can't really have any treatment because I have both cirrhosis and a particular strain of the virus that makes me unlikely to respond , " she added .
Dame Anita started campaigning for Hepatitis C to be taken more seriously as a " public health challenge " .
' Ahead of her time '
Justin Francis , who worked with her at Body Shop , said she was a " pioneer " who advocated business could be a " force for good " .
He said : " She had a great passion for life , a great passion for business and for people .
She was very warm , very witty and very clever . "
John Sauven , executive director of Greenpeace , said Dame Anita was an " incredible woman " who was passionate about environmental and human rights issues .
HAVE YOUR SAY
She was an inspiration to a generation of people .
Her vision and wit in dealing with all issues was a unique gift

He said : " She was an amazing inspiration to those around her .
" She was so ahead of her time when it came to issues of how business could be done ... When you look at it today , and how every company claims to be green , she was living this decades ago . "
Clive Stafford Smith , legal director of anti-death penalty organisation Reprieve , said she had just agreed to be its chairwoman .
' True champion '
" It is a real shame , " he said .
" We were so happy to have her , she was so full of life , so fantastic .
" She was so dedicated , so energetic , she will be sorely missed . "
Emma Colyer from the HIV and Aids charity Body and Soul , which Dame Anita set up , told BBC News it was a terribly sad day for society at large .
" Anita carried out campaigns on so many issues and often issues that were not popular by the mass of public and took some strength of character to become involved in , " she said .
Amnesty International UK director Kate Allen said Dame Anita 's passion for human rights was " immeasurable " .
She said : " We have lost a true champion of the oppressed and persecuted .
" Anita had been a key part of Amnesty International for many years and had shared her brilliance and energy with us to marvellous effect . "

We ’re not the company that makes big promises .
We ’re the company that fulfills them .
It ’s 21 degrees ( F ) in Chicago right now .
To me , that pretty much qualifies as Winter weather .
In one of the first few posts on DLM I mentioned that I drive an old 1998 Chevy Blazer that I refuse to get rid of .
Hey , it ’s paid off , why create debt right ?
Old or not , cars need attention .
This is especially true when you live in an area that goes through extreme temperature or weather changes .
The folks at Advance Auto Parts were nice enough to send over this list of winter car prep tips for DLM readers .
Stop taking your car for granted and give this a quick read .
If anything , ask yourself when you last checked these items .
The last thing you need is to get stranded on the highway with the family during the middle of winter .
Inspect your antifreeze while your engine is cold by using a tester to check the mixture for its freeze point .
A 50/50 ratio means 50 % distilled water and 50 % antifreeze , which is sufficient in most climates , except in extreme cold .
Have your charging system checked for free at any Advance Auto Parts store .
Cold weather starts make the vehicle battery work much harder and getting stranded in the cold is no fun !
Change your oil and oil filter .
Clean , high quality engine oil goes a long way in protecting the motor in cold start situations .
Use the oil recommended by the vehicle manufacturer .
Visually inspect all lights ; marker bulbs , tail lights , third level brake lights , especially headlights and driving lights .
Daylight savings time requires bulbs to work longer hours .
Tire Tread condition ; check it yourself , or have it checked .
Winter driving requires good traction in snow and ice .
Quality tire tread sheds the snow , ice and road grime more quickly , providing better traction for improved safety .
Check your tire pressure regularly , especially in colder temperatures .
Follow the recommended PSI found on the driver ’s side door post for maximum traction .
Visibility is key to your safety ; make sure that your wiper blades are in top condition , to fully clear your windshield , and back window if the vehicle is equipped .
Road salt and slush can jeopardize visibility .
Use washer fluid containing de-icer and Rain - X Treatment on windows to avoid the chiseling of ice early in the morning .
Inspect your engine ’s belts and hoses .
Cracked , frayed or worn out rubber wo n’t stand up to temperature extremes .
Do n’t get stranded on your next trip because of a $ 10.00 belt or hose !
Replace the Cabin Air Filter if the vehicle is equipped .
Outside contaminants from Fall and Summer driving are stranded in the cabin air filter and running the heater on “ high ” in the extreme cold only sends the micro-particles deeper into the vehicle .
Protect your vehicle ’s paint .
Rain , snow and salt are extremely tough on paint .
A tough coating of quality car wax will add another barrier in - between road grime and your vehicle ’s paint .
Last but not least , prepare a roadside emergency kit including a flashlight with fresh batteries , a blanket , food bars , water bottles , cell phone , jumper cables , flares , Fix - a - Flat , HELP Sign , and a first aid kit .
So really it ’s not that tough .
Most of these things you can easily take care of in your garage or driveway .
The point is DO THEM !
Today , we forge ever forward in an attempt to bring you the kitchen gadgets that will make your Thanksgiving preparations go as smoothly as possible .
You can read our previous entry on cooking the turkey here .
And Friday we 'll satisfy your sweet tooth with a feature on gadgets used to make desserts .
Today , we focus on the all - important side dishes .
Sur La Table
Multitier oven rack
A chronic problem with Thanksgiving meals is managing oven space , namely , finding space in the oven for all the side dishes and dips that need baking while your 25 - pound turkey hogs all that prime real estate .
This multitier rack makes it possible to bake several dishes at once , making it easier to manage the timing of the entire meal .
Awesome .
Williams - Sonoma
Digital timer
This digital timer , which we discovered just the other day , is practically made for cooking the Thanksgiving meal .
It can be used to time up to three dishes , each with its own distinct alarm .
The clocks can count up or down , which is helpful for keeping track of the different types of dishes that will be cooking ( or cooling ) at the same time .
Bed Bath & Beyond
Stuffing cage
There 's no doubt about it .
Stuffing is one of the most important side dishes on the Thanksgiving Day table .
This stuffing cage wo n't make it taste any better , but it 'll make it way easier to collect from the turkey cavity when it 's done .
And is n't that what gadgets are for ?
Just be sure your turkey is big enough to accommodate it .
This one 's 9 inches by 4 3/4 inches .

Immersion blender
Immersion blenders have a lot of potential uses .
They can be used to emulsify a salad dressing or puree soups without dirtying a blender or food processor .
These days , a lot of immersion blenders come with attachments that mean the blender can double as a mini food processor or hand mixer .
With the whisk attachment , you can whip eggs or whipping cream .
With the chopper , you can chop nuts or fresh herbs .
It might not replace a food processor or stand mixer in the long - term , but with all the moving parts that go into creating a big meal , a good immersion blender is like an understudy that knows all its lines .
It 'll do a competent job -- and take up less counter space than those big and showy celebrity appliances .

Potato ricer
If you really , really , really , really do n't want lumps in your mashed potatoes , a potato ricer is for you .
Personally , I have always found that cooking the potatoes thoroughly and whipping them in the stand mixer does the trick .
But I 've been known to leave the skins on mashed potatoes on occasion ( the horror ! ) , so who am I to judge ?
Oneida
Mandoline
In general , mandolines get mixed reviews from people on message boards -- some people swear by them , and others let them gather dust for months at a time .
If you 're ever going to pull one out , Thanksgiving might be the time .
Mandolines make it possible to quickly and easily get perfect , uniform slices , so this year 's scallop potatoes can really shine .
It 's also good for turning a regular salad into something a little more special ; various attachments and settings make for pretty salad toppings .
Likewise , there are plenty of vegetable peelers out there that will dress up fruits and vegetables for this special occasion .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Chinese leaders hailed images sent back from the country ’s first lunar satellite on Monday , saying they showed their nation had thrust itself into the front ranks of global technological powers .
An undated picture shows a part of the Moon 's surface from a camera aboard China 's Chang'e

Premier Wen Jiabao , visiting the scientists who have guided the lunar probe Chang’e 1 into space and around the moon , proclaimed the mission a complete success .
“ The full success of our country ’s first lunar exploration mission is helping to turn the Chinese nation ’s 1,000 - year old dream of reaching the moon a reality , ” Wen said .
State television showed the orbiter broadcasting into space “ The East is Red , ” the Communist Party ’s old anthem to a rising China , when Wen visited .
The revolutionary tune was also broadcast by China ’s first satellite in 1970 .
The picture on the Xinhua Web site ( www.xinhuanet.com) showed a patch of grey moon surface splotched with craters .
Even as hundreds of millions of Chinese struggle in rural hardship , the ruling Communist Party is committed to clambering into the select ranks of global space powers , and Chang ’e 1 ’s journey has been accompanied by a stream of patriotic propaganda .
In 2003 , China became only the third country to put a man into space using its own rocket after the former Soviet Union and the United States .
It then sent two astronauts on a five - day flight on its Shenzhou VI rocket in October 2005 .
China plans to launch its third manned rocket , Shenzhou VII , into space in October 2008 and may send an astronaut on a space walk , a Shanghai paper said .
But a space official downplayed plans to put a man on the moon .
“ There are no plans at the moment to send anyone on to the moon .
I ’ve heard of foreign reports which say China will put a man on the moon by 2020 , but I do n’t know of such a plan , ” said Sun Laiyan , head of the China National Space Administration .
“ Please do n’t give us any more pressure .
But I ’m confident one day we ’ll put an astronaut on the moon , ” he told a news conference .
The official China Daily newspaper said last month China planned to put a man on the moon “ within 15 years ” .
Wen said the probe ’s success showed the world that “ the Chinese people have the will , confidence and ability to constantly compose fine new chapters as we scale the peaks of modern science and technology ” .
“ The Chinese nation is fully able to stand tall among the world ’s ranks of advanced nations . ”
But other Asian powers have also announced plans to make a stake on the moon .
And fears of potential military rivalry in space with the United States have mounted since China blew up one of its own weather satellites using a ground - based missile in January .
Japan plans to launch its first mission to land a spacecraft on the moon in the next decade , a feat so far achieved only by the former Soviet Union and the United States .
The Chang’e 1 , named after a legendary Chinese goddess who flew to the moon , blasted off on a Long March 3A carrier rocket on October 24 from the south - western province of Sichuan .
Penn endorses Kucinich , challenges ' conventional wisdom ' on electability Jason Rhyne
Published : Friday December 7 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Actor Sean Penn endorsed dark horse Democratic presidential contender Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) in what was billed as a " major political address " given by the actor Friday in San Francisco .
Lambasting Democrats in Congress for their refusal to pursue the impeachment of President Bush , Vice President Cheney and other members of the current administration , Penn praised Kucinich for his " moral courage , " according to an advance copy of the speech provided to RAW STORY . " [ O ] ur cowardly Democratically dominated House and Senate can barely find one voice willing to propose so much as an impeachment .
That one voice of a true American , " said the actor .
" That one voice of Congressman Dennis Kucinich . "
Penn went on to say that the former Cleveland mayor 's record and vision outweighed " conventional wisdom " about Kucinich 's long - shot chances of winning the presidency .
" I 'm torn between the conventional wisdom of what we all keep being told is electability and the idealism that perhaps alone can live up to the challenges of our generation , " said Penn .
" Of the Democrats running for President , only Congressman Dennis Kucinich 's candidacy is backed by a voting record of moral courage and a history of service to our country that has fully earned our support and our gratitude . "
Added Penn , " So , here 's the question .
We got Iowa coming up , we got New Hampshire right on its ass .
Do we sell it for electability ?
If Hitler were the only candidate , would voting for him be most American ? "
Electability , he said , was in the eye of the beholder .
" It is for us to determine what is electable .
And here 's how simple it is :
If we , those of us who truly believe in the Constitution of the United States of America , all of us , vote for Dennis Kucinich , he will be elected .
Could we call him electable then ? "
Earlier , Penn excoriated the Bush administration for what he called treason , adding that although he was n't a proponent of the death penalty , " existing law provides that the likes of Cheney , Bush , Rumsfeld and Rice , if found guilty , could have hoods thrown over their heads , their hands bound , facing a 12 - man rifle corps executing death by firing squad . "
The actor also had some harsh words for Kucinich 's frontrunning rival for the Democratic nomination , Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) .
" Let 's remind our friends in the social circles of New York and the highbrow winner - friendly and monied major cities that support Mrs. Clinton , that this is not Bill Clinton , " he said , going on to praise the former president .
But he warned that the same " personal agendas " that led to what he characterizes as poor policy decisions from the president could rub off on the former first lady .
" Do n't underestimate the damage her poisonous ambition can do to this country , " he said of Sen. Clinton .
" We can't wait for the benefit of hindsight to service the benefit of Mrs. Clinton 's career . "
Penn took another shot at Clinton while speaking about the recent Democratic debate in Las Vegas .
" I found the debate infuriating , nearly an argument for fascism with few exceptions , key among them Dennis Kucinich , " he said .
" Of course as a strategic politician , Mrs. Clinton pulled out her set of Ginzu knives and dominated once again on ' centrist ' political strategy . "
Concluded Penn , " So , let 's give the Constitution another read , shall we ?
And then decide who its greatest defender would be .
I suggest that Republicans , Independents , and Democrats alike will find that they know what 's really right in their hearts and minds . "
A full copy of the speech 's text follows : # PIANO WIRE PUPPETEERS : THE CONSTITUTION , MEDIA & DENNIS KUCINICH By Sean Penn
It 's been an odd week .
For me , a particularly odd week .
But that 's another story .
So , wait a minute .
Iran DOESN'T have nuclear weapon capability ???
So , who are we gonna bomb ?
I want to bomb somebody !
Did n't Senator Clinton just vote in essence to give President Bush the power to bomb Iran ?
If he had done it last week , would that have made her right ?
I mean , if she knew then what she knows now ?
Or am I getting that backward ?
Golly , I 'm confused .
And what about President Bush ?
This week , Vladimir Putin , the man Mr. Bush said he " Looked into the eyes of and found to be very straightforward and trustworthy . "
So much so , he was " able to get a sense of his soul . "
Well that soulful fella has just successfully coalesced the most dangerous power base in Russia since the Cold War amid rumors that include allegations he ordered the assassinations of journalists and imprisonment of noted proponents of freedom ( Oops ) .
Meanwhile , our President 's great enemy in Venezuela , Hugo Chavez , that " totalitarian , " " authoritarian , " " dictator , " that " mad man run amok , " somehow was unsuccessful in his bid for the constitutional reforms that would have allowed him to be repeatedly re-elected for life ... Hmmm ?
Odd week , you know ?
Really .
What happened to Chavez 's " strong - arming ? "
His " electoral corruption ? "
His alleged " gagging of the press ? "
How in the hell could he have lost ?
I 'm sorry , did I miss something ?
How is it that this " Commie bastard " with 80 % of his citizens having elected him in the first place was unable to prevail ?
Could it be that we 've been lied to about him ?
I mean , Pat Robertson 's not a liar , is he ?
His god would n't let that happen , would he ?
And god - forbid , our god would let the right - wing pundits , left - wing corporates , or our own administration send us a bill of goods !?
Is it possible , I mean I know it 's silly , but is it just a little bit possible that President Chavez is in fact a defender of his people 's Constitution ?
That , that 's how his referendum could fail ?
And that that 's why he accepted it with such grace ?
A constitution which I have read several times .
Quite a beautiful document , not dissimilar to our own .
You might give it a read .
Oh , I forgot -- he 's a " drug runner . "
Let me share something with you .
Late one night in Caracas , I met with a couple of fellas , mercenaries I think you call them .
Goddamit , I keep doing that .
I mean " contractors . "
They were Brits , their specialty : drug interdiction .
These two were no great fans of Chavez .
They called him " radical " and expected him to fall to an assassin 's bullet within the year .
Like him or not , he had the cash to win their acceptance of his employ .
And working alongside the Venezuelan military , these two , based in Caracas , had played the mountainous and jungled border between Columbia and Venezuela .
A zone rife with paramilitaries , FARC guerillas , and mer ... scratch that , contractors .
What I was told that evening in Caracas by these piano wire puppeteers was that they had never worked for a government whose investment in drug interdiction was so genuine .
" Yeah , " said one of the Brits , " I gotta give the bastard Chavez that . "
But I was talking about the Constitution .
Most importantly , our own .
And what an odd week it has been .
Our culture is engrained with a tradition that blurs the line between what is right , what is just and what is constitutional , with what is a scam .
That tradition is the cult of personality .
What can TV sell , what kind of crap will we buy .
And at what point are we buying and selling our rights , our pride , our flag , our children , and succumbing to meaningless slogans that are ultimately pure titles for un-Americanism .
How do we know what 's American and what is not ?
Because John
Wayne tells us so ?
Because Sean Penn tells us so ?
Susan Sarandon ?
Bill O'Reilly ?
Michael Moore ?
Senator Bull ?
Or Senator Shit ?
Ann " my bowel expenditure " Coulter ?
No .
It 's our Constitution .
We do n't use it just to win .
We depend on it because it 's the only " us " worth being .
And because it's our children 's inheritance from our shared forefathers and the traditions that really do speak best of our country .
So , here 's the question .
We got Iowa coming up , we got New Hampshire right on its ass .
Do we sell it for electability ?
If Hitler were the only candidate , would voting for him be most American ?
Jump on a plane with me .
Okay , we 're over the Middle East now ... Let 's land .
Take a deep breath .
Imagine the bodies , burned and mutilated , the concussive sounds of gunfire and explosives defining the last horrifying moments of the dying and the dead .
Imagine the millions of refugees fleeing through the deserts of Iraq , the babies crying , and the stench of death in the air .
Yuck .
Let 's get back on the plane and head home .
Now , imagine American servicemen dead or broken , returning from a broken military to a silent casket or a broken veteran 's administration , to broken lives and broken businesses , broken wives , unspoken husbands , and devastated children .
And what for ?
What have we gained ?
Al - Qaida recruitment is up .
Terrorism is up .
Quality of life is down in our country and around the world .
While the rich continue to get richer and the poor , poorer and more numerous .
And on the verge of recession , we are witnessing the dramatic disassembling of the middle class amidst a flood of foreclosures and unpayable debts .
To Osama Bin Laden 's infinite delight , we have become a country of principle breakers rather than principle bearers .
We are torturers and we too often , imprison only the weak .
When our own administration chooses its bewilderingly un-American agenda ( For the entitled people ?
By the entitled people ? ) over the Constitution in defining American values , principles , and law , Bin Laden laughs at the weakened sheep that we and our representatives have become .
High crimes and misdemeanors ?
How about full - blown treason for the outing our own CIA operatives ?
How about full - blown treason for those who support this administration through media propaganda ?
While I 'm not a proponent of the Death Penalty , existing law provides that the likes of Cheney , Bush , Rumsfeld and Rice , if found guilty , could have hoods thrown over their heads , their hands bound , facing a 12 - man rifle corps executing death by firing squad .
And our cowardly democratically dominated House and Senate can barely find one voice willing to propose so much as an impeachment .
That one voice of a true American .
That one voice of Congressman Dennis Kucinich .
This is not going to be a sound bite .
Not if I can help it .
I 'm torn .
I 'm torn between the conventional wisdom of what we all keep being told is electibility and the idealism that perhaps alone can live up to the challenges of our generation .
Of the democrats running for President , only Congressman Dennis Kucinich 's candidacy is backed by a voting record of moral courage and a history of service to our country that has fully earned our support and our gratitude .
And when I say support , I am not speaking to democrats alone , but rather to every American who would take the time on behalf of their children , our planet , and our soldiers to educate themselves on the Kucinich platform .
In the recent debate among Democrats in Las Vegas , the candidates , one after the other , placed security ahead of human rights .
Benjamin Franklin once said " Any society that would give up a little liberty to gain a little security will deserve neither and lose both . "
Then , there was good ole Patrick Henry .
Remember him ?
" Give me liberty , or give me death . "
These were the real tough bastards .
The real John Wayne's .
These are the traditions we should be serving .
I found the debate infuriating , nearly an argument for fascism with few exceptions , key among them Dennis Kucinich .
Of course as a strategic politician , Mrs. Clinton pulled out her set of Ginzu knives and dominated once again on " centrist " political strategy .
In fending off attacks upon she , the front runner , she reminded the audience and her fellow candidates , " We are all Democrats . "
Wolf Blitzer asked each candidate if they would support the other should they themselves not be the nominee .
One after another , the answer , yes .
One exception : Dennis Kucinich , who with the minimal time allotted him , once again rose up beyond the sound bite and put principal ahead of party ; argued policy rather than politeness .
He has been the dominant voice of integrity on issues of trade , labor , education , environment , health , civil liberties , and the one endlessly determined voice of peace .
But is he too short ?
Does his haircut not appeal ?
Is he not loyal enough to a cowardly democratic platform ?
Does he not appeal to the cult of personality ?
And what if the answer is yes ?
What if Dennis Kucinich , the most deserving and noble of candidates , the most experienced in issues of policy and the least willing to play into the politics of personal power ?
What if we can't elect a man simply on the basis of the best ideas , the most courage , and the most selfless service ?
What does it say about our country when we can't rally the voices of the common good to support a man , like our troops , who would die for us , who would die for our constitution ?
Who , as mayor of Cleveland at the age of 31 stood up against contracts on his life .
Three separate assassins whose intent was to kill him as he stood up for his constituency there .
Nonetheless , he carries on .
He continues to serve .
I 've been a supporter of Dennis Kucinich for several years .
And I 've been torn lately .
I 've been torn by the allure of " electability . "
I began to invest some support in a very good man ( one among Dennis 's opponents ) who seems to be finding himself as a constitutional defender , but he 's not one yet .
He is however , among those that we allow the media to distinguish as electable .
But we 're talking about the Constitution here .
We 're talking about our country .
I have decided not to participate in proactive support on the basis of media distinctions .
I have chosen to pledge my support to the singular , strongest and most proven representative of our constitutional mandate .
Dennis Kucinich offers us a very singular opportunity as we share this minute of time on earth .
We , the people .
It is for us to determine what is electable .
And here 's how simple it is :
If we , those of us who truly believe in the Constitution of the United States of America , all of us , vote for Dennis Kucinich , he will be elected .
Could we call him electable then ?
If so , America will stand taller than ever .
Let 's remind our friends in the social circles of New York and the highbrow winner - friendly and monied major cities that support Mrs. Clinton , that this is not Bill Clinton .
For all the misgivings I have about our former President , he raised up friends and opposition alike , his great gift as a motivator of interest and activism , of self - education and participation was , on its own merits , a unique gift .
But do n't underestimate personal agendas , those that initiated NAFTA , betrayed Haitian refugees and gay rights in the military within a minute of his own election .
Do n't underestimate that part of him when he gives his wife the face of his talent .
Do n't underestimate the damage her poisonous ambition can do to this country .
We can't wait for the benefit of hindsight to service the benefit of Mrs. Clinton 's career .
Let 's raise up men and women of vision , of integrity , of belief in our principles .
How exciting would that be to do ?
How good would that be for television ?
What if we turned this game around ?
Imagine watching on television , our country raising up a leader because he represents our Constitution .
Yes , good things can be good TV .
So , let 's give the Constitution another read , shall we ?
And then decide who its greatest defender would be .
I suggest that Republicans , Independents , and Democrats alike will find that they know what 's really right in their hearts and minds .
This text is meant as an attempt to explain what this ' disease ' might be , trying to be as pedagogic as possible .
You are my guinea pigs , so all comments and questions are welcome - indeed , they are hoped for - so that this text can be improved upon and refined .
I 've been developing in a couple of recent diaries over at the European Tribune ( The Anglo Disease - Financiers worried about end of great bull run and Anglo Disease ( 2 ) - Martin Wolf 's take , withadding input of his own in Anglo - Disease Sidelights ( 1 ) : UK = Tax Haven ) a concept which I think can usefully describe our current economic system , that of the , mirrorring the " Dutch disease " , a term coined in the 70s to describe the economic effects of the rapid development of one sector ( in that case , natural gas , today , the financial industry ) on the rest of the economy .
In the Netherlands , the discovery of the large Groningen gas field which brought about a boom in that resource sector , with a lot of - highly profitable - investment concentrating in that sector .
The reason that something which sounds like good news is called a disease is that the investment in that profitable sector tends to cause a drop in investment in other industrial sectors , because it is so much more profitable ; at the same time , there is a lot of extra revenue from the export of the resource , which generates new demand which cannot be fulfilled by domestic production and gives rise to increased imports .
The fact that resource exports grow strongly also tends to cause the domestic currency to get stronger , thus further penalising other sectors of activity on international markets .
The result is a weakening of the rest of the economy , and increased reliance on the resource sector .
This then becomes a problem when the new sector is based on finite resources , and eventually goes into decline .
At that point , exports dry up , but the rest of the economy , having become uncompetitive and fallen behind , can no longer pick up the slack and has become too small to carry the economy over .
Thus the overall economy suffers .
In effect , the displacement of existing activity by the new sector is , to some extent , irreversible , and thus , when the resource dries up , the overall economy is permanently weakened .
It 's also part of the " resource curse " , which usually includes additional symptoms like corruption and weakening of democratic rules as a lot of money gets concentrated in relatively few hands ( those that own and those that regulate the resource industry ) .
In the worst cases , it can include militarisation of society ( weapons being an easy way to spend a lot of foreign currency and being occasionally useful against those that might want to take your sweet spot overseeing the cash cow ) .
: : ::
I think that the above is increasingly relevant to describe the economy of the UK and , to a lesser extent , that of the US , which are increasingly dominated by the financial services industry .
That prevalence of the financial world is no longer a matter of dispute .
In fact , it is celebrated with increasingly euphoric words in most business publications and current affairs books .
There is an air of hegelian ( or marxist ) inevitability about the triumph of markets and Anglo - Saxon capitalism , led by the powerhouses ( banks , hedge funds and assorted accomplices ) in the City of London and on Wall Street .
But just as Britain led the world into industrialisation , so now Britain is leading it out .
Today you can still find a few British engineers and scientists making jet engines and pharmaceuticals — and doing rather well at it .
But many more are cooking up algorithms for hedge funds and investment banks — where in many cases they add more value .
The economy has boomed these past 15 years , as manufacturing has been left behind and London has become the world 's leading international financial centre .
Britain 's deficit in manufactured goods is hitting record highs .
But so are the capital inflows .
The Economist ( editorial , this week )
The collapse of the trade balance , linked to the long term ( relative ) decline of the manufacturing sector is indeed one of the most noteworthy commonalities between the US and UK economies , along with the reliance on the sale of services , in particular financial services :
Unfettered finance is fast reshaping the global economy ( by Martin Wolf , senior editor , Financial Times , 19 June 2007 )
It is capitalism , not communism , that generates what the communist Leon Trotsky once called “ permanent revolution ” .
It is the only economic system of which that is true .
Joseph Schumpeter called it “ creative destruction ” .
Now , after the fall of its adversary , has come another revolutionary period .
Capitalism is mutating once again .
Much of the institutional scenery of two decades ago – distinct national business elites , stable managerial control over companies and long - term relationships with financial institutions – is disappearing into economic history .
We have , instead the triumph of the global over the local , of the speculator over the manager and of the financier over the producer .
We are witnessing the transformation of mid-20th century managerial capitalism into global financial capitalism .
Above all , the financial sector , which was placed in chains after the Depression of the 1930s , is once again unbound .
Many of the new developments emanated from the US .
But they are ever more global .
With them come not just new economic activities and new wealth but also a new social and political landscape .
The ability of the financial world to generate high returns on capital has fuelled the massive financial boom we 've been in for most of our lives and which has so transformed our economic landscape .
By demonstrating regular high returns possible , it has generalised the requirement for such returns in all economic activities , and thus the need for constant restructuring of businesses , for cost - cutting , offshoring and , often , for the wholesale dismantlement of whole sectors of activity that could not generate the required profitability .
Sectors like manufacturing have seen their share of economic activity shrink , as many activities were outsourced , offshored or eliminated altogether .
The trade balance has gone south , and jobs have disappeared under relentless pressure for higher competitivity .
This might not be so bad if the jobs created in the service sector , and in finance in particular , were as numerous and high paying - and durable as those in the industry .
All statistics on median wages suggest that this is not the case : median wages have been stagnant over the past couple of decades , with a stark increase in inequality .
Increased wealth ( as measured by GDP or average income ) has been captured by a small number of people at the top , something strikingly similar to the remuneration structure of big investment banks and the rest of the financial industry .
The inequality might be acceptable if there was a prospect of reversing it as increasing prosperity is created ( this is essentially the argument of Martin Wolf and other proponents of globalisation ) , but is in fact a structural and necessary feature of the system .
Globalisation has spawned a whole ideology about efficient allocation of resources , optimisation of investment decisions , and the invisible , but natural , and morally neutral hand that allow markets to reveal the best price at any given moment for any item .
It brings along a vicious hate for taxation , and sees government , and its core functions , redistribution and regulation , as something to be avoided and eliminated as much as possible , being fundamentally anti-efficient .
It also brings the core idea that only things that have a price have a value , that everything can be measured in dollars , and that what is n't so measured has no worth nor legitimacy .
It fosters a culture of individualism ( " freedom " ) and consumerism ( " success " ) .
Social policies ( which require distribution ) , common goods ( which need to be defined and managed ) and non-economic measures of well - being are spurned and actively fought .
Growth is paramount .
While I think that this is more than enough to disqualify neoliberalism ( as I have mande abundantly clear in many earlier diaries ) , there is actually worse .
and that 's where the concept of the ' Dutch disease ' comes in .
: : ::
One of the core triggers of the Dutch disease is that the resource sector which has unbalanced the economy eventually shrinks as the underlying resource is depleted .
In our case , the industry that causes activity - substitution ( finance ) can appear to be able to grow ad infinitum , without any limitation to actual resources .
Just borrow more money to do bigger deals and enjoy the very real income taken along the way .
Find another lender to refinance or another buyer to re-purchase , and you 're home and dry .
Or just do deals where the actual burden to repay is pushed back into the future ( and you wo n't be around anymore if and when they falter ) .
Thus the City and Wall Street can appear to generate more jobs than the industries they kill off destroy .
In addition , with New York and ( even moreso ) London dominating finance worldwide and not just domestically , they can create jobs and capture wealth locally while imposing their requirements on companies and activities in other countries , thus creating little or no pain at home ( see the graph below on how the UK as a whole can be defined as an offshore financial center , just like any Caribbean Island ... )
So , while to some extent parasitic on other economies , it might at least make sense for the UK and the US - as nimbler , faster , smarter economies , they reap the benefits of globalisation and are understandably promoting their interests by defending globalisation .
And hey , they are providing real services to investors around the world , who are " free to seek out the best returns around " and " voting with their feet / money . "
But in fact , this is but a transitory phenomenon , underpinned by a single underlying factor : the long decline of inflation , and thus of interest rates , over the past 25 years .
We 've been living in a long , massive bull market for bonds , born off the inflation of the 70s , and the grand ride which was made possible by the new financial tools offered by the IT revolution and by Reagan / Thatcher inspired deregulation is about to come to an end .
The returns we 've grown used to were just a long but temporary phase in a natural long term economic cycle , and , despite the final boost provided by ' Bubbles ' Greenspan in the last few years , not something that can be sustained on a permanent basis .
Put simply , it is not possible to generate 15 % per annum returns on capital forever when the underlying economy is growing only by 3 % .
As the interest rates go up again , and liquidity tightens again , the financial industry is going to run out of the underlying resource that sustained it - easy and plentiful access to money .
As that constraint imposes its implacable discipline , and the financial industry finds out that it no longer has anything to offer to its clients ( trading stuff , or trading imaginary products remotely backed by stuff , will no longer be so much more profitable than making stuff ) , it is going to shrink and withdraw .
And the countries and cities that have bet on that industry for their prosperity will face the resource curse , as their core activity loses steam and alternative activities , having being neglected for so long , no longer exist or are too small or uncompetitive to make a difference , and can not pick up the slack .
This is what I propose should be called the Anglo Disease .
As this reversal has not yet taken place , and as this prediction threatens the livelihoods of many of my readers , I expect to be mocked and dismissed , but bear with me and help me work on the concept .
I hope to expand on the idea in further diaries , and I hope to get your feedback ( including questions if you 're not sure you understand what I wrote - maybe I am actually talking nonsense , for all my apparent trust in my assertions ) .
The topic ties in neatly with the critique of neoliberalism I 've been trying to write about in the past , to our unsustainable focus on growth as a sign of success , to worries about resource availability , and to the " inevitability " of the Western model - or rather of its financial brat , the Anglo - Saxon capitalist market economy , so there is a lot of matter to write about , and I hope you 'll join in the fun .

BBC rural affairs correspondent
Phil Walsh 's crew exceeded their cod quota by June
It says fishing crews often continue catching large amounts of fish such as cod by accident after exceeding quotas - and have no option but to dump them .
Ministers are pushing for a quota increase to help solve the problem .
But environmentalists have called for a change in practices , such as avoiding areas with large numbers of white fish .
40%-60 % dumped
European Union quotas strictly limit the amount of fish that vessels can bring back to port , but there is no restriction on the amount of fish they actually catch .
As a result , boats fishing in the " mixed fishery " of the North Sea often catch a species or size of fish which is above their quota and have to throw the " discard " back .
The EU estimates that between 40 % and 60 % of fish caught by trawlers in this area is dumped back into the sea .
Trawler skipper Phil Walsh told BBC
News he had landed all of the cod he was allowed by June this year .
Since then , he has been fishing for prawns and dumping prime whiting , haddock and cod , which would fetch as much as £ 13.50 / kg on a supermarket shelf .
" I can't describe the feeling really , " he said .
" It 's your livelihood and you spend your life trying to catch it and then you have to throw it back over the side .
" It 's an impossible situation and , unless it is sorted out soon , we will all be finished . "
Many Scottish and English fishermen say they have seen a huge increase in the number of cod in the North Sea this year and now want an increase in the quota level for cod and other white fish they catch .
Decline in numbers
But environmentalists , who have for years been sounding the alarm bell over the decline of North Sea fish stocks , say now is not the time to increase the amount being caught .
HAVE YOUR SAY
We should take back control of British waters .
Before the opening up of British waters to EU countries , these problems never existed
Simon Ward , London
Send us your comments
They say quotas are essential to ensure spawning stocks are allowed to mature and to breed .
But , like the fishermen , activists such as the World Wildlife Fund 's Helen McLachlan agree that throwing dead cod back into the water is not the answer .
Instead , she said , there must be a change in fishing practices .
" Nobody wants discards , " she said .
" So let 's not catch the fish in the first place .
I thought I would never see the day that I had to throw adult cod overboard
David Mell
UK fishing in figures Should EU change policy ?
" Let 's avoid areas where there are going to be large spawning stocks of fish , let 's avoid juveniles ... let 's use selective gear so [ a fisherman can say ] , ' I will only catch prawns , I will not catch white fish ' . "
Oliver Knowles , a campaigner for Greenpeace , also believes quotas are not working for the UK 's mixed fisheries .
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme : " By the government 's own figures , of the 186 million fish caught in UK waters last year , 117 million of them were thrown away dead as waste .
" That 's actually 63 % of the catch , so it 's clear that we do need to do something about this . "
But he added that some kind of limit was needed .
The Scotland - based super - trawlers , with their state - of - the - art technology , say they find it hard to be 100 % specific in targeting the species and size of their catch .
And so they , like the hard - pressed inshore fishermen south of the border , continue to discard huge amounts of good fish .
" I feel very bitter because we 've been so long trying to protect the cod , " said trawler skipper David Mell .
" [ We 've had ] decommissioning , increased our mesh size , we 've been through a lot of pain really .... [ But ]
I thought I would never see the day that I had to throw adult cod overboard . "
Recovery hope
Fisheries Minister Jonathan
Shaw said he agreed it was an " absolute waste " to throw good quality fish back into the sea .
He told the Today programme he would be pushing for an EU quota increase as well as looking at technological solutions , such as nets that would catch only certain kinds of fish .
" What is important is we have fish tomorrow as well as today , " he said .
" We have seen a recovery in cod in the North Sea in particular - now that is good news .
" So that is why we will be pressing the commission at the annual round in December for an increase in cod and hopefully that will help the fishermen . "
EU Fisheries Commissioner Joe Borg - who is instrumental in setting the laws and limits - agreed that discarding fish was " immoral " but said there was no clear solution .
" The problem is when we come to work out the details of how to eliminate discarding but at the same time have sustainable fisheries - that is the big problem . "
Detailing measures to be taken , he said : " In relation to alcohol the intention is to introduce widespread alcohol restrictions on Northern Territory Aboriginal land for six months .
" We will ban the sale , the possession , the transportation , the consumption and [ introduce the ] broader monitoring of takeaway sales across the Northern Territory . "
The Federal Government would legislate to intervene in the territory to enact measures to combat child abuse , Mr Howard said .
He said 50 per cent of welfare payments through Centrelink to parents of children in affected areas would be quarantined to prevent all their money being spent on alcohol .
" The obligation in relation to that will follow the parent wherever that parent may go so the obligation cannot be avoided simply by moving to another part of Australia .
" Effectively , the arrangements will be that that 50 per cent can only be used for the purchase of food and other essentials . "
Mr Howard also announced the Commonwealth would make welfare payments dependent on children attending school .
" We 're going to enforce school attendance by linking income support and family assistance payments to school attendance for all people living on Aboriginal land , " he said .
" We will be ensuring that meals are provided to children at school , with parents paying for the meals . "
The Federal Government would take control of Aboriginal townships through five - year leases to improve property and public housing , Mr Howard said , adding that compensation would be forthcoming if required .
Mr Howard said the reforms would include scrapping the permit system for common areas and road corridors on Aboriginal lands , and marshalling work - for - the - dole participants to clean up Aboriginal communities .
Possession of X - rated pornography would be banned and all publicly - funded computers searched for evidence of stored pornography , he said .
Mr Howard said law and order would be a central focus of the dramatic measures .
" There will be an immediate increase in policing efforts , " he said .
" We 'll be asking each state police service to provide up to 10 officers who will be sworn as police in the Northern Territory . "
The Government will also set up an Australian Government sexual abuse reporting desk .
Mr Howard said there will be a meeting next Thursday of the intergovernmental committee on the Australian Crime Commission .
" At the meeting our minister will ask the ministerial council to formally refer this issue to the Australian Crime Commission to allow the crime commission to locate and identify perpetrators of sexual abuse of indigenous children in other areas of Australia . "
Mr Howard said at cabinet 's next meeting Indigenous Affairs Minister Mal Brough would present further proposals to extend the conditionalities of welfare payments to other welfare recipients .
" To ensure that these payments are used for the benefit of the children , " he said .
He said Parliament would come back during the winter break , if needed , to deal with the legislation required to implement the initiative .
Mr Brough said cabinet would consider conditions on which measures requiring welfare payments to be devoted to the benefit of indigenous children would be extended to all other welfare recipients .
He said that particularly applied to the family tax benefit , but included all payments intended to assist children .
" The Australian population has a real desire to see that money only spent on the welfare of children .
That has been our clear objective , " he said .
" In addition to that is of course school education .
You should n't have a black or white boundary .
Every child should be going to school and if this can help do that , then they are two areas we are current examining and we will have further to say after the cabinet . "
Seizure of land ' will take indigenous people back 40 years '
Sydney Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council chair Rob Welsh said he had not yet seen the details of the proposed measures , but that the seizure of Aboriginal land would take indigenous people back 40 years .
" It 's total control of Aboriginal destinies .
They 've been trying to do it with housing right across Australia .
" That land has cultural significance because there are things that connect people to the land over centuries . "
He said Aboriginal people had little trust in governments to deal sensitively with land .
" As soon as we start giving it back it 's going to be mined and have waste dumped on it . "

This page is the subject of the Dumbest Reddit Thread Ever .
Slow news day , I guess .
Feel free to visit my old drunken blog rants , or my newer plain old blog rants .
You do n’t want to read this article .
But you should and must .
It contains some dreadful truths that are universal but no one will is willing to talk about them because the subject is so uncomfortable .
I would like to reveal a universal prejudice — it is a cruel and judgmental attitude that is written on the hearts of people in all times and all place — that might very well wreck your life , but which you can deal with rather easily .
The subject is table manners .
No biggie , right ?
Who cares about how one holds a fork or cuts a steak or eats soup ?
All this is merely Victorian frippery , irrelevant in our days of social liberation .
Here ’s the truth .
You are being judged every time you lift fork to mouth .
And not just judged : you are watched with an eagle eye and mercilessly and horribly criticized in the minds of those around you .
They are forming extreme opinions about you .
Missteps are being chronicled in the annals of the personal histories others carry around in their minds .
What ’s more , the assembly of facts that people hold in their minds concerning your table manners rise to the top .
It is more important than what you say , because table manners seem to reveal some inner secret about you , your background , your class , your rearing , your parents , your attentiveness and self - awareness .
People are perversely interested in your secrets , particularly those you reveal inadvertently .
No , people will not admit it .
But they are lying .
You are how you eat .
It comes down to this .
You can be wearing a $ 2000 suit .
You can speak with incredible erudition .
You can have the whitest teeth , the best jokes , the coolest haircut , and looks of dazzling beauty .
But bad table manners wipe it all away .
Worse : the better you look and sound , the higher the standards are for your manners and the more severe people will be toward your slipups .
Why ?
Because people will figure that all the other externals are nothing but a put-on .
You will be a living , breathing hoax .
I know that these truths are hard to take .
The first thought might be : hey , do n’t impinge on my eating freedom !
I ’ll eat how I want !

Ok , that ’s fine .
But then you have to live with the consequences .
It ’s the same with dress and language .
You can cuss like a congressman , use the vulgarity word at the table , stink to high heaven , and wear sweats to a dinner party .
For that matter , you can staple your face with 100 metal rings , and stretch your earlobes to your shoulders — but then you have to live with the social fallout .
People will shun you .
You will be an outcast .
It ’s not only that .
Are you really happy knowing that people who have eaten with you carry around an image of you in their heads that has you eating like a pig ?
It does n’t take much to cause this : stacking your artichoke leaves upside - down , for example .
So even if it does n’t hurt your career ( which is does ! ) , are you really happy knowing that people think ill of you ?
Fine , you say , but first let ’s discuss this .
At some point in your life , you will be required to eat in front of someone whom you want to impress .
It could be a future employer .
It could be a present manager higher up in the pecking order .
It could be the dean , your pastor , a potential client or donor .
It could be a possible future in - law .
Do n’t think that eating alone in a fast - food place protects you .
Someone could be watching .
That someone might later find himself or herself in a position to do you a favor .
So let ’s say you blow it on one of these occasions .
There will be no announcement .
No explanation .
No one will take you aside and say : “ Next time , eat your soup by moving the spoon away from your body . ”
No one says : “ I like Jane , but she needs to brush up her table etiquette . ”
You will never know the reason for your failure .
But neither will you ascend .
You will only go as far as your manners place you in the social hierarchy .
Again , people are horribly and secretly cruel : they will condemn not only your character but your whole family history .
It ’s not just your reputation that stands in the balance but that generation’s .

And remember that you only have one chance to get it right , and then you die and your legacy is established for all of history .
Your legacy does not need to be less than it could , all because you never put your napkin on your lap .
These are brutal facts , terrifying ones , even .
But it ’s better that you know now rather than blow your one chance to get it right .
Remember the quotation attributed to Oscar Wilde : “ The world was my oyster , but I used the wrong fork . ”
There are many guides to table manners out there .
But we live in a blogging culture in which all information must be instant and short .
So here are the five essential things you MUST do no matter what :
Hold your fork and spoon properly .
There is only one way : balance them between the first knuckle of the middle finger and the tip of the index finger ; the thumb steadies the handle .
There are no variations on this , no issues of personal style , and no regional permissions .
For some things , such as cutting with the other hand , there are other variations that require turning the fork over .
If you are unsure , default to the orthodox way .
Put your napkin in your lap after you sit down to dinner .
Do not forget .
Do n’t smack .
This is easy , right ?
Apparently not .
Smacking is incredibly and disgustingly common .
People must suppose that others do n’t hear it .
But they do , and it ’s awful .
There is only one way in the known universe to prevent smacking : keep your lips closed when there is food in your mouth , no matter what .
Eat at the margin , not the aggregate .
Do n’t cut all your steak up before you begin eating .
Do n’t butter your whole roll .
Prepare each bit separately .
If in doubt , wait for others .
Do n’t start eating anything until everyone has been served .
There : that ’s five hard - core rules .
There are a hundred others that you can pick up in time , and it is good to read a book , so that you know for sure that you are doing it right .
But you do not want to look like an obsessive rule keeper .
Equally important to obeying rules is to look like you are not even thinking about them .
You must look comfortable , happy , and relaxed .
What ’s more , this is the only way to be in order that you can be delightful at the table .
Okay , so you are jolted a bit , and offended by this article .
You are tempted to forget that you ever read it .
You are free to do so .
But others are also free to think of you as uncouth , ill - trained , low - born , and poorly raised , and to treat you with all those assumptions in mind .
Yes , there are probably great men and women of the past who ate like pigs .
They succeeded despite it .
Why take the chance that you will happen to be among them , when minding manners is so little to ask ?

Airship Ventures , a company based in the San Francisco Bay Area , has a thing for rigid helium filled airships .
They plan to bring a modern carbon composite Zeppelin and offer sightseeing flights around the Bay to the public for $ 250 - 500 a ride , perhaps as soon as October 2008 .
They have been working with the local city governments early in the process to address any concerns they may have about hangearing the ship at NASA 's Moffett Field during inclement weather and for maintenance .
They hope to have tourists board their flight at Moffett in addition to other potential sites around the Bay and Wine Country .
Flying at 500 to 1000 ft above the ground , you will have a bird 's - eye view of famous landmarks ( such as the Golden Gate bridge , Coit Tower ,
Alcatraz , etc in the San Francisco Area )
Modern Zeppelins are already carrying passengers in Germany , Japan and South Africa ( the third ship was used in Botswana to search for diamonds ) .
You can check out pictures of their operations on the Airship Ventures website .
Alexandra Hall is the CEO of Airship Ventures and a PhD Astrophysicist .
Before starting Airship Ventures with her husband Brian , she was the head of the Chabot Space and Science Center in Oakland , California .
Together the Halls have taken their common love for airships ( you should see how many they have on their Christmas tree ) and have turned it into a business that will bring their beloved vessel back to service in the US .
" Is this a blimp ? "
No .
While externally Zeppelins and blimps look quite alike , and indeed its not uncommon to hear people talking about zeppelins when they mean blimps , there is a significant difference .
A blimp does not have an internal rigid frame .
This means that typically the engines have to be mounted to the gondola .
In a Zeppelin , the engines are mounted to the frame on the side of the hull , where they are both more effective , and quieter than their gondola mounted counterparts on blimps .
In return for providing a hangear big enough for an airship , NASA would receive payment that can help fund operations of the airfield and use the airship for scientific instrumentation and data collection of their own .
The major advantage of the Zeppelin is that it is a lot quieter then than traditional aircraft and thus more likely to keep the neighbors happy .
Of course you can't talk about bringing Zeppelin 's back without a Led Zeppelin reference .
In Airship Ventures ' blog they discuss that in reading the original history of Count Zeppelin 's airships that they originally called the steps leading up into the airship 's gondola " Himmelstreppe " in German or " Stairway to Heaven . "
In tribute I will now put on one of my favorite Zeppelin tunes - " Over the Hills and Far Away " .
I hope the new ships will have a really good sound system ...

A History of Treemap Research at the University of Maryland
During 1990 , in response to the common problem of a filled hard disk , I became obsessed with the idea of producing a compact visualization of directory tree structures .
Since the 80 Megabyte hard disk in the HCIL was shared by 14 users it was difficult to determine how and where space was used .
Finding large files that could be deleted , or even determining which users consumed the largest shares of disk space were difficult tasks .
Tree structured node - link diagrams grew too large to be useful , so I explored ways to show a tree in a space - constrained layout .
I rejected strategies that left blank spaces or those that dealt with only fixed levels or fixed branching factors .
Showing file size by area coding seemed appealing , but various rectangular , triangular , and circular strategies all had problems .
Then while puzzling about this in the faculty lounge , I had the Aha !
experience of splitting the screen into rectangles in alternating horizontal and vertical directions as you traverse down the levels .
This recursive algorithm seemed attractive , but it took me a few days to convince myself that it would always work and to write a six line algorithm .
This algorithm and the initial designs led to the first Technical Report ( HCIL TR 91-03 ) in March 1991 which was published in the ACM Transactions on Graphics in January 1992 ( http://www.acm.org/pubs/citations/journals/tog/1992-11-1/p92-shneiderman/).
Choosing the right name took probably as long , but the term ' treemap ' described the notion of turning a tree into a planar space - filling map .
My initial design simply nested the rectangles , but a more comprehensible design used a border to show the nesting .
Finding an effective visualization strategy took only a few months but producing a working piece of software took over a year .
Brian Johnson implemented the algorithms and refined the presentation strategies while preserving rapid performance even with 5,000 node hierarchies .
The TreeViz application ran on color Macintosh models and led to the widely cited paper ( HCIL TR 91-06 ) jointly authored paper in the October 1991 IEEE Conference on Visualization .
This paper was reprinted in Readings in Information Visualization .
I think treemaps are a convenient representation that has unmatched utility for certain tasks .
The capacity to see tens of thousands of nodes in a fixed space and find large areas or duplicate directories is very powerful .
I still use TreeViz for cleaning up my Macintosh .
It does take some learning for novices to grasp the tree structure layout in treemaps , but the benefits are great .
PhD student Brian Johnson 's implementation added many other interesting features such as zooming , sound ( as a redundant or independent code , for example , larger files had a lower pitched sound ) , hue / saturation control , many border variations , and labeling control .
We struggled to deal with the problem of many small files in some directories , but wound up showing only a blackened area that invited closer examination by zooming .
We knew that encoding a linear variable such as file size as an area was breaking a graphic design guideline , but the benefits of seeing a large range of file sizes seemed like a compensation .
We also knew that visually comparing long narrow rectangles to squarish ones was problematic , but cursoring over the boxes produced the exact file size on the bottom of the display .
My excitement about treemaps was great and like many innovators I thought millions of users would be using this tool within a few years .
Our minds were not focused on getting a patent , since I thought this was more of a concept that a product .
Brian 's implementation of TreeViz was registered with the University 's Office of Technology Liaison which sought to distribute TreeViz .
We found that new users took 10 - 15 minutes to get acquainted with the treemap display , so we began to explore improvements and training methods .
We were impressed to examine thousands of nodes at 5 - 7 levels at once on the screen , but novices did better seeing 20 - 50 nodes at 1 - 3 levels .
We had to bring our training times up to about 15 minutes in order to demonstrate the strong benefits of treemaps .
Brian Johnson 's dissertation ( HCIL TR 94 -04 ) reports on two studies , that were never published , that sort out the benefits of his treemaps .
The 1992 HCIL Video Reports and the 1993 HCIL Video Reports showed TreeViz in action .
TreeViz for Apple Macintosh is available for free downloading .
Masters student David Turo also built a treemap system on the Sun workstation and to make it more comprehensible we chose a fixed - level hierarchy .
We used an appealing and familiar sports application : 453 basketball players , organized into the 27 teams in four leagues of the National Basketball Association .
We had 48 statistics about each player for the 1991 - 92 season , so users could chose color and area coding from points scored , fouls , free throws , etc. .
The 1993 HCIL Video Reports showed Turo 's system with the basketball data .
His Masters thesis ( Unpublished ! ) describes his implementations and an empirical study .
Johnson and Turo cooperated on a paper describing improvements they made to the visual presentation ( HCIL TR 92-06 ) .
By now we were pushing ahead on several application domains .
A German visitor , Alexander Jungmeiseter worked with Dave Turo 's implementation and built a stock portfolio visualization that showed clients , portfolios , industry groups , stocks and trades ( HCIL TR 92 - 14 ) .
Size might indicate worth of the holdings and color might indicate the degree of increase / decrease in value .
I still believe that a worthwhile application would be a stock market monitor that would show the current daily trade activity .
It could present the 30 Dow Jones Industrials , the Standard and Poor 's 500 , or all 2700 companies on the New York Stock Exchange .
They would be grouped by industry ( airlines , chemicals , drugs , ... ) , area coded by volume of trading , and color coded by increase / decrease .
A Japanese visitor , Asahi Toshiyuki , built his own innovative treemap interface to implement the Analytical Hierarchy Process in decision making ( HCIL TR 94-08 ) .
Users could express their opinions of the relative merits of a decision choice ( such as which site to chose for a factory ) by pumping up areas for their preferred choices , and pumping up the areas for importance of costs , availability of labor , tax breaks , etc. ( Figure 5 ) .
The video demonstrates these processes ( HCIL Video Reports 1994 , and HCIL TR 95 - 04 ) and an empirical study showed users could succeed with this tool .
Another success story for treemaps was their inclusion in a satellite management system for Hughes Network Systems ( HCIL Video Reports 1994 and HCIL Report TR 94-07 ) .
The three - level hierarchy showed each node of a network as a fixed size and color was used to indicate available capacity .
The engineering - oriented community of ground station operators grasped this simplified version quickly .
In my travels to lecture about our work , treemaps became a major topic .
However , I ran into resistance when showing still images of our hard disk directories with thousands of nodes .
Once at the University of Washington after my talk produced a mixed reaction about treemaps , I asked my audience to follow me down to one of their labs .
I installed TreeViz and examined their hard disk directories .
I immediately spotted a problem , and with a few clues they could see for themselves that there were three copies of the same C compiler installed on this machine .
The x-ray vision metaphor had proven to be effective on this occasion .
Similarly , at Apple Computers , my audience much preferred the dynamic queries demos of the HomeFinder , but I gave copies of TreeViz to several interested attendees .
The next day one of them reported finding many megabytes of useless information on their network servers .
While TreeViz was appreciated for the Apple Macintosh , we were getting requests for a Windows version .
Graduate student Marko Teittinen took up the challenge and used Galaxy from Visix to produce a Windows 3.1 implementation called WinSurfer .
Marko's carefully scripted video ( HCIL Video Reports 1995 ) showed the features which were meant to match the Windows Explorer .
WinSurfer allowed users to view , delete , copy , move , rename and run files .
It worked nicely , but novices were often struggling to understand the layout that might show 5000 or more files at 7 or more levels .
Simplifying the initial screen presentation to only 2 levels and allowing simpler user control never got implemented .
In fact , we never produced a Windows 95 version and Galaxy is no longer a viable commercial product .
However , we did make a temporary patch so as to enter WinSurfer in the Browse - Off competition at ACM SIGCHI 's 1997 Conference .
This event drew six software tools for exploring hierarchies .
There was no clear cut winner and WinSurfer was a leader in some tasks .
Micro Logic Corp , a New Jersey company , sells a commercial product , called DiskMapper http://www.miclog.com/dmdesc.htm for Windows machines based on the treemap idea .
They have received great press attention and awards for their product .
The University of Maryland receives a modest royalty on DiskMapper by way of a license agreement with the Office of Technology Liaison .
Statisticians point out that the mosaic display , shown by Bertin , and others is similar to the treemap concept .
For fixed level hierarchies there is a great similarity , but the gist of the treemap idea was intimately tied to the computerized implementation and user control panel for setting attributes .
A discussion of mosaic displays and an implementation that allows rapid switching of the hierarchy is in a Univ of Maryland graduate student project : CatTrees : Dynamic Visualization of Categorical Data Using Treemaps .
During 1997 an implementation was done in Delphi by Univ. of Maryland grad students Jerome Brown and Shaun Gittens .
It is called TreeMap97 ( http://www.otal.umd.edu/Olive/Class/Trees/).
This general purpose version of slice - and - dice treemaps was revised by Chris North .
You can download the software ( updated version ) and run the sample data set or import your own data sets .
During Summer 2000 , the HCIL resumed work on treemaps , when Raghuveera Chalasani developed a Java version ( http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/treemaps/treemap2000) that included dynamic queries sliders .
By early 2001 we polished his implementation into Treemap 3.0 http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/treemap3 which is licensed by the Univ. of Maryland 's Office of Technology Liaison http://www.otc.umd.edu ( screen shot ) .
Treemap 3.0 includes dynamic queries to filter out unwanted items , squarified layout ( as well as slice - and - dice ) , improved input , infotips , and color / font controls .
A demo version with five data sets is available for free .
A useful feature of Treemap 3.0 is that it also allows you to visualize the contents of your Windows PC directory structure .
The cluster and squarified treemap algorithms are visually appealing in part because the rectangles are more square like .
They avoid the thin rectangles in the slice - and - dice algorithm , but sacrifice the alphabetic ordering of nodes .
This creates an additional problem when leaf node sizes change because the position of rectangles can alter dramatically .
The goal of ordered treemaps was achieved by a novel algorithm that nicely balanced square - like nodes ( aspect ratios close to one ) while preserving order .
This paper , " Ordered Treemap Layouts " was presented at the October 2001 IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization .
However , we found still more ways to improve the layout by organizing the screen space into horizontal ( or vertical ) strips .
This idea helped keep the square - like aspect ratio and made for an easier to follow ordering .
We demonstrated this with a study of 20 users .
Another innovation , quantum treemaps , satisfy the need to accommodate fixed shape items like page thumbnails or photos .
The paper , " Ordered and Quantum Treemaps : Making Effective Use of 2D Space to Display Hierarchies " appeared in ACM Transactions on Graphics ( October 2002 , vol 21 , no 4 , pp 833-854 ) ( http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=571647.571649).
The figure below shows a quantum strip treemap of a photo image browser , PhotoMesa .
To support researchers and students , Ben Bederson and Martin Wattenberg wrote an open source Java 1.1 library of five Treemap Algorithms .
They are generic , and should be readily usable by arbitrary applications .
Each takes a list of numbers and an input rectangle , and generates a set of sub- rectangles that are proportional in area to the input numbers , and partition the space of the input rectangle .
The 5 treemap algorithms implemented are :
BinaryTree - Partially ordered , not very good aspect ratios , stable
Ordered - Partially ordered , medium aspect ratios , medium stability
SliceAndDice - Ordered , very bad aspect ratios , stable
Squarified - Unordered , best aspect ratios , medium stability
Strip - Ordered , medium aspect ratios , medium stability
This animated demonstration shows the strengths and weaknesses of these algorithms .
Treemap 4 , released in February 2003 , includes a flexible hierarchy , color binning , improved color setting , aggregation , directory mapping , and export .
Our applications include treemaps to show oil production data ( SPE paper ) , project management ( PMI paper ) , and a gene ontology with 14,000 nodes at 16 levels .
Our work with biologist Eric Baehrecke led to a special version of Treemap to handle the Gene Ontology and gene expression data from microarray studies ( see paper in BMC Bioinformatics 2004 , 5:84 )
In august 2003 , substantial code modifications were made to speed loading , permit use as an applet , and enhance usage of tm3 files .
In addition , online documentation has been added in the usual textual format , and also as a set of 13 user selectable QuickDemos ( animated with sound ) that run from 11 to 75 seconds .
A 9 - minute video overview is also available .
A 20 - year review of treemaps as compared with hyperbolic and cone trees reveals patterns in research citations , trade press mentions , and patent data .
Conjectures about why treemaps succeeded are made by Shneiderman , B. , Dunne , C. , Sharma , P. , and Wang , P. , Innovation Trajectories for Information Visualizations : Comparing Treemaps , Cone Trees , and Hyperbolic Trees , Information Visualization Journal 11 , 2 ( 2011 ) , 87-105 .
The summer of 2013 was a good time for Ben Shneiderman to work with grad student Minhaz Kazi to produce the Treemap Art Project .
The 12 large ( 24 x 36 inches ) colorful images are framed and hanging in the3rd - floor hallway at the UM Computer Sciences Instructional Center .
The designs and color palettes were influenced by modern art masters such as Mondrian , Albers , Davis , Hoffman , etc. , but they still show real data with significant insights .ï¿½

Andrea Gawrylewski reports that an email from an " ACS insider , " who insisted on anonymity , alleges that bonuses paid to executives of the American Chemical Society are tied to the profits of the publishing division and that this is why the society is opposing open - access publishing .
In January , Nature revealed that the Association of American Publishers had hired PR crisis management guru Eric Dezenhall to devise a campaign against proposals for free public access to publicly funded scientific research , and that ACS had attended a briefing on the campaign .
Rudy Baum , the editor - in - chief of Chemical & Engineering News -- an ACS publication -- " declined to say whether his bonuses were linked to publishing profits . "
However , former ACS staff told Gawrylewski that it was well known that senior managers ' bonuses were linked to profitability .
The chair of the ACS board of directors , Judith Benham , rejected the suggestion that the society 's opposition to open access publishing was linked to executive compensation .
Sexuality as we know it , especially as it pertains to men , has n’t always looked the way it does today .
In fact , it has been the subject of controversy and contention since its first mention ...
A German consortium has announced its plan to build the world 's largest structure - a 578 m - high " Giant Pyramid " , designed to offer paying customers the chance to " outlast personal physical existence " , as the group 's website puts it .
The plan is pretty simple : build a big pyramid where anyone willing to stump up about € 700 can get a burial spot .
The blurb explains :
" The Great Pyramid can potentially be any human being ’s grave or memorial site .
As monumental as it is affordable , it serves those of all nationalities and religions .
Individuals who are either unwilling or unable to have their physical remains buried there can also opt to have a memorial stone placed instead .
Stones can be custom designed with any number of colors , images , or relief decorations .
The Great Pyramid will continue to grow with every stone placed , eventually forming the largest structure in the history of man . "
The " Friends of the Pyramid " have already attracted seed money from the " Future of Labor " programme of the government - backed German Federal Cultural Foundation , and on Sunday unveiled a stone prototype of the structure at a " Great Pyramid Festival " in Streetz , north of Dessau .
The Great Pyramid is designed as an organic project , which will grow only as paying customers die and are immortalised in stone .
Surprisingly , it has invited " Pritzker - winning " Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas to " lead the jury for choosing a final design for the project " .
We say surprisingly , because the above pics and the building 's name give a few hints as to how the final result may look .
Accordingly , since it will almost certainly end in a lofty point , there are unconfirmed reports that Bill Gates , Steve Ballmer and Larry Ellison are currently engaged in a savage bidding war to determine who will occupy the pyramid 's pinnacle in a sarcophagus hewn from gem-encusted silicon and from which lasers project their eternal likeness onto the surface of the moon .
Mere mortals , meanwhile , can register their interest here . ®
NOVEMBER 15-- Baseball star Barry Bonds was indicted today on perjury and obstruction of justice charges stemming from a years - long federal probe that examined his alleged use of steroids .
A copy of the Bonds indictment , which was filed today in U.S. District Court in San Francisco , can be found here .
According to the five - count indictment , Bonds lied to a federal grand jury in December 2003 when asked about his use of steroids .
During that appearance , Bonds , 43 , repeatedly denied that his trainer , Greg Anderson , provided him with performance - enhancing drugs like human growth hormone and the illegal products distributed by the notorious Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative .
Under oath , Bonds clamed that one cream proferred by Anderson was flaxseed oil .
" And I was at the ballpark , whatever , I do n't care .
What 's lotion going to do to me ?
How many times have I heard that : ' This is going to rub into you and work . ' "
Federal prosecutors apparently will seek to prove that the purported flaxseed oil was , in fact , one of BALCO 's illegal salves , which were known as " the clear " and " the cream . "
That charge , the indictment indicates , will apparently be buttressed by results showing that Bonds has tested positive for steroids : " During the criminal investigation , evidence was obtained including positive tests for the presence of anabolic steroids and other performance - enhancing substances for Bonds and other athletes . "
Bonds 's initial court appearance is scheduled for December 7 .
If convicted of the felony charges , he faces up to five years in prison .

With the current volatility in the market , it causes people to begin questioning their investments and wondering where we ’re headed .
In my profession , I have to work with uneasy clients daily , and it can be difficult to remind them that the stock market is constantly moving and generally goes through cycles .
The market ca n’t go up indefinitely , nor will it go down indefinitely .
More often than not , we ’ll see periods of growth followed by periods of volatility or sideways movement , and then have a period of falling stocks that is followed by more volatility before the cycle repeats itself .
A Glimpse of Our Future by Looking at the Past ?
Some claim that there is a four year cycle that the market follows , and there is some evidence to that .
Of course , nothing is certain and the time periods of the cycle can vary , but there is some truth to it all .
For this example , I ’m going to take a look at the Dow Jones Industrials Average from January 1st of 1996 through today ( November 26th , 2007 ) .
I ’m using the DJIA simply because it is one of the more widely tracked indicies and it does n’t have a heavy concentration of technology stocks that saw the most exaggerated data during this time period .
1996 – 1999
Ahh , yes .
The roaring 90s .
It was during the mid-to - late 90s that everyone was a stock trader .
With the Internet becoming popular and the easy access to buying and selling stocks for the Average Joe , people were flooding into the market looking for the next company that was going to double or triple in the next three months .
Think back to this time –how many people did you know that were afraid of the market or selling everything and moving to cash ?
Nobody .
Even though in 1996 the upward trend was just a continuation of previous years , the market seemed unstoppable .
From 1996 to 1999 the DJIA nearly doubled in value .
So , the money continued to pour in during 1999 as well …
1999 – 2002
1999 came and the market was still headed up .
People who were naysayers a few years ago are now coming around and finally looking to get in on some of the action .
Well , it sucks when you ’re late to the party .
As the new millennium came , the stock market reached record highs , but suddenly stalled and became very volatile .
For the next year there was little direction .
This volatility soon gave way to a sell - off in 2001 as panic began to set in .
Those who have been in the market for a few years quickly took their gains , and the selling quickly forced prices lower , which scared many of the people who just recently got into the market .
As the media began to talk about how overvalued many stocks have become , especially the internet companies , people continued to unload their shares …
2002 – 2005
This continued throughout 2002 and the DJIA gave back most of the gains it saw during the late 90s .
The NASDAQ fared much worse .
When the selling subsided , the markets again became very volatile from late 2002 through early 2003 .
The markets began to pick up steam again in late 2003 , but remained almost flat through 2004 as there was little direction …
2005 – Today
Most of 2005 was nothing to write home about as the markets were basically drifting sideways .
Once 2006 rolled around , the market again started to rally .
For the next two years , the DJIA tacked on over 30 % and set new record highs .
Again , if you asked most people early this year or last year about their investments , they probably responded very positively .
Who would n’t ?
If you look at what has happened since April of 2003 to just a few months ago ( almost 4 years ) , the DJIA has returned over 75 % .
The Big Picture
As investors , most of us tend to forget about all of the good years and only focus on the bad .
The broad markets have been heading up for about four years , so the thoughts of what happened in 1999 - 2002 are well behind us .
But now that the markets are volatile , there is a lot of talk about the subprime mortgage industry , a weak dollar , and everyone begins to completely forget about how well the past four years have been and only focus on the last few months or weeks complaining how bad it is .
Things can certainly continue to get worse , but you have to look at things in context .
Remember , what goes up , must come down .
Not only does the stock market cycle , but there is a business cycle as well .
We will always have various times that are great , and those that are n’t as great , but you ca n’t lose sight of the big picture .
Take a look at the following 12 years in a colorized format .
Green identifies periods of strong growth .
Yellow indicates a period of volatility or no real direction , and red shows a period of a downward trend .
Based on this , is it any surprise that markets are becoming volatile and possibly trending downward ?
For even more similarities , scroll back up and look at the first chart from 1996 - 1999 .
Now , scroll down and look at the 2005 - Present image .
Notice how similar they are ?
The markets went up for completely different reasons , yet are behaving almost the same .
All you have to do is look at the following few years to see what might be in store for us over the coming year or two .
Will history repeat itself ?
There is no way to tell , and anything could happen to make all of this information worthless , but you do have to at least consider the past trends and understand that there is a chance the market will behave similarly and we ’ll enter a period of significant decline .
Keep Doing What You ’re Doing
Sure , the market may be a bit unstable right now , and we may certainly be headed for a time where the market falls further , but that should n’t be of much concern to you if you ’re investing for the next 10 , 20 , 30 or more years .
If you want to try and time the market or predict what the next hot sector is , that ’s fine , but the best thing most people can do is to just continuously invest in a diversified portfolio .
If you keep buying even as the market falls , you ’re just adding more shares at a lower price .
Could you make more money if you only invested at the low points and sold at the high points compared to dollar cost averaging ?
Sure , but the likelihood of succeeding on a regular basis is low .
For most people , the best thing to do is to just continue investing bi-weekly , monthly , or quarterly into the same diversified portfolio regardless of market conditions .
When markets are choppy or headed down , you ’re just buying stocks or funds on sale .
All you have to do is look back a few years to see that even though the market might go down , it will eventually come back up again .

Washington
FOR almost two years , the country has debated whether the Bush administration acted properly and lawfully in undertaking emergency surveillance operations of suspected foreign terrorists on presidential authorization in the wake of 9/11 .
For several months , we have been debating bills that seek to modernize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court statute .
There are many complex and difficult issues associated with these debates , but whether to terminate the huge lawsuits that have been filed against the nation ’s major telecommunications carriers accused of cooperating with classified counterterrorism programs is not one of them .
Whatever one feels about the underlying intelligence activities or the legal basis on which they were initially established , it would be unfair and contrary to the interests of the United States to allow litigation that tries to hold private telecommunications companies liable for them .
At the outset , it is critical to understand what the immunity provisions the administration and Congress have negotiated actually do .
This is not “ blanket immunity , ” as it is sometimes caricatured by its opponents .
The Senate bill would confer immunity in only two limited circumstances : if the carrier did not do what the plaintiffs claim ; or if the carrier did do what the plaintiffs claim but based on explicit assurances from the highest levels of the government that the activities in question were authorized by the president and determined to be lawful .
Longstanding principles of law hold that an American corporation is entitled to rely on assurances of legality from officials responsible for government activities .
The public officials in question might be right or wrong about the advisability or legality of what they are doing , but it is their responsibility , not the company ’s , to deal with the consequences if they are wrong .
After years of pummeling each other , Coors and Miller are getting hitched .
SABMiller and the Molson Coors Brewing Company , the nation ’s No. 2 and No. 3 brewers , said yesterday that they would merge their operations in the United States and Puerto Rico , a move that Wall Street analysts have long expected .
The joint venture , to be known as MillerCoors , would have $ 6.6 billion in annual sales and eventually result in $ 500 million in annual cost savings , the companies estimated .
It will also become a more formidable No. 2 challenger to the Anheuser - Busch Companies , which has long dominated the American market .
Peter H. Coors , vice chairman of Molson Coors , said the transaction was prompted by “ profound ” changes in the American alcohol business that are challenging large beer companies .
Sales of domestic beers have been battered as consumers switched to wine , spirits and craft beers and imports .
Besides cost savings , the merger will create a strong portfolio of brands , from domestic brews like Coors Light and Milwaukee ’s Best to import beers like Peroni and Molson Canadian .
Democrats insist funding must be tied to a timetable for withdrawal
The 53 - 45 vote was not enough to advance the bill , which passed in the House of Representatives on Wednesday .
President George W Bush has asked Congress for extra emergency funding for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Defence Secretary Robert Gates warned that if the money was not approved , funds would run out by February .
In a sign of the tussle over the issue in the closely divided chamber , Democrats had earlier blocked a Republican proposal to give Mr Bush $ 70bn in funds without attaching a timetable for withdrawal .
The Bush administration wants Congress to pass the additional war funds as soon as possible but without conditions attached .
Mr Bush wants nearly $ 200bn war funds for the 2008 budget year
Democratic - led attempts to attach conditions to war funding have repeatedly failed because the party has not been able to muster the two - thirds majority to override a presidential veto .
But the Democrats continue to insist that they will not approve more funding unless Mr Bush agrees to conditions including a timetable for troop withdrawal .
" Our troops continue to fight and die valiantly .
And our Treasury continues to be depleted rapidly for a peace that we seem far more interested in achieving than Iraq 's own political leaders , " Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said .
Friday 's vote means that a bill is unlikely to be sent to President Bush until January at the earliest .
The Republicans accused the Democrats of irresponsibility .
" We need to get our troops everything they need .
We need to get it to them right now , " said Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell .
White House spokesman Tony Fratto said that the Pentagon would have to start using its annual budget to cover costs .
" We 'd rather see the department of defence , the military planners and our troops focusing on military manoeuvres rather than accounting manoeuvres as they carry out their mission in the field , " he said .
Seven cops brutalize naked man walking through sleepy CA beach town , break his jaw by Concerned
Tuesday Oct 16th , 2007 12:59 AM
Article from the San Luis Obispo Tribune describes how a naked man was brutalized last weekend by seven deputies and police , who pepper sprayed him , shot beanbags at him , hit him with batons , tasered him , and broke his jaw , for " failing to cooperate . "
He had to be sent to Fresno to put his face back together .
If he was on drugs as the police suggest , why have no charges been filed ?
Sheriff 's officials identify man found walking naked in Los Osos ; he had surgery for broken jaw after allegedly resisting arrest
The man found walking naked in Los Osos on Saturday and appearing to be under the influence of illegal drugs has been identified as Cole Corrigan .
Although it is unclear whether he will face any drug - related charges , deputies said Sunday that he could face felony charges of obstruction .
Authorities are still trying to determine his age and hometown .
Corrigan , who appeared to be in his 20s , was walking in the area of Fifth Street and Santa Ysabel Avenue around 3 a.m.
Saturday , sheriff 's officials said .
Deputies followed him to Seventh Street and El Moro Avenue , where he reportedly failed to cooperate .
They shot Corrigan with beanbag and PepperBall ammunition , sprayed him with pepper spray , struck him with batons and Tasered him , but he did not surrender , according to sheriff 's officials .
He was treated at Sierra Vista Regional Medical Center in San Luis Obispo and then at a hospital in Fresno where he underwent surgery on Sunday for a broken jaw , according to deputies .

Admitting your flaws and putting them out to show the world is not what today 's celebrities are known for .
Unless of course you are Jamie Lee Curtis when she did a More magazine spread that showed her thighs in their true , unaltered form .
When every magazine ad or cover is showing you a full color glossy of a perfect , beautiful woman or man you start to question yourself and ask if you measure up .
But , as we should know , all of these images are ' chopped and cropped ' , touched up or digitally manipulated .
Whether it is heavy airbrushing , zapping zits , brightening those baby blues , contouring or more aggressively removing some unwanted back fat and pushing the eyes two inches apart so that the face appears more doll like - it happens .
Some editors even go the other way and make the image worse than it originally was .
Magazines that run these doctored shots believe it gives them an air of exclusivity or originality , but sometimes they are shown as the fakes they are and even the celebrities seem to be fighting back .
We have some ads and covers that really push the pixels on a photo and others that do it with a more subtle approach .
Red Book – Faith Hill
We know what you 're thinking .
" Faith Hill , she is naturally beautiful , what could they possibly do to fix her up ? "
But it happened .
If you can't easily notice the changes , look at the size and length of her left arm in the before picture , the cover photo makes it look freakishly thin .
Also under the eyes is much lighter .
Her little bit of back fat above the dress is gone and her neck is elongated above her upper back removing the hunch .
Gawkers Media Jezebel obtained this before photo from the shoot for the cover .
So it goes to make a ' beautiful ' point - that even naturally gorgeous women get touched up in a big way .
Redbook shattered our ' Faith ' on this one .
Dove – Artificial Beauty Time Lapse
To illustrate the staggering amount of retouching that goes into creating an ad , Dove produced this time - lapse video of a model being made up and then digitally touched up for their Dove Real Beauty Workshops for Girls .
This workshop sums up all the reasons this type of manipulation is so wrong and harmful to our society .
CBS Watch !
Magazine – Katie Couric
Forget what you know about Watergate , this one has been dubbed Weightgate !
In May 2006 CBS News anchorette Katie Couric was being pre-promoted with the photo to the left .
In September the same photo was used , but touched up considerably , in CBS 's Watch !
Magazine to promote her and she looks to have lost 20 pounds .
The magazine is distributed to CBS employees as well as on American Airlines flights with a circulation of about 400,000 copies .
According to this Washington Post story , it was the fault of " an overzealous employee in its publicity department " who gave a digital nip and tuck to help improve Couric 's physical appearance .
Redbook – Julia Roberts
On Redbook 's July cover , Roberts ' head comes from a paparazzi shot taken at the 2002 People 's Choice awards .
Her body , meanwhile , is from the Notting Hill movie premiere four years ago .
Look at the dresses , look familiar ?
Publisher Hearst admits its mistake : " In an effort to make a cover that would pop on the newsstand , we combined two different shots of Julia Roberts .
We acknowledge that we may have gone too far and hope that Ms. Roberts will accept our apology . "
Time – O.J. Simpson
O.J. Simpson appeared on the 1994 cover of Time magazine shortly after his arrest on murder charges .
The original mug shot appeared on the cover of Newsweek .
Time was subsequently accused of manipulating the photograph to make Simpson appear " darker " and " menacing . "
TV Guide – Oprah Winfrey
The practice of digital manipulation for cover models and ads is certainly not a new trend .
Back in 1989 Oprah 's head was attached to Ann Margaret 's body on a TV Guide cover .
This cover was created by splicing the head of Winfrey onto the body of actress Ann - Margret , taken from a 1979 publicity shot .
The composite was created without permission of Winfrey or Ann - Margret , and was detected by Ann - Margret 's fashion designer , who recognized the dress .
Star – Jennifer Aniston
OK , even accessories are n't safe these days !
What happened to the sunglasses and the image on the book she is holding go ?
Did the magazine want to play with our imaginations and have us think that she was preparing a manuscript or a juicy tell all on Brad ?
Men 's Fitness – Andy Roddick
Just when you thought it is just the women that get all the attention .
Tennis superstar Andy Roddick supposedly stopped in his tracks when he saw this cover for Men 's Fitness while walking in an airport .
Look at those arms !
The guy is a professional athlete , he is already in super shape , but those arms are monstrous and extreme .
Just goes to show that everything that is pushed in our face must be extra special or freakishly not like the person being depicted to give it that edge .
Redbook – Jennifer Aniston
Jennifer took offense when she found out she was on the cover of Redbook without her consent , and we do n't blame her , it looks so fake !
Jen boycotted the magazine after she said her head was placed on another woman ’s body .
Originally she declined a Redbook cover because of a commitment to Harper 's Bazaar .
Redbook informed Jennifer eight weeks before the cover hit that she'd be on it anyway .
A Redbook spokeswoman had this to say : " The only things that were altered in the cover photo were the color of her shirt and the length of her hair , very slightly , in order to reflect her current length . "
Seventeen – Sarah Michelle Gellar
This one is less blatant but it still caused a stir for both parties .
Sarah Michelle Gellar granted an interview but not a photo shoot , so following standard practice for the industry , the magazine purchased a retouched photo of her from a syndication house .
They changed the shirt color from black to purple and somehow made her left arm look weird and elongated .
Gellar stated that she looked like a paper cut -out .
GQ – Kate Winslet
GQ's issue with Kate Winslet on the cover showed a Kate with very slim legs .
Kate has been known to have publicly railed against Hollywood 's obsession with skinniness and weight .
Winslet said , " I was pretty proud of how my legs actually looked in the real picture , I have Polaroids from the shoot and I thought I looked fine . "
The actress is not outraged , but says she spoke out because " it just was important to me to let people know that digital retouching happens all the time .
It 's probably happened to just about every other well - known actress on the face of the planet . "
Newsweek – Martha Stewart
Newsweek 's March 14 cover showed a photo of Martha Stewart coming out from behind a curtain .
Stewart was due to be released from prison just a few days later .
The face was Martha's , but the body was an unnamed model .
Inside the magazine Newsweek told its readers that the cover was a " photo illustration " , also known as a " fake photo " .
A news release on the organization 's web site calls the cover a " major ethical breach . "
Intel and Samsung have both shown off 32 - nm silicon
IBM , Toshiba , AMD , Samsung , Chartered , Infineon and Freescale have formed the alliance to cut development costs .
More transistors on a chip equals more processing power , but the development process is highly expensive .
Analyst Malcolm Penn of Future Horizons said the alliance was an example of " pre-competitive collaboration " .
Mr Penn said : " The industry needs a huge amount of money to reinvent itself every two years . "
He likened the cost of building a new chip factory to buying a fleet of more than 12 A380 Super Jumbos .
The seven companies have agreed to work through 2010 to design , develop and produce the chips using tiny circuitry .
' Contained market '
Chips built using the 32 - nm process can have more than one billion transistors on them .
The group 's chips could be used in everything from memory , computers , graphics cards , set - top boxes to games consoles .
Intel , the world 's biggest supplier of chips to the computer industry , is not part of the alliance .
Mr Penn said : " Intel is in a very focused market place ; it really only makes chips for PCs .
It 's a contained market with very , very little competition so Intel 's absence in this alliance is not important . "
Mark Bohr , Intel Senior Fellow and Director of Process Architecture and Integration , said the need for the alliance showed what a giant undertaking the roll out of new chip technology was .
He said a new fabrication plant to produce the chips could cost $ 3bn and that Intel would be building three in order to meet demand .
Despite the huge costs , he said Intel was able to go it alone .
" Not only can we do it , it gives us an advantage , " he told BBC News .
" We do n't have to deal with the co-ordination issues that the alliance will .
We are able to lead the way with the technology . "
The alliance will focus on sharing the cost of developing the building blocks of the 32 - nanometre chips .
Mr Penn said : " This is about sharing the basic development of the recipe for the chips .
Those building blocks are then put together by the separate companies in a fiercely competitive way . "

In the past , we 've wondered about the business logic of various music performance societies suing restaurants and bars for playing a music without a license .
However , we never denied that it was well within their legal rights to go after these places for not getting a license for performance rights .
It just did n't seem very smart from the business side of things .
Still , it 's not hard to go from the question of whether or not restaurants should pay for performance rights when playing music to rather ridiculous situations .
Take , for example , the case that readerpoints us to in the UK , where a car repair firm is being sued because its mechanics listened to their personal radios too loud
It 's not difficult at all to figure out what 's going on here .
The mechanics working out in the garage have radios playing while they work , and there 's plenty of noise in the garage , so they 're likely to turn those radios up .
Customers in the enclosed area next to the garage are certainly likely to hear that music ... but is it really a public performance ?
The Performing Rights Society in the UK certainly thinks so , which is why they 're suing .
The repair firm , Kwik - Fit , has a pretty weak response , saying that it 's banned personal radios for ten years .
Instead , it should be fighting back on the idea that this is a public performance in any way .
Otherwise , you get into all sorts of trouble .
If you have the windows open in your home and are listening to your legally owned music ( or your TV ! ) and your neighbor can hear it , is that a public performance ?
What if you live in an apartment building with thin walls ?
What about when you 're driving with the radio on and the windows open ?
What if you 're in your cubicle and the folks in the cubicles around you can hear the music ?
At which point do we realize how silly this becomes ?
It 's difficult to see how , with a straight face , anyone in the music industry can claim that any of these situations represents harm done to them .

Disclosure : And - httpd is a HTTP server I wrote .
You 've all seen HTTP requests , right ?
They 're simple and look like :
... right ?
WRONG .
This is the exact same request , and is completely rfc2616 compliant :
If you too wish to explore the joy of simplicity that is the HTTP / 1.1 rfc , you can look at either the w3 html version of rfc2616 or the ietf text version of rfc2616 .
The rest of this page includes tips , and " opinions " .
This a list of the std .
HTTP /1.1 headers a read - only server MAY , SHOULD , or MUST understand ( see rfc4229 for a list of all headers ) .
This is a list of " features " in the HTTP / 1.1 " standard " .
Some are just bad standardization of current practice , some are features at the wrong layer and some are bits the std .
did n't cover well .
Almost all servers fail some of these ( even apache - httpd does n't pass them all ) .
No testing framework : I could forgive a lot of the following if the w3c , or any of the people listed at the top of rfc2616 , wrote some simple unit tests .
It really can't be that hard , if you want xxx return code from Y request ... then send that request to a network connection and see if you 've got it .
Then any sane person can have a quick look through the rfc , impliment what they think is required and when they 're finished run the tests to see .
But no .
Implied * LWS :
The problem is that a valid request can look like : GET / HTTP / 1 . 1 Host : foo.example.com
Accept : text / html , text /* ; q = 1 . 00
This is complete crack .
This is hidden at the bottom of section 2.1 " Augmented BNF " ... which you 're almost guaranteed to skip .
It feels like they threw their hands up at all the crap implementations adding space where it should n't be and said " Ok , you can now have (( \r
) ? [ \t ] + ) * between any two tokens " .
Joy. apache - httpd completely fails to honor this in a lot of cases , but sometimes it does ... and which cases are completely undocumented and have no rationle that I can see .
So you just have to screw all the parsing code in the server with tests for implied LWS .
Joy .
Note that the Request - Line does n't come under implied LWS , but is explicitly allowed to have more than one space between tokens in section 19.3 ... and apache - httpd does parse the above request line .
This also leads to people assuming implied LWS where LWS seems to be explicitly disallowed , as in the following request : GET / HTTP /1.1 HOST : foo.example.com ... now from my reading of section 4.2 it does n't say you can follow the header name with anything other than a colon ( " : " ) , but yet because implied LWS is allowed everywhere else people / clients do requests like the above ... and apache - httpd allows it .
Joy .
Host header :
Ok , so they wanted to make sure all clients passed a host header , fine .
But why make the server respond with a 400 , and not a 404 if the " host " passed does n't exist ?
apache - httpd just defaults to the " main " host , as does Tux .
And - httpd responds with 400 , by default .
And then there is the problem that if you pass an absolute URI it is supposed to override the host header ... so does that mean you do n't need to pass the host header ?
apache - httpd says no ,
And - httpd assumes that 's fine ... who can it hurt ?
Identity and Quality : Most of the list headers allow you to specify a " quality " , so the server can work out which of a number of choices the clients wants to make without the client having to do a request - response - request , and incur the latency of a round trip .
However for accept - encoding there is also an " identity " option , which refers to the entity without any encoding .
So given the request : GET / HTTP /1.1 Host : foo Accept - Encoding : gzip ; q=0.1 , identity ... the server has to respond without any content - encoding , also given the request : GET / HTTP /1.1 Host : foo Accept - Encoding : identity ; q=0 , * ... the entity should only be sent with some content - encoding or the server SHOULD respond with error 406 .
apache - httpd does neither of these things .
In fact apache - httpd does n't even obey the request : GET / HTTP / 1.1 Host : foo Accept - Encoding : gzip ; q=0 , * ... if it is configured with mod_deflate .
If that was n't screwed up enough the quality parameter is a fraction " upto 3 decimal places " between 0 and 1 inclusive .
Or as a sane person might say : " It 's a number between 0 and 1000 , with oportunity for parsing errors at every turn " .
I mean , who is this possibly helping ?
Is it possible some clients just do sprintf ( buf , " %s : %s ; q= %s " , ... ) and present the user with the 0.3 number ?
Why would it be harder for them to see a number from 0 to 1000 ?
Is there some style thing I do n't know about that makes 0.2 and 0.02 better than 200 and 20 ?
Range and Accept - Encoding headers :
The Range specifies a content range within the encoded entity .
What happens if the content - encoding disappears ?
I assume that to use accept - encoding and range the server has to give out an ETag ?
Or the client just assumes if it worked before , it works again and if that assumption fails it tries again ?
Using if - unmodified - since probably helps ... but this just seems broken .
Connect header and HTTP / 1.0 connections :
You MUST ignore any header name in the connection header of a HTTP / 1.0 request , to work around buggy HTTP / 1.0 proxies .
So given the request : GET / HTTP /1.0 Host : foo Range : bytes=1 - 8 Connection : host , range , close ... the server is supposed to act as if it got no headers .
apache - httpd gets this wrong , so does almost everyone else ... woo woo stds .
Range and multi-range returns : Massive layer violation .
99.9999 % of the time noone wants to do more than continue a failed download , if - range and range solve that problem .
Having multipart / byterange returns for multiple range requests is crack , almost nothing needs it and almost no servers support multi-range responses ( so they all implement a custom unstandardized " works if you only pass one range , does n't otherwise " model ) .
Also most servers do n't seem to limit the number of range requests you can specify , apart from the generic header size limits .
If they 'd done the layering over the entire HTTP request , this could have worked much better .
Just say , on a keep alive , the server MUST keep the return code of the last request and it would allow the client to send a set of requests like ...
GET / HTTP /1.1 Host : foo.example.com
Range : bytes=1-8 If - Range : Sun , 10 Oct 2004 07:02:24 GMT GET / HTTP /1.1 Host : foo.example.com
Range : bytes=12-16 If - Previous - Return - Code : 206 GET / HTTP /1.1
Host : foo.example.com
Range : bytes=32-128 If - Previous - Return - Code : 206 ... I 'd bet all servers could easily handle the extra burden to support that single header and the response would n't have to look completely different for those 0.0001 % of requests that wanted to do things like the above .
Sure , it means if you want multiple range requests you need a server that supports keep - alive , all I can say to that is ...
" Here 's two cents kid , go buy yourself a real webserver " .
And - httpd can now be configured to respond with a specified number of multipart / byterange requests .
Empty entries ( for list headers ) :
So a header that takes a list can have any number of empty entries .
Ie . GET / HTTP /1.1 Host : foo.example.com
Accept : text /*;q=0.1 , , , , text / html ... because , you know , it 's more fun that way .
Maybe the idea is whoever does the best ASCII art wins something ... a lobotomy probably .
Multiple headers ( for list headers ) :
So instead of having to do ...
GET / HTTP /1.1 Host : foo.example.com
Accept : text /*;q=0.1 , text/html ... or even ...
GET / HTTP /1.1 Host : foo.example.com
Accept : text /*; q=0.1 , text / html ... you can also do ...
GET / HTTP /1.1 Accept : text /*;q=0.1
Host : foo.example.com
Accept : text / html ... and you have to join the headers to parse the latter identically .
Not only is it pointless random crap , it means you can't take a subsection of the request for each header .
Content - Location and 301 : After all the hacks with accept * header quality values and the multipart / byterange hack , just so clients only needed to send a single request , one of the most common operations a webserver has to do requires a request / response / request .
Ie. 301 redirects , and example of which is : GET / bar HTTP / 1.1 Host : foo.example.com ... when http://foo.example.com/bar is a directory , the server responds with something like : HTTP /1.1 301 Moved Permanently Date : Mon , 14 Feb 2005 06:04:27 GMT
Server : foo / 1.0.0 Last - Modified : Mon , 14 Feb 2005 06:04:27 GMT
Content - Type : text / html Content - Length : 500 Location : http://foo.example.com/bar/ [... snip content ... ] ... but if you respond with : HTTP /1.1 200 OK Date : Mon , 14 Feb 2005 06:04:27 GMT
Server : foo / 1.0.0 Last - Modified : Mon , 14 Feb 2005 06:04:27 GMT
Content - Type : text / html Content - Length : 500 Content - Location : http://foo.example.com/bar/ [... snip content ... ] ... you might expect that all the links within the document would be relative to http://foo.example.com/bar/ and not http://foo.example.com/bar ... but you 'd be wrong .
In fact the standard was specifically worded to enable this behaviour , saying " The value of Content - Location also defines the base URI for the entity . " ... however none of the browser authors implemented this feature , due to a fear that some people somewhere might have misconfigured their servers .
President Vladimir Putin has withdrawn Russia from a key post - cold war international arms treaty , paving the way for the deployment of Russian forces closer to Europe .
The withdrawal of Russian participation in the Conventional Forces in Europe ( CFE ) treaty was signed into law today .
The United States , the European Union and Nato had urged Putin not to suspend the treaty , seen as a cornerstone of European security .
Russia says Nato members have not ratified an amended version of the pact and accuses it of flexing its muscles near Russia 's borders .
The move comes two days ahead of parliamentary elections .
Polls show that talking tough about Russia standing up to foreigners strikes a chord with millions of Russians who yearn for the return of the Soviet Union 's once - mighty superpower status .
Putin has also been sparring with the US and EU over plans for a missile defence shield in Europe , and proposed independence for Serbia 's Kosovo province .
Signed in 1990 and updated in 1999 , the CFE treaty limits the number of battle tanks , heavy artillery , combat aircraft and attack helicopters deployed and stored between the Atlantic and Russia 's Ural mountains .
It was originally negotiated among the then - 22 member states of Nato and the Warsaw Pact , and Russia says it is outdated .
Moscow argues it has been used by an enlarged Nato to limit Russian military movements while Nato builds up forces close to Russia , in contravention of earlier agreements .
Western partners have refused to ratify an amended version of the pact until Russia pulls its forces out of Georgia and Moldova , as it promised in 1999 when the treaty was reviewed .
Moscow 's key problem with the treaty is flank limits which prevent Russia from moving tanks and artillery around its own territory , Russia 's top generals say .

The future of web standards
The world of standards - based web design and development has been undergoing something of a shake - up these past few days ; Andy Clarke ’s “ CSS Unworking Group ” seems to have opened the floodgates to expressions of dissatisfaction with the current method of progress ( or lack thereof ) in developing and standardizing new features for web developers and designers .
Alex Russell ’s “ The W3C Cannot Save Us ” and my friend and former colleague Jeff Croft ’s “ Do we need a return to the browser wars ? ” continue the theme , as does Stuart Langridge ’s “ Reigniting the browser wars ” , which popped up as I was finishing the first draft of this post .
Ultimately , I think this boils down to two problems .
The first problem , not to put too fine a point on it , is that progress in developing new standards is glacial at best .
HTML went from initial concept to version 4.01 in less than a decade , but has stayed pinned at 4.01 since before the turn of the millennium ( XHTML is no better ; XHTML 1.0 was deliberately identical to HTML 4.01 except for the XML syntax , and XHTML 1.1 really did n’t add much , focusing mostly on reorganization and modularization ) .
Similarly , CSS has been sitting at version 2 of its spec since 1998 ; CSS 2.1 is still no more than a “ Candidate Recommendation ” .
The second problem is that innovation on the Web today is largely taking place through leveraging non-standardized or even proprietary technologies :
Flash is popping up in all sorts of unexpected places , Microsoft and Adobe are both working on next - generation “ rich internet application ” runtimes and the biggest buzzword of them all — “ AJAX ” — is based around a formerly Microsoft - only technique ( XMLHttpRequest ) which has found its way into other browsers .
The combination of these two problems leads to a very real worry : that whatever chance there might have been for a truly interoperable Web will vanish , with useful content and applications disappearing into the proprietary walled gardens which provide the only genuine opportunity for new features and capabilities .
The two problems — the slow pace of standardization and innovation through as - yet - non - standard features — are obviously intertwined .
The question at hand , then , is how to solve them together : how to produce a process whereby standards bodies can respond quickly to innovative ideas , and wherein innovators will encourage standardized , interoperable implementations of their ideas .
While I do n’t have a solution , I do have some thoughts on some of the problems with the discussion so far , and some ideas on where to look for a successful model to follow .
So let ’s dive in .
The false dilemma of standardization models
One of the major issues in resolving this problem is that huge amounts of discussion have essentially assumed a false dilemma , that there are only two ways to run a standards body :
A closed - door , pay - to - play system , as the W3C is perceived to be .
A howling mob which runs by consensus of the participants .
Of course , these are n’t the only two options , but quite a few people ( Daniel Glazman , for example ) seem to behave as if they are .
The first thing we need to do , then , is throw that out and recognize that there ’s actually a fairly broad continuum of options in between these two extremes ; in other words , what we should be looking for is a balance between the input of people who use and develop for the Web , and people who develop browsers and attendant technologies .
Finding the balance
This brings us to a new question : how do we find the proper balance between the competing interests of Web vendors and Web users / developers ?
Personally , I think the answer is to look at the available history : the world of web standards is not really breaking new ground in needing to properly strike this sort of balance , and there ’s already a long and rich history of groups going through precisely this process , which anyone who ’s interested in reforming web standards should be looking at .
I ’m primarily thinking of open - source software development , which has been through this already many times over : there ’s plenty of open - source software out there which needs to appeal both to “ average joes ” and to multinational corporations , and even a few examples of projects which have successfully done so .
The Linux kernel is one such ; its model is neither “ closed - door ” nor “ howling mob ” , but rather something in between .
Linux is not a dictatorship , but it is not a democracy ; Linus Torvalds and his trusted “ lieutenants ” ultimately retain control over the project , but input from any interested party is accepted and taken into consideration .
And though not all opinions are equal , the process of deciding which opinions are given more weight than others seems to be largely pragmatic and meritocratic .
The result is that large corporations can participate and contribute without turning Linux into a closed - door effort , and smaller / independent developers can participate and contribute without turning Linux into a howling mob .
That ’s quite an accomplishment , and it ’s something that should not be overlooked by anyone who wants to reform web standards .
And the same is true in many other successful open - source projects : Perl , Python and Ruby , for example , all have open development processes , but ultimately remain in the control of a single “ BDFL ” and / or a few “ lieutenants ” .
And the success of these projects across a broad spectrum of their target markets shows that this process can work extremely well : a general patten of open input and discussion , with a few experienced and trustworthy folks who steer the process and have the power to make final decisions when things would otherwise get bogged down , manages to avoid the downsides of both of the extremes of the false dilemma outlined above .
W3C ’s on first , WHAT ’s on second
Of course , this raises the question of whether the WHATWG , which has been working steadily on refining , improving and extending various standards for several years , will be able to accomplish the same thing in the web - standards world that Linux and other successful open - source projects have accomplished in the software - development world .
At this point I do n’t honestly know , and I do n’t think anyone really does , though there ’s no shortage of opinions .
People far smarter and more experienced than I have come down on both sides , with some feeling that WHATWG is the right way to go and others feeling that it ’s a fool ’s errand .
There are some encouraging signs , though :
Though the group is open and anyone can join and participate , it is very definitely steered by its own “ BDFL ” : Ian Hickson , who possibly knows more about web browsers and the browser industry than anyone else alive .
Ian ’s participation in WHATWG is extremely similar to that of BDFLs in successful open - source projects : he knows the subject matter as well as anyone , is willing to entertain and respond to input from practically anyone , and — speaking as someone who ’s been reading the WHATWG list off and on since September 2004 — has a good track record of sifting through the conflicting interests and finding good compromises .

Despite being an extremely young group , the WHATWG has already produced some notable results ; Apple , Mozilla and Opera are all actively working on implementing various stable portions of WHATWG proposals , and the group has shown a willingness to respond to useful features which do not originate within itself ( as in the case of the offline storage API , which benefits by taking cues from , and cross- pollinating with , Google Gears ) .
Some folks will inevitably point to the recent tempest in a teapot over media codecs as an example of the WHATWG being too beholden to corporate interests , but I ’m not convinced ( though , to be fair , I ’m also not convinced that the HTML spec should be in the business of telling people which media formats to use ) ; unlike many people who began frothing at the mouth when they heard about it , I actually followed the discussion and so I do n’t really see anything to complain about .
The spec no longer specifically recommends Ogg Theora , but it still leaves implementors on the hook to provide support for unencumbered , interoperable media .
And in the long run the “ unknown unknown ” ( to borrow a phrase from the Tao of Donald Rumsfeld ) that represents may prove worse for large companies than the known unknown of implementing Theora ; the current language of the draft is somewhat akin to a dentist telling you that painful tooth will have to come out someday .
At any rate , it ’s still too early to tell whether the WHATWG will work , especially for the case of CSS ; the WHATWG ’s work to date has largely focused on HTML and the DOM , as indicated by the current WHATWG draft specification .
The Microsoft bogeyman
The largest perceived obstacle to any reform of web standards is a big question mark surrounding Microsoft .
Though a member of the W3C and a participant in various working groups , Microsoft ’s implementations of the resulting standards have ranged from lackluster to laughable and this , combined with Internet Explorer ’s dominant market share in the browser world , naturally leads to a concern that any effort which does n’t have a firm commitment from Microsoft will inevitably fail .
But at this point , honestly , I ’m not convinced that Microsoft is relevant .
At least , not in the way everyone seems to think they ’re relevant .
If you ’ve never read Joel Spolsky ’s article “ Fire and Motion ” , do so now , because what I ’m about to argue wo n’t make much sense if you have n’t .
Go ahead and read the whole article , because it ’s good , but the thing you want to take away from it is the fact that a large part of Microsoft ’s dominance is due to the phenomenon Joel so eloquently describes by analogy to infantry combat tactics :
The competition has no choice but to spend all their time porting and keeping up , time that they can’t spend writing new features .
Look closely at the software landscape .
The companies that do well are the ones who rely least on big companies and do n’t have to spend all their cycles catching up and reimplementing and fixing bugs that crop up only on Windows XP .
The companies who stumble are the ones who spend too much time reading tea leaves to figure out the future direction of Microsoft .
People get worried about .NET and decide to rewrite their whole architecture for .NET because they think they have to .
Microsoft is shooting at you , and it ’s just cover fire so that they can move forward and you can’t , because this is how the game is played , Bubby .
Now , stop and look at Internet Explorer 7 ( er , I mean , “ Windows Explorer 7 ” ) .
IE7 is , despite what Microsoft ’s PR people would like you to believe , the result of Microsoft being pinned down under covering fire from the rest of the industry .
Mozilla , Apple and Opera were pelting them with fire from all directions — tabbed browsing , better privacy , better security , all sorts of features people actually cared about — and Microsoft found itself on the receiving end of its own strategy .
And , just as attempts to constantly keep pace with Microsoft resulted in lots of software vendors turning out sub -par products , Microsoft ’s own response to the unfamiliar need to play catch - up resulted in a sub-par browser .
The same thing is actually happening to Microsoft on several fronts right now :
The increased visibility and success of Apple means Microsoft is playing catch - up in the operating - systems business .
The result is that Vista was a flop ; all the features which might have been interesting were gutted long ago in an attempt to get the thing out the door and provide a public competitor to OS X .
X . The utter dominance of Flash on the Web , and the new threats of AIR and JavaFX , have Microsoft playing catch - up on another front , resulting in the extension of their desktop APIs into the browser through Silverlight .
Microsoft is pinned ; they ’re stuck trying to catch up to what everybody else is already doing , while the competition just keeps piling on new features and new technologies .
They ’re not dead yet , of course , and are far from it : IE is still the dominant browser and Windows is still the dominant operating system .
But there ’s definitely been a sea change in the industry : Microsoft , the unstoppable juggernaut , is vulnerable and is having to play catch - up to maintain its dominance .
To borrow a phrase from Lewis Carroll , they ’re having to run as fast as they can , just to stay where they are .
And so Microsoft really is n’t relevant to the future of web standards ; any compelling new development that comes from the rest of the industry will be just another form of fire and motion , and Microsoft will have no choice but to keep pace , regardless of whether they participated in the process .
Where to go from here
I do n’t really know .
Right now I ’m just making some observations and engaging in a little analysis of the problem , because that ’s what I do .
I do think that the major points I ’ve outlined above are all important to any actual solution :
Any replacement process will need to strike a balance between the “ closed - door ” and “ howling mob ” extremes , starting with the realization that those are n’t the only options .
The open - source software world is probably a good place to look for successful ways to do this .
The WHATWG shows promise , but it ’s too early to tell if it ’s the real solution .
shows promise , but it ’s too early to tell if it ’s the real solution .
Microsoft ’s participation or non-participation is no longer relevant .
But beyond that I ’m not sure where to go .
For now I ’m keeping my eye on the WHATWG ( as I ’ve been doing for several years , because for the most part they ’re the ones who are actually getting things done ) , but something better may certainly come along .
I think an important next step for the folks who are dissatisfied with the status quo is to decide what to do .
Andy Clarke has proposed some ideas , but amusingly derides the idea of operating by consensus whilst proposing things that could only work if accepted by consensus ( and largely seems to fall into the false dilemma outlined above ) .
It ’s all well and good to know that a different direction is desired , but it ’s equally important to know which direction you want to go in .
So I ’ll close with a thought to that effect from one of my philosophical heroes , G.K. Chesterton ( from the opening chapter of his wonderful book Heretics ) :

Facebook Scientists have launched a project aimed at solving the mystery of the giant redwood tree :
What allows it to grow so tall and live so long ?
Arborists from Bartlett Tree Experts recently climbed almost 300 feet up three redwood trees in Roy 's Redwoods Open Space Preserve in Marin County , Calif. , to collect samples of new growth as part of an effort to clone some of the oldest and biggest redwood trees in the western USA .
The project will take genetic material from the trees to create a " living library " so researchers can study what allows these trees to become the tallest and largest living things on Earth , says David Milarch of the Champion Tree Project , which is working with Bartlett and the Tree Research and Education Endowment Fund on the project .
Milarch hopes to plant the clones near universities .
Because the young trees will be identical to the trees from which they were cloned , scientists can study their genetics without having to make the climb up the older trees to gather samples , which is expensive and difficult .
Scientists also will cross-pollinate some of the clones from different areas of the 500 - mile - wide redwood range .
Some of the second - generation trees created by the project might be capable of growing bigger and older than their parent trees under the right conditions , Milarch says .
Although this has never been done before with redwoods , it is standard practice when scientists are trying to find " better versions " of plants or animals , says Bill Libby , a professor emeritus of forestry at the University of California - Berkeley , who has spoken with Milarch about the plans .
" Most of them are not going to be very good , but some of them will be special , " Libby says .
Redwoods can grow to more than 300 feet tall and can live for 2,000 to 3,000 years .
But less than 5 % of the old - growth redwood forest in the western USA is left , says Ruskin Hartley , director of the Save the Redwoods League .
Since the 1920s , the league has been working to protect the redwoods from logging and other threats .
Now 60 % of the remaining old - growth redwoods are being preserved , Hartley says .
" The redwoods just have a power to inspire , and people just get drawn to their size and their grandeur and drawn to take action , " Hartley says .
" I hope ( the project ) will engage more people in the work to protect the redwoods . "
The team will gather samples from the next set of trees in about two months , says David McMaster of Bartlett Tree Experts .
This time , the climbers will be going up trees that are more than 300 feet tall and will have to use a crossbow to reach the lowest branch , which is 200 feet high .

CPUs are today much more sophisticated than they were only 25 years ago .
In those days , the frequency of the CPU core was at a level equivalent to that of the memory bus .
Memory access was only a bit slower than register access .
But this changed dramatically in the early 90s , when CPU designers increased the frequency of the CPU core but the frequency of the memory bus and the performance of RAM chips did not increase proportionally .
This is not due to the fact that faster RAM could not be built , as explained in the previous section .
It is possible but it is not economical .
RAM as fast as current CPU cores is orders of magnitude more expensive than any dynamic RAM .
If the choice is between a machine with very little , very fast RAM and a machine with a lot of relatively fast RAM , the second will always win given a working set size which exceeds the small RAM size and the cost of accessing secondary storage media such as hard drives .
The problem here is the speed of secondary storage , usually hard disks , which must be used to hold the swapped out part of the working set .
Accessing those disks is orders of magnitude slower than even DRAM access .
Fortunately it does not have to be an all - or - nothing decision .
A computer can have a small amount of high - speed SRAM in addition to the large amount of DRAM .
One possible implementation would be to dedicate a certain area of the address space of the processor as containing the SRAM and the rest the DRAM .
The task of the operating system would then be to optimally distribute data to make use of the SRAM .
Basically , the SRAM serves in this situation as an extension of the register set of the processor .
While this is a possible implementation , it is not viable .
Ignoring the problem of mapping the physical resources of such SRAM - backed memory to the virtual address spaces of the processes ( which by itself is terribly hard ) this approach would require each process to administer in software the allocation of this memory region .
The size of the memory region can vary from processor to processor ( i.e. , processors have different amounts of the expensive SRAM - backed memory ) .
Each module which makes up part of a program will claim its share of the fast memory , which introduces additional costs through synchronization requirements .
In short , the gains of having fast memory would be eaten up completely by the overhead of administering the resources .
So , instead of putting the SRAM under the control of the OS or user , it becomes a resource which is transparently used and administered by the processors .
In this mode , SRAM is used to make temporary copies of ( to cache , in other words ) data in main memory which is likely to be used soon by the processor .
This is possible because program code and data has temporal and spatial locality .
This means that , over short periods of time , there is a good chance that the same code or data gets reused .
For code this means that there are most likely loops in the code so that the same code gets executed over and over again ( the perfect case for spatial locality ) .
Data accesses are also ideally limited to small regions .
Even if the memory used over short time periods is not close together there is a high chance that the same data will be reused before long ( temporal locality ) .
For code this means , for instance , that in a loop a function call is made and that function is located elsewhere in the address space .
The function may be distant in memory , but calls to that function will be close in time .
For data it means that the total amount of memory used at one time ( the working set size ) is ideally limited but the memory used , as a result of the random access nature of RAM , is not close together .
Realizing that locality exists is key to the concept of CPU caches as we use them today .
A simple computation can show how effective caches can theoretically be .
Assume access to main memory takes 200 cycles and access to the cache memory take 15 cycles .
Then code using 100 data elements 100 times each will spend 2,000,000 cycles on memory operations if there is no cache and only 168,500 cycles if all data can be cached .
That is an improvement of 91.5 % .
The size of the SRAM used for caches is many times smaller than the main memory .
In the author 's experience with workstations with CPU caches the cache size has always been around 1/1000th of the size of the main memory ( today : 4MB cache and 4GB main memory ) .
This alone does not constitute a problem .
If the size of the working set ( the set of data currently worked on ) is smaller than the cache size it does not matter .
But computers do not have large main memories for no reason .
The working set is bound to be larger than the cache .
This is especially true for systems running multiple processes where the size of the working set is the sum of the sizes of all the individual processes and the kernel .
What is needed to deal with the limited size of the cache is a set of good strategies to determine what should be cached at any given time .
Since not all data of the working set is used at exactly the same time we can use techniques to temporarily replace some data in the cache with other data .
And maybe this can be done before the data is actually needed .
This prefetching would remove some of the costs of accessing main memory since it happens asynchronously with respect to the execution of the program .
All these techniques and more can be used to make the cache appear bigger than it actually is .
We will discuss them in Section 3.3 .
Once all these techniques are exploited it is up to the programmer to help the processor .
How this can be done will be discussed in Section 6 .
3.1 CPU Caches in the Big Picture
Before diving into technical details of the implementation of CPU caches some readers might find it useful to first see in some more details how caches fit into the big picture of a modern computer system .
Figure 3.1 : Minimum Cache Configuration
Figure 3.1 shows the minimum cache configuration .
It corresponds to the architecture which could be found in early systems which deployed CPU caches .
The CPU core is no longer directly connected to the main memory .
{ In even earlier systems the cache was attached to the system bus just like the CPU and the main memory .
This was more a hack than a real solution .}
All loads and stores have to go through the cache .
The connection between the CPU core and the cache is a special , fast connection .
In a simplified representation , the main memory and the cache are connected to the system bus which can also be used for communication with other components of the system .
We introduced the system bus as FSB  which is the name in use today ; see Section 2.2 .
In this section we ignore the Northbridge ; it is assumed to be present to facilitate the communication of the CPU (s ) with the main memory .
Even though computers for the last several decades have used the von Neumann architecture , experience has shown that it is of advantage to separate the caches used for code and for data .
Intel has used separate code and data caches since 1993 and never looked back .
The memory regions needed for code and data are pretty much independent of each other , which is why independent caches work better .
In recent years another advantage emerged : the instruction decoding step for the most common processors is slow ; caching decoded instructions can speed up the execution , especially when the pipeline is empty due to incorrectly predicted or impossible - to - predict branches .
Soon after the introduction of the cache , the system got more complicated .
The speed difference between the cache and the main memory increased again , to a point that another level of cache was added , bigger and slower than the first - level cache .
Only increasing the size of the first - level cache was not an option for economical reasons .
Today , there are even machines with three levels of cache in regular use .
A system with such a processor looks like Figure 3.2 .
With the increase on the number of cores in a single CPU the number of cache levels might increase in the future even more .
Figure 3.2 : Processor with Level 3 Cache
Figure 3.2 shows three levels of cache and introduces the nomenclature we will use in the remainder of the document .
L1d is the level 1 data cache , L1 i the level 1 instruction cache , etc .
Note that this is a schematic ; the data flow in reality need not pass through any of the higher - level caches on the way from the core to the main memory .
CPU designers have a lot of freedom designing the interfaces of the caches .
For programmers these design choices are invisible .
In addition we have processors which have multiple cores and each core can have multiple threads .
The difference between a core and a thread is that separate cores have separate copies of ( almost { Early multi - core processors even had separate 2nd level caches and no 3rd level cache .} ) all the hardware resources .
The cores can run completely independently unless they are using the same resources — e.g. , the connections to the outside — at the same time .
Threads , on the other hand , share almost all of the processor 's resources .
Intel 's implementation of threads has only separate registers for the threads and even that is limited , some registers are shared .
The complete picture for a modern CPU therefore looks like Figure 3.3 .
Figure 3.3 : Multi processor , multi-core , multi- thread
In this figure we have two processors , each with two cores , each of which has two threads .
The threads share the Level 1 caches .
The cores ( shaded in the darker gray ) have individual Level 1 caches .
All cores of the CPU share the higher - level caches .
The two processors ( the two big boxes shaded in the lighter gray ) of course do not share any caches .
All this will be important , especially when we are discussing the cache effects on multi-process and multi- thread applications .
3.2 Cache Operation at High Level
To understand the costs and savings of using a cache we have to combine the knowledge about the machine architecture and RAM technology from Section 2 with the structure of caches described in the previous section .
By default all data read or written by the CPU cores is stored in the cache .
There are memory regions which cannot be cached but this is something only the OS implementers have to be concerned about ; it is not visible to the application programmer .
There are also instructions which allow the programmer to deliberately bypass certain caches .
This will be discussed in Section 6 .
If the CPU needs a data word the caches are searched first .
Obviously , the cache cannot contain the content of the entire main memory ( otherwise we would need no cache ) , but since all memory addresses are cacheable , each cache entry is tagged using the address of the data word in the main memory .
This way a request to read or write to an address can search the caches for a matching tag .
The address in this context can be either the virtual or physical address , varying based on the cache implementation .
Since the tag requires space in addition to the actual memory , it is inefficient to chose a word as the granularity of the cache .
For a 32 - bit word on an x86 machine the tag itself might need 32 bits or more .
Furthermore , since spatial locality is one of the principles on which caches are based , it would be bad to not take this into account .
Since neighboring memory is likely to be used together it should also be loaded into the cache together .
Remember also what we learned in Section 2.2.1 : RAM modules are much more effective if they can transport many data words in a row without a new CAS or even RAS signal .
So the entries stored in the caches are not single words but , instead , lines of several contiguous words .
In early caches these lines were 32 bytes long ; now the norm is 64 bytes .
If the memory bus is 64 bits wide this means 8 transfers per cache line .
DDR supports this transport mode efficiently .
When memory content is needed by the processor the entire cache line is loaded into the L1d .
The memory address for each cache line is computed by masking the address value according to the cache line size .
For a 64 byte cache line this means the low 6 bits are zeroed .
The discarded bits are used as the offset into the cache line .
The remaining bits are in some cases used to locate the line in the cache and as the tag .
In practice an address value is split into three parts .
For a 32 - bit address it might look as follows :
With a cache line size of 2O the low O bits are used as the offset into the cache line .
The next S bits select the cache set .
We will go into more detail soon on why sets , and not single slots , are used for cache lines .
For now it is sufficient to understand there are 2S sets of cache lines .
This leaves the top 32 - S - O = T bits which form the tag .
These T bits are the value associated with each cache line to distinguish all the aliases { All cache lines with the same S part of the address are known by the same alias .} which are cached in the same cache set .
The S bits used to address the cache set do not have to be stored since they are the same for all cache lines in the same set .
When an instruction modifies memory the processor still has to load a cache line first because no instruction modifies an entire cache line at once ( exception to the rule : write - combining as explained in Section 6.1 ) .
The content of the cache line before the write operation therefore has to be loaded .
It is not possible for a cache to hold partial cache lines .
A cache line which has been written to and which has not been written back to main memory is said to be dirty  .
Once it is written the dirty flag is cleared .
To be able to load new data in a cache it is almost always first necessary to make room in the cache .
An eviction from L1d pushes the cache line down into L2 ( which uses the same cache line size ) .
This of course means room has to be made in L2 .
This in turn might push the content into L3 and ultimately into main memory .
Each eviction is progressively more expensive .
What is described here is the model for an exclusive cache as is preferred by modern AMD and VIA processors .
Intel implements inclusive caches { This generalization is not completely correct .
A few caches are exclusive and some inclusive caches have exclusive cache properties .} where each cache line in L1d is also present in L2 .
Therefore evicting from L1d is much faster .
With enough L2 cache the disadvantage of wasting memory for content held in two places is minimal and it pays off when evicting .
A possible advantage of an exclusive cache is that loading a new cache line only has to touch the L1d and not the L2 , which could be faster .
The CPUs are allowed to manage the caches as they like as long as the memory model defined for the processor architecture is not changed .
It is , for instance , perfectly fine for a processor to take advantage of little or no memory bus activity and proactively write dirty cache lines back to main memory .
The wide variety of cache architectures among the processors for the x86 and x86 - 64 , between manufacturers and even within the models of the same manufacturer , are testament to the power of the memory model abstraction .
In symmetric multi-processor ( SMP ) systems the caches of the CPUs cannot work independently from each other .
All processors are supposed to see the same memory content at all times .
The maintenance of this uniform view of memory is called cache coherency .
If a processor were to look simply at its own caches and main memory it would not see the content of dirty cache lines in other processors .
Providing direct access to the caches of one processor from another processor would be terribly expensive and a huge bottleneck .
Instead , processors detect when another processor wants to read or write to a certain cache line .
If a write access is detected and the processor has a clean copy of the cache line in its cache , this cache line is marked invalid .
Future references will require the cache line to be reloaded .
Note that a read access on another CPU does not necessitate an invalidation , multiple clean copies can very well be kept around .
More sophisticated cache implementations allow another possibility to happen .
If the cache line which another processor wants to read from or write to is currently marked dirty in the first processor 's cache a different course of action is needed .
In this case the main memory is out - of - date and the requesting processor must , instead , get the cache line content from the first processor .
Through snooping , the first processor notices this situation and automatically sends the requesting processor the data .
This action bypasses main memory , though in some implementations the memory controller is supposed to notice this direct transfer and store the updated cache line content in main memory .
If the access is for writing the first processor then invalidates its copy of the local cache line .
Over time a number of cache coherency protocols have been developed .
The most important is MESI , which we will introduce in Section 3.3.4 .
The outcome of all this can be summarized in a few simple rules :
A dirty cache line is not present in any other processor 's cache .
Clean copies of the same cache line can reside in arbitrarily many caches .
If these rules can be maintained , processors can use their caches efficiently even in multi-processor systems .
All the processors need to do is to monitor each others ' write accesses and compare the addresses with those in their local caches .
In the next section we will go into a few more details about the implementation and especially the costs .
Finally , we should at least give an impression of the costs associated with cache hits and misses .
These are the numbers Intel lists for a Pentium M :
To Where Cycles Register <= 1 L1d ~3 L2 ~ 14 Main Memory ~ 240
These are the actual access times measured in CPU cycles .
It is interesting to note that for the on - die L2 cache a large part ( probably even the majority ) of the access time is caused by wire delays .
This is a physical limitation which can only get worse with increasing cache sizes .
Only process shrinking ( for instance , going from 60nm for Merom to 45 nm for Penryn in Intel 's lineup ) can improve those numbers .
The numbers in the table look high but , fortunately , the entire cost does not have to be paid for each occurrence of the cache load and miss .
Some parts of the cost can be hidden .
Today 's processors all use internal pipelines of different lengths where the instructions are decoded and prepared for execution .
Part of the preparation is loading values from memory ( or cache ) if they are transferred to a register .
If the memory load operation can be started early enough in the pipeline , it may happen in parallel with other operations and the entire cost of the load might be hidden .
This is often possible for L1d ; for some processors with long pipelines for L2 as well .
There are many obstacles to starting the memory read early .
It might be as simple as not having sufficient resources for the memory access or it might be that the final address of the load becomes available late as the result of another instruction .
In these cases the load costs cannot be hidden ( completely ) .
For write operations the CPU does not necessarily have to wait until the value is safely stored in memory .
As long as the execution of the following instructions appears to have the same effect as if the value were stored in memory there is nothing which prevents the CPU from taking shortcuts .
It can start executing the next instruction early .
With the help of shadow registers which can hold values no longer available in a regular register it is even possible to change the value which is to be stored in the incomplete write operation .
Figure 3.4 : Access Times for Random Writes
For an illustration of the effects of cache behavior see Figure 3.4 .
We will talk about the program which generated the data later ; it is a simple simulation of a program which accesses a configurable amount of memory repeatedly in a random fashion .
Each data item has a fixed size .
The number of elements depends on the selected working set size .
The Y–axis shows the average number of CPU cycles it takes to process one element ; note that the scale for the Y–axis is logarithmic .
The same applies in all the diagrams of this kind to the X–axis .
The size of the working set is always shown in powers of two .
The graph shows three distinct plateaus .
This is not surprising : the specific processor has L1d and L2 caches , but no L3 .
With some experience we can deduce that the L1d is 213 bytes in size and that the L2 is 220 bytes in size .
If the entire working set fits into the L1d the cycles per operation on each element is below 10 .
Once the L1d size is exceeded the processor has to load data from L2 and the average time springs up to around 28 .
Once the L2 is not sufficient anymore the times jump to 480 cycles and more .
This is when many or most operations have to load data from main memory .
And worse : since data is being modified dirty cache lines have to be written back , too .
This graph should give sufficient motivation to look into coding improvements which help improve cache usage .
We are not talking about a few measly percent here ; we are talking about orders - of - magnitude improvements which are sometimes possible .
In Section 6 we will discuss techniques which allow writing more efficient code .
The next section goes into more details of CPU cache designs .
The knowledge is good to have but not necessary for the rest of the paper .
So this section could be skipped .
3.3 CPU Cache Implementation Details
Cache implementers have the problem that each cell in the huge main memory potentially has to be cached .
If the working set of a program is large enough this means there are many main memory locations which fight for each place in the cache .
Previously it was noted that a ratio of 1 - to - 1000 for cache versus main memory size is not uncommon .
3.3.1 Associativity
It would be possible to implement a cache where each cache line can hold a copy of any memory location .
This is called a fully associative cache .
To access a cache line the processor core would have to compare the tags of each and every cache line with the tag for the requested address .
The tag would be comprised of the entire part of the address which is not the offset into the cache line ( that means , S in the figure on Section 3.2 is zero ) .
There are caches which are implemented like this but , by looking at the numbers for an L2 in use today , will show that this is impractical .
Given a 4MB cache with 64B cache lines the cache would have 65,536 entries .
To achieve adequate performance the cache logic would have to be able to pick from all these entries the one matching a given tag in just a few cycles .
The effort to implement this would be enormous .
Figure 3.5 : Fully Associative Cache Schematics
For each cache line a comparator is needed to compare the large tag ( note , S is zero ) .
The letter next to each connection indicates the width in bits .
If none is given it is a single bit line .
Each comparator has to compare two T - bit - wide values .
Then , based on the result , the appropriate cache line content is selected and made available .
This requires merging as many sets of O data lines as there are cache buckets .
The number of transistors needed to implement a single comparator is large especially since it must work very fast .
No iterative comparator is usable .
The only way to save on the number of comparators is to reduce the number of them by iteratively comparing the tags .
This is not suitable for the same reason that iterative comparators are not : it takes too long .
Fully associative caches are practical for small caches ( for instance , the TLB caches on some Intel processors are fully associative ) but those caches are small , really small .
We are talking about a few dozen entries at most .
For L1i , L1d , and higher level caches a different approach is needed .
What can be done is to restrict the search .
In the most extreme restriction each tag maps to exactly one cache entry .
The computation is simple : given the 4MB / 64B cache with 65,536 entries we can directly address each entry by using bits 6 to 21 of the address ( 16 bits ) .
The low 6 bits are the index into the cache line .
Figure 3.6 : Direct - Mapped Cache Schematics
Such a direct - mapped cache is fast and relatively easy to implement as can be seen in Figure 3.6 .
It requires exactly one comparator , one multiplexer ( two in this diagram where tag and data are separated , but this is not a hard requirement on the design ) , and some logic to select only valid cache line content .
The comparator is complex due to the speed requirements but there is only one of them now ; as a result more effort can be spent on making it fast .
The real complexity in this approach lies in the multiplexers .
The number of transistors in a simple multiplexer grows with O ( log N ) , where N is the number of cache lines .
This is tolerable but might get slow , in which case speed can be increased by spending more real estate on transistors in the multiplexers to parallelize some of the work and to increase the speed .
The total number of transistors can grow slowly with a growing cache size which makes this solution very attractive .
But it has a drawback : it only works well if the addresses used by the program are evenly distributed with respect to the bits used for the direct mapping .
If they are not , and this is usually the case , some cache entries are heavily used and therefore repeatedly evicted while others are hardly used at all or remain empty .
Figure 3.7 : Set - Associative Cache Schematics
This problem can be solved by making the cache set associative .
A set - associative cache combines the features of the full associative and direct - mapped caches to largely avoid the weaknesses of those designs .
Figure 3.7 shows the design of a set - associative cache .
The tag and data storage are divided into sets which are selected by the address .
This is similar to the direct - mapped cache .
But instead of only having one element for each set value in the cache a small number of values is cached for the same set value .
The tags for all the set members are compared in parallel , which is similar to the functioning of the fully associative cache .
The result is a cache which is not easily defeated by unfortunate or deliberate selection of addresses with the same set numbers and at the same time the size of the cache is not limited by the number of comparators which can be implemented in parallel .
If the cache grows it is ( in this figure ) only the number of columns which increases , not the number of rows .
The number of rows only increases if the associativity of the cache is increased .
Today processors are using associativity levels of up to 16 for L2 caches or higher .
L1 caches usually get by with 8 .

Table 3.1 : Effects of Cache Size , Associativity , and Line Size
Given our 4MB /64B cache and 8 - way set associativity the cache we are left with has 8,192 sets and only 13 bits of the tag are used in addressing the cache set .
To determine which ( if any ) of the entries in the cache set contains the addressed cache line 8 tags have to be compared .
That is feasible to do in very short time .
With an experiment we can see that this makes sense .
Table 3.1 shows the number of L2 cache misses for a program ( gcc in this case , the most important benchmark of them all , according to the Linux kernel people ) for changing cache size , cache line size , and associativity set size .
In Section 7.2 we will introduce the tool to simulate the caches as required for this test .
Just in case this is not yet obvious , the relationship of all these values is that the cache size is
cache line size × associativity × number of sets
The addresses are mapped into the cache by using
O = log 2 cache line size
S = log 2 number of sets
in the way the figure in Section 3.2 shows .
Figure 3.8 : Cache Size vs Associativity ( CL=32 )
Figure 3.8 makes the data of the table more comprehensible .
It shows the data for a fixed cache line size of 32 bytes .
Looking at the numbers for a given cache size we can see that associativity can indeed help to reduce the number of cache misses significantly .
For an 8 MB cache going from direct mapping to 2 - way set associative cache saves almost 44 % of the cache misses .
The processor can keep more of the working set in the cache with a set associative cache compared with a direct mapped cache .
In the literature one can occasionally read that introducing associativity has the same effect as doubling cache size .
This is true in some extreme cases as can be seen in the jump from the 4MB to the 8MB cache .
But it certainly is not true for further doubling of the associativity .
As we can see in the data , the successive gains are much smaller .
We should not completely discount the effects , though .
In the example program the peak memory use is 5.6 M .
So with a 8 MB cache there are unlikely to be many ( more than two ) uses for the same cache set .
With a larger working set the savings can be higher as we can see from the larger benefits of associativity for the smaller cache sizes .
In general , increasing the associativity of a cache above 8 seems to have little effects for a single - thread workload .
With the introduction of multi-core processors which use a shared L2 the situation changes .
Now you basically have two programs hitting on the same cache which causes the associativity in practice to be halved ( or quartered for quad - core processors ) .
So it can be expected that , with increasing numbers of cores , the associativity of the shared caches should grow .
Once this is not possible anymore ( 16 - way set associativity is already hard ) processor designers have to start using shared L3 caches and beyond , while L2 caches are potentially shared by a subset of the cores .
Another effect we can study in Figure 3.8 is how the increase in cache size helps with performance .
This data cannot be interpreted without knowing about the working set size .
Obviously , a cache as large as the main memory would lead to better results than a smaller cache , so there is in general no limit to the largest cache size with measurable benefits .
As already mentioned above , the size of the working set at its peak is 5.6 M .
This does not give us any absolute number of the maximum beneficial cache size but it allows us to estimate the number .
The problem is that not all the memory used is contiguous and , therefore , we have , even with a 16 M cache and a 5.6 M working set , conflicts ( see the benefit of the 2 - way set associative 16MB cache over the direct mapped version ) .
But it is a safe bet that with the same workload the benefits of a 32 MB cache would be negligible .
But who says the working set has to stay the same ?
Workloads are growing over time and so should the cache size .
When buying machines , and one has to choose the cache size one is willing to pay for , it is worthwhile to measure the working set size .
Why this is important can be seen in the figures on Figure 3.10 .
Figure 3.9 : Test Memory Layouts
Two types of tests are run .
In the first test the elements are processed sequentially .
The test program follows the pointer n but the array elements are chained so that they are traversed in the order in which they are found in memory .
This can be seen in the lower part of Figure 3.9 .
There is one back reference from the last element .
In the second test ( upper part of the figure ) the array elements are traversed in a random order .
In both cases the array elements form a circular single - linked list .
3.3.2 Measurements of Cache Effects
All the figures are created by measuring a program which can simulate working sets of arbitrary size , read and write access , and sequential or random access .
We have already seen some results in Figure 3.4 .
The program creates an array corresponding to the working set size of elements of this type :
struct l { struct l * n ; long int pad [ NPAD ] ; } ;
All entries are chained in a circular list using the n element , either in sequential or random order .
Advancing from one entry to the next always uses the pointer , even if the elements are laid out sequentially .
The pad element is the payload and it can grow arbitrarily large .
In some tests the data is modified , in others the program only performs read operations .
In the performance measurements we are talking about working set sizes .
The working set is made up of an array of struct l elements .
A working set of 2N bytes contains
2N/ sizeof ( struct l )
elements .
Obviously sizeof ( struct l ) depends on the value of NPAD .
For 32 - bit systems , NPAD =7 means the size of each array element is 32 bytes , for 64 - bit systems the size is 64 bytes .
Single Threaded Sequential Access
The simplest case is a simple walk over all the entries in the list .
The list elements are laid out sequentially , densely packed .
Whether the order of processing is forward or backward does not matter , the processor can deal with both directions equally well .
What we measure here — and in all the following tests — is how long it takes to handle a single list element .
The time unit is a processor cycle .
Figure 3.10 shows the result .
Unless otherwise specified , all measurements are made on a Pentium 4 machine in 64 - bit mode which means the structure l with NPAD=0 is eight bytes in size .
Figure 3.10 : Sequential Read Access , NPAD=0
Figure 3.11 : Sequential Read for Several Sizes
The first two measurements are polluted by noise .
The measured workload is simply too small to filter the effects of the rest of the system out .
We can safely assume that the values are all at the 4 cycles level .
With this in mind we can see three distinct levels :
Up to a working set size of 2 14 bytes .
bytes .
From 2 15 bytes to 2 20 bytes .
bytes to 2 bytes .
From 221 bytes and up .
These steps can be easily explained : the processor has a 16 kB L1d and 1MB L2 .
We do not see sharp edges in the transition from one level to the other because the caches are used by other parts of the system as well and so the cache is not exclusively available for the program data .
Specifically the L2 cache is a unified cache and also used for the instructions ( NB : Intel uses inclusive caches ) .
What is perhaps not quite expected are the actual times for the different working set sizes .
The times for the L1d hits are expected : load times after an L1d hit are around 4 cycles on the P4 .
But what about the L2 accesses ?
Once the L1d is not sufficient to hold the data one might expect it would take 14 cycles or more per element since this is the access time for the L2 .
But the results show that only about 9 cycles are required .
This discrepancy can be explained by the advanced logic in the processors .
In anticipation of using consecutive memory regions , the processor prefetches the next cache line .
This means that when the next line is actually used it is already halfway loaded .
The delay required to wait for the next cache line to be loaded is therefore much less than the L2 access time .
The effect of prefetching is even more visible once the working set size grows beyond the L2 size .
Before we said that a main memory access takes 200 + cycles .
Only with effective prefetching is it possible for the processor to keep the access times as low as 9 cycles .
As we can see from the difference between 200 and 9 , this works out nicely .
We can observe the processor while prefetching , at least indirectly .
In Figure 3.11 we see the times for the same working set sizes but this time we see the graphs for different sizes of the structure l .
This means we have fewer but larger elements in the list .
The different sizes have the effect that the distance between the n elements in the ( still consecutive ) list grows .
In the four cases of the graph the distance is 0 , 56 , 120 , and 248 bytes respectively .
At the bottom we can see the line from the previous graph , but this time it appears more or less as a flat line .
The times for the other cases are simply so much worse .
We can see in this graph , too , the three different levels and we see the large errors in the tests with the small working set sizes ( ignore them again ) .
The lines more or less all match each other as long as only the L1d is involved .
There is no prefetching necessary so all element sizes just hit the L1d for each access .
For the L2 cache hits we see that the three new lines all pretty much match each other but that they are at a higher level ( about 28 ) .
This is the level of the access time for the L2 .
This means prefetching from L2 into L1d is basically disabled .
Even with NPAD =7 we need a new cache line for each iteration of the loop ; for NPAD =0 , instead , the loop has to iterate eight times before the next cache line is needed .
The prefetch logic cannot load a new cache line every cycle .
Therefore we see a stall to load from L2 in every iteration .
It gets even more interesting once the working set size exceeds the L2 capacity .
Now all four lines vary widely .
The different element sizes play obviously a big role in the difference in performance .
The processor should recognize the size of the strides and not fetch unnecessary cache lines for NPAD =15 and 31 since the element size is smaller than the prefetch window ( see Section 6.3.1 ) .
Where the element size is hampering the prefetching efforts is a result of a limitation of hardware prefetching : it can not cross page boundaries .
We are reducing the effectiveness of the hardware scheduler by 50 % for each size increase .
If the hardware prefetcher were allowed to cross page boundaries and the next page is not resident or valid the OS would have to get involved in locating the page .
That means the program would experience a page fault it did not initiate itself .
This is completely unacceptable since the processor does not know whether a page is not present or does not exist .
In the latter case the OS would have to abort the process .
In any case , given that , for NPAD =7 and higher , we need one cache line per list element the hardware prefetcher cannot do much .
There simply is no time to load the data from memory since all the processor does is read one word and then load the next element .
Another big reason for the slowdown are the misses of the TLB cache .
This is a cache where the results of the translation of a virtual address to a physical address are stored , as is explained in more detail in Section 4 .
The TLB cache is quite small since it has to be extremely fast .
If more pages are accessed repeatedly than the TLB cache has entries for the translation from virtual to physical address has to be constantly repeated .
This is a very costly operation .
With larger element sizes the cost of a TLB lookup is amortized over fewer elements .
That means the total number of TLB entries which have to be computed per list element is higher .
To observe the TLB effects we can run a different test .
For one measurement we lay out the elements sequentially as usual .
We use NPAD =7 for elements which occupy one entire cache line .
For the second measurement we place each list element on a separate page .
The rest of each page is left untouched and we do not count it in the total for the working set size .
{ Yes , this is a bit inconsistent because in the other tests we count the unused part of the struct in the element size and we could define NPAD so that each element fills a page .
In that case the working set sizes would be very different .
This is not the point of this test , though , and since prefetching is ineffective anyway this makes little difference .}
The consequence is that , for the first measurement , each list iteration requires a new cache line and , for every 64 elements , a new page .
For the second measurement each iteration requires loading a new cache line which is on a new page .
Figure 3.12 : TLB Influence for Sequential Read
The result can be seen in Figure 3.12 .
The measurements were performed on the same machine as Figure 3.11 .
Due to limitations of the available RAM the working set size had to be restricted to 224 bytes which requires 1GB to place the objects on separate pages .
The lower , red curve corresponds exactly to the NPAD =7 curve in Figure 3.11 .
We see the distinct steps showing the sizes of the L1d and L2 caches .
The second curve looks radically different .
The important feature is the huge spike starting when the working set size reaches 213 bytes .
This is when the TLB cache overflows .
With an element size of 64 bytes we can compute that the TLB cache has 64 entries .
There are no page faults affecting the cost since the program locks the memory to prevent it from being swapped out .
As can be seen the number of cycles it takes to compute the physical address and store it in the TLB is very high .
The graph in Figure 3.12 shows the extreme case , but it should now be clear that a significant factor in the slowdown for larger NPAD values is the reduced efficiency of the TLB cache .
Since the physical address has to be computed before a cache line can be read for either L2 or main memory the address translation penalties are additive to the memory access times .
This in part explains why the total cost per list element for NPAD =31 is higher than the theoretical access time for the RAM .
Figure 3.13 : Sequential Read and Write , NPAD=1
We can glimpse a few more details of the prefetch implementation by looking at the data of test runs where the list elements are modified .
Figure 3.13 shows three lines .
The element width is in all cases 16 bytes .
The first line is the now familiar list walk which serves as a baseline .
The second line , labeled  Inc , simply increments the pad [ 0 ] member of the current element before going on to the next .
The third line , labeled  Addnext0 , takes the pad [ 0 ] list element of the next element and adds it to the pad [ 0 ] member of the current list element .
The naïve assumption would be that the  Addnext0  test runs slower because it has more work to do .
Before advancing to the next list element a value from that element has to be loaded .
This is why it is surprising to see that this test actually runs , for some working set sizes , faster than the  Inc test .
The explanation for this is that the load from the next list element is basically a forced prefetch .
Whenever the program advances to the next list element we know for sure that element is already in the L1d cache .
As a result we see that the  Addnext0  performs as well as the simple  Follow  test as long as the working set size fits into the L2 cache .
The  Addnext0  test runs out of L2 faster than the  Inc test , though .
It needs more data loaded from main memory .
This is why the  Addnext0  test reaches the 28 cycles level for a working set size of 221 bytes .
The 28 cycles level is twice as high as the 14 cycles level the  Follow test reaches .
This is easy to explain , too .
Since the other two tests modify memory an L2 cache eviction to make room for new cache lines cannot simply discard the data .
Instead it has to be written to memory .
This means the available bandwidth on the FSB is cut in half , hence doubling the time it takes to transfer the data from main memory to L2 .
Figure 3.14 : Advantage of Larger L2/L3 Caches
One last aspect of the sequential , efficient cache handling is the size of the cache .
This should be obvious but it still should be pointed out .
Figure 3.14 shows the timing for the Increment benchmark with 128 - byte elements ( NPAD =15 on 64 - bit machines ) .
This time we see the measurement from three different machines .
The first two machines are P4s , the last one a Core2 processor .
The first two differentiate themselves by having different cache sizes .
The first processor has a 32 k L1d and an 1M L2 .
The second one has 16 k L1d , 512k L2 , and 2M L3 .
The Core2 processor has 32 k L1d and 4M L2 .
The interesting part of the graph is not necessarily how well the Core2 processor performs relative to the other two ( although it is impressive ) .
The main point of interest here is the region where the working set size is too large for the respective last level cache and the main memory gets heavily involved .

Table 3.2 : L2 Hits and Misses for Sequential and Random Walks , NPAD=0
As expected , the larger the last level cache is the longer the curve stays at the low level corresponding to the L2 access costs .
The important part to notice is the performance advantage this provides .
The second processor ( which is slightly older ) can perform the work on the working set of 220 bytes twice as fast as the first processor .
All thanks to the increased last level cache size .
The Core2 processor with its 4M L2 performs even better .
For a random workload this might not mean that much .
But if the workload can be tailored to the size of the last level cache the program performance can be increased quite dramatically .
This is why it sometimes is worthwhile to spend the extra money for a processor with a larger cache .
Single Threaded Random Access Measurements
We have seen that the processor is able to hide most of the main memory and even L2 access latency by prefetching cache lines into L2 and L1d .
This can work well only when the memory access is predictable , though .
Figure 3.15 : Sequential vs Random Read , NPAD=0
If the access is unpredictable or random the situation is quite different .
Figure 3.15 compares the per-list - element times for the sequential access ( same as in Figure 3.10 ) with the times when the list elements are randomly distributed in the working set .
The order is determined by the linked list which is randomized .
There is no way for the processor to reliably prefetch data .
This can only work by chance if elements which are used shortly after one another are also close to each other in memory .
There are two important points to note in Figure 3.15 .
First , the large number is cycles needed for growing working set sizes .
The machine makes it possible to access the main memory in 200-300 cycles but here we reach 450 cycles and more .
We have seen this phenomenon before ( compare Figure 3.11 ) .
The automatic prefetching is actually working to a disadvantage here .
The second interesting point is that the curve is not flattening at various plateaus as it has been for the sequential access cases .
The curve keeps on rising .
To explain this we can measure the L2 access of the program for the various working set sizes .
The result can be seen in Figure 3.16 and Table 3.2 .
The figure shows that , when the working set size is larger than the L2 size , the cache miss ratio ( L2 misses / L2 access ) starts to grow .
The curve has a similar form to the one in Figure 3.15 : it rises quickly , declines slightly , and starts to rise again .
There is a strong correlation with the cycles per list element graph .
The L2 miss rate will grow until it eventually reaches close to 100 % .
Given a large enough working set ( and RAM ) the probability that any of the randomly picked cache lines is in L2 or is in the process of being loaded can be reduced arbitrarily .
The increasing cache miss rate alone explains some of the costs .
But there is another factor .
Looking at Table 3.2 we can see in the L2 / # Iter columns that the total number of L2 uses per iteration of the program is growing .
Each working set is twice as large as the one before .
So , without caching we would expect double the main memory accesses .
With caches and ( almost ) perfect predictability we see the modest increase in the L2 use shown in the data for sequential access .
The increase is due to the increase of the working set size and nothing else .
Figure 3.16 : L2d Miss Ratio
Figure 3.17 : Page - Wise Randomization , NPAD=7
For random access the per-element time increases by more than 100 % for each doubling of the working set size .
This means the average access time per list element increases since the working set size only doubles .
The reason behind this is a rising rate of TLB misses .
In Figure 3.17 we see the cost for random accesses for NPAD =7 .
Only this time the randomization is modified .
While in the normal case the entire list of randomized as one block ( indicated by the label ∞ ) the other 11 curves show randomizations which are performed in smaller blocks .
For the curve labeled ' 60 ' each set of 60 pages ( 245.760 bytes ) is randomized individually .
That means all list elements in the block are traversed before going over to an element in the next block .
This has the effect that number of TLB entries which are used at any one time is limited .
The element size for NPAD =7 is 64 bytes , which corresponds to the cache line size .
Due to the randomized order of the list elements it is unlikely that the hardware prefetcher has any effect , most certainly not for more than a handful of elements .
This means the L2 cache miss rate does not differ significantly from the randomization of the entire list in one block .
The performance of the test with increasing block size approaches asymptotically the curve for the one - block randomization .
This means the performance of this latter test case is significantly influenced by the TLB misses .
If the TLB misses can be lowered the performance increases significantly ( in one test we will see later up to 38 % ) .
3.3.3 Write Behavior
Before we start looking at the cache behavior when multiple execution contexts ( threads or processes ) use the same memory we have to explore a detail of cache implementations .
Caches are supposed to be coherent and this coherency is supposed to be completely transparent for the userlevel code .
Kernel code is a different story ; it occasionally requires cache flushes .
This specifically means that , if a cache line is modified , the result for the system after this point in time is the same as if there were no cache at all and the main memory location itself had been modified .
This can be implemented in two ways or policies :
write - through cache implementation ;
write - back cache implementation .
The write - through cache is the simplest way to implement cache coherency .
If the cache line is written to , the processor immediately also writes the cache line into main memory .
This ensures that , at all times , the main memory and cache are in sync .
The cache content could simply be discarded whenever a cache line is replaced .
This cache policy is simple but not very fast .
A program which , for instance , modifies a local variable over and over again would create a lot of traffic on the FSB even though the data is likely not used anywhere else and might be short - lived .
The write - back policy is more sophisticated .
Here the processor does not immediately write the modified cache line back to main memory .
Instead , the cache line is only marked as dirty .
When the cache line is dropped from the cache at some point in the future the dirty bit will instruct the processor to write the data back at that time instead of just discarding the content .
Write - back caches have the chance to be significantly better performing , which is why most memory in a system with a decent processor is cached this way .
The processor can even take advantage of free capacity on the FSB to store the content of a cache line before the line has to be evacuated .
This allows the dirty bit to be cleared and the processor can just drop the cache line when the room in the cache is needed .
But there is a significant problem with the write - back implementation .
When more than one processor ( or core or hyper - thread ) is available and accessing the same memory it must still be assured that both processors see the same memory content at all times .
If a cache line is dirty on one processor ( i.e. , it has not been written back yet ) and a second processor tries to read the same memory location , the read operation cannot just go out to the main memory .
Instead the content of the first processor 's cache line is needed .
In the next section we will see how this is currently implemented .
Before we get to this there are two more cache policies to mention :
write - combining ; and
uncacheable .
Both these policies are used for special regions of the address space which are not backed by real RAM .
The kernel sets up these policies for the address ranges ( on x86 processors using the Memory Type Range Registers , MTRRs ) and the rest happens automatically .
The MTRRs are also usable to select between write - through and write - back policies .
Write - combining is a limited caching optimization more often used for RAM on devices such as graphics cards .
Since the transfer costs to the devices are much higher than the local RAM access it is even more important to avoid doing too many transfers .
Transferring an entire cache line just because a word in the line has been written is wasteful if the next operation modifies the next word .
One can easily imagine that this is a common occurrence , the memory for horizontal neighboring pixels on a screen are in most cases neighbors , too .
As the name suggests , write - combining combines multiple write accesses before the cache line is written out .
In ideal cases the entire cache line is modified word by word and , only after the last word is written , the cache line is written to the device .
This can speed up access to RAM on devices significantly .
Finally there is uncacheable memory .
This usually means the memory location is not backed by RAM at all .
It might be a special address which is hardcoded to have some functionality outside the CPU .
For commodity hardware this most often is the case for memory mapped address ranges which translate to accesses to cards and devices attached to a bus ( PCIe etc ) .
On embedded boards one sometimes finds such a memory address which can be used to turn an LED on and off .
Caching such an address would obviously be a bad idea .
LEDs in this context are used for debugging or status reports and one wants to see this as soon as possible .
The memory on PCIe cards can change without the CPU 's interaction , so this memory should not be cached .
3.3.4 Multi-Processor Support
In the previous section we have already pointed out the problem we have when multiple processors come into play .
Even multi-core processors have the problem for those cache levels which are not shared ( at least the L1d ) .
It is completely impractical to provide direct access from one processor to the cache of another processor .
The connection is simply not fast enough , for a start .
The practical alternative is to transfer the cache content over to the other processor in case it is needed .
Note that this also applies to caches which are not shared on the same processor .
The question now is when does this cache line transfer have to happen ?
This question is pretty easy to answer : when one processor needs a cache line which is dirty in another processor 's cache for reading or writing .
But how can a processor determine whether a cache line is dirty in another processor 's cache ?
Assuming it is just because a cache line is loaded by another processor would be suboptimal ( at best ) .
Usually the majority of memory accesses are read accesses and the resulting cache lines are not dirty .
Processor operations on cache lines are frequent ( of course , why else would we have this paper ? ) which means broadcasting information about changed cache lines after each write access would be impractical .
What developed over the years is the MESI cache coherency protocol ( Modified , Exclusive , Shared , Invalid ) .
The protocol is named after the four states a cache line can be in when using the MESI protocol :
Modified :
The local processor has modified the cache line .
This also implies it is the only copy in any cache .
: The local processor has modified the cache line .
This also implies it is the only copy in any cache .
Exclusive :
The cache line is not modified but known to not be loaded into any other processor 's cache .
: The cache line is not modified but known to not be loaded into any other processor 's cache .
Shared :
The cache line is not modified and might exist in another processor 's cache .
: The cache line is not modified and might exist in another processor 's cache .
Invalid :
The cache line is invalid , i.e. , unused .
This protocol developed over the years from simpler versions which were less complicated but also less efficient .
With these four states it is possible to efficiently implement write - back caches while also supporting concurrent use of read - only data on different processors .
Figure 3.18 : MESI Protocol Transitions
The state changes are accomplished without too much effort by the processors listening , or snooping , on the other processors ' work .
Certain operations a processor performs are announced on external pins and thus make the processor 's cache handling visible to the outside .
The address of the cache line in question is visible on the address bus .
In the following description of the states and their transitions ( shown in Figure 3.18 ) we will point out when the bus is involved .
Initially all cache lines are empty and hence also Invalid .
If data is loaded into the cache for writing the cache changes to Modified .
If the data is loaded for reading the new state depends on whether another processor has the cache line loaded as well .
If this is the case then the new state is Shared , otherwise Exclusive .
If a Modified cache line is read from or written to on the local processor , the instruction can use the current cache content and the state does not change .
If a second processor wants to read from the cache line the first processor has to send the content of its cache to the second processor and then it can change the state to Shared .
The data sent to the second processor is also received and processed by the memory controller which stores the content in memory .
If this did not happen the cache line could not be marked as Shared .
If the second processor wants to write to the cache line the first processor sends the cache line content and marks the cache line locally as Invalid .
This is the infamous  Request For Ownership ( RFO ) operation .
Performing this operation in the last level cache , just like the I→M transition is comparatively expensive .
For write - through caches we also have to add the time it takes to write the new cache line content to the next higher - level cache or the main memory , further increasing the cost .
If a cache line is in the Shared state and the local processor reads from it no state change is necessary and the read request can be fulfilled from the cache .
If the cache line is locally written to the cache line can be used as well but the state changes to Modified .
It also requires that all other possible copies of the cache line in other processors are marked as Invalid .
Therefore the write operation has to be announced to the other processors via an RFO message .
If the cache line is requested for reading by a second processor nothing has to happen .
The main memory contains the current data and the local state is already Shared .
In case a second processor wants to write to the cache line ( RFO ) the cache line is simply marked Invalid .
No bus operation is needed .
The Exclusive state is mostly identical to the Shared state with one crucial difference : a local write operation does not have to be announced on the bus .
The local cache copy is known to be the only one .
This can be a huge advantage so the processor will try to keep as many cache lines as possible in the Exclusive state instead of the Shared state .
The latter is the fallback in case the information is not available at that moment .
The Exclusive state can also be left out completely without causing functional problems .
It is only the performance that will suffer since the E→M transition is much faster than the S→M transition .
From this description of the state transitions it should be clear where the costs specific to multi-processor operations are .
Yes , filling caches is still expensive but now we also have to look out for RFO messages .
Whenever such a message has to be sent things are going to be slow .
There are two situations when RFO messages are necessary :
A thread is migrated from one processor to another and all the cache lines have to be moved over to the new processor once .
A cache line is truly needed in two different processors .
{ At a smaller level the same is true for two cores on the same processor .
The costs are just a bit smaller .
The RFO message is likely to be sent many times .}
In multi - thread or multi-process programs there is always some need for synchronization ; this synchronization is implemented using memory .
So there are some valid RFO messages .
They still have to be kept as infrequent as possible .
There are other sources of RFO messages , though .
In Section 6 we will explain these scenarios .
The Cache coherency protocol messages must be distributed among the processors of the system .
A MESI transition cannot happen until it is clear that all the processors in the system have had a chance to reply to the message .
That means that the longest possible time a reply can take determines the speed of the coherency protocol .
{ Which is why we see nowadays , for instance , AMD Opteron systems with three sockets .
Each processor is exactly one hop away given that the processors only have three hyperlinks and one is needed for the Southbridge connection .}
Collisions on the bus are possible , latency can be high in NUMA systems , and of course sheer traffic volume can slow things down .
All good reasons to focus on avoiding unnecessary traffic .
There is one more problem related to having more than one processor in play .
The effects are highly machine specific but in principle the problem always exists : the FSB is a shared resource .
In most machines all processors are connected via one single bus to the memory controller ( see Figure 2.1 ) .
If a single processor can saturate the bus ( as is usually the case ) then two or four processors sharing the same bus will restrict the bandwidth available to each processor even more .
Even if each processor has its own bus to the memory controller as in Figure 2.2 there is still the bus to the memory modules .
Usually this is one bus but , even in the extended model in Figure 2.2 , concurrent accesses to the same memory module will limit the bandwidth .
The same is true with the AMD model where each processor can have local memory .
Yes , all processors can concurrently access their local memory quickly .
But multi - thread and multi-process programs -- at least from time to time -- have to access the same memory regions to synchronize .
Concurrency is severely limited by the finite bandwidth available for the implementation of the necessary synchronization .
Programs need to be carefully designed to minimize accesses from different processors and cores to the same memory locations .
The following measurements will show this and the other cache effects related to multi- threaded code .
Multi Threaded Measurements
To ensure that the gravity of the problems introduced by concurrently using the same cache lines on different processors is understood , we will look here at some more performance graphs for the same program we used before .
This time , though , more than one thread is running at the same time .
What is measured is the fastest runtime of any of the threads .
This means the time for a complete run when all threads are done is even higher .
The machine used has four processors ; the tests use up to four threads .
All processors share one bus to the memory controller and there is only one bus to the memory modules .
Figure 3.19 : Sequential Read Access , Multiple Threads
Figure 3.19 shows the performance for sequential read - only access for 128 bytes entries ( NPAD =15 on 64 - bit machines ) .
For the curve for one thread we can expect a curve similar to Figure 3.11 .
The measurements are for a different machine so the actual numbers vary .
The important part in this figure is of course the behavior when running multiple threads .
Note that no memory is modified and no attempts are made to keep the threads in sync when walking the linked list .
Even though no RFO messages are necessary and all the cache lines can be shared , we see up to an 18 % performance decrease for the fastest thread when two threads are used and up to 34 % when four threads are used .
Since no cache lines have to be transported between the processors this slowdown is solely caused by one or both of the two bottlenecks : the shared bus from the processor to the memory controller and bus from the memory controller to the memory modules .
Once the working set size is larger than the L3 cache in this machine all three threads will be prefetching new list elements .
Even with two threads the available bandwidth is not sufficient to scale linearly ( i.e. , have no penalty from running multiple threads ) .
When we modify memory things get even uglier .
Figure 3.20 shows the results for the sequential Increment test .
Figure 3.20 : Sequential Increment , Multiple Threads
This graph is using a logarithmic scale for the Y axis .
So , do not be fooled by the apparently small differences .
We still have about a 18 % penalty for running two threads and now an amazing 93 % penalty for running four threads .
This means the prefetch traffic together with the write - back traffic is pretty much saturating the bus when four threads are used .
We use the logarithmic scale to show the results for the L1d range .
What can be seen is that , as soon as more than one thread is running , the L1d is basically ineffective .
The single - thread access times exceed 20 cycles only when the L1d is not sufficient to hold the working set .
When multiple threads are running , those access times are hit immediately , even with the smallest working set sizes .
One aspect of the problem is not shown here .
It is hard to measure with this specific test program .
Even though the test modifies memory and we therefore must expect RFO messages we do not see higher costs for the L2 range when more than one thread is used .
The program would have to use a large amount of memory and all threads must access the same memory in parallel .
This is hard to achieve without a lot of synchronization which would then dominate the execution time .
Figure 3.21 : Random Addnextlast , Multiple Threads
Finally in Figure 3.21 we have the numbers for the Addnextlast test with random access of memory .
This figure is provided mainly to show to the appallingly high numbers .
It now take around 1,500 cycles to process a single list element in the extreme case .
The use of more threads is even more questionable .
We can summarize the efficiency of multiple thread use in a table .
# Threads Seq Read Seq Inc Rand Add 2 1.69 1.69 1.54 4 2.98 2.07 1.65 Table 3.3 : Efficiency for Multiple Threads
The table shows the efficiency for the multi - thread run with the largest working set size in the three figures on Figure 3.21 .
The number shows the best possible speed - up the test program incurs for the largest working set size by using two or four threads .
For two threads the theoretical limits for the speed - up are 2 and , for four threads , 4 .
The numbers for two threads are not that bad .
But for four threads the numbers for the last test show that it is almost not worth it to scale beyond two threads .
The additional benefit is minuscule .
We can see this more easily if we represent the data in Figure 3.21 a bit differently .
Figure 3.22 : Speed - Up Through Parallelism
The curves in Figure 3.22 show the speed - up factors , i.e. , relative performance compared to the code executed by a single thread .
We have to ignore the smallest sizes , the measurements are not accurate enough .
For the range of the L2 and L3 cache we can see that we indeed achieve almost linear acceleration .
We almost reach factors of 2 and 4 respectively .
But as soon as the L3 cache is not sufficient to hold the working set the numbers crash .
They crash to the point that the speed - up of two and four threads is identical ( see the fourth column in Table 3.3 ) .
This is one of the reasons why one can hardly find motherboard with sockets for more than four CPUs all using the same memory controller .
Machines with more processors have to be built differently ( see Section 5 ) .
These numbers are not universal .
In some cases even working sets which fit into the last level cache will not allow linear speed - ups .
In fact , this is the norm since threads are usually not as decoupled as is the case in this test program .
On the other hand it is possible to work with large working sets and still take advantage of more than two threads .
Doing this requires thought , though .
We will talk about some approaches in Section 6 .
Special Case : Hyper-Threads
Hyper-Threads ( sometimes called Symmetric Multi- Threading , SMT ) are implemented by the CPU and are a special case since the individual threads cannot really run concurrently .
They all share almost all the processing resources except for the register set .
Individual cores and CPUs still work in parallel but the threads implemented on each core are limited by this restriction .
In theory there can be many threads per core but , so far , Intel 's CPUs at most have two threads per core .
The CPU is responsible for time - multiplexing the threads .
This alone would not make much sense , though .
The real advantage is that the CPU can schedule another hyper - thread when the currently running hyper - thread is delayed .
In most cases this is a delay caused by memory accesses .
If two threads are running on one hyper - threaded core the program is only more efficient than the single - threaded code if the combined runtime of both threads is lower than the runtime of the single - threaded code .
This is possible by overlapping the wait times for different memory accesses which usually would happen sequentially .
A simple calculation shows the minimum requirement on the cache hit rate to achieve a certain speed - up .
The execution time for a program can be approximated with a simple model with only one level of cache as follows ( see [ htimpact ] ) :
T exe = N [ ( 1 - F mem ) T proc +
F mem ( G hit T cache + ( 1 - G hit ) T miss ) ]
The meaning of the variables is as follows :
N = Number of instructions .
F mem = Fraction of N that access memory .
G hit = Fraction of loads that hit the cache .
T proc = Number of cycles per instruction .
T cache = Number of cycles for cache hit .
T miss = Number of cycles for cache miss .
T exe = Execution time for program .
For it to make any sense to use two threads the execution time of each of the two threads must be at most half of that of the single - threaded code .
The only variable on either side is the number of cache hits .
If we solve the equation for the minimum cache hit rate required to not slow down the thread execution by 50 % or more we get the graph in Figure 3.23 .
Figure 3.23 : Minimum Cache Hit Rate For Speed - Up
The X–axis represents the cache hit rate G hit of the single - thread code .
The Y–axis shows the required cache hit rate for the multi- threaded code .
This value can never be higher than the single - threaded hit rate since , otherwise , the single - threaded code would use that improved code , too .
For single - threaded hit rates below 55 % the program can in all cases benefit from using threads .
The CPU is more or less idle enough due to cache misses to enable running a second hyper - thread .
The green area is the target .
If the slowdown for the thread is less than 50 % and the workload of each thread is halved the combined runtime might be less than the single - thread runtime .
For the modeled system here ( numbers for a P4 with hyper - threads were used ) a program with a hit rate of 60 % for the single - threaded code requires a hit rate of at least 10 % for the dual - threaded program .
That is usually doable .
But if the single - threaded code has a hit rate of 95 % then the multi - threaded code needs a hit rate of at least 80 % .
That is harder .
Especially , and this is the problem with hyper - threads , because now the effective cache size ( L1d here , in practice also L2 and so on ) available to each hyper - thread is cut in half .
Both hyper - threads use the same cache to load their data .
If the working set of the two threads is non-overlapping the original 95 % hit rate could also be cut in half and is therefore much lower than the required 80 % .
Hyper-Threads are therefore only useful in a limited range of situations .
The cache hit rate of the single - threaded code must be low enough that given the equations above and reduced cache size the new hit rate still meets the goal .
Then and only then can it make any sense at all to use hyper - threads .
Whether the result is faster in practice depends on whether the processor is sufficiently able to overlap the wait times in one thread with execution times in the other threads .
The overhead of parallelizing the code must be added to the new total runtime and this additional cost often cannot be neglected .
In Section 6.3.4 we will see a technique where threads collaborate closely and the tight coupling through the common cache is actually an advantage .
This technique can be applicable to many situations if only the programmers are willing to put in the time and energy to extend their code .
What should be clear is that if the two hyper - threads execute completely different code ( i.e. , the two threads are treated like separate processors by the OS to execute separate processes ) the cache size is indeed cut in half which means a significant increase in cache misses .
Such OS scheduling practices are questionable unless the caches are sufficiently large .
Unless the workload for the machine consists of processes which , through their design , can indeed benefit from hyper - threads it might be best to turn off hyper - threads in the computer 's BIOS .
{ Another reason to keep hyper - threads enabled is debugging .
SMT is astonishingly good at finding some sets of problems in parallel code.}
3.3.5 Other Details
So far we talked about the address as consisting of three parts , tag , set index , and cache line offset .
But what address is actually used ?
All relevant processors today provide virtual address spaces to processes , which means that there are two different kinds of addresses : virtual and physical .
The problem with virtual addresses is that they are not unique .
A virtual address can , over time , refer to different physical memory addresses .
The same address in different process also likely refers to different physical addresses .
So it is always better to use the physical memory address , right ?
The problem here is that instructions use virtual addresses and these have to be translated with the help of the Memory Management Unit ( MMU ) into physical addresses .
This is a non-trivial operation .
In the pipeline to execute an instruction the physical address might only be available at a later stage .
This means that the cache logic has to be very quick in determining whether the memory location is cached .
If virtual addresses could be used the cache lookup can happen much earlier in the pipeline and in case of a cache hit the memory content can be made available .
The result is that more of the memory access costs could be hidden by the pipeline .
Processor designers are currently using virtual address tagging for the first level caches .
These caches are rather small and can be cleared without too much pain .
At least partial clearing the cache is necessary if the page table tree of a process changes .
It might be possible to avoid a complete flush if the processor has an instruction which specifies the virtual address range which has changed .
Given the low latency of L1i and L1d caches ( ~3 cycles ) using virtual addresses is almost mandatory .
For larger caches including L2 , L3 , ... caches physical address tagging is needed .
These caches have a higher latency and the virtual →physical address translation can finish in time .
Because these caches are larger ( i.e. , a lot of information is lost when they are flushed ) and refilling them takes a long time due to the main memory access latency , flushing them often would be costly .
It should , in general , not be necessary to know about the details of the address handling in those caches .
They cannot be changed and all the factors which would influence the performance are normally something which should be avoided or is associated with high cost .
Overflowing the cache capacity is bad and all caches run into problems early if the majority of the used cache lines fall into the same set .
The latter can be avoided with virtually addressed caches but is impossible for user - level processes to avoid for caches addressed using physical addresses .
The only detail one might want to keep in mind is to not map the same physical memory location to two or more virtual addresses in the same process , if at all possible .
Another detail of the caches which is rather uninteresting to programmers is the cache replacement strategy .
Most caches evict the Least Recently Used ( LRU ) element first .
This is always a good default strategy .
With larger associativity ( and associativity might indeed grow further in the coming years due to the addition of more cores ) maintaining the LRU list becomes more and more expensive and we might see different strategies adopted .
As for the cache replacement there is not much a programmer can do .
If the cache is using physical address tags there is no way to find out how the virtual addresses correlate with the cache sets .
It might be that cache lines in all logical pages are mapped to the same cache sets , leaving much of the cache unused .
If anything , it is the job of the OS to arrange that this does not happen too often .
With the advent of virtualization things get even more complicated .
Now not even the OS has control over the assignment of physical memory .
The Virtual Machine Monitor ( VMM , aka hypervisor ) is responsible for the physical memory assignment .
The best a programmer can do is to a ) use logical memory pages completely and b ) use page sizes as large as meaningful to diversify the physical addresses as much as possible .
Larger page sizes have other benefits , too , but this is another topic ( see Section 4 ) .
3.4 Instruction Cache
Not just the data used by the processor is cached ; the instructions executed by the processor are also cached .
However , this cache is much less problematic than the data cache .
There are several reasons :
The quantity of code which is executed depends on the size of the code that is needed .
The size of the code in general depends on the complexity of the problem .
The complexity of the problem is fixed .
While the program 's data handling is designed by the programmer the program 's instructions are usually generated by a compiler .
The compiler writers know about the rules for good code generation .
Program flow is much more predictable than data access patterns .
Today 's CPUs are very good at detecting patterns .
This helps with prefetching .
Code always has quite good spatial and temporal locality .
There are a few rules programmers should follow but these mainly consist of rules on how to use the tools .
We will discuss them in Section 6 .
Here we talk only about the technical details of the instruction cache .
Ever since the core clock of CPUs increased dramatically and the difference in speed between cache ( even first level cache ) and core grew , CPUs have been pipelined .
That means the execution of an instruction happens in stages .
First an instruction is decoded , then the parameters are prepared , and finally it is executed .
Such a pipeline can be quite long (> 20 stages for Intel 's Netburst architecture ) .
A long pipeline means that if the pipeline stalls ( i.e. , the instruction flow through it is interrupted ) it takes a while to get up to speed again .
Pipeline stalls happen , for instance , if the location of the next instruction cannot be correctly predicted or if it takes too long to load the next instruction ( e.g. , when it has to be read from memory ) .
As a result CPU designers spend a lot of time and chip real estate on branch prediction so that pipeline stalls happen as infrequently as possible .
On CISC processors the decoding stage can also take some time .
The x86 and x86 - 64 processors are especially affected .
In recent years these processors therefore do not cache the raw byte sequence of the instructions in L1i but instead they cache the decoded instructions .
L1i in this case is called the trace cache .
Trace caching allows the processor to skip over the first steps of the pipeline in case of a cache hit which is especially good if the pipeline stalled .
As said before , the caches from L2 on are unified caches which contain both code and data .
Obviously here the code is cached in the byte sequence form and not decoded .
To achieve the best performance there are only a few rules related to the instruction cache :
Generate code which is as small as possible .
There are exceptions when software pipelining for the sake of using pipelines requires creating more code or where the overhead of using small code is too high .
Whenever possible , help the processor to make good prefetching decisions .
This can be done through code layout or with explicit prefetching .
These rules are usually enforced by the code generation of a compiler .
There are a few things the programmer can do and we will talk about them in Section 6 .
3.4.1 Self Modifying Code
In early computer days memory was a premium .
People went to great lengths to reduce the size of the program to make more room for program data .
One trick frequently deployed was to change the program itself over time .
Such Self Modifying Code ( SMC ) is occasionally still found , these days mostly for performance reasons or in security exploits .
SMC should in general be avoided .
Though it is generally executed correctly there are boundary cases in which it is not and it creates performance problems if not done correctly .
Obviously , code which is changed cannot be kept in the trace cache which contains the decoded instructions .
But even if the trace cache is not used because the code has not been executed at all ( or for some time ) the processor might have problems .
If an upcoming instruction is changed while it already entered the pipeline the processor has to throw away a lot of work and start all over again .
There are even situations where most of the state of the processor has to be tossed away .
Finally , since the processor assumes - for simplicity reasons and because it is true in 99.9999999 % of all cases - that the code pages are immutable , the L1i implementation does not use the MESI protocol but instead a simplified SI protocol .
This means if modifications are detected a lot of pessimistic assumptions have to be made .
It is highly advised to avoid SMC whenever possible .
Memory is not such a scarce resource anymore .
It is better to write separate functions instead of modifying one function according to specific needs .
Maybe one day SMC support can be made optional and we can detect exploit code trying to modify code this way .
If SMC absolutely has to be used , the write operations should bypass the cache as to not create problems with data in L1d needed in L1i .
See Section 6.1 for more information on these instructions .
Normally on Linux it is easy to recognize programs which contain SMC .
All program code is write - protected when built with the regular toolchain .
The programmer has to perform significant magic at link time to create an executable where the code pages are writable .
When this happens , modern Intel x86 and x86 - 64 processors have dedicated performance counters which count uses of self - modifying code .
With the help of these counters it is quite easily possible to recognize programs with SMC even if the program will succeed due to relaxed permissions .
3.5 Cache Miss Factors
We have already seen that when memory accesses miss the caches , the costs skyrocket .
Sometimes this is not avoidable and it is important to understand the actual costs and what can be done to mitigate the problem .
3.5.1 Cache and Memory Bandwidth
To get a better understanding of the capabilities of the processors we measure the bandwidth available in optimal circumstances .
This measurement is especially interesting since different processor versions vary widely .
This is why this section is filled with the data of several different machines .
The program to measure performance uses the SSE instructions of the x86 and x86 - 64 processors to load or store 16 bytes at once .
The working set is increased from 1 kB to 512MB just as in our other tests and it is measured how many bytes per cycle can be loaded or stored .
Figure 3.24 : Pentium 4 Bandwidth
Figure 3.24 shows the performance on a 64 - bit Intel Netburst processor .
For working set sizes which fit into L1d the processor is able to read the full 16 bytes per cycle , i.e. , one load instruction is performed per cycle ( the movaps instruction moves 16 bytes at once ) .
The test does not do anything with the read data , we test only the read instructions themselves .
As soon as the L1d is not sufficient anymore the performance goes down dramatically to less than 6 bytes per cycle .
The step at 218 bytes is due to the exhaustion of the DTLB cache which means additional work for each new page .
Since the reading is sequential prefetching can predict the accesses perfectly and the FSB can stream the memory content at about 5.3 bytes per cycle for all sizes of the working set .
The prefetched data is not propagated into L1d , though .
These are of course numbers which will never be achievable in a real program .
Think of them as practical limits .
What is more astonishing than the read performance is the write and copy performance .
The write performance , even for small working set sizes , does not ever rise above 4 bytes per cycle .
This indicates that , in these Netburst processors , Intel elected to use a Write - Through mode for L1d where the performance is obviously limited by the L2 speed .
This also means that the performance of the copy test , which copies from one memory region into a second , non-overlapping memory region , is not significantly worse .
The necessary read operations are so much faster and can partially overlap with the write operations .
The most noteworthy detail of the write and copy measurements is the low performance once the L2 cache is not sufficient anymore .
The performance drops to 0.5 bytes per cycle !
That means write operations are by a factor of ten slower than the read operations .
This means optimizing those operations is even more important for the performance of the program .
In Figure 3.25 we see the results on the same processor but with two threads running , one pinned to each of the two hyper - threads of the processor .
Figure 3.25 : P4 Bandwidth with 2 Hyper - Threads
The graph is shown at the same scale as the previous one to illustrate the differences and the curves are a bit jittery simply because of the problem of measuring two concurrent threads .
The results are as expected .
Since the hyper - threads share all the resources except the registers each thread has only half the cache and bandwidth available .
That means even though each thread has to wait a lot and could award the other thread with execution time this does not make any difference since the other thread also has to wait for the memory .
This truly shows the worst possible use of hyper - threads .
Figure 3.26 : Core 2 Bandwidth
Compared to Figures 3.24 and 3.25 the results in Figures 3.26 and 3.27 look quite different for an Intel Core 2 processor .
This is a dual - core processor with shared L2 which is four times as big as the L2 on the P4 machine .
This only explains the delayed drop - off of the write and copy performance , though .
There are much bigger differences .
The read performance throughout the working set range hovers around the optimal 16 bytes per cycle .
The drop - off in the read performance after 220 bytes is again due to the working set being too big for the DTLB .
Achieving these high numbers means the processor is not only able to prefetch the data and transport the data in time .
It also means the data is prefetched into L1d .
The write and copy performance is dramatically different , too .
The processor does not have a Write - Through policy ; written data is stored in L1d and only evicted when necessary .
This allows for write speeds close to the optimal 16 bytes per cycle .
Once L1d is not sufficient anymore the performance drops significantly .
As with the Netburst processor , the write performance is significantly lower .
Due to the high read performance the difference is even higher here .
In fact , when even the L2 is not sufficient anymore the speed difference increases to a factor of 20 !
This does not mean the Core 2 processors perform poorly .
To the contrary , their performance is always better than the Netburst core's .
Figure 3.27 : Core 2 Bandwidth with 2 Threads
In Figure 3.27 , the test runs two threads , one on each of the two cores of the Core 2 processor .
Both threads access the same memory , not necessarily perfectly in sync , though .
The results for the read performance are not different from the single - threaded case .
A few more jitters are visible which is to be expected in any multi - threaded test case .
The interesting point is the write and copy performance for working set sizes which would fit into L1d .
As can be seen in the figure , the performance is the same as if the data had to be read from the main memory .
Both threads compete for the same memory location and RFO messages for the cache lines have to be sent .
The problematic point is that these requests are not handled at the speed of the L2 cache , even though both cores share the cache .
Once the L1d cache is not sufficient anymore modified entries are flushed from each core 's L1d into the shared L2 .
At that point the performance increases significantly since now the L1d misses are satisfied by the L2 cache and RFO messages are only needed when the data has not yet been flushed .
This is why we see a 50 % reduction in speed for these sizes of the working set .
The asymptotic behavior is as expected : since both cores share the same FSB each core gets half the FSB bandwidth which means for large working sets each thread 's performance is about half that of the single threaded case .
Because there are significant differences between the processor versions of one vendor it is certainly worthwhile looking at the performance of other vendors ' processors , too .
Figure 3.28 shows the performance of an AMD family 10h Opteron processor .
This processor has 64 kB L1d , 512 kB L2 , and 2MB of L3 .
The L3 cache is shared between all cores of the processor .
The results of the performance test can be seen in Figure 3.28 .
Figure 3.28 : AMD Family 10 h Opteron Bandwidth
The first detail one notices about the numbers is that the processor is capable of handling two instructions per cycle if the L1d cache is sufficient .
The read performance exceeds 32 bytes per cycle and even the write performance is , with 18.7 bytes per cycle , high .
The read curve flattens quickly , though , and is , with 2.3 bytes per cycle , pretty low .
The processor for this test does not prefetch any data , at least not efficiently .
The write curve on the other hand performs according to the sizes of the various caches .
The peak performance is achieved for the full size of the L1d , going down to 6 bytes per cycle for L2 , to 2.8 bytes per cycle for L3 , and finally .5 bytes per cycle if not even L3 can hold all the data .
The performance for the L1d cache exceeds that of the ( older ) Core 2 processor , the L2 access is equally fast ( with the Core 2 having a larger cache ) , and the L3 and main memory access is slower .
The copy performance cannot be better than either the read or write performance .
This is why we see the curve initially dominated by the read performance and later by the write performance .
The multi - thread performance of the Opteron processor is shown in Figure 3.29 .
Figure 3.29 : AMD Fam 10h Bandwidth with 2 Threads
The read performance is largely unaffected .
Each thread 's L1d and L2 works as before and the L3 cache is in this case not prefetched very well either .
The two threads do not unduly stress the L3 for their purpose .
The big problem in this test is the write performance .
All data the threads share has to go through the L3 cache .
This sharing seems to be quite inefficient since even if the L3 cache size is sufficient to hold the entire working set the cost is significantly higher than an L3 access .
Comparing this graph with Figure 3.27 we see that the two threads of the Core 2 processor operate at the speed of the shared L2 cache for the appropriate range of working set sizes .
This level of performance is achieved for the Opteron processor only for a very small range of the working set sizes and even here it approachesthe speed of the L3 which is slower than the Core 2's L2 .
3.5.2 Critical Word Load
Memory is transferred from the main memory into the caches in blocks which are smaller than the cache line size .
Today 64 bits are transferred at once and the cache line size is 64 or 128 bytes .
This means 8 or 16 transfers per cache line are needed .
The DRAM chips can transfer those 64 - bit blocks in burst mode .
This can fill the cache line without any further commands from the memory controller and the possibly associated delays .
If the processor prefetches cache lines this is probably the best way to operate .
If a program 's cache access of the data or instruction caches misses ( that means , it is a compulsory cache miss , because the data is used for the first time , or a capacity cache miss , because the limited cache size requires eviction of the cache line ) the situation is different .
The word inside the cache line which is required for the program to continue might not be the first word in the cache line .
Even in burst mode and with double data rate transfer the individual 64 - bit blocks arrive at noticeably different times .
Each block arrives 4 CPU cycles or more later than the previous one .
If the word the program needs to continue is the eighth of the cache line , the program has to wait an additional 30 cycles or more after the first word arrives .
Things do not necessarily have to be like this .
The memory controller is free to request the words of the cache line in a different order .
The processor can communicate which word the program is waiting on , the critical word , and the memory controller can request this word first .
Once the word arrives the program can continue while the rest of the cache line arrives and the cache is not yet in a consistent state .
This technique is called Critical Word First & Early Restart .
Processors nowadays implement this technique but there are situations when that is not possible .
If the processor prefetches data the critical word is not known .
Should the processor request the cache line during the time the prefetch operation is in flight it will have to wait until the critical word arrives without being able to influence the order .
Figure 3.30 : Critical Word at End of Cache Line
Even with these optimizations in place the position of the critical word on a cache line matters .
Figure 3.30 shows the Follow test for sequential and random access .
Shown is the slowdown of running the test with the pointer which is chased in the first word versus the case when the pointer is in the last word .
The element size is 64 bytes , corresponding the cache line size .
The numbers are quite noisy but it can be seen that , as soon as the L2 is not sufficient to hold the working set size , the performance of the case where the critical word is at the end is about 0.7 % slower .
The sequential access appears to be affected a bit more .
This would be consistent with the aforementioned problem when prefetching the next cache line .
3.5.3 Cache Placement
Where the caches are placed in relationship to the hyper - threads , cores , and processors is not under control of the programmer .
But programmers can determine where the threads are executed and then it becomes important how the caches relate to the used CPUs .
Here we will not go into details of when to select what cores to run the threads .
We will only describe architecture details which the programmer has to take into account when setting the affinity of the threads .
Hyper-threads , by definition share everything but the register set .
This includes the L1 caches .
There is not much more to say here .
The fun starts with the individual cores of a processor .
Each core has at least its own L1 caches .
Aside from this there are today not many details in common :
Early multi-core processors had separate L2 caches and no higher caches .
Later Intel models had shared L2 caches for dual - core processors .
For quad - core processors we have to deal with separate L2 caches for each pair of two cores .
There are no higher level caches .
AMD 's family 10h processors have separate L2 caches and a unified L3 cache .
A lot has been written in the propaganda material of the processor vendors about the advantage of their respective models .
Separate L2 caches have an advantage if the working sets handled by the cores do not overlap .
This works well for single - threaded programs .
Since this is still often the reality today this approach does not perform too badly .
But there is always some overlap .
The caches all contain the most actively used parts of the common runtime libraries which means some cache space is wasted .
Completely sharing all caches beside L1 as Intel 's dual - core processors do can have a big advantage .
If the working set of the threads working on the two cores overlaps significantly the total available cache memory is increased and working sets can be bigger without performance degradation .
If the working sets do not overlap Intel 's Advanced Smart Cache management is supposed to prevent any one core from monopolizing the entire cache .
If both cores us
Amsterdam 's mayor Job Cohen laid out plans Monday to curb prostitution in the Dutch city , replacing many of the notorious red-light " windows " with upmarket restaurants and art galleries .
" We are going to clean up , and massively cut down on the number of prostitutes ' windows and coffee shops ( selling soft drugs ) , and fast - food joints , " said Cohen at a press conference .
While he said that prostitution would not be outlawed entirely , specific streets and squares within the city 's historic centre would be banned from housing sex commerce .

The Financial Tsunami
Part 1 : Deutsche Bank 's painful lesson F. William Engdahl
www.engdahl.oilgeopolitics.net/
Nov 26 , 2007
Even experienced banker friends tell me that they think the worst of the US banking troubles are over and that things are slowly getting back to normal .
What is lacking in their rosy optimism is the realization of the scale of the ongoing deterioration in credit markets globally , centered in the American asset - backed securities market , and especially in the market for CDOs - Collateralized Debt Obligations and CMOs - Collateralized Mortgage Obligations .
By now every serious reader has heard the term " It 's a crisis in Sub - Prime US home mortgage debt . "
What almost no one I know understands is that the Sub - Prime problem is but the tip of a colossal iceberg that is in a slow meltdown .
I offer one recent example to illustrate my point that the " Financial Tsunami " is only beginning .
Deutsche Bank got a hard shock a few days ago when a judge in the state of Ohio in the USA made a ruling that the bank had no legal right to foreclose on 14 homes whose owners had failed to keep current in their monthly mortgage payments .
Now this might sound like small beer for Deutsche Bank , one of the world 's largest banks with over ¤ 1.1 trillion ( Billionen ) in assets worldwide .
As Hilmar Kopper used to say , " peanuts . "
It 's not at all peanuts , however , for the Anglo - Saxon banking world and its European allies like Deutsche Bank , BNP Paribas , Barclays Bank , HSBC or others .
Why ?
A US Federal Judge , C.A. Boyko in Federal District Court in Cleveland Ohio ruled to dismiss a claim by Deutsche Bank National Trust Company .
DB 's US subsidiary was seeking to take possession of 14 homes from Cleveland residents living in them , in order to claim the assets .
Here comes the hair in the soup .
The Judge asked DB to show documents proving legal title to the 14 homes .
DB could not .
All DB attorneys could show was a document showing only an " intent to convey the rights in the mortgages . "
They could not produce the actual mortgage , the heart of Western property rights since the Magna Charta of not longer .
Again why could Deutsche Bank not show the 14 mortgages on the 14 homes ?
Because they live in the exotic new world of " global securitization " , where banks like DB or Citigroup buy tens of thousands of mortgages from small local lending banks , " bundle " them into Jumbo new securities which then are rated by Moody 's or Standard & Poors or Fitch , and sell them as bonds to pension funds or other banks or private investors who naively believed they were buying bonds rated AAA , the highest , and never realized that their " bundle " of say 1,000 different home mortgages , contained maybe 20 % or 200 mortgages rated " sub - prime , " i.e. of dubious credit quality .
Indeed the profits being earned in the past seven years by the world 's largest financial players from Goldman Sachs to Morgan Stanley to HSBC , Chase , and yes , Deutsche Bank , were so staggering , few bothered to open the risk models used by the professionals who bundled the mortgages .
Certainly not the Big
Three rating companies who had a criminal conflict of interest in giving top debt ratings .
That changed abruptly last August and since then the major banks have issued one after another report of disastrous " sub - prime " losses .
A new unexpected factor The Ohio ruling that dismissed DB 's claim to foreclose and take back the 14 homes for non-payment , is far more than bad luck for the bank of Josef Ackermann .
It is an earth - shaking precedent for all banks holding what they had thought were collateral in form of real estate property .
How this ?
Because of the complex structure of asset - backed securities and the widely dispersed ownership of mortgage securities ( not actual mortgages but the securities based on same ) no one is yet able to identify who precisely holds the physical mortgage document .
Oops !
A tiny legal detail our Wall Street Rocket Scientist derivatives experts ignored when they were bundling and issuing hundreds of billions of dollars worth of CMOs in the past six or seven years .
As of January 2007 some $ 6.5 trillion of securitized mortgage debt was outstanding in the United States .
That 's a lot by any measure !
In the Ohio case Deutsche Bank is acting as " Trustee " for " securitization pools " or groups of disparate investors who may reside anywhere .
But the Trustee never got the legal document known as the mortgage .
Judge Boyko ordered DB to prove they were the owners of the mortgages or notes and they could not .
DB could only argue that the banks had foreclosed on such cases for years without challenge .
The Judge then declared that the banks " seem to adopt the attitude that since they have been doing this for so long , unchallenged , this practice equates with legal compliance .
Finally put to the test , " the Judge concluded , " their weak legal arguments compel the court to stop them at the gate . "
Deutsche Bank has refused comment .
What next ?
As news of this legal precedent spreads across the USA like a California brushfire , hundreds of thousands of struggling homeowners who took the bait in times of historically low interest rates to buy a home with often , no money paid down , and the first 2 years with extremely low interest rate in what are known as " interest only " Adjustable Rate Mortgages ( ARMs ) , now face exploding mortgage monthly payments at just the point the US economy is sinking into severe recession .
( I regret the plethora of abbreviations used here but it is the fault of Wall Street bankers not this author ) .
The peak period of the US real estate bubble which began in about 2002 when Alan Greenspan began the most aggressive series of rate cuts in Federal Reserve history was 2005 - 2006 .
Greenspan 's intent , as he admitted at the time , was to replace the Dot.com internet stock bubble with a real estate home investment and lending bubble .
He argued that was the only way to keep the US economy from deep recession .
In retrospect a recession in 2002 would have been far milder and less damaging than what we now face .
Of course , Greenspan has since safely retired , written his memoirs and handed the control ( and blame ) of the mess over to a young ex-Princeton professor , Ben Bernanke .
As a Princeton graduate , I can say I would never trust monetary policy for the world 's most powerful central bank in the hands of a Princeton economics professor .
Keep them in their ivy - covered towers .
Now the last phase of every speculative bubble is the one where the animal juices get the most excited .
This has been the case with every major speculative bubble since the Holland Tulip speculation of the 1630's to the South Sea Bubble of 1720 to the 1929 Wall Street crash .
It was true as well with the US 2002 - 2007 Real Estate bubble .
In the last two years of the boom in selling real estate loans , banks were convinced they could resell the mortgage loans to a Wall Street financial house who would bundle it with thousands of good better and worse quality mortgage loans and resell them as Collateralized Mortgage Obligation bonds .
In the flush of greed , banks became increasingly reckless of the credit worthiness of the prospective home owners .
In many cases they did not even bother to check if the person was employed .
Who cares ?
It will be resold and securitized and the risk of mortgage default was historically low .
That was in 2005 .
The most Sub - prime mortgages written with Adjustable Rate Mortgage contracts were written between 2005 - 2006 , the last and most furious phase of the US bubble .
Now a whole new wave of mortgage defaults is about to explode onto the scene beginning January 2008 .
Between December 2007 and July 1 , 2008 more than $ 690 Billion in mortgages will face an interest rate jump according to the contract terms of the ARMs written two years before .
That means market interest rates for those mortgages will explode monthly payments just as recession drives incomes down .
Hundreds of thousands of homeowners will be forced to do the last resort of any homeowner : stop monthly mortgage payments .
Here is where the Ohio court decision guarantees that the next phase of the US mortgage crisis will assume Tsunami dimension .
If the Ohio Deutsche Bank precedent holds in the appeal to the Supreme Court , millions of homes will be in default but the banks prevented from seizing them as collateral assets to resell .
Robert Shiller of Yale , the controversial and often correct author of the book , Irrational Exuberance , predicting the 2001 - 2 Dot.com stock crash , estimates US housing prices could fall as much as 50 % in some areas given how home prices have diverged relative to rents .
The $ 690 billion worth of " interest only " ARMs due for interest rate hike between now and July 2008 are by and large not Sub - prime but a little higher quality , but only just .
There are a total of $ 1.4 trillion in " interest only " ARMs according to the US research firm , First American Loan Performance .
A recent study calculates that , as these ARMs face staggering higher interest costs in the next 9 months , more than $ 325 billion of the loans will default leaving 1 million property owners in technical mortgage default .
But if banks are unable to reclaim the homes as assets to offset the non-performing mortgages , the US banking system and a chunk of the global banking system faces a financial gridlock that will make events to date truly " peanuts " by comparison .

When I was writing the summary of differences between WebOb and other request objects , to remind myself of web frameworks I might have forgotten I went to the WebFrameworks page on the Python wiki .
Looking through that page I ’m reminded how many framework options there have been .
And I was further reminded of how few relevant options there are now .
From all this , there have emerged just a few options : Django , Pylons , TurboGears , Zope .
No offense to anyone left out of that list — I know there ’s some other actively developed frameworks out there .
But frankly they are n’t serious choices ; they might be fine internal tools , or interesting experiments , but they are clearly on a different tier ( and they all have questionable futures ) .
And now that TurboGears 2 will be based on Pylons the list looks smaller still .
For a long , long time ( longer than most of those frameworks have existed ) people have complained about the proliferation of web frameworks in Python .
Those of us involved in developing web frameworks in Python have n’t been able to respond all that well .
Complaining does n’t magically lead to solutions , and you ca n’t just will there to be a single Python web framework .
You can work towards that , but that ’s what we ’ve been doing … mostly people do n’t seem to notice .
It ’s just not an easy thing to work towards ; the problem space for a web framework is n’t well defined , its end goal is far more vague than most people immediately realize , and it involves consensus , which makes everything much harder .
We said the market would decide , which is kind of a cop out ( the market decides through the decisions of developers ) but that ’s the best answer we had .
But after all this time , it seems clear that we are getting much closer to that goal .
If you squint really hard , you can almost imagine we are there .
The total list of frameworks only gets longer over time — that ’s how open source works — but the list of choices has become quite compact .
How we get to the next level is a little less clear .
We ’ve gotten this way largely through attrition , but that ’s not going to get us any further .
I ’ll at least assure people that we are discussing this stuff — it ’s slow going , but everyone is interested .
And if anyone actually wants to do some leg work to move this forward , a lot of the work is actually technical , not political , so do n’t be afraid to jump in .
PALO ALTO , Calif . --
Late one spring afternoon last year , a mystery man sat in the back of a creative - writing seminar at Stanford .
Evidently a student , he was much older than anyone else in the room .
He was wearing a black blazer and white Nikes .
He said his name was Phil .
As the days passed , the man 's identity gradually came into focus .
The instructor " made several vague allusions to Phil taking off in his private jet , " recalls André Lyon , an English major enrolled in the class .
And tales about Michael Jordan found ...
BANGKOK ( Reuters ) - Canadian pedophile suspect Christopher Neil , focus of a global hunt that ended in rural Thailand on Friday , will be charged with molesting underage children after being tracked down through his boyfriend ’s phone .
Policemen escort suspected Canadian paedophile Christopher Paul Neil to the national police headquarters in Bangkok October 19 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Sukree Sukplang
Thai police appealed for more victims to come forward after nabbing Neil at a rented house .
Neil is also accused of raping young boys in Vietnam and Cambodia after being unmasked by nifty police computer work and hunted in a unique Internet appeal .
“ From pictures on the Internet , there were five to seven children under age 10 who have been abused by him , including one girl , ” Deputy National Police Chief Wongkot Maneerin told a packed news conference in Bangkok .
Neil , 32 , caught in the northeast Thai province of Nakhon Ratchasima , 250 km ( 150 miles ) from Bangkok and well off the normal tourist trail , refused to answer reporters ’ questions .
Police said Neil , who arrived in handcuffs at national police headquarters , his head covered by a blue T - shirt , had confirmed his identity to investigators but said nothing else .
Neil was no stranger to Thailand , having once taught in a Bangkok language school , but his hiding place was revealed by a trace on the mobile phone of his 25 - year - old Thai boyfriend , identified by transvestites in the seedy beach town of Pattaya .
“ They went together to different provinces , probably on the run , and the last call made was from Nakhon Ratchasima .
So I sent my men there , ” tourist police chief Chuchart Suwannakom told Reuters .
Thai police issued a warrant for Neil ’s arrest on Thursday , a week after he fled South Korea , after two Thai teenagers accused him of paying for oral sex when they were nine and 14 , grounds for prosecution under Thai law .
Neil could face up to 20 years in jail if convicted in Thailand .
Wongkot said he would be prosecuted in Bangkok , but left open the possibility he could be extradited once he had served his sentence .
“ He has to be prosecuted in Thailand first , ” he said .
“ SWIRLY FACE ”
Canada -- which can prosecute its citizens for child sex crimes committed abroad , but has rarely done so -- has not said if it plans to seek Neil ’s extradition .
“ We are aware an arrest has been made and we will offer consular services as necessary , ” a spokesman for the Canadian embassy in Bangkok said .
Cambodia said it also wanted to question Neil and would charge him if police there could put a case together .
“ We want to know did he really commit sexual abuses on Cambodia ’s children and women , ” Police Major General Keo Vannthan said .
“ If so it will lead us to locate the victims and we will file suit against him . ”
Vietnam might also want to question Neil .
Detectives in various countries had been trying to track Neil down since German police discovered photographs on the Internet three years ago of a man sexually abusing 12 boys in Vietnam and Cambodia .
Slideshow ( 6 images )
His face had been scrambled with a digital swirling pattern , but German police computer experts managed to unravel the “ Swirly Face ” disguise and Interpol issued an unprecedented worldwide appeal through the Internet for information on who the man was .
More than 350 people came forward and Neil was identified by five sources from three different continents , Interpol said .
Neil abruptly left South Korea , where he was teaching , after Interpol broadcast his cleaned - up photograph and flew to Thailand , where he was photographed with shaved head and glasses by airport security cameras .
Thailand and its neighbors immediately alerted border posts in case he tried to sneak across a land frontier as Thai police launched a manhunt to rival their search a year ago for JonBenet Ramsey murder suspect John Mark Karr .
Karr was arrested in a run-down Bangkok hostel and sent back to the United States , where he was eventually cleared of any involvement in Ramsey ’s murder , one of America ’s most infamous unsolved crimes .
The brain remains a complicated machine but researchers from the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition ( CNBC ) , a joint project of Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh have made progress in explaining why , when we notice a scent , the brain can quickly sort through input and determine exactly what that smell is .
To do it , they created a biologically inspired algorithm for analyzing the brain at work and they have described a mechanism called “ dynamic connectivity , ” in which neuronal circuits are rewired “ on the fly ” allowing stimuli to be more keenly sensed .
“ If you think of the brain like a computer , then the connections between neurons are like the software that the brain is running .
Our work shows that this biological software is changed rapidly as a function of the kind of input that the system receives , ” said Nathan Urban , associate professor of biological sciences at Carnegie Mellon .

When a stimulus such as an odor is encountered , many neurons start to fire .
When many neurons fire at the same time , the signals can be difficult for the brain to interpret .
During lateral inhibition , the stimulated neurons send “ cease - fire ” messages to the neighboring neurons , reducing the noise and making it easier to precisely identify a stimulus .
This process also facilitates accurate recognition of stimuli in many sensory areas of the brain .
In this project , Urban and colleagues specifically examine the process of lateral inhibition in an area of the brain called the olfactory bulb , which is responsible for processing scents .
Until now , scientists thought that the connections made by the neurons in the olfactory bulb were dictated by anatomy and could only change slowly .
However , in this current study , Urban and colleagues found that the connections are , in fact , not set but rather able to change dynamically in response to specific patterns of stimuli .
In their experiments , they found that when excitatory neurons in the olfactory bulb fire in a correlated fashion , this determines how they are functionally connected .
The researchers showed that dynamic connectivity allows lateral inhibition to be enhanced when a large number of neurons initially respond to a stimulus , filtering out noise from other neurons .
By filtering out the noise , the stimulus can be more clearly recognized and separated from other similar stimuli .
“ This mechanism helps to explain why you can walk into a room and recognize a smell that seems to be floral .
As you continue to smell the odor , you begin to recognize that the scent is indeed flowers and even more specifically is the scent of roses , ” Urban said .
“ By understanding how the brain does this , we can then apply this mechanism to other problems faced by the brain . ”
Researchers converted this mechanism into an algorithm and used computer modeling to further show that dynamic connectivity makes it easier to identify and discriminate between stimuli by enhancing the contrast , or sharpness , of the stimuli , independent of the spatial patterns of the active neurons .
This algorithm allows researchers to show the applicability of the mechanism in other areas of the brain where similar inhibitory connections are widespread .
For example , the researchers applied the algorithm to a blurry picture and the picture appeared refined and in sharper contrast ( see figure ) .
Coauthors of the study include Armen Arevian , a graduate student in the Center for Neuroscience at the University of Pittsburgh , and Vikrant Kapoor , a biological sciences graduate student at Carnegie Mellon .
The study was funded through grants from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders , and the National Science Foundation .
The process is described in a paper in the January 2008 issue of Nature Neuroscience , and available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nn2030.
Republican presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani arrives at a fundraiser at a restaurant in Providence , R.I. Giuliani 's cache boasts big names
Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani may be running for the GOP presidential nomination as a Washington outsider , but you 'd never know it from the list of lobbyist insiders raising money for him .

Giuliani has collected more lobbyist bundlers -- 20 -- than any other major candidate who is accepting help from the community .
He beat Republican challenger Sen. John McCain 's number of 12 and , on the Democratic side , Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton 's half - dozen lobbyist helpers .
While Giuliani clocks in with more hands on deck , that has n't translated into more money .
Clinton still leads in that category , pulling in $ 234,550 to Giuliani's $ 100,950 , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
Unlike the other major campaigns , the Giuliani camp did not release its bundlers list .

Anyway , as we made the controller pictured above this week , it occured to us that you might enjoy making one of your own — so we took a lot of pictures , and here you go : a guide to building your own full - sized GH controller .
Or , as we like to call it :
What happens when you cross a perfectly good TAC wireless GH controller and a perfectly good guitar ?
Read on past the jump to find out .

Warning !
Before you jump into this project , let us warn you that this is n’t for the faint of heart .
There ’s a lot of destruction involved and it takes a good bit of patience to cut and mangle these parts slowly — test fitting as you go — to make sure they ’re all going to fit .
It took us about 75 hours to complete ours , and though yours may move along more quickly ( depending on the tools and experience at your command ) this is still a pretty difficult task .
Task Overview / Selecting the Controller & Guitar
Our goal here is to remove the functional components from a GH controller and install them into a real guitar .
You ’ve probably seen some of the pictures of these floating around the ‘ net as some people have already successfully built them .
We saw those pictures , too , and it looked like a pretty straightforward task .
In some ways it is , and in many ways it ’s not .
The problem you ’ll deal with over and over during this project is space or more importantly the lack thereof .
Whenever you ’re selecting parts or laying out the guitar , keep in mind where all the components will fit and whether or not they ’ll conflict with each other .
Selecting a controller is easy if you want a wireless controller ; at the time we started the project only one was available : the TAC controller .
Now the Red Octane version is readily available as well , so you have a choice .
( Actually , if anyone out there has a Red Octane version and would be willing to crack it open and take a few pix to send them our way , we ’ll post them here for everyone ’s benefit . )
Note : Click on smaller photos for larger versions .
If you do n’t care to go wireless , you could save yourself a lot of hassle and expense by starting with a factory Red Octane GH controller .
Remember that if you want to go wireless , you ’re going to have to deal with batteries — which is easier said than done .
Obviously you have a little more choice with the guitar .
We started out by looking around the local pawn shops , hoping to find a guitar that ’d already had a good life on stage ( or in somebody ’s bedroom ) and was ready for a change .
Sadly , we had little luck .
Most of the guitars we found had been pawned for at least $ 20 , which meant that they would n’t let go of them for less than $ 40 — and everything we found in that price range needed some major paint work .
Of course , if you ’ve got weeks to spend on the project , painting can be fun and rewarding .
Since we had about a week , we decided to go for something more “ ready to play . ”
A trip to Guitar Center netted us a brand - new Fender Squier Bullet for $ 99 .
Disassembly
Before we ran out to pick up switches and such , we decided to see what we got ourselves into ; we took the GH conroller apart .
Since the battery pack cover is fastened with small Phillips screws , TAC ships a handy little screwdriver with the unit .
We used it to take the screws out of the body , which revealed the controller ’s guts .
There are five main components : the “ strummer ” unit ( which also houses the majority of the electronics ) , the “ whammy bar ” unit , the “ fret ” button board , the start / select button board , and the tilt switch assembly .
Besides those , there ’s also an on - off switch and a battery pack .
The strummer attaches to the controller ’s face with four screws , and an orange plastic stand - off captures and positions the “ strum bar ” so that it actuates the switches .
It ’s connected to the button boards with ribbon cables and to the rest with common small - gauge wire .
The whammy bar unit consists of a white plastic cage that positions the silver swivel perpendicular to a potentiometer .
The potentiometer is held in place by a metal strap , and the swivel connects to the cage via a small spring to return the bar after use .
The start / select buttons are very inexpensive circuit - board type buttons — where the buttons themselves provide the mechanical connection — there ’s no big “ switch . ”
When you mash the button , you ’re squashing some flexible material in the plastic “ button , ” allowing a small conductor to make contact across a shape etched into the board .
The same goes for the fret button board .
The tilt sensor slides into a bracket and is hot - glued in place .

In December 2003 , German citizen Khaled el - Masri boarded a bus in Germany for a holiday in Skopje , Macedonia .
Instead of a restful vacation , the Muslim man of Lebanese heritage says he ended up in a Central Intelligence Agency isolation cell in Afghanistan as a suspected terrorist .
He was released after five months of interrogation with no explanation justifying the action or apology if it was a mistake .
Now , nearly four years later , his lawyers are asking the US Supreme Court to examine whether the Bush administration has the power to prevent Mr. Masri from seeking recourse in American courts .
Masri's lawyers claim that the CIA kidnapped and tortured an innocent man .
The government has never responded directly to the accusation .
Instead , Justice Department lawyers asked a US judge to throw the case out of court to prevent disclosure of state secrets .
He did .
At issue in El - Masri v. US is the government 's use of the so - called state - secrets privilege .
The judicial doctrine provides that some legal cases must be dismissed if the central evidence in the court battle would require disclosure of national security secrets .
The Bush administration is using the same doctrine to block a string of legal challenges to other secret terror - war tactics , including warrantless electronic surveillance in the US .
Masri's lawyers say he is not seeking to disclose secrets ; he just wants to have US officials held accountable for their alleged treatment of him , which has already been made public .
The government counters that any effort to defend US actions in the Masri case would require disclosure of how the CIA handles terror suspects and other US intelligence sources and methods .
Such information is secret and must remain secret , government lawyers say .
" It is true that , at a high level of generality , the government has disclosed the CIA 's participation in a program involving detention and interrogation of suspected terrorists , " Solicitor General Paul Clement says in his brief to the court .
" But ... the facts that would be central to the adjudication of this action are not limited to such general disclosures . "
Critics of the government 's approach say the state - secrets privilege is being used to cover up Masri 's alleged illegal detention and treatment .
They add that it undermines the judiciary 's oversight role in America 's constitutional system of checks and balances .
" The whole reason for the court system is to protect individual rights that would n't be protected in the political process , " says Amanda Frost , a visiting professor at Harvard Law School , who also teaches at American University 's Washington School of Law .
If the high court takes up Masri 's case , including the broader area of judicial responsibility , it could set the stage for a landmark ruling endorsing aggressive judicial oversight of secret administration tactics in the war on terror .
But that approach runs counter to the limited role for judges embraced by Chief Justice John Roberts and arguments by the solicitor general that judges have no business second - guessing presidential decisions concerning intelligence and war - fighting matters
When Masri filed his suit in federal court , government lawyers told the judge that just confirming or denying the charges would reveal state secrets about how the US is waging its war on terror .
The government submitted a classified affidavit to the trial judge , explaining its position .
Masri's lawyers were not permitted to see the affidavit .
The judge threw out the suit on state - secrets grounds , and a federal appeals court panel upheld the dismissal on the same grounds .
In his appeal to the Supreme Court , Masri is asking the justices to examine whether the government properly invoked the state - secrets privilege or simply used the privilege to avoid being held accountable for alleged torture and other illegal and unconstitutional activities .
" The [ state - secrets ] privilege is now routinely invoked to block adjudication of disputes that raise profound constitutional questions , " says Benjamin Wizner of the American Civil Liberties Union , in his petition to the court .
He says the state - secrets privilege was originally meant to help resolve courtroom disputes over individual pieces of evidence .
But the government is increasingly using the privilege as a way to immediately throw entire cases out of court , he says , before any investigation of the allegations can take place .
The Bush administration is urging the Supreme Court not to hear Masri 's case .
In a brief filed at the high court last week , Solicitor General Clement disputed suggestions that the administration has escalated its use of the state - secrets privilege .
He also said the legal issues surrounding the privilege are clear and well settled .
" This court has already laid down the governing legal principles and ... the courts of appeals have consistently applied them to varying factual circumstances without demonstrating any need for further guidance , " Mr. Clement writes in his brief .
The same state - secrets issue is also at the center of a string of lawsuits challenging the Bush administration 's warrantless surveillance operations by the National Security Agency .
The Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco heard two cases last month involving alleged NSA surveillance within the US .
Although federal judges have reached conflicting rulings on how to apply the state - secrets privilege , so far appeals courts have uniformly upheld the Bush administration 's position .
Some analysts say that might soon change when the Ninth Circuit panel rules in the NSA cases .
Aside from the legal issue , the Masri case raises fundamental questions about fairness and respect for human rights by the US government , analysts say .
Masri's alleged ordeal sparked widespread outrage in Europe , triggered an ongoing German government investigation , and prompted an attempt by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to explain the Bush administration 's position to allies .
" When and if mistakes are made , we work very hard and as quickly as possible to rectify them , " she told a 2005 press conference in Berlin .
But in the nearly two years since Ms. Rice 's pledge , there has been no talk by the Bush administration of mistakes in the Masri case or rectification .
When he dismissed Masri 's case on state - secrets grounds in 2006 , US District Judge T.S. Ellis III said the action was required by settled , controlling law .
But he added , " If El - Masri 's allegations are true or essentially true , then all fair - minded people ... must ... agree that El - Masri has suffered injuries as a result of our country 's mistake and deserves a remedy . "
Some legal analysts also suggest new legislation could help resolve state - secrets disputes .
The Classified Information Procedures
Act was passed to help prosecute criminal cases in which some of the evidence is classified information .
Under CIPA , a judge is empowered to substitute a nonclassified version of the same information as evidence for use in open court .
Some legal experts say Congress could write a new chapter to CIPA to permit similar protective procedures in civil cases filed against the US government involving classified information .
A hard - partying Wall Street trader and his ex-girlfriend are in court over an allegedly broken $ 100,000 promise to keep on the straight and narrow .
In recently filed court papers , Elisa Kwon accuses her former beau Greg Calvino , 45 , of reneg ing on a pledge he had made to not “ use drugs , stay out late , frequent strippers or prosti tutes . ”
The 30 - something Kwon insists Calvino had vowed that if he ever did any of those things again , she could cash a $ 100,000 check he had made out to her .
After Calvino ’s allegedly debauched boys ’ night out at a strip club in March 2005 , that ’s just what Kwon did .
But a fuming Calvino filed suit in Manhattan Supreme Court in late July to get his money back – plus interest , legal fees and damages – claiming the whole thing is an extortion attempt .
Calvino claims Kwon had threatened to go to his bosses at RBC Capital Markets , where he was a stock trader at the time of the intemperate night out , and make up tales of drug use “ with strippers and whores . ”
He claims he wrote the $ 100,000 check to protect his career and reputation , and that she cashed it for no apparent reason .
But Kwon , in a motion to dismiss filed on Sept. 20 , said Calvino ’s drug use and wild ways with women entitled her to the money .
She said she cashed the check in November 2005 , after he went out with fellow RBC traders to ogle the girls at Flashdancers and do cocaine that March .
What ’s more , he failed a store - bought drug test of his urine , she claims .
In an affidavit , Kwon attached what she claims is the text of a long instant - message conversation she had with Calvino in which he appears to cop to doing drugs and visiting strip clubs and tells her to keep the cash .
After initially writing that he was “ sorry I was irresponsible last night – but I did n’t do the bad stuff , ” and that he was not “ stupid enough to jeopardize our future , ” Calvino explains he was only “ drunk / bombed [ on ]
Jack [ Daniels ] , ” according to the text transcript .
Kwon reminds him of the “ $ 25 Rite - Aid ” test – “ it ’s POSITIVE . ”
Calvino then appears to blame one of his trading buddies : “ He put it in my face . ”
Later in the instant - message exchange , Calvino confesses to going to Flashdancers after a charity event with four colleagues , the text shows
An RBC spokesman did not immediately comment .
An apparently contrite Calvino later writes to Kwon , “ A promise is a promise , ” according to the text .
He also allegedly writes , “ I did n’t hold up my end of the bargain , ” and “ If you want to keep my money it ’s yours to start anew . ”
Calvino , who has since moved to Thomas Weisel Partners , did not reply to calls or e-mail requesting comment .
His lawyer also did n’t return calls .
Kwon did not reply to an e-mail seeking comment .
Her lawyer , Zachary Margulis - Ohnuma , declined to comment .
Calvino and Kwon , who dated for two years , broke up in April 2006 .

From ABC :
Huckabee recently told CNN , “ None of us could ’ve predicted what Dumond could ’ve done when he got out . ”
It ’s Bush and the levees all over again .
No one could have predicted .
Yeah , no one could have predicted that a convicted rapist who mauled a 17 year old high school student would then turn around and maul another woman after he was let out of prison early as a result of Huckabee ’s intervention .
And now Huckabee is trying to cover up the entire affair .
This story is n’t going away .
And I ’m sure we can expect mom to be starring in many a TV commercial , and doing many a talk show .
And when the right - wing noise machine starts attacking mom , like they did the first girl this monster raped , then we ’ll see whose side Mike Huckabee is really on .
Now , do n’t get me wrong .
I do n’t think Huckabee thought the man would rape again .
I just think that Huckabee did n’t care if the man would rape again .
Huckabee was more interested in anti-Bill - Clinton conspiracy theories , the fact that the first womant he man raped was a distant Clinton relative , than he was the danger of putting a convicted rapist back on the street .
Huckabee tried to take a cheap shot at Bill Clinton through his raped cousin and a woman is dead as a result .
Did Huckabee want her dead ?
No .
But are we really to believe that he ’s surprised that a convicted rapist who did n’t do his time then raped ( and murdered ) again ?
Oh please .
( And can I just say “ kudos ” to ABC ’s Brian Ross for quoting something on CNN .
I do n’t think I ’ve ever seen one network reference another , or at least very rarely .
That was good of him , and very Internet -y . )

Up to 10 million may have died in the Ukraine famine
Ekaterina Marchenko is insistent .
" I can't have you leaving here hungry , " she says .
" Here , just have this bowl of soup , and maybe later you 'll feel like having a sandwich , or a cup of tea and a piece of cake . "
The hospitable 87 - year - old cannot bear the thought of her guest being less than full , but then she has a horror of going hungry .
Seventy - five years ago , Ekaterina saw seven members of her family and almost all of her neighbours starve to death , in a man -made famine that killed millions of people in Ukraine .
Tree bark and roots
The " Holodomor " or " famine plague " as it is known in Ukraine , was part of Joseph Stalin 's programme to crush the resistance of the peasantry to the collectivisation of farming .
Do n't go near the priest 's house either - because the neighbours there have killed and eaten their children
Ekaterina Marchenko recalls a warning from her mother
When in 1932 the grain harvest did not meet the Kremlin 's targets , activists were sent to the villages where they confiscated not just grain and bread , but all the food they could find .
The confiscations continued into 1933 , and the results were devastating .
No -one is sure how many people died , but historians say that in under a year at least three million and possibly up to 10 million starved to death .
The horrors Ekaterina saw live with her still .
" We did n't have any funerals - whole families died , " she tells me .
" Of our neighbours I remember all the Solveiki family died , all of the Kapshuks , all the Rahachenkos too - and the Yeremo family - three of them , still alive , were thrown into the mass grave . "
Ekaterina , her mother and brother , survived by eating tree bark , roots and whatever they could find - but she says starvation drove others to terrible deeds .
" One day mother said to us , ' children , you can't take your usual shortcut through the village anymore because the grandpa in the house nearby killed his grandson and ate him - and now he 's been killed by his son ...
And do n't go near the priest 's house either - because the neighbours there have killed and eaten their children . ' "
The famine was part of Stalin 's plan to crush peasant resistance
Though some , like Ekaterina , can never forget what happened , many Ukrainians had never heard of the famine until the country 's independence - such was the secrecy about it during Soviet times .
But every year since independence , events to commemorate the famine get larger , and momentum is growing behind a campaign to raise international awareness of what happened .
This weekend marks the 75th anniversary of the start of the Holodomor , and Ukraine is starting a year of commemorations .
Events are being held across the country .
And around the world members of the Ukrainian diaspora are also marking the anniversary .
Ukraine has officially declared the Holodomor a genocide - it says the famine was part of a campaign to crush Ukrainian nationalism .
Russian objections
Ukraine 's borders were sealed during the famine , say scholars , to ensure the subjugation of the whole country .
It is a message Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko wants to take to the world .
An exhibition of the famine forms part of Ukraine 's remembrance
This anniversary is being used to boost a campaign for other countries , and the United Nations , to officially declare the Holodomor a genocide , too .
But Russia objects .
The Russians are accusing Ukraine of using the tragedy of the past to gain political advantage .
The famine could not be genocide , they say , because there was starvation in many parts of the Soviet Union at the time and , they add , for the Ukrainians to claim it was aimed at them is an insult to those of other nationalities who died .
Within Ukraine there is division too .
The head of the country 's Communist Party , Pyotr Simonenko , does not believe there was any deliberate starvation at all , and he accuses President Yushchenko of using the famine to stir up hatred .
" He draws people 's attention to history so as not to answer questions about the problems of today - he speaks of the dead , not thinking of the living , " he says .
" Yushchenko has set a time bomb under Ukrainian - Russian relations .
" His insistence that this be recognised as a genocide - which is by the way , an idea with no foundation - will only lead to someone using it in the future to ignite inter-ethnic conflict . "
Though few in Ukraine share Mr Simonenko 's interpretation of history , there is some sympathy with his view that the commemoration has been politicised , and that the campaign could damage relations with Russia .
None of this , however , is deterring President Yushchenko .
He says he wants a new law criminalising Holodomor denial - and to see new monuments to the famine built in Ukraine before the end of the year 's commemorations .
It remains to be seen whether those monuments will bring Ukrainians together in remembrance , or divide them along political lines .

The Daily Mail , as you know , is engaged in a philosophical project of mythic proportions : for many years now it has diligently been sifting through all the inanimate objects in the world , soberly dividing them into the ones which either cause – or cure – cancer .
The only tragedy is that one day , amongst the noise , they might genuinely be on to something , and we would simply laugh .
That day has come .
They asked : “ Is your lipstick giving you breast cancer ? ”
And the answer is simple : butyl benzyl phthalate should be banned from use in the cosmetic industry .
I agree with a scare story in the Daily Mail .
“ Chemicals found in lipstick and nail varnish could trigger breast cancer , scientists warned yesterday . ”
Yes .
“ A study has shown that butyl benzyl phthalate , or BBP , can interfere with the healthy development of breast tissue . ” I agree .
“ Environmental campaigners yesterday called for it to be banned in the cosmetic industry . ” I agree with them too .
For just one moment , indulge my secret geeky love of materials science .
Phthalates are very clever oily substances which are used as plasticisers : when you add them to something like , say PVC , which is hard , they allow the long PVC molecules to slide over each other .
It ’s a bit like adding water to clay .
You can tell plastic products which have phthalates in them because they have that kind of waxy , flexible texture , and a dodgy chemical smell .
A drop of phthalate is the difference between a rigid 12 - inch vinyl record and a figure - hugging PVC corset .
Without phthalates there would be no fetish nightclubs , and none of those spongy PVC floor tiles .
They ’ve also been used to make flexible plastic toys , and were banned from children ’s teethers a while ago ( although that was a bit of a cosmetic regulatory move , since most of your exposure is through food , because phthalates leak out of the plastic packaging ; there ’s a lot of them in dust , too ) .
So what risk judgment are we endorsing here ?
Phthalates are all different , but some have been shown at high concentrations to have harmful effects in laboratory animals , they may block the effects of male hormones , and in one OK–ish study – the results of which have been overstated in many quarters – phthalates have also been associated with borderline effects on genital development in foetuses .
But the details of BBP in cosmetics are less interesting than the question of how we collectively manage risks : because we will always need to take risks , with every step we take down the street , and the nature of our risk exposure has changed .
I cannot unanimously ban BBP from cosmetics in Europe , and reduce my risk of breast cancer , and I cannot decide unanimously to change my country ’s foreign policy , to reduce my chances of being blown up on the way to work .
We employ people to make these judgments for us , imperfectly , collectively , as best they can .
They are politicians , bureaucrats and scientists , not journalists , because journalists are often too eager to produce a frightening story , and sometimes that can come secondary to concerns about accuracy .
In the case of this story on BBP in cosmetics , for example , the Daily Mail , in demanding a ban , seems to have missed one important element of the story : BBP is already banned for use in cosmetics , by the European Union , throughout Europe , after careful consideration , and has been for quite some time now .
The truth is out - cyclists shave their legs to look good .
It 's not to help with massages and it 's definitely not about speed .
An increasing number of otherwise normal Australians are shaving their legs , donning tight lycra ( which leaves little to the imagination ) and clogging up cafe sidewalks every weekend in order to fit into a growing subculture .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) -- Don Imus , the tousled and acerbic radio host whose racial remarks engendered a media storm that triggered a swift upending of his career , is not going away quietly even if the imbroglio has all but disappeared from the national conversation in the wake of the Virginia Tech massacre .
For Imus , who made a career out of operating in the murky space between sophomoric humor and high - brow political talk , there is the little matter of about $ 40 million left on his contract with CBS Radio - whose boss Les Moonves fired the shock jock on April 12 .
CBS ' lawyers contend Imus was fired for cause and not owed the rest of the money .
But Imus has hired one of the nation 's premiere First Amendment attorneys , and the two sides are gearing up for a legal showdown that could turn on how language in his contract that encouraged the radio host to be irreverent and engage in character attacks is interpreted , according to one person who has read the contract .
The language , according to this source , was part of a five - year contract that went into effect in 2006 and that paid Imus close to $ 10 million a year .
It stipulates that Imus be given a warning before being fired for doing what he made a career out of - making off - color jokes .
The source described it as a " dog has one - bite clause . "
A lawsuit could be filed within a month , this person predicted .
A CBS spokesman declined comment , and Imus , through his attorney , also declined an interview .
Bo Dietl , a private investigator and author who is a long - time Imus confidante and was a regular guest on the show , has been making the rounds of the cable talk shows defending his friend and had this to say to Fortune : " I just heard that there is a contract in place , and that he can't be fired without a warning . "
Imus has hired Martin Garbus , a New York - based attorney at the law firm Davis & Gilbert who is widely recognized as one of the country 's most able First Amendment lawyers .
Time Magazine , for one , has called him " legendary , one of the best trial lawyers in the country . "
He 's successfully represented the comedian Lenny Bruce against criminal charges on First Amendment grounds , and the writer Robert Sam Anson in a lawsuit filed by Walt Disney trying to halt the publication of a book critical of the media giant .
But in Imus ' case , his free speech rights are tempered by the fact that he said what he said on the public airwaves - which are subject to Federal Communications Commission regulations about what is appropriate content .
" [ Garbus is ] a First Amendment lawyer who 's argued many important cases , " said Washington , D.C. - based attorney Lynne Bernabei , who has often represented plaintiffs in employment disputes .
" I 'm sure they 're trying to make this a First Amendment case .
But the airwaves are heavily regulated by the FCC .
" In my mind there is a big difference between someone who is under contract and is under FCC regulations and someone who speaks out in town hall .
This is someone in a heavily regulated industry and who used the public airwaves . "
Bernabei also said that any contract stipulations that allow for provocative content on Imus ' show are probably balanced by " something in the contract about appropriate content . "
She said , " I 'm sure CBS has something about conduct - that he can't use profanity and has to abide by FCC regulations . "
So under this argument , the case could turn on whether Imus ' comments - which referred to members of the Rutgers women 's basketball team as " nappy - headed hos " - meets the definition of profanity under FCC guidelines .
The FCC , on its Web site , defines profanity as " including language so grossly offensive to members of the public who actually hear it as to amount to a nuisance . "
In some people 's minds , CBS ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) would have a slam dunk in making that case .
Then there would be the matter of whether or not Imus ever quietly received warnings for previous offensive racial remarks .
And there were several , including once referring to the New York Times African - American sports columnist Bill Rhoden as a " quota hire " and PBS anchor Gwen Ifill , who is black , as a " cleaning lady . "
Meanwhile , Imus plans to retreat to his ranch in New Mexico for the summer before deciding whether to make another go of it on the radio .
Many have speculated he could wind up in the unregulated world of satellite radio , but Dietl , his close friend , thinks he 'll be back on terrestrial radio .
" He 's going to take off the summer , but I think he 'll be back and stronger than ever , " he said .
" I put the following work under your protection .
It contains my opinion upon religion .

" The question before the human race is , whether the God of nature shall govern the world by his own laws , or whether priests and kings shall rule it by fictitious miracles ? " -- John Adams
But , my countrymen , the sole purpose and effect of it [ omitting any religious test in the Constitution ] is to exclude persecution , and to secure to you the important right of religious liberty .
...
But in other parts of the world , it has been , and still is , far different .

And let the history of all nations be searched , from that day to this , and it will appear that the imposing of religious tests hath been the greatest engine of tyranny in the world .
And I rejoice to see so many gentlemen who are now giving in the rights of conscience , in this great and important matter . " -- Reverend Isaac Backus , Feb. 4 , 1788 .
" The government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the Christian Religion " -- Treaty of Tripoli , 1797
" Under the color of religious tests the utmost cruelties have been exercised .
Those in power have generally considered all wisdom centered in themselves , that they alone had a right to dictate to the rest of mankind , and that all opposition to their tenets was profane and impious . " --

The greatest service that could be rendered the Christian peoples would be to convert them to Christianity .

Intelligence Analysts ' Refusal to Go Along With Vice President 's Drumbeat for War Against Iran Has Delayed Release of New National Intelligence Estimate For More Than a Year -- Rice and Gates Also Reportedly Balking
Vice President Dick Cheney places a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier during a Veterans Day ceremony Sunday at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington , Virginia .
Cheney 's increasingly bellicose rhetoric against Iran over its nuclear program in recent weeks is underscoring a bitter battle over a long - delayed National Intelligence Estimate report on Iran , with several analysts from the nation 's spy agencies refusing to go along with the vice president 's assertions that a military strike against Iran in necessary to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons .

SPECIAL REPORT
By Gareth Porter
Inter - Press Service
A long - awaited U.S. National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) on Iran has been held up for more than a year in an effort to force the intelligence community to remove dissenting judgments on the Iranian nuclear program .
The aim is to make the document more supportive of Vice President Dick Cheney 's militarily aggressive views toward Iran , according to accounts provided by participants in the NIE process to two former Central Intelligence Agency officers .
But this pressure on intelligence analysts , apparently instigated by Cheney himself , has not produced a draft estimate without those dissenting views , these sources say , indicating a fierce refusal by the dissenting analysts to buckle to the vice president .
Combined with public statements in recent weeks by Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert Gates that also run counter to Cheney 's hard line , The White House has now apparently decided to release the " unsatisfactory " draft NIE , but without making its key findings public .
[ Rice denied Sunday that the U.S. was bent on war with Iran and renewed an offer of reconciliation talks if the Islamic republic renounces its nuclear drive .
Interviewed on ABC's " This Week , " Rice was pressed on a Senate resolution passed in September that labeled Iran 's Revolutionary Guards a terrorist operation -- a step that critics said had brought war nearer .
[ " Obviously , it can be the case that he ( Bush ) will never take his options off the table , but this particular resolution has nothing to do with that from our point of view , " Rice said , referring to the prospect of military force on Iran .
[ For his part , Defense Secretary Robert Gates , while on a visit to China last week , appealed to Beijing for help in curbing Iran 's nuclear program , arguing that a stable Persian Gulf was in the interests of Beijing 's energy security .
[ " An Iran that is a destabilizing force in the region is not in anyone 's interest , including in China's , " Gates told reporters as he toured Beijing 's Forbidden City .
" If one is interested in long - term energy security , then a stable Persian Gulf , Middle East area is a very high priority . " ]
McConnell Refused to Release NIE Without Consensus on Iran's Nuke Program
An NIE coordinates the judgments of the nation 's 16 intelligence agencies on a specific country or issue .
A former CIA intelligence officer who has asked not to be identified told Inter - Press Service that an official involved in the NIE process says the Iran estimate was ready to be published a year ago , but has been delayed because retired Vice Admiral John Michael " Mike " McConnell , the director of national intelligence , wanted a draft reflecting a consensus on key conclusions -- particularly on Iran 's nuclear program .
There is sharp division in the intelligence community on how much of a threat the Iranian nuclear program poses , according to the intelligence official 's account .
Some analysts who are less independent are willing to give the benefit of the doubt to the alarmist view coming from Cheney 's office , but others have rejected that view .
White House Refused to Accept NIE With Dissenting Views
The draft NIE , first completed a year ago , which had included the dissenting views , was not acceptable to the White House , according to the former intelligence officer .
" They refused to come out with a version that had dissenting views in it , " he says .
As recently as early October , the official involved in the process was said to be unclear about whether a NIE would be circulated and , if so , what it would say .
Former CIA officer Philip Giraldi provided a similar account , based on his own sources in the intelligence community .
He told IPS that intelligence analysts have had to review and rewrite their findings three times , because of pressure from the White House .
" The White House wants a document that it can use as evidence for its Iran policy , " says Giraldi .
Despite pressures on them to change their dissenting conclusions , however , Giraldi says some analysts have refused to go along with conclusions that they believe are not supported by the evidence .
In October 2006 , Giraldi wrote in The American Conservative that the NIE on Iran had already been completed , but that Cheney 's office had objected to its findings on both the Iranian nuclear program and Iran 's role in Iraq .
The draft NIE did not conclude that there was confirming evidence that Iran was arming Shi'ite insurgents in Iraq , according to Giraldi .
Giraldi said the White House had decided to postpone any decision on the internal release of the NIE until after the November 2006 congressional elections .
Was Ex-Intelligence Czar Negroponte Fired Over His Public Statements on Iran ?
Cheney 's desire for a " clean " NIE that could be used to support his aggressive policy toward Iran was apparently a major factor in the replacement of John Negroponte as director of national intelligence last January .
Negroponte , now deputy secretary of state , had angered neoconservatives in the administration by telling the press in April 2006 that the intelligence community believed that it would still be " a number of years off " before Iran would be " likely to have enough fissile material to assemble into or to put into a nuclear weapon , perhaps into the next decade . "
Neoconservatives immediately attacked Negroponte for the statement , which merely reflected the existing NIE on Iran issued in spring 2005 .
Robert Joseph , the undersecretary of state for arms control and an ally of Cheney , contradicted Negroponte the following day .
He suggested that Iran 's nuclear program was nearing the " point of no return " -- an Israeli concept referring to the mastery of industrial - scale uranium enrichment .
Frank Gaffney , a protege of neoconservative heavyweight Richard Perle , complained that Negroponte was " absurdly declaring the Iranian regime to be years away from having nuclear weapons . "
Negroponte Replaced By an Apparent ' Yes Man '
Following the Democrats ' takeover of Congress in January , President Bush announced the nomination of McConnell to be the new director of national intelligence .
McConnell was approached by Cheney himself about accepting the position , according to Newsweek magazine .
McConnell was far more amenable to White House influence than his predecessor .
On February 27 , one week after his confirmation , he told the Senate Armed Services Committee he was " comfortable saying it 's probable " that the alleged export of explosively formed penetrators to Shi'ite insurgents in Iraq was linked to the highest leadership in Iran .
Cheney had been making that charge , but Rice and Gates , as well as Negroponte , have opposed it .
A public event last spring indicated that the White House had ordered a reconsideration of the draft NIE 's conclusion on how many years it would take Iran to produce a nuclear weapon .
The previous Iran estimate completed in the spring of 2005 had estimated it at five to 10 years .
Two weeks after Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced in mid-April that Iran would begin producing nuclear fuel on an industrial scale , the chairman of the National Intelligence Council , Thomas Fingar , said in an interview with National Public Radio that the completion of the NIE on Iran had been delayed while the intelligence community determined whether its judgment on the time frame within which Iran might produce a nuclear weapon needed to be amended .
Fingar said the estimate " might change , " citing " new reporting " from the International Atomic Energy Agency , the United Nations ' nuclear watchdog , as well as " some other new information we have . "
And then he added , " We are serious about reexamining old evidence . "
As With Prewar Intelligence on Iraq , It 's ' Deja Vu' All Over Again -- Or Is It ?
That extraordinary revelation about the NIE process , which was apparently ordered by McConnell , was an unsubtle signal to the intelligence community that the White House was determined to obtain a more alarmist conclusion on the Iranian nuclear program .
A decision announced in late October indicated , however , that Cheney did not get the consensus findings on the nuclear program and Iran 's role in Iraq that he had wanted .
On October 27 , David Shedd , a deputy to McConnell , told a congressional briefing that McConnell had issued a directive making it more difficult to declassify the key judgments of national intelligence estimates .
That reversed a Bush administration practice of releasing summaries of key judgments in NIEs that began when the White House made public the key judgments from the controversial 2002 NIE on Iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction program in July 2003 .
The decision to withhold key judgments on Iran from the public was apparently part of a White House strategy for reducing the potential damage of publishing the estimate with the inclusion of dissenting views .
As of early October , officials involved in the NIE were " throwing their hands up in frustration " over the refusal of the administration to allow the estimate to be released , according to the former intelligence officer .
But the Iran NIE is now expected to be circulated within the administration in late November , says Ray McGovern , a former CIA analyst and the founder of the anti-war group Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity .
The release of the Iran NIE will certainly intensify the bureaucratic political struggle over Iran policy .
If the NIE includes both dissenting views on key issues , a campaign of selective leaking to news media of language from the NIE that supports Cheney 's line on Iran will soon follow , as well as leaks of the dissenting views by his opponents .
Both sides may be anticipating another effort by Cheney to win Bush 's approval of a significant escalation of military pressure on Iran in early 2008 .

Abstract
To most economists , personal grooming is a non-market activity .
The standard view is that time spent in non-market activities is counterproductive as it reduces work effort and job commitment .
But grooming may be different .
Grooming provides an important source of communication about workers , their values and personalities .
There is reason to believe that certain productive personality traits may be inferred on the basis of personal grooming .
In this paper , we use data from the American Time Use survey ’s pooled cross-section 2003 - 2007 to investigate the effect of additional time spent grooming on earnings .
The results show that the effect of grooming on earnings differs significantly by gender and race .
Somers , New York , USA & Atlanta - 20 Jun 2006 : IBM and the Georgia Institute of Technology announced today that their researchers have demonstrated the first silicon - based chip capable of operating at frequencies above 500 GHz -- 500 billion cycles per second -- by cryogenically “ freezing ” the chip to 451 degrees below zero Fahrenheit ( 4.5 Kelvins ) .
Such extremely cold temperatures are found naturally only in outer space , but can be artificially achieved on Earth using ultra-cold materials such as liquid helium .
( Absolute Zero , the coldest possible temperature in nature , occurs at minus 459.67 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
By comparison , 500 GHz is more than 250 times faster than today 's cell phones , which typically operate at approximately 2 GHz .
Computer simulations suggest that the silicon - germanium ( SiGe ) technology used in the chip could ultimately support even higher ( near - TeraHertz – 1,000 GHz ) operational frequencies even at room temperature .
The experiments , conducted jointly by IBM and Georgia Tech researchers , are part of a project to explore the ultimate speed limits of silicon - germanium ( SiGe ) devices , which operate faster at very cold temperatures .
The chips used in the research are from a prototype fourth - generation SiGe technology fabricated by IBM on a 200 - millimeter wafer .
At room temperature , they operated at approximately 350 GHz .
“ For the first time , Georgia Tech and IBM have demonstrated that speeds of half a trillion cycles per second can be achieved in a commercial silicon - based technology , using large wafers and silicon - compatible low - cost manufacturing techniques , ” said John D. Cressler , Byers Professor in Georgia Tech ’s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering , and a researcher in the Georgia Electronic Design Center ( GEDC ) at Georgia Tech .
“ This work redefines the upper bounds of what is possible using silicon - germanium nanotechnology techniques . ”
" This groundbreaking collaborative research by Georgia Tech and IBM redefines the performance limits of silicon - based semiconductors , " said Bernie Meyerson , vice president and chief technologist , IBM Systems and Technology Group .
" IBM is committed to working closely with our academic and industry partners to deliver the insight and innovation that will enable a new generation of high - performance , energy efficient microprocessors . "
SiGe is a process technology in which the electrical properties of silicon , the material underlying virtually all modern microchips , is augmented with germanium to make chips operate more efficiently .
SiGe boosts performance and reduces power consumption in chips that go into cellular phones and other advanced communication devices .
IBM first announced its SiGe technology in 1989 , and later introduced SiGe into the industry 's first standard , high - volume SiGe chips in October 1998 .
Since that time , it has shipped hundreds of millions of SiGe chips .
Ultra -high - frequency silicon - germanium circuits have potential applications in commercial communications systems , defense electronics , space exploration , and remote sensing .
Achieving such extreme speeds in silicon - based technology – which can be manufactured using conventional low - cost techniques – could provide a pathway to high - volume applications .
Until now , only integrated circuits fabricated from more costly “ III - V ” compound semiconductor materials have achieved such extreme levels of transistor performance .
Better understanding the physics of silicon - germanium devices – and ultimately the circuits that can be built from them – will provide important clues to improvements needed in the future .
“ We observe effects in these devices at cryogenic temperatures which potentially make them faster than simple theory would suggest , and may allow us to ultimately make the devices even faster , ” Cressler explained .
“ Understanding the basic physics of these advanced transistors arms us with knowledge that could make the next generation of silicon - based integrated circuits even better . ”
Silicon - germanium technology has been of great interest to the electronics industry because it allows substantial transistor performance improvements to be achieved while using fabrication techniques compatible with standard high - volume silicon - based manufacturing processes .
By introducing germanium into silicon wafers at the atomic scale , engineers can boost dramatically performance while retaining the many advantages of silicon .
In addition to Cressler , the research team included Georgia Tech Ph.D. students Ramkumar Krithivasan and Yuan Lu ; Jae -Sun Rieh of Korea University in Seoul , South Korea ( formerly with IBM ) ; and Marwan Khater , David Ahlgren and Greg Freeman of IBM Microelectronics in East Fishkill , N.Y .
The accomplishment will be reported in the July issue of the journal IEEE Electron Device Letters .
The research has been supported by IBM , NASA , and the GEDC at Georgia Tech .
About a month ago we sent out a survey asking for your thoughts about what the virtual SIGGRAPH 2020 should look like .
Here is a summary of what we learned from the survey .
In case you have n’t been following the progress being made on JavaScript 1.8 here ’s a quick overview of what ’s already landed in the latest Firefox 3 nightlies .
So far , three main features have landed , with a few more to come .
In general , this release will be relatively ‘ light ’ , mostly attempting to bring the current JavaScript implementation closer to the desired JavaScript 2 spec .
Expression Closures
This just landed in trunk and I ’m sure it ’ll tickle those of you who enjoy functional programming .
Effectively , this addition is nothing more than a shorthand for writing simple functions , giving the language something similar to a typical Lambda notation .
For example , look at the Lambda notation that ’s available in a couple languages , in comparision to JavaScript 1.8 .
Python :
lambda x : x * x
Smalltalk :
[ :x | x * x ]
JavaScript 1.8 :
function (x ) x * x
( For reference ) JavaScript 1.7 and older :
function ( x ) { return x * x ; }
I think , probably , my favorite use for this shorthand will be in binding event listeners , like so :
document.addEventListener(" click " , function ( ) false , true ) ;
Or combining this notation with some of the array functions from JavaScript 1.6 :
elems.some( function ( elem ) elem.type == " text " ) ;
This will give you some JS / DOM code that looks downright elegant .
Generator Expressions
This is another one that was just committed to trunk .
It ’s a little bit more involved than the previous addition , as this one encompasses a number of concepts .
Specifically , it requires knowledge of most of the features within JavaScript 1.7 , specifically Iterators , Generators , and Array comprehension .
This particular feature is based off of the generator expressions that exist in Python .
In the ticket tracking this feature , Brendan posted an elegant , functional , Sudoku solver written using the new syntax that this addition affords us .
This demo is based off of a similar one written in Python used to demonstrate its generator expressions .
To better understand what this feature means , lets look at a single line of JavaScript 1.8 code , taken from the Sudoku solver .
dict ( [s , [u for ( u in unitlist ) if ( u.contains ( s ) ) ] ] for ( s in squares ) )
This line relies upon the dict ( ) function , which takes a 2xN sized matrix , and converts it into a key / value pair object .
The code of which can be found here :
function dict ( A ) { let d = {} for ( let e in A ) d[ e [ 0 ] ] = e[ 1 ] return d }
Let ’s go through that line of code , part - by - part , to better understand what exactly is going on .
[u for ( u in unitlist ) if ( u.contains ( s ) ) ]
The first part of the line is an example of array comprehension coming from JavaScript 1.7 .
Specifically , we ’re iterating over ‘ unitlist ’ and building it out into an array of keys ( excluding which keys do n’t contain ‘ s ’ ) .
[s , ... ] for ( s in squares )
The second part of this line is another example of array comprehension .
At first glance , it appears as if it ’s another feature from JavaScript 1.7 , a destructuring assignment , although , that is n’t the case .
A normal destructuring assignment only occurs when you ’re assigning a value , however in this situation we ’re just creating an array value using array comprehension .
These new 2 - unit arrays will then plug back into the dict function .
dict ( [s , ...] for ( s in squares ) )
This is where the magic happens .
In JavaScript 1.7 we could ’ve called the dict ( ) function like so :
dict ( [ [s , ...] for ( s in squares ) ] )
Note the extra , explicit , use of array comprehension .
The issue with that extra comprehension is that it has to be completely run when it ’s first encountered , in order to build out the full array ( which will then be turned into a ‘ dictionary ’ ) .
However , the lack of extra [… ] is what makes this a generator expression .
That makes that line in JavaScript 1.8 equivalent to the following in JavaScript 1.7 :
dict ( ( function ( ) { for ( s in squares ) yield [ s , ... ] ; } ) ( ) )
As you ’ll see , it the generator expression lazy - builds the resulting array , handling it as a generator – meaning that the specific values wo n’t have to be generated until they are explicitly needed by the dict ( ) function ( resulting in less loops and better overall performance ) .
Here ’s another example of a generator expression
// Create a generator that loops over an object values function val_iter ( obj ) { return ( obj [ x ] for ( x in obj ) ) ; } //
Iterate through an objects keys for ( let key in obj ) { ... } //
Iterate through an objects values for ( let value in val_iter ( obj ) ) { ... }
Of course , the val_iter ( ) function could be built with JavaScript 1.7 right now , using yield :
function val_iter ( obj ) { for ( let x in obj ) yield obj[ x ] ; }
Most likely , though , generator expressions will see the most use in memory / cpu hungry code ( like the Sudoku solver ) , since solutions will now be able to get results when they need them , as opposed to loading them all up front .

Soldier once warned family : Investigate if I die David Edwards and Nick Juliano

Print This Email This Ciara Durkin warned her family before returning to Afghanistan , " If anything happens to me , you guys make sure it gets investigated . "
What seemed a joke at the time could have been eerily prescient as Durkin , a National Guard specialist , was found dead , shot once in the head , within the fortified walls of Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan .
The Pentagon is releasing no details aside from confirmation that Durkin's was a " non-combat " death .
" We just want full disclosure , " Durkin 's sister Deirdre said on CBS 's Early Show Thursday .
Now Durkin 's family is demanding an independent investigation and has enlisted the help of Sens.
John Kerry and Edward Kennedy , who represent their home state of Massachusetts .
Although Durkin was gay , her family does not believe her death had anything to do with that .
But Durkin , who worked in a finance office , told her family that she had uncovered some information that would upset other military officials .
" She was in the finance unit and she said , ' I discovered some things I dont like and I made some enemies because of it . '
Then she said , in her light - hearted way , ' If anything happens to me , you guys make sure it gets investigated , ' " Durkin 's older sister , Fiona Canavan , told The Patriot Ledger .
" But at the time we thought it was said more as a joke . "
Durkin died last Friday of a single gun-shot wound , but the Army has not said whether a weapon was found near her body .
The Defense Department says it is investigating the incident , according to reports .
The family told Television interviewers that they did n't believe Durkin killed herself because she seemed upbeat on a recent trip home .
Only hours before her death , Durkin left her brother a cheerful voicemail and sang happy birthday to him , the family told ABC News .
 ( The military ) is definitely holding back ,  Canavan told the Boston Herald .
 As to why we can only speculate . 

U.S. antimissile launch may provoke counterattack - army chief
RIA Novosti
15/12/2007 18:33
( Adds details , quotes , background after para .

MOSCOW , December 15 ( RIA Novosti ) - A possible U.S. launch of an interceptor missile from Central Europe may provoke a counterattack by intercontinental ballistic missiles , Russia 's top military commander said .
" If we suppose that Iran wants to strike the United States , than interceptor missiles , which would be launched from Poland , will fly towards Russia , " the Chief of the Russian General Staff , Gen .
Yury Baluyevsky said , adding that the shape of interceptor missiles and their flight trajectory are very similar with IBMs .
Washington wants to place a radar in the Czech Republic and 10 missile interceptors in Poland , purportedly to counter a missile threat from Iran and other " rogue " states .
Moscow has responded angrily to the plans , saying the European shield would destroy the strategic balance of forces and threaten Russia 's national interests .
The top Russian military official said Russia operates automated missile warning systems , which could respond automatically in case the U.S. fires an antimissile across Russia against a possible ballistic missile form Iran .
He added that the U.S. also still keeps high on the agenda an issue of a possible global confrontation with Russia .
" The issue of , to put it mildly , a confrontation with Russia , including a direct confrontation , is unfortunately still regarded by my counterparts from the Pentagon as relevant , " he said adding that the U.S. missile shield plans in Central Europe are aimed to change the current security system in Europe and not against possible strikes from " rogue states . "
He said the formation of the Third Site in Poland and the Czech Republic is a destabilizing factor in Europe and Russia will do everything possible to prevent a decrease in its national defense capability .
" Depending on the situation we [ Russia ] plan to take adequate and asymmetrical measures aimed to prevent a drop in national defense capabilities , " Baluyevsky said adding that the U.S. proposals on the missile shield are unacceptable for Russia .
" We believe that Russia 's opinion should be heard and taken into account concerning such important issue as the missile shield in Europe , " he said .
" We speak for the dialogue , but under the condition that the problem will not be complicated by unilateral steps in this sphere . "
Russia has offered the U.S. use of radar stations at Gabala in Azerbaijan , and Armavir in south Russia , as alternatives to missile shield deployment in Central Europe .
Washington said , though , it could use these radars only as additional components of the European shield .
Speaking about the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty , Baluyevsky said that European states have turned the treaty into a tool of political pressure .
" Western countries have deliberately turned a regime of arms control into a tool for achieving political aims , " he said .
The law to freeze Russia 's participation in the CFE treaty was unanimously approved by parliament and signed on November 30 by President Vladimir Putin .
Russia 's unilateral moratorium came into force immediately after midnight on Wednesday .
Moscow considers the original CFE treaty , signed in December 1990 by 16 NATO countries and six Warsaw Pact members , to be discriminatory and outdated since it does not reflect the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact , the breakup of the Soviet Union , or recent NATO expansion .
Baluyevsky said that after the moratorium came into force Russia has the full right to move its military units across the country the way it prefers , but the country does not plan to increase weapons stock .
NATO said in a statement Wednesday that it regretted Russia 's decision to impose a moratorium on the arms reductions treaty , which the West regards as a cornerstone of Euro - Atlantic security , and urged Moscow to reverse its decision .
Russia has urged NATO countries to ratify the adapted version of the treaty , signed on November 19 , 1999 and so far ratified only by Russia , Ukraine , Belarus and Kazakhstan .
Over time , many , many readers have asked me how I keep myself organized and find the time to maintain The Simple Dollar , work a full time job , handle a family life that involves two kids in diapers , and have any free time at all for other pursuits including some degree of intellectual curiosity .
It ’s not easy , and the only way it ’s worked at all is by putting together some basic organization techniques that keep things in focus .
So , without further ado , here are the basic tenets of how I manage all of this stuff and keep things moving forward , with a lot of visual help along the way .
If you have any questions , please ask them in the comments , because if you ’re thinking of a question , chances are someone else is too and it makes sense to ask there and have my responses there , too .
The Most Important Thing
The absolute most important thing in my life in terms of keeping my thoughts organized and not losing valuable ideas is this :
I keep a very simple Mead pocket notebook and a pen in my pocket at all times ( hence the beat up look ) .
Wherever I ’m at , if an idea pops into my head , I jot it down in this notebook .
I ’ve even pulled off the road to do this and I ’ve also been known to pull this out during conversations with others if they cause me to think about something .
What goes in the notebook ?
Anything and everything : tasks I need to do , words I want to look up , ideas I want to research or follow up on ; all of these things are fair game .
I usually write one distinct idea per page so that I can make “ sub - notes ” underneath it .
Let ’s look at a couple of examples from the notebook to see what I mean .
When I open the notebook , the first item I find is a note reminding me to “ get lime remover for hot water heater , ” and under that I jotted “ ebay ?
plumbing supply ? ”
This was the result of a conversation with a person who installs hot water heaters for a living .
I described to this person that my hot water heater was making a “ percolating ” sound , much like a coffee pot , and he immediately suggested that I try running lime remover through it .
I pulled out my notebook , jotted that down , and asked him where to get it – obviously , he said to try eBay or a plumbing supply store .
This is a note reminding me to follow up on a pont of intellectual curiosity .
Here , I read an article from the September 2007 issue of The Atlantic about Karl Rove and I found that he was politically inspired by the presidency of William McKinley and that of McKinley ’s advisor , Mark Hanna .
I wanted to follow up on this to learn more about McKinley and Hanna , a pair I had only brushed upon once a long time ago .
On an average day , I ’ll make ten or so notes like these .
They ’ll vary as much as these two do , from areas of intellectual curiosity to tasks that need to be completed .
However , just making notes does n’t mean that I do anything about them .
I follow up on these notes once a day by putting them all in my inbox , then processing it .
The “ Inbox ”
Here ’s a look at my inbox at the moment :
It consists of a folder ( which contains several things I need to review that you can just see peeking out ) , two envelopes , a black pamphlet between the envelopes , and two pieces of paper torn out from the notebook .
This is actually rather thin for my inbox – often , it has as many as thirty things in it .
Note that I do n’t actually have a plastic or metal inbox – it struck me as an unnecessary expense , which I suppose reveals my frugal nature a bit .
My goal at the end of each day is to have that inbox empty .
I usually do this by doing an inbox “ processing ” after work each night .
I go through everything in it and do one of three things with it :
If it takes less than five minutes , I do it immediately .
If something afterwards needs to be filed , I just put it in my filing box at the front of the box , then every once in a while I file this stuff away .
This actually winds up being the majority of the stuff in my inbox .
If it ’s a longer task , I try to break it down into smaller pieces and try to do the first piece of it .
I usually wind up sketching out at least the first few steps of a longer task in another notebook ( that you ’ll see in a minute ) and then each day I ’ll check each of these longer tasks and make sure I ’m moving forward with them in some fashion .
This keeps a lot of moderately complex tasks urgent for me .
If it ’s food for thought ( like a book or a magazine or a note to research something ) , I put it off to the side in a “ thinking ” pile to deal with later on .
This “ thinking ” pile can get quite large , but I really enjoy going through it when I have an hour or two to burn , as it provides almost all of my creative ideas .
If I get into a routine of trusting my inbox , then I do n’t really have to remember much at all and can instead focus on just getting through the stuff I need to do , and that ’s a giant relief .
Organizing Documents
As I mentioned above , I file stuff somewhat regularly .
I do this with a big pile of file folders and a pair of simple cardboard filing boxes like this :
One of these boxes is bill statements , receipts , and tax documents for the last seven years ; the other one is instruction manuals and other materials .
I plan on moving to an electronic filing system in the future when I get a true workstation set up , but for now the paper filing works fine .
For the most part , I just stack stuff that needs to be filed inside the box , then file it into the folders about once every month or two .
This takes care of all of the paperwork miscellany that would otherwise be floating around .
The Portable Office , or “ Go Bag ”
Naturally , I like the ability to take the stuff that I need and just go wherever I need to be , whether it ’s my actual office at home , the dining room table , a coffee shop , the kitchen counter at my parents ’ house late in the evening , or wherever else .
To do that , here ’s my “ go bag . ”
Yet again , I reveal my frugal tendencies : this is a backpack I ’ve had for twelve years , and it was originally picked up used at a garage sale .
There ’s an ink stain on the bottom that I picked up from an exploded pen circa 1999 .
It ’s also been sewn back together at least twice .
It does the job I need and I ’m not desiring to impress anyone , so I ’ll likely be using it until it falls apart .
Here ’s what I keep inside of it :
From left to right ( roughly ) : a baggie containing several essential cables , a small number of books ( with the recently reviewed The Paradox of Choice , a copy of What Color is Your Parachute ? 2008 under that ) , a Dell Inspiron 1505 laptop , a Nintendo DS ( a few games are also in that baggie with the cables ) , an iPod Nano , a power supply , a card reader that can read about any small memory card under the sun , a memory stick , and a Moleskine reporter ’s notebook .
Not pictured but always present in the bag are a file folder ( seen in my inbox picture and which usually contains a few documents plus at least some of the contents of my inbox ) , a few pens ( I was actually out of them at the time I took the picture ) , and the digital camera with which the picture was taken .
The reporter ’s notebook , though , is much more interesting – it ’s my “ project ” book .
Each page in that notebook equates to a project that I ’m working on .
That page is a list of the specific steps that need to be done to get the project done .
Whenever I finish one , I cross off that step in the notebook , and I usually try to keep at least a couple steps into the future written down for each project so I can see where I ’m headed .
For example , if I write a series for The Simple Dollar , a project would likely consist of a list of the basic concept for each post in the series , and I ’d cross them off as they were fleshed out or else discarded for some reason .
This keeps me on the ball for every long term project I ’m working on , breaking them down neatly for me into nice , discrete steps .
Keeping a Schedule and Reminders of Important Events
As I ’ve mentioned in the past , I use Mozilla Sunbird as my primary schedule keeper .
Within it , I basically keep track of every possible timed event in my life , from the usual appointments and birthdays and anniversaries to things like infrequent home maintenance tasks .
The tasks listed here are basically an extension of my inbox – I use the automatically generated “ to do ” lists that Sunbird can spit out for you to see the things that I need to be doing on any given day .
Let me walk you through an example of how it works .
Let ’s say I ’m out and about and I hear about a blogger meetup in Des Moines on a Friday that I happen to be available .
I jot this info down in my pocket notebook and , when I get home , I toss it in my paper inbox and start processing .
When I get to that item , I go ahead and fire up Sunbird and enter that event so I can then crumple up the sheet .
After I fire up Sunbird , I notice that it ’s been three months since I changed my air handling filter in the house , so I enter the event , then run downstairs and change the filter .
If there ’s more than one scheduled event in a day , I usually print off a copy of the day ’s schedule so that I have it with me and do n’t have to fire up my laptop to check on things or to make any last minute changes – I just edit with a pen and keep going .
Idea Organization on my Computer
Obviously , when I ’m busy at my computer , the last thing I want to do when I have an idea or a task is stop , pull out my pocket notebook , and jot something down .
Even when it ’s sitting on the desk next to me , I still do n’t usually want to stop and jot down that idea .
Yet I want to also be able to easily retrieve any ideas and notes and tasks I have on my computer from any computer , and for that exact purpose , I use Google Notebook .
Google Notebook is an online application that basically lets you jot down notes to save for later .
These notes can be your thoughts , pieces of web pages , images , or whatever you wish , which is nice , but it ’s not really the reason I use it .
This is why I use it :
This is what my default web browsing window looks like in Mozilla Firefox , my browser of choice .
Notice that little spot at the bottom that I ’ve highlighted that says “ Open Notebook ” ?
No matter what website I ’m at , all I have to do is click on that ( or press Alt - N on my keyboard ) and the following opens up :
This little window pops up .
Within it , I can just jot down any idea I have in a very free - form fashion .
I can also separate them into different “ notebooks ” to keep them somewhat organized .
I just click where I want to write and just jot down the thought , and if I want to , I can drag in pieces of web pages that I ’m on as well .
I basically treat this as an extension of my inbox , processing it each night .
What ’s most useful about this is that I have this plugin installed on every computer I use regularly , plus I can access the notebook from any web - accessible computer .
Another absolutely vital piece of organization for me is Remember the Milk , a website I ’ve written fondly about in the past .
Remember the Milk is basically a very convenient list maker ; for example , you can use it to make grocery shopping lists or Christmas gift lists .
Why would one bother to use this for a grocery list , you might ask ?
Let me paint you a picture .
Throughout the week , we do jot down our grocery list using a piece of paper on the fridge and I sometimes also note ingredients in Google Notebook for things I ’d like to try making .
My wife and I will go over this , just to make sure we have n’t forgotten anything , and I ’ll make the “ master list ” with Remember the Milk , which seems pretty mundane , right ?
Well , check this out :
If you visit m.rememberthemilk.com , you can access your shopping list from any web - accessible cell phone , like mine is .
So , when I get to the store , I just log onto the site on my way into the store and there ’s my list .
What ’s special about that ?
Let ’s say my wife thinks of a recipe she wants to try after I ’ve left .
She just logs on , adds the items to the list , and I have the complete , correct list when I get to the store .
A similar logic applies for Christmas gifts , or a list of errands to run , or pretty much anything else you can imagine from a checklist .
Dealing With Email
One last important aspect of my personal organization is email .
For this , I follow three simple rules .
First , do n’t close the email program without emptying the email inbox .
This means deleting the junk , reading each message , and either dealing with it now or adding it to Google Notebook .
I empty the inbox , then close the email program and do n’t open it again all day .
I usually only do email twice a day at most unless I have five or ten minutes of idle time that I can use to shorten my email session later in the day or tomorrow morning .
One quick thing I do that helps with this is that I use the Quicktext extension for Mozilla Thunderbird ( my preferred email program ; again , both are free ) .
This plugin lets me respond to most of the common messages I get very quickly – I have nine of my most common responses pre-written with fields that automatically fill in names , and so I just hit Ctrl - R to reply , then Alt - 0 ( or any other number ) to insert a message automatically .
This does most of the email response work for me .
Second , do n’t save it unless you need it for reference .
If you ’ll need the message for reference in the future , save it .
Otherwise , delete it .
Some people insist on saving every email , then they can’t actually find the useful items amid the thousands of saved messages that really do n’t mean a thing .
Unless you ’ll need it again in the future , delete it now .
Third , if the amount of mail is too overwhelming , delete it all .
If the message is actually important , the person will contact you again .
If it ’s not , well , why bother reading it to begin with ?
I usually use this approach when I return from a vacation from email – I just wipe all of it out if I open up my email program and feel utterly overwhelmed .
Do You Want To Know More ?
In the end , there ’s really only two principles behind everything : do n’t lose an idea , but do n’t get overwhelmed , either .
Everything else is just a specific implementation of one of those two ideas or a way to resolve them when they conflict with each other .
If you want to track down some of the ideas that contribute to this philosophy , here goes .
First ( and most obvious ) is the book Getting Things Done by David Allen .
It ’s been written about over and over again online , but that ’s because it ’s really useful .
However , for most people it ’s like trying to shoot an elephant gun to kill a gnat .
Just read the book and pull out only the pieces that you need for your own life .
If you ’re looking for more , I compiled a list of
great personal productivity books a while back – and they ’re roughly ordered in their level of usefulness .
If you read those and still want more , here are three excellent online resources :
Inbox Zero by Merlin Mann at 43 folders , explaining in detail the value of emptying your email inbox .
Zen to Done by Leo Babauta at zen habits , which focuses mostly on mental strategies to get things done .
The Hipster PDA , again by Merlin Mann at 43 folders , which explains in a somewhat humorous tone the value of keeping something in your pocket to jot stuff down on .
At night , the hotel bars were crammed with people celebrating the Bush victory .
Amid the laughter and the toasts was triumphalism at the fact that the Democratic Party was in despair , a battered and beaten party that had lost not just the presidential election but seats in both houses of Congress .
At a small gathering of senior Democratic Party officials a day before the inauguration , all the talk was of hopelessness and of the party 's defeat at the hands of this most despised and divisive of presidents .
The next day must have been unbearable for them , as Bush took the oath of office in the flag - draped square in front of the Capitol , his inaugural speech full of soaring rhetoric about American exceptionalism and the great mission he had set for the country to spread democracy around the world .
It must have been unbearable also when the inaugural balls got under way that night and George and Laura Bush moved from one ballroom to another to be cheered and exalted as they did a clumsy two - step to the strains of some corny American show tune .
The celebrations stretched into the night and the streets were full of young men and women still high on champagne and victory , and it was hard to believe that America was at war in Iraq , that 150,000 US troops were there fighting that war and dying in ever - increasing numbers .
As they celebrated , those Republican wannabes , there was a strange and puzzling disconnect between them and what was happening in Iraq .
America was at war and yet most Americans were untouched , the coffins of the dead brought home in secret , the bodies buried quietly in their home towns or at Arlington National Cemetery .
Was that the President 's great political achievement ?
Karl Rove , his political svengali , proclaimed that the Bush victory , narrow as it was - the narrowest for any second - term president - would mean that the Republicans were the natural party of government , destined to be in power for a generation or more .
And the Democrats , demoralised and divided , leaderless and bitter , seemed to believe this hubristic nonsense , just as Bush believed it and the conservative evangelical base of the Republican Party believed it , the godless liberals having been crushed and consigned to the political wilderness .
Of course the Rove triumphalism was nonsense , though it is hard to say when it became clear that the war in Iraq and its aftermath had destroyed the Bush presidency , when the disconnect between the war and the lives led by most Americans had disappeared .
When did it become clear that the vast majority of Americans could not wait to see the back of Bush and all the President 's men and women ?
Perhaps it was late last October , in Lynchburg , central Virginia , a lovely southern town of graceful mansions with wide porches and white - columned verandahs surrounded by startlingly deep green manicured lawns .
Lynchburg is a town of churches , a college town of 70,000 people , home of the Liberty University , the Baptist college run by the late televangelist Jerry Falwell , the fundamentalist preacher who founded the Moral Majority in 1979 and who died two weeks ago .
The Moral Majority had spawned dozens of conservative Christian political activist groups that coalesced into the conservative Christian evangelical political movement in the 1980s and 1990s .
This movement become the base of the Republican Party .
Its standard - bearer in the 2000 presidential election was the born - again Bush , an undistinguished governor of Texas from a distinguished political family of East Coast Republican blue bloods .
Bush was a sort of faux southerner who had found God in his 40s after a life characterised by listlessness .
We had come to Lynchburg for an election rally for James Webb , the Democrat candidate for the Virginia Senate seat , which the Republicans , just three months previously , did not consider at risk given that George Allen , who held it , was a hero of the religious right and their great hope for the 2008 presidential race .
Most of the audience looked like they had just strolled off the lovely wooden verandahs of their imposing homes to hear what he had to say , this native son of southern Virginia , a part of America that Webb had once described with pride as redneck country .
They had come to hear this warrior from a family of warriors , this celebrated novelist and war hero whose son was serving in Iraq even though his father was bitterly opposed to the war , this man who had served as secretary of the navy during the Reagan administration , this man who had once considered himself a conservative and a Reagan protege .
Over in the corner of the ballroom , dressed in his World War II army veteran 's bomber jacket and cap covered in gold badges , sat 83 - year - old Fitzgerald Morton , who said he no longer supported Bush because he had sent the country into a war that it did not need to fight , and because Bush had done so because he knew nothing about what war was really like .
" Those fellas , Bush and Cheney and Rumsfeld , ai n't never been to war , " he said .
" They ain't seen what I seen .
Jim Webb has been to war .
He 's the right man for Virginia and for America .
The country needs him . "
Later , after Webb , an intense and quietly spoken man with fierce eyes , had arrived at the ballroom and moved rather awkwardly through the crowd , he approached Morton .
The two embraced , tentatively but with genuine affection .
When Webb spoke , he looked down every now and then to the battered light brown boots he was wearing with his dark suit , combat boots his son had sent him from Iraq , and then up at Morton .
Webb talked about his family 's warrior history , his time as a combat commander in Vietnam and then about his belief that the Iraq war was a futile and reckless exercise launched by a President who , he implied , knew nothing about war .
There was a sort of electric silence in the ballroom , when everyone there , including Webb , knew that the midterm elections would be a disaster for the Republicans and that the result would signal the end of the Bush ascendancy .
A few hours later , in a shabby conference room in a motel just off the highway leading into Lynchburg , George Allen was the guest speaker at a rally organised by the Virginia Family Foundation , which was running a campaign for a change in the state constitution that would ban gay marriage .
There were perhaps 150 people in the room , a gathering of " values " Republicans , evangelical Christians all , a representative group of the Republican Party 's base that claimed it had delivered Bush the 2004 presidential election by garnering the conservative Christian vote in key states .
At the back of the room stood a wedding cake which , after the speeches , would be shared among the faithful .
Allen turned out to be everything that Webb was not : a smooth - talking baby kisser , a gladhander , all smiles and bonhomie , dressed in a smart blue suit and shiny black cowboy boots , a favourite of the Republican Party nationally , a man destined for the presidency but whose eyes were not fierce like Webb 's but fearful , even as he laughed and joked , for he knew that the polls , which showed that his support was fast eroding , were probably right and that he was doomed .
He was .
Webb won the seat and the hapless , hopeless Democrats of that inauguration day less than two years before won control of both houses of Congress .
Bush looked like the result had aged him by a decade or more .
It was as if the defeat had diminished him physically as well as politically .
Many Americans had once considered him to be a straight - talking , if not intellectually brilliant , man who was into action rather than self - examination , an antidote to Bill Clinton 's showy brilliance and charisma and compromised personal morality .
Now most Americans wanted to see the back of Bush .
It was not just the fiasco of the Iraq war and the incompetence of the Administration 's handling of the postwar occupation that was responsible for this .
In November 2005 , a year after Bush won re-election , I did a trip across the country - from the East Coast to the old industrial heartland in Michigan where , in Detroit , the rundown and emptying city centre was a symbol of the decline of the once mighty US car industry , and on through Kansas to Colorado and Arizona .
America felt like an unhappy and pessimistic place .
And there was little love for Bush , out there in the heartland where , it seemed , people were in the grip of nostalgia for a time when America was a simpler and happier place , where American values - Christian values - ruled , a time that had never existed but that George Bush had promised to re-create .
This sense of a lost America was everywhere , from the small towns of Kansas where the modest timber houses along the tidy tree - lined streets had US flags flying on lovingly tended lawns and where every few houses there was a handwritten sign fixed to the front door welcoming back a son or daughter from Iraq , to Tombstone , Arizona , that legendary Wild West town near the Mexican border with its fake Wild West shopfronts and ageing fake cowboys and cowgirls wearing fake guns and playing out a western fantasy for the steadily declining number of tourists who visit in search of their childhood cowboy dreams .
Even in Colorado Springs , home of good soldiers of Focus on the Family , perhaps the most powerful Christian organisation in the country , there was disappointment with Bush , who had promised so much - an amendment to the constitution that would ban gay marriage , the promotion of a " culture of life " that would lead to an end to legal abortions , for a start - and had delivered so little .
In its imposing headquarters at the base of the snow - covered Rocky Mountains , hundreds of young men and women , many of them graduates of Christian universities , were committed to the task of remaking America as a Christian republic .
They were polite and welcoming of strangers - even journalists - and they had about them the aura of certainty that comes from unquestioning faith .
They were pre-Enlightenment nostalgists , these young men and women , some 80 million , all of whom say they have had a personal encounter with God .
They share their faith and their fears .
It was Rove 's great achievement to convince these people that Bush shared their faith and their fears .
America is too big and too diverse , too full of paradoxes and contradictions , for easy generalisations .
But perhaps in a republic in which the pursuit of happiness was written into the Declaration of Independence , there has always been this nostalgia for a non-existent and better America .
Travelling around the country , the contradictions and paradoxes were vivid and you felt , in the words of the poet and songwriter Leonard Cohen , that America really was " the cradle of the best and of the worst " .
The worst was there for the world to see when New Orleans drowned in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in late August 2005 .
The suffering of the city 's poor and mostly black population - abandoned in their flooded houses , their dead floating unnamed and unrecognised in the toxic floodwaters , with thousands of people crammed into a football stadium and a convention centre without food or water ; old and sick , some of them , mothers with babies and small children - was all played out in endless hours of television coverage .
It horrified and shamed Americans .
And what horrified them , too , was that Bush stayed on holiday at his ranch in Texas , and the man whom he had appointed to run the national emergency organisation , a crony who had previously run a horse show , worried about the clothes he should wear in television interviews during which he displayed a sort of grumpy bewilderment about what was happening in New Orleans .
It was the drowning of that city rather than the growing fiasco in Iraq that marked middle America 's disillusionment with Bush .
Katrina and its aftermath convinced a majority of Americans that Bush was incompetent .
They concluded that an incompetent president , one who had appointed cronies totally unqualified for the jobs he had given them , was fighting a war that he had no idea how to win .
Less than a year after all those triumphal celebrations in January 2005 , most Americans wanted to see the back of George Bush .
A year later , when the Republicans were handed a stunning defeat in the midterm elections , the Bush era was over and so was the era of unchallenged conservative dominance of US politics .
The new era , no matter who moves into the White House in January 2009 , started in February when Barack Obama , a 45 - year - old black senator from Illinois whose personal narrative - the son of a white woman from Kansas and a black man from Kenya - so thrills Americans who want to get beyond the country 's blighted and horrifying racial history , stood in front of the old state house in Springfield and told thousands of deliriously excited supporters that he was a candidate for the Democratic Party 's presidential nomination .
Hillary Clinton had already announced her bid for the nomination , and if she succeeds it will be an historic victory .
She is the first woman to have a real chance of becoming president .
But Obama was offering something that she could not offer , for Clinton was really part of the political establishment .
Obama was offering what he described as a new politics , one that buried the old politics of the baby - boomer generation , a politics of renewal and hope .
Of course , this can sound corny and cliched , so full of that special brand of American sentimentality that can be very hard to take .
But Obama embodies that promise of a renewed America , and this is the secret to his appeal .
He might not win the nomination , but for the next eight months or so , leading to the primaries in January , he will profoundly shape the campaign .
Obama offers Americans what Reagan once described as the chance for a new " morning in America " .
As for the Republicans , who could have believed even a year ago that the clear favourite for the party 's nomination would be a 62 - year - old former mayor of New York - that centre of liberal godlessness - with a messy private life , who favours gun control , gay rights and is pro-choice on abortion ?
Rudy Giuliani , in the end , may not win the Republican Party 's nomination because he is unacceptable to its conservative Christian evangelical base , but the mere fact that he is favoured by so many Republican voters suggests that the political influence of those ageing Christian leaders is on the wane .
In the American pursuit of happiness , change and renewal are the great constants .
Americans are always on the move , from one city to another , from the north to the south and over centuries , from the east to the west , chasing dreams and opportunities .
It can feel like a country full of fantasists .
Is that the basis of the country 's energy and its resilience ?
To this observer , Washington has felt like the centre of the world , which in a sense it is , of course , a great imperial capital of the superpower that for good and ill , no matter who is in the White House in January 2009 , will in large part shape the world 's future .
The so - called American century , which began after World War I , is far from over .
Michael Gawenda 's book , American Notebook ( Melbourne University Publishing ) , will be published in early August .
Top 24 Tips for Making Your Self Confidence Soar
What would you like to improve about yourself ?
Although we may not want to admit it publicly I think a lot of us feel like we could use an improvement in self confidence .
Fortunately there are better advice out there than the often exclaimed â€ œJust be more confident , man ! â€ or â€ œHave another beer !â€ .
There are actually quite a few practical tips you can use to raise your self confidence .
Here are 24 of them .
As usual , with these tip - lists , donâ€™t try it all at once .
Just try a few suggestions and see which ones work best for you .
Some of them youâ€™ll need to practise a bit before they start to pay off .
Itâ€™s like playing the guitar or soccer , it might not work too well the first or second time you try it .
And keep in mind that you have a choice .
You can choose if you want to raise or lower your self confidence .
Many of these suggestions can only boost your confidence temporarily .
But this can allow you to do something you may not have been able to do before .
And as you do it you build a deeper confidence in yourself .
And collect concrete proof that you can actually do and achieve a lot of things .
1 . Ask yourself : Whatâ€™s the worst that could happen ?
Itâ€™s easy to get lost in a vague fear – or very improbable scenarios – of what might happen if you go through with something .
When you really ask yourself what the worst thing that could happen you get a clearer picture , a bit of fear vanishes and you discover that the potential consequences are seldom as frightening as you first thought .
By doing this you define the potential consequences and also discover that whatever the might happen you can manage and recover from it .
2 . Use uplifting music .
A classic .
Use inspiring and motivating music to pump up yourself before leaving for a night out , before a big test or meeting , before anything that might make your confidence unstable .
This works pretty well as a temporary state - booster .
3 . Try something new .
When you break out of your comfort zone and try something you havenâ€™t before you not only challenge yourself .
You expand your own limitations and your confidence in your own abilities , in how many things you can actually do .
By trying something new on a continual basis you can also lessen your fears and live a life with less barriers and limitations .
4 . Make a plan to do something .
Then follow through .
This is probably one of the most important and effective ways to building lasting confidence .
When you decide to do something and donâ€™t back down but go through with it you get proof of your â€ “ often underestimated â€ “ capabilities and your confidence in yourself soars .

5. Use Guided Meditation .
Iâ€™ve already written a bit about guided meditations and their positive effect in One Very Simple Way to Feel Relaxed for 24 Hours and How to Move Beyond Being a Self - Help Junkie .
I find that guided mediations such as Paraliminals are an excellent way to break out of negative emotional states and ease into more positive ones .
For feeling more confident for a few days I recommend trying the two Paraliminals called Self - Esteem Supercharger and Talking to Win .
They are sold by The Learning Company for $ 29.95 each and there is a 30 day money back guarantee .
If you want to try a free guided mediation right now have a look at the One Very Simple Way to Feel Relaxed for 24 Hours article .
6. Exercise .
This one definitely makes an impact on my self confidence .
Regular exercise improves your energy levels and produces various chemicals – for example testosterone and endorphins – that put you in a more positive state .
This seems to often almost automatically improve your confidence and outlook on life compared to if you spend your time on the couch , eating Pringles and watching TV .
Plus , getting in shape and looking better can be a powerful confidence - booster .
7 . Face a fear .
This is not an easy one .
But the reward is big .
If you face a fear then your confidence takes about ten steps up .
And for every time you face a fear you can slowly start to discover that the classic quote â€ œThere is nothing to fear but fear itselfâ€ was not just another empty clichÃ© .
For tips overcoming your fears check out 5 Life - Changing Keys to Overcoming Your Fear .
8. Create something .
Everyone is a creative person .
But after childhood and the teenage years this is sometimes forgotten .
Rediscovering your creativity is a good way to improve your confidence in yourself .
Creating something is a wonderful but not always easy experience .
But when youâ€ ™re done you not only feel good about yourself .
Sometimes you discover new , previously unknown parts of yourself .
Being creative is good a way to get to know yourself and your hidden capabilities .
9 . Fake it til you make it .
One way to break out of your own self - imposed limitations , take a step out of your comfort zone and build confidence is to play a part .
This might sound like it couldnâ€™t work .
Like you are just making things up and lying to yourself .
Well , that might be the case .
But it still works .
If you donâ€™t feel confident , fake it and play the part of how you would think and behave if you were confident .
Soon youâ€™ll really start to feel confident .
The part becomes real .
10 .
Use your environment .
One effective way to change yourself is to change your environment to match the person you want to become .
If you want to become more confident read autobiographies / watch documentaries of confident people , change your music from depressing songs to confident and positive ones and try to find confident people to hang out with .
You can read more about this topic in Change Your Environment to Change Yourself .
11 . Use your imagination .
Your mind is a great instrument .
By learning to use your imagination in a positive way you can improve your confidence .
One way is to use visualization .
LetÂ´s say to you have an important meeting coming up .
Visualize how great the events will unfold – see and hear it – and also how great will you feel at this meeting .
See yourself smiling , being positive , open and having a great time .
See the excellent outcome in your mind .
Then release by visualizing that it has already happened , that the meeting is over with the desired result .
This is surprisingly effective and will get you into a great and relaxed mood before even stepping into the first , second or twentieth meeting .
If you are having trouble seeing yourself as confident then imitate someone else .
Find a confident person â€ “ perhaps an athlete , perhaps a movie star , perhaps a relative – and copy him / her .
See how / she walks , talks , moves and carries him / herself .
Then just imitate that behavior in your visualization .
12 . Use your body .
If you start fidgeting with your leg youâ€™ll soon start to feel nervous or anxious .
If you start to walk slower youâ€™ll soon start to feel more relaxed .
To feel more confident , use your body in more confident way .
Walk , sit , stand and move in a more confident way .
If you donâ€™t know how , imitate as described in the previous tip .
Copy how confident people in your surroundings , on the TV or at the movies use their bodies .
13 . Awash yourself in positive memories .
Itâ€™s a common habit to let previous failures and bad experiences wash through your mind before you do something important .
Replace that habit by actively letting positive memories , accomplishments and experiences wash through your mind for a minute or two instead .
We often forget these positive things and our minds become focused on the negative memories .
But this is up to you , you have a choice .
And the product of your choice is a factor in your level of self confidence .
14 . Take it into the future .
One great way of putting things into perspective and choose how much you let everyday happenings affect your confidence is to take a look from the future .
Ask yourself :
Will this be a big deal in 5 years or something Iâ€™ll even remember ?
This takes you out of being wrapped up in what just happened .
And the answer to the question is almost always a no .
By using this question it gets easier to handle your day to day troubles and realise that in a larger context most stuff is small stuff you donâ€™t really need to sweat .
15 . Realise that the past does not equal the present .
What happened last year , last month or yesterday does not equal tomorrow , next month or next year .
You create your future in the present and you can to a large degree decide for yourself how much you let the past affect you and your future .
Even if your confidence has been low for the last 10 years does not mean that it has to stay that way .
You can choose to change your future and life .
You can let go of previous thoughts that have not been useful for you and thatâ€™s ok .
You can choose new thoughts to think .
This realization untangles your mind from a self - made prison , creates a sense of possibility and makes it easier to change negative thought patterns .
16 . Be good to yourself .
You might treat yourself badly .
Realize that there is no need for doing that .
Even if you have done up until today , you can choose to stop it .
Be good to yourself instead .
Itâ€™s ok .
Itâ€™s allowed .
Itâ€™s pretty pointless doing the opposite unless your goal is to make unhappy , complaining people happy through shadenfreude .
An important part of being good to yourself is recognizing your strengths and developing them .
This will not only helps to improve your skills but also your confidence in your own abilities .
Another and smaller – but important – part is simply learning to accept a compliment .
Itâ€™s ok to say â€ œthank you !â€ and feel good about yourself .
17 . Learn about how your mind actually works .
If you havenâ€™t already start reading about personal development and psychology .
Everybody is different but what is more important , people share a lot of similarities in how our minds work .
What has worked for others may work very well for you too .
For me itâ€™s been quite enlightening to learn about different common patterns of thought .
Now , when I know what some of them are it becomes easier to not respond in a knee - jerk manner when for instance my ego feels threatened or when someone is trying to influence me through various popular methods of persuasion .
This process of getting to know yourself better has certainly increased my self confidence .
If you donÂ´t know where to start , have a look at Recommended Personal Development Products for some suggestions .
18 . Improve your social skills .
Relationships is one of the most important areas of life and Iâ€™d say that improving your social skills is one of the top things people want to learn .
Improving your results in this area and finding a larger confidence in your social skill - set can be a really big boost for your overall sense of confidence .
Some popular previous articles for pointers are : Do You Make These 10 Mistakes in a Conversation , 18 Ways to Improve Your Body Language and How To Make a Great First Impression .
19 . Focus outward instead of inward .
When you interact with others and sometimes when you are by yourself itâ€™s good to try to keep the focus of your mind outward instead of inward .
The problem with a focus inward is – in many situations – that it makes you focus on how you look , what you just said and what the other person – or a whole bunch of people – thinks of you right now .
This can reduce anyone to a bumbling , second - guessing , fidgeting shadow of their former self as the self - consciousness becomes almost paralyzing .
Focusing outward is , besides being a good tip for keep your self - confidence up , also a good way to improve your people skills .
20 . Keep a positive crowd .
The people you hang out with can either drag you down or lift you up .
Since we spend so much of our time with other people itâ€™s important to keep positive â€ “ or at least reasonably neutral â€ “ people around you as much as you can .
One or a few negative people can affect you in a big way – perhaps through nagging – and pull you down day after day .
21 . Keep a positive intake of information , influence and emotions .
Much of the news and society brings a bleak and negative picture of both the world and yourself to your doorstep each day .
Just like the people that surround you the information that surrounds you can affect you in big way .
Donâ€™t just stay passive and take it all in .
Choose what you want to watch , hear and read .
Choose what Â´s useful and beneficial for you .
22 . Positive thinking
Learning to see the world and your life through a more positive lens can be a bit difficult and takes some time .
Especially if youâ€™ve spent several years with a negative view on things .
Have a look at Take the Positivity Challenge ! for pointers on how to change your mindset to a more positive one .
23 . Compare yourself to yourself .
Not to others .
This will eliminate a lot of unnecessary pain in your life .
The thing is if you pass one person then youâ€™ll just find another person more successful than you .
And your brief sense of being a winner will once again transform into anxiety and fear .
Focus on yourself , not the other people around you , no matter if they are more or less successful .
Compare yourself to yourself .
Improve yourself and see how you grow and become a more successful , more confident and happier person .
24 . Redefine failure .
How you view failure controls how much your confidence drops before or after a failure .
The definition of failure we are brought up with in society might not be the best and most useful to have .
If you look at the most successful people you quickly notice that they have a different response to failure than the more common one .
They donâ€™t take failure or rejection that seriously .
They know itâ€™s not the end of the world if they fail .
Instead they look at each failure and see the good part : what they can learn from it and improve next time .
They have an abundance - mentality .
They know that if their first business - venture fails it feels like crap for a while but itâ€™s ok in the long run .
They learn from it and then they try again .
If they are rejected for date , do they give up ?
Probably not .
They know that next week or the week after they might find someone else thatâ€™s interesting and ask them out .
They know that there are a lot of good people out there .
That there are a lot of good business opportunities out there .
But they have also learned that to become successful at anything you have to fail perhaps 5 , 10 , 20 times or more .
You have work on your skills to sharpen them .
See failure or rejection not as something incredible negative that might end your life if it strikes .
Redefine it in your mind to lessen the negative emotional impact and the fear .
See failure simply as feedback on what you need to improve on .
Listen to the advice the failure gives you and you will improve .
And , by redefining failure this way your level of confidence will not take a drastic drop every time you fail or fear failure .

It ’s not often one gets one ’s bong in the scientific literature , let alone one designed to allow you to smoke weed inside an MRI scanner , but this is exactly what has been achieved in an article published in the journal Pharmacology , Biochemistry and Behavior .
Most studies on the neuroscience of marijuana have used pills or injections of THC , the main active ingredient , but this is quite different from smoking – both in the way it reaches the brain and because of the fact that burning the plant creates many other chemicals which also get inhaled .
A team from Harvard Medical School are interested in how smoked marijuana affects the brain , but have come to the inevitable conclusion that it ’s actually quite hard smoking a joint when you ’re lying on your back being brain scanned .
So the research team put their heads together (! ) , and realised they needed to design a bong – a water pipe for smoking marijuana – safe to use in an MRI scanner .
This is n’t a trivial task .
Apart from being free of metal parts that could be affected by the MRI scanner ’s strong magnet , the device had to be installed and removed within one booked session and also needed to control the smoke .
As well as allowing the person take hits from the bong , the device also had to capture the smoke that was exhaled .
Otherwise , the scanner room would get filled with smoke which could interfere with the equipment and affect any participants who took part in other studies that happened afterwards .
Presumably , after much trial and error , the final device was created with two main parts : the first was a face mask with pipes going to the bong and the ‘ exhaust ’ , the second was the water pipe which was sealed in a box .
One thing you may not be aware of is that the US research agency NIDA , the National Institute on Drug Abuse , have standard issue spliffs .
These are government approved reefers guaranteed to have a measured amount of THC in them .
The bong was designed so these could be attached to the water pipe and lit at the appropriate time so the participant could smoke while being brain scanned .
The researchers tested their creation with a simple brain scan , declared the project a success and published their MRI - safe bong design in the medical journal Pharmacology , Biochemistry and Behavior .

Introducing the Hardy Heron
Hi Folks , I am delighted to have the pleasure of announcing the Hardy Heron ( Ubuntu 8.04 ) , the next version of Ubuntu that will succeed Gutsy Gibbon ( Ubuntu 7.10 , due for release in October 2007 ) .
Not only will the Ubuntu community continue to do what it does best , produce an easy - to - use , reliable , free software platform , but this release will proudly wear the badge of Long Term Support ( LTS ) and be supported with security updates for five years on the server and three years on the desktop .
We look forward to releasing the Hardy Heron in April 2008 .
With the opening of each new release cycle of Ubuntu , we have more and more opportunity at our fingertips .
Not only are our friends in the upstream world constantly innovating and extending their applications and software , but the Ubuntu community continues to see incredible growth in its diverse range of areas such as packaging , development , documentation , quality assurance , translations , LoCo teams and more .
Each new release gives us all an opportunity to shine , irrespective of which bricks in the project we are laying , and this is at the heart of our belief - working together to produce an Operating System that will empower its users and shape the IT industry , putting free software at the corner - stone of our direction .
Most people only ever see the end - user view of Ubuntu , running it on their desktops , servers and mobile devices around the world .
For these users , Ubuntu provides a simple , convenient means to do what they want to do easily , effectively and without unnecessary complexity .
For many of us though , we want to open up the hood and understand how the system works and how to extend and grow it .
Thousands of us get out of bed every day , united behind Ubuntu , ready to make a difference , working together to make our vision happen .
Importantly , our ethos of collaboration and freedom extends to the development process as well as the end product .
As such , the Ubuntu development process is a very open , transparent one , and anyone is welcome to get involved .
It works like this : - Everyone is welcome to think of and develop ideas for features that could be present in the Hardy Heron release .
These ideas are written as specifications ( detailed documents outlining how the idea would work and be implemented ) .
You are welcome to add your specifications to https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu. -
In October 2007 , we will hold the Ubuntu Developer Summit in Cambridge , Massachusetts , USA and generate a schedule of sessions to discuss these specifications .
The sessions provide a means for interested parties to help scope out the proposed feature and determine methods and plans to implement it .
The Ubuntu Developer Summit is a semi-virtual event in which those who cannot attend can dial in with VoIP and use IRC and collaborative editing with Gobby to take part in the summit .
Everyone is welcome to participate , everyone is welcome to get involved , and everyone is welcome to help shape the form of the Hardy Heron .
Let 's work together to shake things up , make things happen and make the most compelling Ubuntu release yet .

Those who know about the centrifuges used to refine uranium tell me they must spin at an almost unrivaled velocity — almost unrivaled , because Bush administration statements are being spun at equivalent speed by White House and corporate media spiders .
Without Spinmeister Karl Rove and former spokesman Tony Snow , it is amateur hour at the White House .
And the theater would be as funny as The Daily Show , were the subject not so serious .
Judging from President George W. Bush ’s words and body language he is far from giving up on ways to “ justify ” attacking Iran ’s nuclear program — weapons - related or not .
He appears convinced he must honor the pledge he has made to Israel ’s current leaders to eliminate what they have called an “ existential threat ” to Israel .
This came through in a particularly pointed way on October 17 , when an agitated president ad - libbed about the possibility of World War III , complaining loudly , “ We ’ve got a leader in Iran who has announced he wants to destroy Israel . ”
Not at all helpful to the president was the judgment of U.S. intelligence that the Iranians halted their nuclear weapons - related program in 2003 , a judgment the administration made public this week .
The White House knew only too well that that this bombshell could not be kept secret very long — the more so since Congress ’ intelligence committees , Pentagon brass , and senior CIA officials reportedly made it quite clear they would go public if the White House did not publish a sanitized version of the key judgments of the latest National Intelligence Estimate .
On Oct. 26 , National Intelligence Director Mike McConnell launched a trial balloon , declaring he would no longer declassify and release summaries of National Intelligence Estimates , but that balloon was quickly shot down .
So what can Cheney and Bush do now to “ justify ” striking Iran ?
Several months ago , about the time new intelligence established there was no active nuclear weapons program in Iran , there were signs in the rhetoric coming from the president and Gen.
David Petraeus that the argument was going to hinge on claims that the Iranian Revolutionary Guards were supplying the wherewithal to kill our troops in Iraq .
Petraeus was clearly ready to play that game , but his superior , Admiral “ we ’re - not - going - to - do - Iran - on - my - watch ” William Fallon would not play along .
And neither would the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates is now back from a brief visit to Iraq and his caution so far on this issue suggests he is paying more heed to Fallon than to Petraeus .
In other words , there is no sign that Gates wants to abet using Iranian meddling in Iraq as a pretext for a military strike on Iran .
Gates ’ well - deserved chameleon - like reputation counsels caution here , since a word from Cheney or Bush could conceivably make Gates a fervent champion of this pretext for war .
But people do mature ; Gates is smart ; and I doubt he would want to be so closely associated with starting a regional war , if not WW III .
Spinning Enrichment
So where does that leave the beleaguered president ?
This week ’s spinning by the White House and subservient media suggests the administration still thinks it can make a case for war , by obfuscating the nuclear program in Iran .
This has become clearer as administration mouthpieces blur the distinction between uranium enrichment for a civilian energy use ( permitted to signatories of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty ) and the much more demanding requirements of a nuclear weapons program .

When you feel like eating something , what comes to mind first ?
For me it ’s the purely the taste .
Then my inner-brain kicks in and thoughts of portion size , calories , fats , & sugars , slowly convince me to make a smart choice .
Weight gain aside , I would rarely think of any other complications or side effects the food may cause .
Side effects are attributed to medications or medical procedures , but not food , right ?
Well , guess again .
Turns out , the food we eat may also cause side effects .
Some side effects are serious , some are disturbing , and some may put you into embarrassing situation .
Here is a list of 10 common side effects caused by the food we eat :
Body Odor .
Researchers found that red meat consumption negatively influences on body odor [ 1 ] .
Acne .
Foods that are high in saturated fat and trans fatty acids increase the sebum production in the body , which in turn increases acne .
Researchers suggest that there is a positive association between milk consumption and acne .
Allergy .
Allergy is a number one foods side effect .
In theory , any food can cause an allergy .
But in fact there are 8 foods to blame for 90 % of allergic reactions to food : milk , eggs , peanuts , tree nuts ( including Brazil nuts , hazelnuts , almonds and walnuts ) , fish , shellfish , soy and wheat .
Candidiasis ( Yeast infection ) .
Yeast infections are caused by an overgrowth of the normal yeast in the body , so foods that affect the yeast levels may contribute to a yeast infection .
These foods are : sugars , vinegar , starches , refined carbohydrates , yeast and yeast containing products .
Heartburn and Acid Reflux .
There is a relatively long list of foods that cause heartburn .
Some foods cause the lower esophageal sphincter – a muscle that helps to keep stomach contents out of the esophagus – to become weaker , and some cause the stomach to produce more acid than usual .
Both of these problems can increase acid reflux .
Most common food triggers for heartburn are citrus fruits , fried and fatty foods , vinegar , tomatoes , chocolate .
High Cholesterol ( Hyperlipidemia ) .
Cholesterol is found mostly in animal foods .
Consumption of cholesterol - rich foods can elevate blood cholesterol level , which may increase the risk of heart attack or stroke .
High cholesterol foods are : brains ( beef , pork , lamb ) , eggs , organ meat ( liver , kidneys , spleen ) .
Kidney stones .
People whose diets are high in animal protein and low in fiber and fluids may be at higher risk for stones .
Several studieshave shown that increasing dietary calcium and restricting salt , animal protein , and foods rich in oxalate , such as rhubarb , spinach , cocoa , nuts , pepper , and tea , can help prevent calcium oxalate stones from returning [ 2 ] .
Memory and Cognition Impairment .
Among older adults whose diets are high in saturated fats and trans fats , a high intake of foods containing copper may cause a fast decline in their ability to think , learn , and remember , according to the study from Rush University Medical Center in Chicago [ 3 ] .
The research studies have linked fat intake , especially that of saturated and trans fats , to Alzheimer ’s disease and other forms of cognitive difficulties .
Edema and Water Retention .
Foods high in salt , sodium or sugar may cause the body to retain considerable fluids and worsen edema .
The body needs a constant concentration of salt in its tissues .
When excess salt is taken in , the body dilutes it by retaining fluid .
Migraine and Headache .
Foods may trigger not only migraine but also tension type headache , which feels like tightening of a band around the head , making the whole head ache .
Foods cause headaches by affecting the brain chemistry or changing the size of blood vessels .
Certain foods cause headache in most vulnerable people because of their high content of the amino acids tyramine and phenyethyamine .
The tyramine increases blood flow to the brain , which can lead to a headache .
Common headache food triggers are aged cheese , beer , red wine , chocolate , nitrite - containing foods .

Anyone Can Become a Millionaire by Following a Few Simple Steps
Becoming a millionaire is n’t all that difficult and there are countless ways to achieve that milestone .
Some people do it through real estate , others start their own business , while some simply get lucky by winning the lottery or winning big on a game show .
What is even more interesting is that you do n’t have to be wealthy to begin with nor do you have to earn six figures to reach this goal .
I know some people who earn well over $ 100,000 and all they have to show for it is a large mortgage payment and a fancy car that depreciates faster than a glass of milk left outside in the summer sun .
Anyone can become a millionaire and there are five things you need to do to have the best shot of making that a reality .
1. Earn Income .
Clearly , the more money you make , the faster you can reach that milestone , but that does n’t mean your average Joe with a average income ca n’t obtain millionaire status .
The current median income in this country ranges between $ 35,000 - $ 60,000 depending on where you live .
Better yet , get married so you have dual incomes .
The wonderful thing about having dual incomes is that even with two people in the household , your income may double , but your expenses typically do n’t .
If you do n’t earn even an average income , all is not lost .
It is up to you to do something about it .
A negative attitude about your job or your earning potential wo n’t change anything .
Be proactive and make the decision to improve your situation .
It is your life , so take control and realize that things do n’t change overnight .
It may take a few years of slow growth before you reach the point where you want to be , but you can do it if you try .
Remember , short of inheriting money from a relative or winning the lottery , you will need reasonable income to become a millionaire .
2. Live Within Your Means .
Ok , so you have income but now what ?
It does n’t matter how much money you make if you spend it all or spend even more than you make .
It might be nice to eat out at nice restaurants every night , or to always be on the cutting edge of designer fashion but , this will only make you look like millionaire to others instead of actually being a millionaire .
This does n’t mean you have to live a miserable and miserly lifestyle , but you simply need to live reasonably .
The bottom line is buying things and acting like a millionaire if you are n’t will simply empty your bank account and give people a false impression of your status , but that ’s it .
Start by purchasing a home that you can comfortably afford and drive vehicles that suit your lifestyle without straining your budget .
You do n’t have to be pulling down $ 75,000 a year and drive a 1992 Civic Hatchback or live in a dump , but throwing your money at a 4,000 square foot home in a gated community with luxury cars or SUVs that cost as much as one year of your salary wo n’t help you become a millionaire .
Some may argue that an expensive home and real estate in general is a good way to become a millionaire , but I will touch on that later .
3. Save Money .
This is n’t rocket science but if you earn a reasonable income and you live within your means , guess what , you will probably have money left over to save .
But that ’s exactly the problem .
Most people treat savings as an afterthought , or something that only gets attended to after all the other bills are paid .
People pay bills , buy things , and then whatever is leftover they try to save .
That is the wrong way to save .
I ’m sure you ’ve heard it before , but pay yourself first .
Whether it is $ 100 a month or $ 1,000 a month , think of the savings as a bill that needs to be paid and do it regularly .
If you are unable to save money you will find that your only wealth is in the form of material things .
So , you need to start saving every month and you need to make it happen automatically .
An online savings account can accomplish this for you , and on top of that you ’ll be earning better interest on that money than you would be at your local bank .
Here are a few online banks with current rates to check out .
4. Invest Wisely .
Now that you are saving money , you need to invest it wisely .
Sticking it under the mattress or slowly building up in a savings account is n’t going to help you reach your goals any faster .
You do n’t have to read the Wall Street Journal or watch CNBC everyday while actively managing your portfolio in order to be a good investor .
Some of the best investment advice is to simply invest regularly and in a diversified portfolio .
If you do this you ’ll already be doing more than most people and on your way to building wealth .
It is also important to remember that real estate is part of your investment picture , but it should n’t be all of it .
Too many people stake almost everything they have into a primary residence and expect it to appreciate in value .
Just like any investment , generally speaking , over time you will make money .
There is n’t much debate about that , but relying heavily on real estate is no different than if you rely on one stock to fund your retirement .
So , begin with opening up an investing account and put your money to work .
It does n’t matter if you are investing in stocks , bonds , or index funds , but keeping costs down helps you keep more of your own money .
One of the best and cheapest places to start investing is at TradeKing .
You can become a millionaire by simply buying a single stock and holding onto it for 20 years if it goes up significantly just like you can buy a $ 500,000 home and have it double in value in 20 years , but that ’s a pretty risky proposition .
Take a lot of the risk out of the picture by making sure all of your eggs are n’t in the same basket and develop an investment strategy that will provide steady growth over the years ..
5. Stick With Your Plan .
Finally , if you have done the previous four items the only thing left to do is to continue doing it and stick to the plan .
As far as income is concerned , always be on the lookout for ways to increase your income , whether it is through climbing the ladder at your current job , finding work elsewhere , or maybe even starting a business on the side .
Increased income will mean you can save even more , provided you are n’t foolishly spending the additional money .
As that additional money gets tucked away into savings or investments it will continue to grow even more quickly .
It Is n’t Hard to Do if You Work at It
Unfortunately , most people are looking for a way to get rich quick or to capitalize on the next big thing .
It is true that some people have made their wealth through playing the real estate market , while others have done so by investing in a few stocks that exploded , but this is the exception and not the norm .
If the above list seems overly simplistic , that ’s good .
There are no secrets to becoming a millionaire and almost anyone has the chance to make it happen .
The process is simple :
1. Make money
2 . Do n’t spend all of your money
3 . Save some money
4. Invest that money at TradeKing
5. Repeat
Certainly , there are many factors in play that can make this easier or more difficult for different people .
This is simply the process that you can use in order to reach that goal , whether it is in 5 years or 50 , if you follow a few basic steps you can do it .
Amid growing polarization between President Gen. Pervez Musharraf and Pakistan ’s civilian opposition forces , US hopes of salvaging a power - sharing accord that would marry the military dictator to former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto are fading fast .
Indeed , Bhutto ’s public break with the military dictator  enunciated , among other places , in a Washington Post column Wednesday that called on Musharraf to resign as both president and as army chief  will make it much harder to patch together the deal that Washington had tried so hard to work out over the last several months , according to most analysts here .
That deal called for Musharraf to retain his disputed presidency on condition that he first permit Bhutto to return from exile and then hold elections that would give her a third premiership in exchange for his resignation as chief of the army , presumably in favor of his number two , Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani , a Washington favorite .
Kayani , routinely touted in the press here as a " moderate " and " pro-western " officer , has also been depicted as part of a group of military reformers who , according to the New York Times , " are widely believed to be eager to pull the army out of politics and focus its attention purely on securing the country , " presumably from radical , Taliban - related Islamists who have both consolidated and expanded their control of the frontier areas along the Afghan border since Musharraf declared his state of emergency 10 days ago .
But with Bhutto put under house arrest in Lahore and thousands of other opposition politicians , activists , lawyers , and human rights defenders in detention around the country , it now appears that the deal is off , and Washington ’s options have become both narrower and the course of events much more risky .
The stakes could not be higher .
Not only is the Pakistani Army ’s cooperation considered essential to stabilizing Afghanistan against the Taliban and defeating al - Qaeda , but the prospect that the worsening political crisis could fracture the military along regional lines is now looming as a worrisome possibility .
Pakistan is believed to have some 50 nuclear weapons scattered around the country .
In addition , the Bush administration ’s failure to break with Musharraf and declare unequivocal support for the civilian opposition ’s demands risks both further alienating the vast majority of the more than 160 million Pakistanis whose image of the US had fallen to unprecedented levels before the current crisis , and exposing Bush ’s " freedom agenda " for the Muslim world  already a source of understandable skepticism  as a total fraud .
" If anyone in the Muslim world still believed in the Bush administration ’s historic promise to support democracy over political expedience , those hopes are being shattered with the crisis unfolding in Pakistan , " said Mohamad Bazzi , a visiting fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations .
To try to redress the situation , the administration of President George W. Bush is sending Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte to Islamabad as his special envoy Thursday for talks with Musharraf , as well as meetings with other senior political figures , probably including Bhutto herself .
Negroponte ’s primary goal , according to insiders , is to see whether " Humpty - Dumpty can be put back together again , " according to one administration official who asked not to be identified in a reference to the original power - sharing plan .
To that end , Negroponte will point to threats by Congress that would cut off nearly two billion dollars in mostly military aid it has appropriated for Pakistan each year since the " global war on terror " after 9/11 , unless Musharraf rescinds the emergency , sheds his uniform , and permits free and fair elections to go forward , among other conditions .
In addition , Congress could suspend the sales of long - sought F - 16 fighter jets .
But many analysts here believe that will not be sufficient to bring Musharraf around .
If anything , the Pakistani leader appears to have become increasingly confident that he can ride out the storm , particularly given the continuing mildness of western reaction , including Negroponte ’s own assertion in Congressional testimony last week that the Pakistani leader was an " indispensable " ally in the war on terrorism .
And , even if Musharraf bends to Washington ’s threats , according to Pakistan specialists here , it ’s increasingly doubtful that Bhutto , who has been reaching out in recent days to other opposition parties to forge a united democratic front , would go along at this point , lest she appear to be selling out her new partners , as well as undermining whatever personal credibility she retains .
Just two days ago , she told the Financial Times unequivocally that there was " no chance " of negotiations with Musharraf being revived .
One point of leverage against Musharraf that could be more effective , according to one expert , Selig Harrison at the Center for International Policy ( CIP ) here , would be suspending the 100 million dollars a month that the US Defense Department provides directly to the Pakistani military in counterterrorism funding , a significant portion of which is distributed in cash and used to ensure loyalty to the chain of command .
But , led by the Pentagon , the administration appears dead - set against putting that aid into play , fearing not only that it would reduce Pakistan ’s already - tepid and sporadic cooperation with the US against al - Qaeda and the Taliban , but also strengthen Islamist elements within the military who have long resented and even resisted serving Washington ’s priorities .
" If we use that leverage , we could move Musharraf to do many things , but I have no reason to believe we ’ll use it , " said Harrison , who noted that even the International Crisis Group ( ICG ) , several of whose board members who also served in top US ambassadorial posts called Tuesday in a Post column for a military aid cutoff to Pakistan , exempted the counter - terrorist program .
" Frankly , without using that leverage , I think it ’s too late to do anything very effective , " Harrison told IPS .
The administration ’s Plan B , which some analysts believe is already underway , is to " reach out " to other generals more responsive to US interests , starting with Kayani , to press Musharraf to step down and take action of their own , if he fails to do so .
In that respect , the choice of Negroponte as chief envoy is particularly ironic .
During his tenure as ambassador to Honduras in the early 1980s , Negroponte aligned himself unconditionally with its brutal armed forces chief , Gen. Gustavo Álvarez Martínez , who was so responsive to US strategy in the region that his own commanders forcibly ousted him from office .
Negroponte , who apparently was unaware of the barracks plot , was recalled a short time later .

The Software Freedom Law Center ( SFLC ) has settled its second GPL infringement case , this time with networking vendor Xterasys over charges that the company was n't complying with terms of the open source license agreement .
The suit was filed nearly a month ago and leaves the SFLC with a score 2 settled cases and two still outstanding .
Although no financial terms were revealed , the settlement itself could help spur other parties in similar lawsuits to come to the bargaining table .
" We are very pleased that we have settled the matter and that Xterasys has agreed to comply with the GPL on a going forward basis and take steps to ameliorate the harm caused by their past non-compliance , " SFLC Legal Director Dan Ravicher told InternetNews.com .
The SFLC 's legal suit against Xterasys was filed on behalf of BusyBox programmers .
BusyBox is a collection of UNIX utilities that have been optimized for size and are most commonly used in embedded environments .
BusyBox is licensed under the GPL which is a reciprocal license and requires that users make the source code available to end users .
Ravicher argued that Xterasys had been notified more than a year before the law suit was first filed .
" As we said in our complaint , we believe that third parties notified them of these issues in July 2006 , " Ravicher said .
" We then directly notified them of these issues in May 2007 .
So , as of at least those dates , Xterasys had notice of these issues . "
As part of the settlement Xterasys will cease distributing BusyBox code until the SFLC can verify that Xterasys is in compliance with the GPL .
Xterasys will also appoint an internal person to ensure GPL compliance .
There is also an undisclosed financial sum that Xterasys will pay .
" We seek a fair amount of financial compensation , " Ravicher said .
" Thus , there is no hard formula , but instead is negotiated on a case by case basis . "
The SFLC still has two cases outstanding on behalf of BusyBox .
One OF the cases is with High Gain Antennas that was filed the same day as the Xterasys suit .
The other which was filed in early December against Verizon .
" We are in discussions with both regarding hopefully settling those matters as well , although no settlement agreement in either case has yet been reached , " Ravicher said .
The SFLC had settled a case with Monsoon Multimedia in October on behalf of BusyBox with a similar GPL infringement complaint .
“ Americans ’ Economic Pessimism Reaches Record High . ”
That ’s the headline on a recent Gallup report , which shows a nation deeply unhappy with the state of the economy .
Right now , “ 27 % of Americans rate current economic conditions as either ‘ excellent ’ or ‘ good , ’ while 44 % say they are ‘ only fair ’ and 28 % say they are poor . ”
Moreover , “ an extraordinary 78 % of Americans now say the economy is getting worse , while a scant 13 % say it is getting better . ”
What ’s really remarkable about this dismal outlook is that the economy is n’t ( yet ? ) in recession , and consumers have n’t yet felt the full effects of $ 98 oil ( wait until they see this winter ’s heating bills ) or the plunging dollar , which will raise the prices of imported goods .
The response of those who support the Bush administration ’s economic policies is to complain about the unfairness of it all .
They rattle off statistics that supposedly show how wonderful the economy really is .
Many of these statistics are misleading or irrelevant , but it ’s true that the official unemployment rate is fairly low by historical standards .
So why are people so unhappy ?
The answer from Bush supporters — who are , on this and other matters , a strikingly whiny bunch — is to blame the “ liberal media ” for failing to report the good news .
But the real explanation for the public ’s pessimism is that whatever good economic news there is has n’t translated into gains for most working Americans .
A committee of the United Nations General Assembly voted today to back a resolution calling for a global moratorium on executions with a view to eventually abolishing the death penalty entirely .
The Assembly ’s third committee , which deals with human rights issues , voted 99 to 52 , with 33 abstentions , in favour of the resolution , which states “ that there is no conclusive evidence of the death penalty ’s deterrent value and that any miscarriage or failure of justice in the death penalty ’s implementation is irreversible and irreparable . ”
The resolution will now go before the full 192 - member Assembly for a vote next month .
All Assembly resolutions are non-binding .
The resolution welcomes “ the decisions taken by an increasing number of States to apply a moratorium on executions , followed in many cases by the abolition of the death penalty , ” and expresses deep concern that the death penalty continues to be applied in some countries .
It calls on nations that do impose the death penalty to ensure they meet internationally agreed minimum standards on the safeguards for those facing execution , and to provide the United Nations Secretary - General with information about their use of capital punishment and observation of the safeguards .
Further , the resolution asks countries to progressively restrict the use of the death penalty , such as by reducing the number of offences for which it may be imposed , and calls on those States that have abolished the practice to not reintroduce it .
In the past two days , before the resolution was put to a vote by the third committee , more than a dozen proposed amendments to the text were rejected by committee members .
The third committee also passed a resolution today , this time by consensus without a vote , calling for the elimination of rape and other forms of sexual violence in all their manifestations , including in conflict and related situations .
The text urges States to take special measures to protect women and girls from gender - based violence ; to end impunity for perpetrators of such crimes ; to provide victims with greater access to health care , including trauma counselling ; to promote human rights education and conduct public awareness campaigns ; and to consider ratifying or acceding to all human rights treaties on the issue , particularly the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and its Optional Protocol .
Michael Rae has posted some thoughts on known longevity mutations to the Immortality Institute forums .
Cleaning it up a little , we have :
While laypeople and non-biogerontologist biologists often subscribe to the idea that we are ' programmed to age and die ' ( usually as a means to clear out the old to free up resources for the young , and / or to facilitate evolution by increasing the turnover of the generations ) , almost no gerontologists do : the idea is actually logically incoherent granted the basic logic of natural selection .
Instead , almost all biogerontologists subscribe to some version of the idea that aging is the result of stochastic molecular damage that is only partially prevented or repaired because to invest the resources into creating maintenance mechanisms powerful enough to obliterate such effects would be a waste - natural selection selects organisms that leave behind the most viable progeny , not those that win the longevity medal .
Thus , evolution tends to select for maintenance systems that retard aging ENOUGH to let individuals live out a relatively long life - relative to what can be expected if they are n't killed by starvation , predation , exposure , etc - but not DRAMATICALLY more .
The resources that would have been invested in repair are instead directed to either reproduction matters ( fertility , attractiveness , etc ) or line items related to surviving those other , grossly environmental threats ( warmer fur , sharper claws , etc ) .
Such ideas can be grouped under the " disposable soma theory , " and mechanisms include the lack of selective pressure against mutations whose ill effects are felt only late in life -- most dramatically , in the case of " antagonistic pleiotropy , " where a trait is selected because it has effects that are beneficial for fitness , but that cause negative consequences that are not normally felt in the wild .
These negative consequences are only seen when the organism is sufficiently shielded from the natural environment to age significantly past its prime ( e.g. growth hormone , sex steroids and reproductive and other cancers ) .
An apparent challenge to this has been raised by studies in C elegans ( tiny roundworms ) and other model organisms that have mutations that dramatically slow the rate of their aging , seemingly at no cost to fitness .
However , studies have shown that this is often the result of the animals not being subjected to the rigors of a natural environment , and that when they have to compete under more natural conditions , they rapidly lose out to their wild - type cousins .
Which is why you do n't see these sorts of mutations in the wild .
Rae goes on to give examples - you should read the whole thing - and concludes :
This should give pause to those looking to intervene in aging by pharmaceutically exploiting these pathways ( a standard strategy of the " gerontologist 's school " of anti-aging biomedicine ) , and again reinforce the benefits of allowing metabolism to remain in its normal state , but cleaning up the ensuing damage directly , at the molecular level , iteratively pushing the level of damage beneath the threshold of pathology ( the " engineer 's school " of anti-aging biomedicine ) .
I 'm not sure I agree with that conclusion as a blanket over the subject ; after all , we 're already very reliant upon technology to shield us from the consequences of not having technology - i.e. to have to endure the rigors of the environment and extremely poor control over basic needs for life .
I 'm sure we 'd jump into the pool of being less generally resilient and more reliant on technology to live significantly longer in good health , given that we 're pretty much already in that pool today .
But that is n't the only option on the table , fortunately .
My arguments for the same conclusion as Rae above - let us primarily aim to repair damage rather than manipulate the rate at which damage happens - are primarily utilitarian .
One path looks to be much easier than the other , and plausible arguments exist for it to produce more rapid gains per dollar invested in research .
Furthermore , the resulting technology will likely be far more useful for those who are already old .
Slowing the rate of further damage does n't do much for those already greatly damaged .

INTRODUCTION
Probably the most significant development in aviation history is one which most Americans dont even know happened .
We worked hard to get our B - 29 built so we could reach Japan , the retaliation that President Roosevelt so badly wanted .
The Russians also wanted and badly needed a long range bomber as much as we did .
The difference is , we engineered ours with ingenuity and perseverance , the Russians stole it .
Read this fascinating story and you will find it hard to believe , but it actually happened .
The B - 29 is now as much a part of Russian aviation history as it is to American aviation history .
RUSSIAN B -29 CLONE - THE TU - 4 STORY
After the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor , President Roosevelt had a burning desire to retaliate by bombing Japan .
This soon became an obsession with him , but how were we going to accomplish this seemingly impossible feat ?
The only long range bomber in our arsenal was the B - 17 , and the idea of reaching Japan became increasingly remote .
We needed a Super Bomber , but did not even have one on the drawing board .
Roosevelt fortunately had a solution to his problem , with time almost ruling out such an undertaking .
His solution was Gen. H.H. Arnold , better known as HAP  .
Gen .
Arnold was already pushing for a more sophisticated Air Force with long range capability .
He sent request to all the aircraft companies seeking designs for a Super Bomber .
Boeing had been working on such a design and won the contract .
They were to deliver two flying prototypes by 1942 .
It was to be the fastest , largest , heaviest plane ever mass produced .
The U.S. ordered 250 sight unseen .
Then Germany attacked Russia .
The number was increased to 500 planes .
On Sept. 21st , 1942 , the Boeing XB flew out of the Seattle plant .
This three billion dollar gamble was the largest government commitment ever to a single project , including the Atomic Bomb .
There were residual benefits to this contract .
It brought the country together .
Boeing had four assembly plants , and hundreds of smaller plants making subassemblies .
Finally in 1943 the first production model B - 29 rolled out of the Wichita plant .
Eventually over 4000 were produced , 1600 at the Wichita plant which employed 26,000 workers working seven days a week .
The first bombers were sent to the CBI area ( China , Burma , India ) .
Gen .
Arnold realized we needed a place for damaged planes to land after bombing Japan .
Roosevelt asked Stalin for permission to land in Siberia or Russia .
Stalin evaded answering the request .
Russia was not at war with Japan , and had their hands full fighting the Germans .
They did not want to open up another front by taking on Japan .
Our crews were told that after bombing Japan , only in an extreme emergency , to land in Vladivostok , Russia .
On August 20 , 1944 , a B - 29 was forced to divert to the Soviet Union .
It crashed east of Khabarovsk after the crew baled out .
The crew was interned in Russia .
A U.S. made version of the B - 29 A U.S. made version of the B - 29 About the same time three B - 29s with emergencies landed in Vladivostok .
One of the planes was the  Ramp Tramp , another was the  Ding Hao .
Ironically the third plane was completely intact was the Gen. H.H. Arnold Special .
The crews assumed the planes would be refueled and they would return to China .
They were never to see their planes again .
The crews and aircraft were all interned .
Now the Russians were holding four crews and three complete B - 29s .
Desperate negotiations by the U.S. for the release of the crews and the aircraft were ignored .
Stalin was continually pressured for the release of the crews and planes , however it soon became obvious that he had no intentions of giving them up .
He decided to steal them .
He figured it would take over five years to design and build their own much needed long range bomber .
A better way would be to steal these already in his possession and make a bolt for bolt exact copy of them .
Stalin demanded the reproductions be ready in two years .
The entire Soviet aircraft industry was mobilized to meet this seemingly impossible deadline .
At that time any dissention was met with punishment , even death .
That would be considered sabotage to question a project .
This project received top priority .
The Russians were completely dumbfounded when faced with the enormity of the situation .
They were fascinated with the gigantic  Silver Bullet .
What better luck than to have three of them dropped right in their back yard .
Finally through some bizarre diplomatic negotiations between the US and Molotov it was arranged for the aircrews to escape to Tashkent , Russia , via the Trans - Siberian Railroad .
They were given adequate treatment while interned .
From Tashkent they were transported by train and truck to Tehran , Iran , for their release .
However their release wasnt going to be that simple .
They were warned not to talk to anyone , and had to sign top secret documents swearing them to secrecy .
They were flown to Naples , Italy , and then shipped to N.Y. where they finally found freedom .
The Russian plan was to organize the best pilots , technicians , engineers , and aviation specialist to measure and catalog each of the 105,000 parts of the B - 29 .
They decided to completely disassemble the Hap Arnold Special and use it for measurements .
The Ding Hao would serve as a reference model , and the Ramp Tramp would be used for pilots training .
Russian pilots would have a hard time figuring out the significance of the instruments , so their top pilot , fluent in english , labeled every instrument in Russian so their pilots could easily identify everything required to fly the B - 29 .
The Russians were amazed at the quality of the workmanship and the technology involved in the manufacture of the B - 29 .
The Soviet version would be called the TU - 4 , NATO code name  BULL  .
After the Hap Arnold Special was completely dismantled they immediately realized the almost impossible task of reverse engineering  the aircraft .
It has been reported the Russians only had slide rules and even some used an abacus .
All measurements had to be converted to metric sizes .
Now they were running into major problems .
Imagine the complexity of copying the giant R - 3350 engine .
They were not able to manufacture the wing fuel tanks .
The compound curves of the plexiglass nose presented an unsolved problem , and pilots complained about distortion in the Russian copy .
They did not have the capability to manufacture the huge tires .
The massive landing gear also was a problem .
The responsibility of copying the airframe went to Tupolev .
There were miles of wires , and the sophisticated gunnery system presented the biggest problem .
The Russians sent agents to the U.S. to try to purchase anything they could find in parts , plans , tires , or information pertaining to the B - 29 .
The machine guns were replaced with cannons .
The copying and manufacture of the R-3350 engine was turned over to Shvetsov .
The TU - 4 project was well underway early in 1945 .
An increase in quality control and sheer perseverance moved things along .
The end of the war with Japan made no difference in the production effort .
It was full speed ahead .
The U.S. had previously not believed the Russians had the capability to clone the B - 29 , it seemed totally inconceivable .
The public Russian debut in the Aviation Day parade in 1947 changed their minds .
The U.S. found itself in a panic situation when they learned the TU - 4 was indeed a reality , capable of hitting any target in the U.S.
There were reports of one way  missions by hundreds of TU - 4s carrying nuclear bombs attacking the U.S.
This forced the U.S. to beef up their Radar systems , surface to air missiles , and interceptor jet fighters .
The Russian version of the U.S. B - 29 Russian designation to be known as the TU? 4 NATO designation was ?
BULL ?
The Russian version of the U.S. B - 29 Russian designation to be known as the TU? 4 NATO designation was ?
BULL ?
Meanwhile , back in the Soviet Union , problems continued to plague the TU - 4 project .
The advanced avionics of the central fire control gunnery system remained unsolved .
There were problems with the pressurization system , and the R - 3350 copy was overheating , had short engine life , runaway props , and in general the total unreliability of the entire aircraft .
The Russians toiled endlessly on solving these problems , and it was not until 1949 that the TU - 4 became fully operational with some 300 in service .
The TU - 4 never saw combat .
Some 850 were eventually produced .
Before the 60s arrived the TU - 4 had been replaced by jet aircraft .
A few were given to China , and there are reports these were kept flying as late as 1968 .
The Ramp Tramp and the Ding Hao were scrapped .
The Hap Arnold Special was never put back together .
The B - 29 brought our country together , and made us a proud nation .
The TU - 4 became as much a part of Russian aviation history as the B - 29 was to American history .
As far as we know the only remaining TU - 4 is displayed at the Yuri Gagarin Air Force Academy outside Moscow .
This story , as incredible as it seems , is all true .
Just another page in aviation history .
Like a baseball struck by a bat , there ’s a neutron star out there that ’s going , going , gone .
Discovered using the Chandra X - Ray Observatory , the neutron star appears to be the result of a lopsided supernova explosion .
It ’s now hurtling away from the Milky Way faster than 4.8 million km/h ( 3 million mph ) .
And it ’s never coming back .
Astronomers think that the Puppis A supernova remnant was created about 3,700 years ago when a massive star detonated in a supernova explosion .
Instead of exploding evenly , it was one - sided .
A blast of material went in one direction , and the resulting neutron star was given a powerful kick in the opposite direction – like a natural rocket .
The neutron star ’s position was measured in December 1999 , and then again in April 2005 .
Based on the distance that it had moved , astronomers were able to calculate its velocity .
With that kind of speed , it should be easy to spot , but it ’s so far away that the difference is quite tiny from our vantage point .
It ’s impressive that Chandra was able to make the observation at all .
A detailed composite optical / X - ray image of the region near the neutron star shows clumps of oxygen drifting away from what is thought to be the centre of the explosion .
The cloud is moving in the opposite direction of the neutron star .
The Puppis A neutron star is a bit of a mystery .
Even the most sophisticated supernova explosion models can’t predict the speed and radiation coming from the neutron star .
“ The problem with discovering this cosmic cannonball is we are n’t sure how to make the cannon powerful enough . ” said Frank Winkler of Middlebury College in Vermont .
“ The high speed might be explained by an unusually energetic explosion , but the models are complicated and hard to apply to real explosions . ”

wes anderson : the ultimate heartbreaker
Pssst !
This post has been updated .
Have you ever woken up one morning and suddenly realised that an old and cherished friend does n’t care about you or anything you represent , and actually either ignores or caricatures your existence ?
Well , neither have I .
But too many times I ’ve realised that a director ( or musician or writer or artist … ) that I love like a friend actually creates art that exoticises , fetishises , or all out erases who I am .
I ’ve managed to recover from the horror of finding that much of the music I used to like is grossly sexist , ( see our little blurb about Jessica Hopper ’s famous article on emo music here ) but I ’m still working on getting over my ex-friend Wes Anderson .
Before I identified as a woman of colour and started applying anti-oppression criticism to every inch of pop culture I could get my hands on , I loved Wes Anderson .
But in my grand old age , I ca n’t excuse the racist caricatures that populate all of his movies .
Like Pagoda , the cute little Indian man in the Royal Tenenbaums ( who also appears in Bottle Rocket and Rushmore ) who exists solely to do Royal ’s bidding , and has an adorable lack of morality .
Or the slew of characters of colour - the Brazilian David Bowie ( played by Seu Jorge who actually has quite an illustrious film and recording career ) ; Vikram Ray , whose character ’s main feature is that he was “ born on the Ganges ” ; the Filipino pirates - in The Life Aquatic .
Characters of colour in Anderson ’s films are always caricatures , hilariously exotic .
Anderson uses “ race as a novelty ” , says salon.com , “ suggesting an assertively white - kid view of the world . ”
These characters are funny not because of their personalities or life situations - unlike Anderson ’s white characters - but solely because they ’re brown .
It ’s like Anderson is saying , “ The pirates are Filipino !
How hilarious is that ? ? ”
Needless to say , I do n’t get the joke .
As if that is n’t bad enough , Anderson also uses Asian cultures to demonstrate just how educated and well - travelled he is .
It ’s like the movie equivalent of “ Some of my best friends are Laotian ” and “ I went backpacking in Vietnam . ”
The master of in - joke filmmaking , Anderson ’s brown characters are like an inside joke for urban hipsters who ’ve visited Little India a few times .
While Anderson devotees have brushed off criticisms of characters like Pagoda as being minor , and few and far between , it seems like things are about to get a lot worse :
Fox Searchlight
Last week , Anderson ’s new film The Darjeeling Limited opened .
The film is the story of three American brothers who travel to India together after their father dies .
Maybe I ’m being prematurely judgemental , but the Darjeeling Limited looks suspiciously like “ Pagoda : The Movie . ”
It ’s this that really gets my back up about the Darjeeling Limited :
This is what really breaks my heart : Wes ’ track record with women of colour .
Anderson just loves pairing women of colour up with dorky white dudes , shortly after dorky white dudes have been dumped or rejected by white ladies .
Even though Rushmore ’s Margaret
Yang is the fullest of all of Wes ’ colour characters , she is still paired up with the loveable / hateable Max after Ms Cross turns him down .
It ’s the same story with Inez , the lovely Latin American hotel cleaner in Bottle Rocket .
Once upon a time , when it was illegal in Canada for non-white men to marry white women ( incidentally it was only in the 60’s that those laws were repealed both in the US and Canada ) , I imagine images of interracial relationships were radical statements .
But these days , you ca n’t swing a cat in urban North America without stumbling across some form of cultural appropriation .
The interracial relationships in Anderson ’s films are not radical .
They simply reinforce racism ’s most current and insidious form - they take cultural appropriation to the ultimate level by appropriating actual women of colour , a la Gwen Stefani .
In the words of Racialicious.com , Darjeeling Limited ( and , according to me , aspects of all of Anderson ’s films ) looks like it falls into “ the time - honored genre of White People Working Out Their Issues Against an Exotic Backdrop . ”
Still , I ’d like to say for the record that I do n’t think Anderson consciously sets out to reduce his non-white characters to ridiculous stereotypes , who are used only to enhance his white characters , and never allowed to stand on their own .
But the fact that the only role that people of colour can have in his movies are as sexual fantasies , sidekicks or deeply insulting cartoons suggests that , consciously or subconsciously , Anderson does n’t think that much of real life people of colour .
And between you and me , I ’m not sure mine and Wes ’ friendship can withstand that .
I know I sound bitter .
But it ’s hard to get over such a betrayal .
As a liberal arts student in the early ’00s with a tendency towards hipsterism , I adored Wes ’ movies .
At 17 I sneaked into Rushmore , at 19 I memorised all the dialogue to Bottle Rocket , and at 20 The Royal Tenenbaums pulled me out of an extended case of the blues , and maybe , just maybe , preventing me from dropping out of university .
Anderson ’s beautifully filmed and bizarre characters , who somehow made madness , dysfunctional families and alienation seem not only manageable but funny , were like friends who reminded me that I was n’t alone .
There were many times that Anderson ’s movies comforted me with the message that yes , everyone gets lonely , and yes , there are still reasons to live through it .
It was like Wes really got me .
But here ’s the thing about Wes Anderson : he positions himself as an outsider , and his protagonists are always outsiders , painfully awkward and deeply deficient in social skills but also desperately seeking love ( and you will notice that his white characters are capable of longing for love in a much more profound way than his characters of colour will ever acheive ) .
But at the end of the day , what is so outsider about Wes ?
He ’s an extremely succesful , wealthy , white dude .
That ’s not to say that rich white dudes can’t ever feel alienated .
But to position yourself as an outsider , while making art that ensures that people of colour are truly outside , is obscenely fake .
There ’s few things more horrible in pop culture than discovering that someone who let you inside is actually determined to keep you outside .
Does anybody else have sob stories of artists they revered , who turned out to be total , oppressive jerks ?
My mum always tells me to stay away from toxic friendships .
In that vein , I ’m not even sure I ’m going to rent The Darjeeling Limited .
Wes , do n’t even try to Facebook me .
It ’s time we both accepted it : it ’s over .
Update ! :
Ooo , look , slate.com agrees with me .

Market bulls believe stock prices will continue to rise
The Chinese market has almost tripled in value this year as investors clamour for a slice of the world 's fastest growing economy .
And if the shares of PetroChina soar when it lists in Shanghai next week , there 's a chance the Chinese oil giant could become the world 's most valuable quoted company , stealing the crown from ExxonMobil .
For some , this is a natural extension of China 's economic rise .
For others , it 's evidence of a massive stock market bubble that parallels the height of the dotcom boom .
Too hot ?
China 's market is displaying many of the classic warning signs of a bubble .
Cab drivers , college kids and Buddhist monks are making small fortunes in a frenzy of " chao gu " or stir frying stocks - Chinese slang for trading .
Internet chatrooms are abuzz with investment tips and reports say that millions of stock trading accounts are being opened each month .
People have a bullish feeling before the Olympics
Professor Yao Shujie , China Policy Institute at the University of Nottingham
Investment guru Warren Buffett , who recently sold his Hong Kong - listed PetroChina shares for a huge profit , warned last week that China is too hot to buy .
By most conventional yardsticks , valuations of many of China 's largest shares do look stretched .
China 's main stock index trades at more than 50 times projected earnings of the companies listed on it , almost triple that of major European and US stock markets .
Different standards
Shanghai - based fund manager Chris Ruffle says China 's market cannot be judged by the same standards as other exchanges .
Inflation exceeds the return on bank deposits and real estate has lost its appeal following measures taken by Chinese authorities .
Strict investment rules forbid Chinese households from putting their $ 2.3 trillion savings in overseas assets , leaving China 's stock market the only option .
" If it was a normal market it would be overheated , but it 's a closed system here , " says Mr Ruffle , who manages a $ 3bn fund for Martin Currie , an investment management business with its headquarters in Edinburgh .
Mr Ruffle says that companies have enjoyed explosive profit growth of 30 % in recent years and this could pick up pace as management techniques at state - run firms improve .
" Attitudes are changing .
Managers regard themselves as executives rather than civil servants , " says Mr Ruffle .
He plans to steer clear of big - name Chinese companies like PetroChina , but says he can still find good value firms in sectors such as healthcare , where the Chinese government is channelling investment .
Record listing
One factor behind the market 's white - hot rally has been a slew of stock market listings .
In the third quarter alone , China hosted 75 share offerings .
Many recent debuts have been household names in China and a big draw for local investors ' cash .
BIGGEST FIRMS BY MARKET VALUE ExxonMobil PetroChina General Electric China Mobile ICBC Gazprom Sinopec AT&T BP
China Life Source : Reuters
PetroChina , which is also listed in Hong Kong and New York , said this week it raised almost $ 9bn from its share sale , the largest amount raised in Shanghai to date .
" Prior to 2006 , there were few big heavyweight firms listing in Shanghai , " says Professor Yao Shujie , at Nottingham University 's China Policy Institute .
" If prices continue to rocket when it 's smaller firms doing [ initial public offerings ] , to me that 's a much clearer sign of a bubble . "
Chinese authorities have taken some steps to cool the market but investors have so far paid little heed .
There is a strong conviction that the government will not allow a huge crash in share prices .
" People have a bullish feeling before the Olympics , " says Professor Yao .
" They believe the government will do what it can support the market in case of difficulty therefore they are not so cautious about protecting their investments . "
Political fallout
A crash would have political ramifications for China 's leaders , who have staked their legitimacy on maintaining a breakneck pace of economic growth .
Ordinary urban Chinese would be the biggest victims of any crash , with foreign investment in the Shanghai market still subject to limits .
Stock ownership among ordinary Chinese is on the rise
" When it does fall it will be the middle classes marching on the streets , " says Kerry Brown , associate fellow at international affairs think tank Chatham House .
" It would cause unease among those that have kept out of politics for the past two decades and dent confidence in the Communist Party 's economic management . "
The stock market boom has given China five of the world 's 10 biggest companies by market value .
For now this is a source of pride for China 's government , but it is an honour that could turn into a big headache .
Few people get the advertised top speed for broadband
The warning comes from Ofcom as it moves to ensure that net firms do not oversell broadband in advertising .
Customers should get specific data about the speed on their line or be able to back out of the deal .
The regulator said new guidelines on the selling of broadband should come into force early in 2008 .
Clear information
The warning came in a letter sent by Ofcom boss Ed Richards to the Ofcom Consumer Panel in response to its work with broadband suppliers on the advertising and selling of high - speed services .
In October the panel talked to chief executives at the UK's top six net service firms to find out why consumers often do not get the speeds broadband firms advertise .
Net firms have been criticised for advertising their services using the phrase " up to " that can give consumers a false sense of the speed they will get when they sign up .
The Ofcom Consumer Panel said speeds advertised as " up to " a certain level end up being much slower in reality .
The panel called on Ofcom to set up and administer a mandatory code of practice for net firms .
Panel chairman Colette Bowe said : " This code would establish agreed processes to give the customer the best information during and after the sales process , and to give them flexibility to move freely to different packages that reflect the actual speeds with which their ISPs are able to provide them . "
The code would let customers know as they sign up about the maximum theoretical speed they can get on their line ; provide information about what affects line speed and call customers two weeks after installation to let them know what speed they are getting .
At that time , if speeds were " significantly " lower than those someone signed up for , customers should be able to swap to a different package free of charge or back out of the deal .
Customers should get more data about what can slow line speed
The consumer panel talked to net firms about the problem with line speeds following widespread reports that consumers were disappointed with the broadband speeds they were getting .
In late September a study by UK magazine Computeractive found that 62 % of those who used its speed testing software were browsing the net at less than half of the top speed advertised by their supplier .
It also said Ofcom should put more information on its website to give consumers as much information as possible before they sign up or switch suppliers .
In his response Ofcom boss Ed Richards backed the consumer panel work and said it was talking to the broadband industry about how best to implement the recommendations .
The result of these discussions should be made public early in 2008 , he said .
" We are keen that any measures are implemented in the shortest time frame possible , " said Mr Richards .
" At this stage , we have not ruled out the possibility of using formal powers if we consider it would be more effective in delivering our objectives . "
A spokeswoman for Ofcom said that currently the regulator had no powers to enforce the new arrangements on the selling of broadband but would seek them by beefing up the guidelines net firms must abide by .
" This is a considerable consumer issue we are concerned by , " said the spokeswoman .
" We think consumers should get what they pay for .
It 's an important decision for them . "

The invasion has created a series of problems
It was a few weeks before the invasion of Iraq , three years ago .
I was interviewing the Saudi Foreign Minister , Prince Saud al - Faisal , in the ballroom of a big hotel in Cairo .
Shrewd , amusing , bulky in his superb white robes , he described to me all the disasters he was certain would follow the invasion .
The US and British troops would be bogged down in Iraq for years .
There would be civil war between Sunnis and Shias .
The real beneficiary would be the government in Iran .
" And what do the Americans say when you tell them this , " I asked ?
" They do n't even listen , " he said .
Over the last three years , from a ringside seat here in Baghdad , I have watched his predictions come true , stage by stage .
Falluja fallout
The first stage was the looting .
Iraqis have voted , but still have no government
As Saddam Hussein fled Baghdad , people started attacking every symbol of the old system , no matter how self - destructive that might be .
I saw crowds of people sacking a hospital , running out with bits of equipment which were useless to them , but essential to the running of the hospital .
At the information ministry , I watched them stripping the claddings from the walls and the underlay from the floors .
The American soldiers outside did nothing to stop them .
Sometimes they would fire in the air , but the looters scarcely even looked round .
Until then , most Iraqis had thought the US was all - powerful , and was there to help them .
The perception started to change then and there .
For the next year , if you were careful , you could wander round Baghdad , and even drive to other parts of the country .
When we arrived for a tour of duty we travelled by road to Baghdad from Jordan , through places like Falluja , or else from Kuwait , past Nasiriya and Hilla .
It was sometimes nerve - racking , but we always got through .
Now there is no alternative to flying in .
The BBC , like most other news organisations , is based in the city centre , not inside the Green Zone .
It still is , but now our bureau is protected like a fortress .
Everything in Iraq changed in April 2004 , with the American onslaught on Falluja .
The town is small , but it took a long time to subdue - and it never has been subdued entirely .
The ferocity of the American attack angered a broad swathe of Iraqi opinion .
At the same time , against the advice of many Iraqi politicians , the Americans also took on the Shia cleric Moqtada al - Sadr .
After that , the towns and cities of central Iraq became markedly more dangerous .
We started hearing more of the American acronym IED , or improvised explosive device ( it simply means a bomb ) .
Post - traumatic stress
The Coalition Provisional Authority under the leadership of Paul Bremer handed over to an interim Iraqi administration in July 2004 .
There is an all - out effort to provoke a civil war .
The bombings of Shia shrines are always followed by the murder of individual Sunnis
The next key moment was the election of January 2005 .
The violence dropped noticeably , as the insurgents saw the size of the turnout and felt the general enthusiasm , and waited to see if they could do a deal with the new government .
But there was no new government for a full three months .
The politicians squabbled among themselves , and the moment passed .
The violence soon returned to its former level .
By July of last year there was already talk of civil war .
A referendum and another election followed , and an effective administration was as far away as ever .
Four months after the December election , Iraq still has no government .
' Easier targets '
The insurgency is fading a little now .
Fewer American , British and Iraqi troops are dying , and there are less frequent attacks on the Iraqi police .
Instead , easier targets present themselves .
There is an all - out effort to provoke a civil war .
The bombings of Shia shrines are always followed by the murder of individual Sunnis : sometimes dozens at a time .
There is a quiet movement of population , as people leave mixed areas and head for places where others like them live .
Marriages between Sunnis and Shias used to be frequent ; now they 've dropped away to almost nothing .
A psychiatrist at one of the main hospitals in Baghdad told me that serious mental illness in Iraq in the past had affected fewer than 3 % of the population .
Now , he said , the figure was 17 % .
Another psychiatrist told me that in the days of Saddam Hussein , his patients had shown the effects of living under a ferocious dictatorship : stress levels were very high .
Now , he said , most of his patients suffered from post - traumatic stress disorder .
It 's no longer the fear of violence and injury which troubles them , it 's the daily reality of it .
While we were filming , someone fired a gun close by .
I wo n't easily forget the terrified way some of the patients flinched .
Doing and undoing
Just over three years ago , when I interviewed the Saudi foreign minister , I asked him why he thought the US was determined to invade Iraq .
He said he had put the same question to Vice - President Dick Cheney .
Mr Cheney had replied : " Because it 's do - able . "
It was .
The trouble is , undoing the kind of damage the Saudi foreign minister foresaw is proving very hard indeed .
Do you agree with John Simpson 's views ?
Where does Iraq go from here ?
Is Iraq heading for civil war ?
— The State Bureau of Investigation is looking into allegations that a trooper abused a police dog during a training exercise in early August .
Sgt. Charles L. Jones , 38 , was placed on investigative leave and turned in his badge and uniform on Friday after internal affairs investigators received videotape of an incident of alleged animal abuse .
The videotape contains footage of Jones handling Ricoh , a Belgian Malinois , at a training exercise in early August .
Another trooper recorded the incident with his cell phone camera and turned it over to internal affairs investigators .
Details about the exact nature of the alleged animal abuse are not being released .
After seeing the videotape , Brian Beatty , the state secretary of Crime Control and Public Safety , suspended Jones and called in the SBI .
The SBI is investigating to see if Jones broke any laws .
Abusing a law enforcement animal is a felony offense .
Ricoh has been removed from Jones 's care and is being housed in a kennel at the North Carolina State Highway Patrol Training Academy .
Jones is banned from having any contact with Ricoh .
Ricoh had lived with Jones at his Wake County home for seven years and was the first dog that had been assigned to Jones .
Jones , a 12 - year veteran of the Highway Patrol , is assigned to the Special Operations Division and also coordinates training for troopers and their K - 9s .

Thousands of the terminals are being deployed in Macedonia
Many firms now offer low - cost PCs and laptops designed specifically for poorer nations but one firm is harnessing the untapped power of computers to power so - called dumb terminals .
NComputing , a privately held company based in Silicon Valley , believes its solution is cheaper and more effective than technology pushed by firms such as Intel , Asus and Microsoft , and the not - for - profit organisation One Laptop Per Child .
" The PC has become so powerful it is like a supercomputer on your desk - but to run everyday applications like internet , e-mail or Office you are only using a very small part of its capability , " said Martin Booth , business development director NComputing .
" So why not take that machine and share it with multiple users at the same time ? "
NCOMPUTING TERMINALS
Each terminal costs £ 35 A keyboard , mouse and monitor is plugged in The terminal connects to the main PC via Ethernet
NComputing 's solution is to share the resources of a single PC across up to 30 other users by hooking up low - cost terminals , known as a thin client , which are connected across a wired network .
The terminals , which are about the size of a small paperback book , are plugged into a monitor and keyboard and for users the experience is no different from logging into a normal PC .
" The key to the technology is our software that turns the machine into multi-user system , " said Mr Booth .
" It sends an image of their desktop off to the box at the other end of cable . "
The terminals buffer the screen image passed to and from the central PC and only register a change on the screen in order to minimise the impact on the system 's resources .
" It 's very efficient .
Every extra user demands only an extra 100 Mb of memory and the network bandwidth utilisation for most applications is in the hundreds of kilobits . "
There are limitations : the network can struggle to deal with the bandwidth needed to send full screen video to a number of terminals and the hardware is not suited for use with 3D graphics .
The terminals work with both Windows and Linux operating system .
A software licence needs to be bought for each user accessing Windows .
You hear a lot on the news about OLPC and other initiatives but no - one has ever heard of NComputing
Martin Booth , NComputing
NComputing has sold more than 500,000 terminals to more than 70 countries , including the UK and US , as well as developing nations like Bangladesh .
Mr Booth said : " You hear a lot on the news about OLPC and other initiatives but no - one has ever heard of NComputing .
We are deploying a solution for £ 35 per terminal while the OLPC laptop costs more than £ 100 .
The cost of each terminal does not include a mouse , keyboard or monitor , however .
" A lot of schools have old screens and keyboards which are unused .
In the developing world there are lot of programmes to recycle the West 's screens and keyboards , " said Mr Booth .
The user experience is like logging on to your own PC
NComputing is taking advantage of Moore 's Law , which states that computing power doubles every 18 months .
" The reason this is possible is because hardware companies are making computers that go faster , faster , faster but the cost really is n't coming down , " said Mr Booth .
He added : " It 's been stuck at £ 300 for the last few years .
You can't really drive down the price any more - the processor , the motherboard , the hard drive - it 's a zero margin for manufacturers at the bottom end of the market . "
The company 's biggest deployment of late has been in the Republic of Macedonia , which has bought 180,000 terminals .
Mr Booth said : " The government decided it wanted to transform the country into a knowledge - based economy within five years and they were going to invest in computers for every student in the country .
" The cheapest way to do it was with us .
We have already deployed 90,000 of the 180,000 terminals . "
Thin client technology is not new - it has been used widely in banking and sectors which want to avoid placing sensitive information on individual PCs .
NComputing has also been deploying its technology in factories where operating conditions are not suitable for ordinary PCs .
In Creuzberg , Germany , timber firm Pollmeier has replaced PCs on the factory floor with the dumb terminals , which are much more robust , as there are no moving parts .
" We 're also putting these terminals in schools in inner London , and inner New York .
Our goal is to connect the next billion internet users around the world , " said Mr Booth .

Money Morning / The Money Map Report
It was definitely a ' Tale of Two Markets ' yesterday .
And despite that phrase 's similarity to the Dickensian classic novel , it was n't legendary author Charles Dickens who was dominating my thoughts as the market closed yesterday ( Monday ) .
It was legendary Contrarian investor Jim Rogers .
Just look at the headlines of the day and you 'll immediately see what I mean .
On the positive side of the " news ledger , " on this first day of the new quarter , we had the Dow Jones Industrial Average soar to a new record high .
And yet , on that very same day , headlines warned of two failed buyout deals , lousy financial reports from Citicorp and UBS , and a manufacturing report that fell short of forecasts even with a greenback that 's at a limbo - like low .
The minute I spotted those incongruous and contradictory forces at work , I immediately thought of Rogers , and a somewhat combative , highly entertaining and extremely informative interview that the famed author and market commentator provided to Bloomberg TV a couple of weeks ago .
In fact , the interview was taped on Monday , Sept. 17 – the day before U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers held a scheduled meeting and stunned the financial markets with a bigger - than - expected interest - rate cut of half a percentage point .
Speaking the day before Sept. 18 rate cut , Rogers warned that such a move would be nothing more than a gift bailout to a couple of hedge funds and some banks , and warned that the United States is on the road to inflation - fed financial ruin if the central bank does n't get control of the money supply , and if we hem in the free - market forces that on their own will repeatedly rejuvenate capitalist markets .
( Jim ) Rogers and Me
A little bit of background is needed here .
It was the summer of 1997 , and I was in my fifth year on the Eastman Kodak Co. ( EK ) beat for Gannett Newspapers Inc. ( GCI ) .
Thanks to a big national scoop I 'd enjoyed earlier that year , I found myself invited to a big Hewlett - Packard Co. ( HPQ ) press event in New York City .
H- P was gunning for Kodak in the just - then - emerging consumer market for digital cameras , and was unveiling its new , low - priced line of " Photo Smart " digital cameras and printers to do so .
I 'd broken the story , and found myself suddenly on H - P's PR radar screen .
After a trip to their headquarters in Silicon Valley that summer for some follow - up interviews , I ended up as one of the many journalists on their guest list for their glitzy unveiling late that summer .
But my New York trip had a dual purpose .
My co-author and I had just put the finishing touches on the manuscript for our new book , Contrarian Investing , and we were meeting with publisher Prentice Hall to finalize some details .
One huge problem remained :
We needed a prominent investor – preferably a well - known Contrarian – to write the " forward , " the essay that readers perceive as a kind of tacit endorsement of the book .
Although the Prentice Hall folks and my co-author had tossed around a bunch of names , I already knew who I wanted : ' Adventure capitalist ' Jim Rogers , the author of the best - selling book , Investment Biker , and a columnist , commentator and financial adventurer whose global - market insights were unique , captivating and – invariably – correct .
At the time , Jim was a regular guest on CNBC 's hugely popular morning money program , " Squawk Box . "
I always tuned in when he was a guest .
I 'd read all his books , and I regularly clipped out and saved the columns he 'd written for Worth magazine and other publications .
Rogers was born in Oct. 1942 , and already had a list of impressive achievements before he was even 30 years old .
By 1970 , Rogers had earned degrees from Yale and Oxford , done a stint in the U.S. Army , and held several jobs on Wall Street .
That year , he joined the firm of Arnhold & S. Bleichroeder , and met George Soros , the financier who today is usually always referred to by his full name : ' Billionaire Investor George Soros . '
The duo of Soros and Rogers soon formed The Quantum Fund , a hedge fund that 's often described as the first truly global investment fund .
Over the next decade , Quantum gained 4,200 % , while the Standard & Poor 's 500 Index climbed about 50 % .
Rogers " retired " in 1980 , and since then has traveled the world ( several times ) , written a series of business bestsellers , hosted several TV investment programs , and worked as a " guest professor " of finance at Columbia University 's Graduate School of Business .
Since I 'd been the one to suggest Rogers to our friends at Prentice Hall , I was assigned to track Rogers down and ask if he would write the forward for our book .
Working from my hotel room during my short stay in New York , I somehow managed to find him , and even make an appointment to chat by phone .
For some reason , we hit it off immediately .
As I 've said before , it did n't hurt that I 'd recently returned from an extended reporting trip to China , and that I 'd actually invested in one of Rogers ' emerging - markets stock recommendations , a Chinese poultry company that also manufactured motorcycles .
It also helped , I think , that I 'd actually read so much of his work ( and was actually able to recite the titles of a series of his articles , even naming the magazines in which they 'd appeared ) .
There was one magazine article I 'd especially liked :
It was the perfect Contrarian piece – " Sell Euphoria , Buy Panic . "
Rogers was extremely gracious and gave me a surprising amount of time ; he actually asked me a bit about my career and some of my goals .
Even so – for me , at least – the conversation ended far too soon .
Maybe he wanted to help out a hungry young journalist .
I 'm sure that he remembered what it was like to have that first book coming out .
And it definitely did n't hurt that I was a confirmed Contrarian .
But Rogers ended up allowing us to adapt one of his essays for our book forward .
And the essay we agreed upon could n't have been any better suited to its task had it been specifically written for our book :
It was a perfect representation of his view of the world , and it meshed just as well with the message my co-author and I had spent more than a year researching and writing to bring to light .
It 's also the best piece of Contrarian investment advice an investor will ever get .
It was that favorite essay of mine : " Sell Euphoria , Buy Panic . "
The Toll Road to Trouble
So as I scrolled through the news after the markets closed yesterday afternoon , I could n't help but think about Dickens , Rogers and that interview the famed author ( Rogers , not Dickens ) had given to Bloomberg TV back on Sept. 17 .
The interview was classic Rogers :
He was at times contentious , and refused to indulge unintelligent observations , but he was also courtly , and as always left investors with a lot of wisdom to live by – and to profit from .
His central message was a warning :
The all - but - certain Fed rate cut ( which ended up being even more certain than anyone realized ) would n't be the panacea that everyone was predicting – at least not over the long term .
It might well bring the best of times now , but there would be a cost – and the worst of times would later follow .
Story continues below …
With a greenback already so weak that it 's nearing three - decade lows against other key currencies , and that insidious serpent – inflation – slithering its way back into our lives , the U.S. central bank should be raising interest rates , not cutting them , Rogers told the Bloomberg TV commentators .
" Other central banks are raising interest rates right now – the Norwegians recently raised interest rates , the Chinese recently raised interest rates , " Rogers said , speaking from Shanghai , where he now lives .
" There is inflation in the world .
And inflation is going to get a whole lot worse .
The U.S. dollar is going down dramatically , and the Fed is sitting around talking about trying to make interest rates a whole lot lower .
That 's going to cause inflation to go through the roof and it's going to cause the dollar to collapse .
The Fed was n't designed to bail out a bunch of hedge funds .
The Fed was founded to make the quality of the dollar – the soundness of the dollar – very good for all of us .
They are not here to bail out hedge funds . "
Once again that " Best of Times / Worst of Times " theme came into play .
According to Rogers , it 's those hedge funds – and the broader problems in the housing and finance sectors – that everyone is focusing on .
But investors – and the Fed – are ignoring the big picture .
While it 's true there are some serious problems in this one part of the economy – mostly due to speculation fueled by an overabundance of easy credit that the Fed created – it's also true that that stocks are in record territory .
" Yes , maybe we 're going into a recession , but it 's not the end of the world , " he said , adding that the Dow Jones Industrial Average is within 5 % of its all - time high .
" Where 's this crisis you 're talking about , except in a few hedge funds ? "
It was almost like Rogers has been able to peer ahead in time about two weeks , because he described yesterday 's market dichotomy perfectly .
On one hand , the Dow Jones Industrial Average kicked off the new quarter by surging 191 points to eclipse the 14,000 mark and set an all - time record .
On the other hand , several failed buyout deals , a lackluster manufacturing report and lousy quarterly reports from banking giants Citicorp and UBS reminded us all of the financial landmines that are still hidden ahead of us , in the darkness of uncertainty .
[ For a related story about yesterday 's market developments in the stock and credit markets , please click here . ]
Here again we see that " Best of Times / Worst of Times " theme holding true .
During the cable network interview two weeks ago , Rogers at one point called the Fed 's brain trust " clowns " and a rate cut a " vote getter . "
And he reiterated over and over that the Fed 's role is not to serve special interests , or to keep the free markets from operating .
Recessions are a normal element of capitalism – a purifying element , in fact .
Downturns are way of washing the excesses out of the financial system , which makes the economy stronger so that it can resume its upward surge .
But by constantly putting " Band Aids " on problem areas – and by stopping the free markets from operating as they should – the central bank and lawmakers in Washington are only putting off the inevitable , and making sure that when those problems finally do reach home , they 'll be far bigger than they otherwise might have been .
" Let some people go bankrupt .
That 's what capitalism is , " he said .
" If you do n't let people fail , that 's not capitalism .
The Russians tried that , " and we all see where that got them .
Moves to Make Now
According to Rogers , investors should n't own dollar - denominated investments – especially currency or bonds – right now .
He actually sold U.S. investment banks short some time ago .
He also recently sold all his emerging markets investments , except for China , which he'd like to hold " forever . "
He advocated investments in the Japanese Yen , the Chinese Renminbi ( Yuan ) , the Swiss Franc , and perhaps other Asian currencies , too .
But there 's one real long - term play to make here :
Buy commodities , Rogers said .
Stay away from wheat , which has soared nearly vertically in the past few months , and will likely consolidate , at some point .
But Rogers likes most other agricultural commodities , specifically mentioning cotton , sugar and coffee .
[ For a related story on agricultural commodities – which includes some potential investment opportunities – please click here . ]
Rogers has long been an major advocate of China – as both a great long - term investment , and as the world 's next great country :
In fact , he has a new book – A Bull in China : Investing Profitably in the World 's Greatest Market – scheduled for publication in December .
Even so , Rogers warned that China could well be experiencing a stock - market bubble .
The country is actively working to try and control growth and inflation , but the very inefficiency of its not - fully - formed capital markets may make that impossible .
Even so , given how the Fed is mismanaging the U.S. monetary system , Rogers said he'd rather have the Chinese central bank on his side than the U.S. Federal Reserve .
" They are doing their best , " he said of the inflation - fighting efforts of China 's central bank .
But even if that market bubble were to burst , it might not accurately reflect the soundness of the underlying China economy , which Rogers said remains quite strong .
One thing , he said , may have nothing to do with the other .
In other words , should China 's soaring stock market prove to be a bubble that bursts , it will certainly be the ' Worst of Times ' for investors .
But it will remain the ' Best of Times ' for China 's workers , who care little about how many vacation days they get when they start a new job there .
Indeed , Rogers says that all they care about is how many days they can work .
If we look at that statement very closely , I believe that we 've been given yet one more snippet of wisdom from one of the investing world 's few true masters .

Meanwhile , French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner used a surprise trip to Baghdad to call on European countries to help the United States repair Iraq .
Kouchner ’s comments represent a major departure from former French president Jacques Chirac ’s stance on Iraq .
Relations between France and the United States were severely damaged after Chirac led global opposition to the 2003 invasion .
Since his election in May , French President Nicolas Sarkozy has sought to strengthen ties with the United States .
Kouchner told a French radio station that Iraq ’s leaders are “ expecting something ” from the French government and that he planned to assist U.S. efforts .
“ The Americans ca n’t get this country out of difficulty all alone , ” Kouchner said .
Kouchner ’s humanitarian background as co-founder of the medical relief group Medecins Sans Frontieres may begin to explain the willingness to overlook the anti-French GOP posturing of the not - so - distant past and to let bygones be bygones .

Democrats have votes to hold two White House officials in contempt by full House vote : report John Byrne and Nick Juliano
Published : Friday October 26 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) and House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers ( D - MI ) are surveying the House Democratic caucus to determine whether it will support holding White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten and former White House Counsel Harriet Miers in contempt for ducking subpoenas in the continuing investigation into the firing of nine US attorneys .
According to Bresnahan of Politico , Conyers said the contempt motion could be brought " as early as next week , " but that Pelosi had not made a final decision on the vote , saying it would be more likely in two weeks .
Democrats believe they have the votes to hold Miers and Bolten in contempt , Bresnahan says .
If a criminal contempt resolution passes , it would light new fires in a White House already struggling to stave off additional controversy .
The House Judiciary Committee approved a contempt resolution after both failed to show up for a July hearing , but it was not brought to the House floor for a vote .
Senior Democratic aides told the site they'd be able to round up the 218 votes needed from their caucus .
They expect Republicans to stand pat on their side of the aisle .
Several Democratic lawmakers purportedly said under condition of anonymity that they'd been polled on the move and all said they 'd back it if it came to the floor .
Conyers told Bresnahan he'd been in discussions with White House Counsel Fred Fielding to broker a compromise without success .
The House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Miers and Bolton June 13 .
Miers -- once tapped by President Bush to be a Supreme Court Justice -- was asked what her role was while serving in the White House ; Bolton was called because he was supposed to have kept track of documents related to the mass firings .
If the full House approves the contempt charges , Miers and Bolton are still unlikely to face any criminal penalties .
Before Alberto Gonzales resigned as Attorney General , the Justice Department informed the committee that it would not pursue criminal contempt charges against White House officials when executive privilege is invoked .
Democrats say the firings were politically motivated .
Conyers recommended contempt charges in July The House Judiciary Committee formally recommended criminal contempt charges against former White House counsel Harriet Miers and chief of staff Joshua Bolten for their failure to comply with an investigation into the firings July 25 .
The charges were presented in a resolution that , if passed by the House as a whole , would present a case for criminal proceedings to the US Attorney for the District of Columbia .
Gonzales instructed the Justice Department not to purse the charges because the White House has invoked executive privilege .
Attorney General nominee Michael Mukasey has said the department could pursue charges if executive privilege claims were " unreasonable , " but he hopes to avoid having to make such a decision .
The House Judiciary Committee voted 22 - 17 along party lines to send the Democratic measure to the full House .
Brian A. Benczkowski , principal deputy assistant attorney general , sent a letter to Conyers citing the department 's " long - standing " position , " articulated during administrations of both parties , that the criminal contempt of Congress statute does not apply to the president or presidential subordinates who assert executive privilege . "
Conyers introduction of the resolution was accompanied by a 52 - page report outlining the criminal charges against the administration officials .
Republicans sought to convince members of the majority not to get involved in a prolonged constitutional fight over executive privilege and accused Democrats of pursuing a partisan witch - hunt without basis in facts .
Democrats argued the contempt filing was necessary because of the disrespect with which the White House treated members of the committee .
" We have rolled over with every claim of executive privilege , " said Rep. Adam Schiff ( D - FL ) , who called Miers snub of the committee " beyond the pale . "
Judiciary Chairman John Conyers , D - Mich. , said the contempt charges were being sought " only as a last resort . "
" What I am not open to is accepting a take - it - or leave it offer , which would not allow us access to the information we need ... this is the only proposal we have received from White House counsel , " Conyers said .
Ranking Member James Sensenbrenner ( R - WI ) said he thought the White House would prevail in court against criminal charges .
Instead , he suggested a civil lawsuit that would focus narrowly on the claim of executive privilege in this particular case .
Rep. Chris Cannon ( R - UT ) said Democrats on the committee have offered no evidence of corruption and should not file contempt charges until they can prove inappropriate conduct within the White House .
Conyers said the lack of evidence was the fault of the White House for not cooperating , and explaining that that is exactly why the charges were being filed .
" We can't get to the evidence before we get to the witnesses and the documents that we 've requested , " Conyers said .
President Bush invoked executive privilege when refusing to allow Miers to appear before the committee .
She did not show up to testify when called July 12 ; Bolton refused to hand over White House documents sought by Democrats on the committee .
Republicans said Bush is entitled to confidential advice from his aides , and Congress does not have the right to subvert their ability to have private conversations with advisers .
Conyers said the president has yet to " personally " invoke privilege and reminded the committee that testimony has yet to reveal whether Bush was directly involved in the decisions leading to the attorneys being fired .
Correction : Because of an editing error , an early edition of this article incorrectly stated that two more White House officials had been held in contempt .
Contempt charges had been approved by the House Judiciary for both Miers and Bolten by Committee in July but not voted upon by the House .

OTTAWA , Sept. 19 — In an unusual approach to research and development , Barrick Gold offered a $ 10 million prize on Wednesday to any scientist , researcher or inventor who can increase the amount of silver the company recovers from a mine in Argentina .
Gold and silver extraction , which generally involves trickling diluted cyanide over crushed rock , has sometimes caused serious environmental problems .
But Barrick ’s decision to stake a prize for a new process comes from its frustration at recovering only 6.7 percent of the silver in its Veladero mine , compared to an 80 percent rate for its gold .
After several alternative techniques for removing the silver proved either unsuccessful or financially unfeasible , Gregory C. Wilkins , Barrick ’s chief executive and president , said the company thought it needed a broader approach .
“ This is a way to go out to the global scientific community to focus that intellectual horsepower , ” Mr. Wilkins said from the company ’s head office in Toronto .
“ Rather than limit the problem to a very small R.& D. staff , we have turned our R.& D. group into managers of research . ”
Oct. 12 , 2007  --
Seven - year - old Samuel Boutwell is an outgoing and well - spoken second grader .
He loves to play with his dogs and play soccer , but he loves something else even more .
Samuel is a Baptist preacher at a church in his home town of Brookhaven , a small town in southwestern Mississippi .
He also preaches outside in front of the local Wal - Mart , and has preached on the road in Virginia , Louisiana , Tennessee , Washington D.C. , and the streets of New York City .
Like many , Samuel said he became a preacher after he was " saved " by Jesus -- he just happened to be 3 years old at the time .
" After I got saved , I knew I could try to reach more people to try to get saved , " Samuel said .
His sin against God ?
Disobeying his mom .
And so the boy turned to Jesus .
When asked to describe God , Samuel said , " Can you show me a building that did n't have a builder , could you show me a painting that did n't have a painter ?
Because nobody made God .
He just exists . "
Samuel is home - schooled and fed a steady diet of Scripture , but his father , Kendall Boutwell , a born - again lay preacher himself , said the idea of preaching was all Samuel's .
' The Power of God '
Soon after he was saved , Samuel said God spoke to him by helping him come up with things to preach about .
" When I asked to preach , right when I think I can preach , God gives me something right there , " he said .
Randall Balmer , an Episcopal priest and preacher and a professor of religion at Barnard College , wondered if Samuel 's words truly come from divine inspiration .
" Is he merely parroting some line … that he gets from a parent , or from a minister , or is it something that comes from the wellspring of the soul ? "
Balmer asked .
Balmer is the author of a dozen books on religion ( his next book , " God in the White House : A History -- 1960-2004 , " will be published in spring 2008 ) .
He said that kids simply do n't have the life experience to preach .
" I believe that one 's calling as a minister arises out of the crucible of one 's experience … and there 's a certain maturity that comes with that , a certain understanding of the faith that comes with that . "
But Samuel 's father believes his son gets his understanding from God .
" I know he 's divinely inspired … if you listen to the messages , the different ones on the different subjects , yes , he 's definitely divinely inspired , " said TK .
He also believes that his son is not too young to preach .
Another child minister , 9 - year - old Terry Durham bills himself as the " little man of God . "
He 's a travel - worn veteran compared to Samuel Boutwell .
Terry has preached in cities around the country since he was only 4 years old .
But he does n't stop at just preaching .
His grandmother , Pastor Sharone Monroe , said that " ever since he was a baby he was layin ' hands and praying for people . "
Monroe raised Terry and taught him much of what he knows about preaching and touching people to take away their pain .
" When I touch the people , I feel God 's hands come into my hands , " said Terry , " and it 's so exciting to see God move in the midst of their problems . "
Terry calls himself a prophet , not a healer , and adults seem to flock to him .
He disagrees with the idea that he might be too young for preaching , saying " people say Jesus started at the age of 12 .
And they say that my grandmother is pushing me , but it 's not my grandmother , it 's the power of God that 's pushing me . "
Too Young for Some Topics ?
Samuel Boutwell has been taught to take the Bible at its word .
When it comes to the after - life , he takes a hard line .
He believes that anyone who is not saved by Jesus Christ will go to hell -- no exceptions .
" I wish he had taken his Bible and read Matthew 7:1 , where Jesus calls on his followers not to judge , lest they be judged , " Balmer said .
Balmer objects to such a young boy preaching and finds it " offensive to the faith . "
" This Christian faith is for me , and for millions of other people , a source of meaning , a source of truth , and to have it reduced to a kind of circus sideshow , I find deeply offensive . "
Samuel often preaches outside abortion clinics .
He said he knows what an abortion is and that he 's seen pictures of abortions .
" Women going in and they kill their child .
I 'll tell you the same thing I told my daddy one time :
If they do n't want to have their child they can give it to someone else , " he said .
When asked if he knows how babies are made , Samuel said that he does n't .
Balmer believes that no matter what ones view of abortion , it 's wrong to have a child preaching about a topic he could n't possibly understand fully .
" It seems to me that the child is being used as a kind of political prop , for a particular political ideology . "
But Samuel 's father argues that the boy is simply preaching the law of the Bible .
Samuel is clearly articulate and mature beyond his years .
Which is why it 's surprising when , in a candid moment , the fact that he is just a child becomes obvious .
When asked what makes him want to preach , Samuel replied , " You 're gonna have to ask my daddy that , I do n't know . "

In the new Futurama DVD Bender 's Big Score , the characters encounter Al Gore driving a taxi — a hybrid taxi , naturally .
Some viewers may chuckle when they notice that the license plate on the former Vice President 's cab reads NOCO2 .
But very few will realize that the the badge number on another cab , 87539319 , is also a joke .
Math geeks , however , will find that number hilarious because of something that happened about a century ago .
The British mathematician G.H. Hardy was paying a call on the Indian mathematician Srinivisa Ramanujan .
" I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one , " Hardy later recalled .
Ramanujan disagreed .
" It is a very interesting number , " he insisted .
" It is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways . "
The number 1729 can be expressed as 13 + 123 or it can be expressed as 93 + 103 .
The number 87539319 can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in three different ways , as 1673 + 4363 or as 2283 + 4233 , or 2553 + 4143 .
Much scholarly research has since been dedicated to so - called taxicab numbers like these .
Which means that a tiny percentage of mathematically inclined Futurama viewers will get a chuckle when they see a cartoon taxi that has a taxicab number printed on it .
Futurama , a show made by geeks for geeks , is shot through with impossibly obscure references like that .
" The number on Al Gore 's cab in that scene also has a secret meaning , " says David X. Cohen , who codeveloped Futurama with Matt Groening and serves as showrunner .
Cohen refuses to reveal the other gag , but if you visit a fan site like GotFuturama.com a few days after the DVD goes on sale , you 're likely to find a screenshot and a detailed explanation written by one of the hardcore fans .
" If you care enough , you frame - advance through it , " says Cohen .
" They 've earned that moment of pleasure . "
Cohen takes his math very seriously .
In his office at Matt Groening 's studio , he shows me a 25 - year - old plaque commemorating a math team victory .
He placed third in the entire state of New Jersey , and his team from Dwight Morrow High School in Englewood took first place in the state during his senior year , irking the preppies they competed against .
" It killed them that they were beaten by public school kids , " he chuckles .
" As a general rule , I hate watching TV or movies with mathematicians in it , " Cohen says .
" It never rings true .
They 're portrayed as magic beings .
There 's an implication that a normal person can't do math because they do n't have this magic power , which is very discouraging .
You do n't have to have Math - Ray Vision . "
Cohen is wearing a Math - Club T - shirt .
Unlike the plaque , this shirt is n't a cherished memento from his childhood .
It 's from an actual club for grownup math fans in the LA area .
Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox Film CorporationCohen was a physics major at Harvard , and he went on to study theoretical computer science at UC Berkeley , earning a master 's .
He decided to pursue comedy writing instead of academia , but his wonkiness often worked its way into his scripts .
In a 1995 Simpsons episode , Cohen devised an equation that appears briefly behind Homer Simpson :
178212 + 184112 = 192212
The equation appears to be a counterexample to a famous mathematical statement , Fermat 's Last Theorem .
Pierre de Fermat had proposed the theorem in 1637 , and a proof had only recently been discovered when the episode aired .
Cohen wrote a computer program to find near - misses for Fermat 's Last Theorem , equations that were close enough to being true that a person who tapped it into a calculator would be fooled .
The willingness to put that much effort into a gag that only a small fraction of his audience could possibly get would serve him well a few years later on Futurama .
( Download the original C program here . )
As showrunner on Futurama , Cohen assembled a team of writers with equally wonky backgrounds .
Ken Keeler , who scripted the pilot as well as the new DVD , has a PhD in applied math .
Stewart Burns , who wrote the Emmy - winning episode " Roswell That Ends Well , " has a master 's in math .
There are also PhDs in chemistry , philosophy , and computer science .
" It was the nerdiest writers ' room I 'd ever been in , and that 's saying something , " says Eric Horsted , whose previous experience on sitcoms like Home Improvement and Coach did n't prepare him for the intense discussions about string theory and quantum mechanics .
Futurama was geek - friendly to begin with : Episodes are built around sci- fi staples like parallel universes , spaceship battles , and time travel .
But look more closely and you 'll spot fleeting jokes that are geekier than a Slashdot comments thread , gags about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle , particle physics , and the P=NP problem .
This sort of material helped make Futurama a cult favorite that fans wanted to buy on DVD and frame - advance through , looking for more hidden treasure .
The show was canceled in 2002 , but its popularity on DVD and in syndication led Fox to green - light four feature - length DVDs worth of new shows .
One of the bonus features on the first of the new DVDs explores the role of math on the show .
" The lecture is by professor Sarah Greenwald of Appalachian State University , " says Cohen .
" She discusses various mathematical references over the history of the series , and her talk is intercut with clips from the episodes she refers to . "
( Greenwald has a raft of interviews with the Futurama writers online here . )
Cohen refers to a One Percent Rule that guided the writing on Futurama .
When they were scripting the episode " Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch , " a character claims that he painstakingly programmed a holographic simulation using " 4 million lines of BASIC . "
One writer pointed out that 99 percent of the audience would n't get the reference to an old programming language .
Producer - writer Eric Kaplan responded , " Fuck them ! "
As long as it does n't derail the enjoyment of the 99 percent , Futurama will make a joke tailored to the nerdiest 1 percent of its audience .
" That 1 percent becomes a fan for life , " says Cohen .

THE TOP 40 REASONS TO DOUBT THE OFFICIAL STORY OF SEPTEMBER 11th , 2001
… An outline in simple talking points …
NEW for the 16th anniversary —
We hope the updated site makes it easy to find what you are looking for among the thousands of articles here at 911 Truth.org .
( It will take quite a long time to get all of the articles connected . )
Below is a sampling of the many articles that back virtually every point made by by James Corbett in the video above .
Much of the basic research is supported by entries at the Complete 9/11 Timeline ( formerly known as cooperativeresearch.org ) and the NY Attorney General Spitzer petition and complaint ( Justicefor911.org ) .
THE DAY ITSELF – EVIDENCE OF COMPLICITY
1 ) AWOL Chain of Command
a .
It is well documented that the officials topping the chain of command for response to a domestic attack – George W. Bush , Donald Rumsfeld , Richard Myers , Montague Winfield , Ralph Eberhart – all found reason to do something else during the actual attacks , other than assuming their duties as decision - makers .
b. Who was actually in charge ?
Dick Cheney , Richard Clarke , Norman Mineta and the 9/11 Commission directly conflict in their accounts of top - level response to the unfolding events , such that several ( or all ) of them must be lying .
A short production of news clips detailing George W. Bush ’s 9/11 inaction , including his post - attack foot dragging on establishing an independent investigation into the worst attack ever on United States soil .
Bush was clearly negligent in his duty on 9/11 , not only as President , but also as our Commander in Chief .
His inaction alone is reason enough to re-open the 9/11 investigation .
Throw in the fact that Donald Rumsfeld was not at his post directing a defense for this country , and that Dick Cheney tracked the Pentagon attack “ vehicle ” from over 50 miles out and still did not shoot the object down , and you have negligence and dereliction of duty at the highest levels of the U.S. government .
2 ) Air Defense Failures
a . The US air defense system failed to follow standard procedures for responding to diverted passenger flights .
b. Timelines :
The various responsible agencies – NORAD , FAA , Pentagon , USAF , as well as the 9/11 Commission – gave radically different explanations for the failure ( in some cases upheld for years ) , such that several officials must have lied ; but none were held accountable .
c. Was there an air defense standdown ?
3 ) Pentagon Strike
How was it possible the Pentagon was hit 1 hour and 20 minutes after the attacks began ?
Why was there no response from Andrews Air Force Base , just 10 miles away and home to Air National Guard units charged with defending the skies above the nation ’s capital ?
How did Hani Hanjour , a man who failed as a Cessna pilot on his first flight in a Boeing , execute a difficult aerobatic maneuver to strike the Pentagon ?
Why did the attack strike the just - renovated side , which was largely empty and opposite from the high command ?
4 ) Wargames
a. US military and other authorities planned or actually rehearsed defensive response to all elements of the 9/11 scenario during the year prior to the attack – including multiple hijackings , suicide crashbombings , and a strike on the Pentagon .
b . The multiple military wargames planned long in advance and held on the morning of September 11th included scenarios of a domestic air crisis , a plane crashing into a government building , and a large - scale bio- terrorism emergency in New York .
If this was only an incredible series of coincidences , why did the official investigations avoid the issue ?
There is evidence that the wargames created confusion as to whether the unfolding events were “ real world or exercise . ”
Did wargames serve as the cover for air defense sabotage , and / or the execution of an “ inside job ” ?

5 ) Flight 93
Did the Shanksville crash occur at 10:06 ( according to a seismic report ) or 10:03 ( according to the 9/11 Commission ) ?
Does the Commission wish to hide what happened in the last three minutes of the flight , and if so , why ?
Was Flight 93 shot down , as indicated by the scattering of debris over a trail of several miles ?
THE DAY – POSSIBLE SMOKING GUNS
6 ) Did cell phones work at 30,000 feet in 2001 ?
How many hijackings were attempted ?
How many flights were diverted ?
7 ) Demolition Hypothesis
What caused the collapse of a third skyscraper , WTC 7 , which was not hit by a plane ?
Were the Twin Towers and WTC 7 brought down by explosives ?
( See “ The Case for Demolitions , ” the websites wtc7. net and 911research.wtc7.net , and the influential article by physicist Steven Jones .
See also items no. 16 and 24 , below . ) [ See Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth ]
FOREKNOWLEDGE & THE ALLEGED HIJACKERS
8 ) What did officials know ?
How did they know it ?
a. Multiple allied foreign agencies informed the US government of a coming attack in detail , including the manner and likely targets of the attack , the name of the operation ( the “ Big Wedding ” ) , and the names of certain men later identified as being among the perpetrators .
b. Various individuals came into possession of specific advance knowledge , and some of them tried to warn the US prior to September 11th .
c. Certain prominent persons received warnings not to fly on the week or on the day of September 11th .
9 ) Able Danger , Plus – Surveillance of Alleged Hijackers
a . The men identified as the 9/11 ringleaders were under surveillance for years beforehand , on the suspicion they were terrorists , by a variety of US and allied authorities – including the CIA , the US military ’s “ Able Danger ” program , the German authorities , Israeli intelligence and others .
b. Two of the alleged ringleaders who were known to be under surveillance by the CIA also lived with an FBI asset in San Diego , but this is supposed to be yet another coincidence .
10 ) Obstruction of FBI Investigations prior to 9/11
A group of FBI officials in New York systematically suppressed field investigations of potential terrorists that might have uncovered the alleged hijackers – as the Moussaoui case once again showed .
The stories of Sibel Edmonds , Robert Wright , Coleen Rowley and Harry Samit , the “ Phoenix Memo , ” David Schippers , the 199i orders restricting investigations , the Bush administration ’s order to back off the Bin Ladin family , the reaction to the “ Bojinka ” plot , and John O’Neil do not , when considered in sum , indicate mere incompetence , but high - level corruption and protection of criminal networks , including the network of the alleged 9/11 conspirators .
( Nearly all of these examples were omitted from or relegated to fleeting footnotes in /11 Commission Report . )

11 ) Insider Trading
a. Unknown speculators allegedly used foreknowledge of the Sept. 11th events to profiteer on many markets internationally – including but not limited to “ put options ” placed to short - sell the two airlines , WTC tenants , and WTC re-insurance companies in Chicago and London .
See Billions in Pre-911 Insider Trading Profits Leaves a Hot Trail and Criminal Insider Trading leads directly to CIA .
b. Initial reports on these trades , such as Profiting from Disaster and Suspicious Trading , were suppressed and forgotten , and only years later did the 9/11 Commission and SEC provide a partial , but untenable explanation for only a small number of transactions ( covering only the airline put options through the Chicago Board of Exchange ) .
c. In addition , suspicious monetary transactions worth hundreds of millions were conducted through offices at the Twin Towers during the actual attacks .
The German firm , Convar , recovered financial data from hard drives recovered from Ground Zero although the Commission published this FBI briefing on trading in which agents expressed a lack of knowledge and doubt about the data recovery long after the data was transmitted to the FBI .
Here is an update on Oh the places you go ( when you follow the money ) .
d . See this interview with Bill Bergman who worked at the Chicago Federal Reserve for over 13 years as an economist and financial markets policy analyst .
He was fired when he raised concerns about unusual currency transactions pre- 9 - 11 .
12 ) Who were the perpetrators ?
a . Much of the evidence establishing who did the crime is dubious and miraculous : bags full of incriminating material that happened to miss the flight or were left in a van ; the “ magic passport ” of an alleged hijacker , found at Ground Zero ; documents found at motels where the alleged perpetrators had stayed days and weeks before 9/11 .
b . The identities of the alleged hijackers remain unresolved , there are contradictions in official accounts of their actions and travels , and there is evidence several of them had “ doubles , ” all of which is omitted from official investigations .
c. What happened to initial claims by the government that 50 people involved in the attacks had been identified , including the 19 alleged hijackers , with 10 still at large ( suggesting that 20 had been apprehended ) ?

Where did they get their VISAS ?

13 ) Who Is Osama Bin Ladin ?
a . Who judges which of the many conflicting and dubious statements and videos attributed to Osama Bin Ladin are genuine , and which are fake ?
The most important Osama Bin Ladin video ( Nov. 2001 ) , in which he supposedly confesses to masterminding 9/11 , appears to be a fake .
In any event , the State Department ‘s translation of it is fraudulent .
b. Did Osama Bin Ladin visit Dubai and meet a CIA agent in July 2001 ( Le Figaro ) ?
Was he receiving dialysis in a Pakistani military hospital on the night of September 10 , 2001 ( CBS ) ?
c. Whether by Bush or Clinton : Why is Osama always allowed to escape ?
The Hunt For Bin Laden
Watch this video on YouTube
d . The terror network associated with Osama , known as the “ base ” ( al - Qaeda ) , originated in the CIA - sponsored 1980s anti-Soviet jihad in Afghanistan .
When did this network stop serving as an asset to covert operations by US intelligence and allied agencies ?
What were its operatives doing in Kosovo , Bosnia and Chechnya in the years prior to 9/11 ?
14 ) All the Signs of a Systematic 9/11 Cover-up
a. 911 Truth .
Org broke the story that Airplane black boxes were found at Ground Zero , according to two first responders and an unnamed NTSB official , but they were “ disappeared ” and their existence is denied in /11 Commission Report .
b. US officials consistently suppressed and destroyed evidence ( like the tapes recorded by air traffic controllers who handled the New York flights ) .
NEADS recordings damaged during transcription .
Ground Zero steel sold for scrap .
c. Whistleblowers ( like Sibel Edmonds and Anthony Shaffer ) were intimidated , gagged and sanctioned , sending a clear signal to others who might be thinking about speaking out .
d. Officials who “ failed ” ( like Myers and Eberhard , as well as Frasca , Maltbie and Bowman of the FBI ) were given promotions .
15 ) Poisoning New York
The White House deliberately pressured the EPA into giving false public assurances that the toxic air at Ground Zero was safe to breathe .
This knowingly contributed to an as - yet unknown number of health cases and fatalities , and demonstrates that the administration does consider the lives of American citizens to be expendable on behalf of certain interests .
16 ) Disposing of the Crime Scene
The rapid and illegal scrapping of the WTC ruins at Ground Zero disposed of almost all of the structural steel indispensable to any investigation of the collapse mechanics .
( See also item no. 23 , below . )
17 ) Anthrax
Mailings of weapons - grade anthrax – which caused a practical suspension of the 9/11 investigations – were traced back to US military stock .
Soon after the attacks began in October 2001 , the FBI approved the destruction of the original samples of the Ames strain , disposing of perhaps the most important evidence in identifying the source of the pathogens used in the mailings .
Were the anthrax attacks timed to coincide with the Afghanistan invasion ?
Why were the letters sent only to media figures and to the leaders of the opposition in the Senate ( who had just raised objections to the USA PATRIOT Act ) ?
Calls were issued to investigate the investigators .
18 ) The Stonewall
a. Colin Powell promised a “ white paper ” from the State Department to establish the authorship of the attacks by al - Qaeda .
This was never forthcoming , and was instead replaced by a paper from Tony Blair , which presented only circumstantial evidence , with very few points actually relating to September 11th .
b. Bush and Cheney pressured the ( freshly - anthraxed ) leadership of the Congressional opposition into delaying the 9/11 investigation for months .
The administration fought against the creation of an independent investigation for more than a year .
c. The White House thereupon attempted to appoint Henry Kissinger as the chief investigator , and acted to underfund and obstruct the 9/11 Commission .
d. Failure to release the missing 28 pages from the Joint Inquiry .
19 ) A Record of Official Lies
a . “ No one could have imagined planes into buildings ” – a transparent falsehood upheld repeatedly by Rice , Rumsfeld and Bush .
b. “ Iraq was connected to 9/11 ″ – The most “ outrageous conspiracy theory ” of all , with the most disastrous impact .
c. CIA misleads FBI about hijackers in US .
20 ) Pakistani Connection – Congressional Connection
a . The Pakistani intelligence agency ISI , creator of the Taliban and close ally to both the CIA and “ al - Qaeda , ” allegedly wired $ 100,000 to Mohamed Atta just prior to September 11th , reportedly through the ISI asset Omar Saeed Sheikh ( later arrested for the killing of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl , who was investigating ISI connections to “ al - Qaeda . ” )
b. This was ignored by the congressional 9/11 investigation , although the senator and congressman who ran the probe ( Bob Graham and Porter Goss ) were meeting with the ISI chief , Mahmud Ahmed , on Capitol Hill on the morning of September 11th .
c. About 25 percent of the report of the Congressional Joint Inquiry was redacted , including long passages regarding how the attack ( or the network allegedly behind it ) was financed .
Graham later said foreign allies were involved in financing the alleged terror network , but that this would only come out in 30 years .
21 ) 9/11 Commission :
a . The September 11th families who fought for and gained an independent investigation ( the 9/11 Commission ) posed 400 - plus questions , which the 9/11 Commission adopted as its roadmap .
The vast majority of these questions were completely ignored in the Commission hearings and the final report .
b. The membership and staff of the 9/11 Commission displayed awesome conflicts of interest .
The families called for the resignation of Executive Director Philip Zelikow , a Bush administration member and close associate of “ star witness ” Condoleezza Rice , and were snubbed .
Commission member Max Cleland resigned , condemning the entire exercise as a “ scam ” and “ whitewash . ”
c./11 Commission
Report is notable mainly for its contradictions , obvious omissions , distortions and outright falsehoods – ignoring anything incompatible with the official story , banishing the issues to footnotes , and even dismissing the still - unresolved question of who financed 9/11 as being “ of little practical significance . ”
22 ) Crown Witnesses Held at Undisclosed Locations
The alleged masterminds of 9/11 , Khalid Sheikh Mohamed ( KSM ) and Ramzi Binalshibh , are reported to have been captured in 2002 and 2003 , although one Pakistani newspaper said KSM was killed in an attempted capture .
They have been held at undisclosed locations and their supposed testimonies , as provided in transcript form by the government , form much of the basis for the 9/11 Commission Report ( although the Commission ’s request to see them in person was denied ) .
After holding them for years , why does n’t the government produce these men and put them to trial ?
23 ) Spitzer Redux
a. Eliot Spitzer , attorney general of New York State , snubbed pleas by New York citizens to open 9/11 as a criminal case ( Justicefor911.org ) .
b. Spitzer also refused to allow his employee , former 9/11 Commission staff member Dietrich Snell , to testify to the Congress about his ( Snell ’s ) role in keeping “ Able Danger ” entirely out of /11 Commission Report .
24 ) NIST Omissions
After the destruction of the WTC structural steel , the official Twin Towers collapse investigation was left with almost no forensic evidence , and thus could only provide dubious computer models of ultimately unprovable hypotheses .
It failed to even test for the possibility of explosives .
( Why not clear this up ? )
25 ) Radio Silence
The 9/11 Commission and NIST both allowed the continuing cover -up of how Motorola ’s faulty radios , purchased by the Giuliani administration , caused firefighter deaths at the WTC – once again showing the expendability , even of the first responders .
26 ) The Legal Catch - 22
a. Hush Money – Accepting victims ’ compensation barred September 11th families from pursuing discovery through litigation .
b. Judge Hellerstein –
Those who refused compensation to pursue litigation and discovery had their cases consolidated under the same judge ( and as a rule dismissed ) .
c. Foreign states have sovereign immunity .
[ See Saudi Connections below ]
27 ) Saudi Connections
a . The 9/11 investigations made light of the “ Bin Ladin Airlift ” during the no-fly period , and ignored the long - standing Bush family business ties to the Bin Ladin family fortune .
( A company in which both families held interests , the Carlyle Group , was holding its annual meeting on September 11th , with George Bush Sr. , James Baker , and two brothers of Osama Bin Ladin in attendance . )
b. The issue of Ptech .
c. Saudi connections to terrorism financing and 9/11 hijackers .
28 ) Media Blackout of Prominent Doubters
The official story has been questioned and many of the above points were raised by members of the US Congress , retired high - ranking officers of the US military , the three leading third - party candidates for President in the 2004 election , a member of the 9/11 Commission who resigned in protest , a former high - ranking adviser to the George W. Bush administration , former ministers to the German , British and Canadian governments , the commander - in - chief of the Russian air force , 100 luminaries who signed the “ 9/11 Truth Statement , ” and the presidents of Iran and Venezuela .
Not all of these people agree fully with each other , but all would normally be considered newsworthy .
Why has the corporate - owned US mass media remained silent about these statements , granting due coverage only to the comments of actor Charlie Sheen ?
GEOPOLITICS , TIMING AND POSSIBLE MOTIVES
29 ) “ The Great Game ”
The Afghanistan invasion was ready for Bush ’s go - ahead on September 9 , 2001 , with US and UK force deployments to the region already in place or underway .
This followed the failure earlier that year of backdoor diplomacy with the Taliban ( including payments of $ 125 million in US government aid to Afghanistan ) , in an attempt to secure a unity government for that country as a prerequisite to a Central Asian pipeline deal .
30 ) The Need for a “ New Pearl Harbor ”
Principals in US foreign policy under the current Bush administration ( including Cheney , Rumsfeld , Wolfowitz , Perle and others ) have been instrumental in developing long - running plans for worldwide military hegemony , including an invasion of the Middle East , dating back to the Ford , Reagan and Bush Sr. administrations .
They reiterated these plans in the late 1990s as members of the “ Project for a New American Century , ” and stated a clear intent to invade Iraq for the purpose of “ regime change . ”
After 9/11 , they lost no time in their attempt to tie Iraq to the attacks .
31 ) Perpetual “ War on Terror ”
9/11 is supposed to provide carte - blanche for an open - ended , global and perpetual “ War on Terror , ” against any enemy , foreign or domestic , that the executive branch chooses to designate , and regardless of whether evidence exists to actually connect these enemies to 9/11 .
32 ) Attacking the Constitution
a . The USA PATRIOT
Act was written before 9/11 , Homeland Security and the “ Shadow Government ” were developed long before 9/11 , and plans for rounding up dissidents as a means for suppressing civil disturbance have been in the works for decades .
b. 9/11 was used as the pretext to create a new , extra-constitutional executive authority to declare anyone an “ enemy combatant ” ( including American citizens ) , to detain persons indefinitely without habeas corpus , and to “ render ” such persons to secret prisons where torture is practiced .
33 ) Legal Trillions
9/11 triggers a predictable shift of public spending to war , and boosts public and private spending in the “ new ” New Economy of “ Homeland Security , ” biometrics , universal surveillance , prisons , civil defense , secured enclaves , security ,
etc .
34 ) Plundered Trillions ?
On September 10 , 2001 , Donald Rumsfeld announced a “ war on waste ” after an internal audit found that the Pentagon was “ missing ” 2.3 trillion dollars in unaccounted assets .
On September 11th , this was as good as forgotten .
35 ) Did 9/11 prevent a stock market crash ?
Did anyone benefit from the destruction of the Securities and Exchange Commission offices at WTC 7 , and the resultant crippling of hundreds of fraud investigations ?
36 ) Resource Wars
a . What was discussed in the Energy Task Force meetings under Dick Cheney in 2001 ?
Why is the documentation of these meetings still being suppressed ?
b. Is Peak Oil a motive for 9/11 as inside job ?
37 ) The “ Little Game ”
Why was the WTC privatized just before its destruction ?
HISTORY
38 ) “ Al - CIA -da ? ”
The longstanding relationship between US intelligence networks and radical Islamists , including the network surrounding Osama Bin Ladin .
( See also point 13d . )
39 ) Historical Precedents for “ Synthetic Terror ”
a .
In the past many states , including the US government , have sponsored attacks on their own people , fabricated the “ cause for war , ” created ( and armed ) their own enemies of convenience , and sacrificed their own citizens for “ reasons of state . ”
b. Was 9/11 an update of the Pentagon - approved “ Project Northwoods ” plan for conducting self - inflicted , false - flag terror attacks in the United States , and blaming them on a foreign enemy ?
40 ) Secret Government
a . The record of criminality and sponsorship of coups around the world by the covert networks based within the US intelligence complex .
b. Specifically also :
The evidence of crime by Bush administration principals and their associates , from October Surprise to Iran-Contra and the S&L plunder to PNAC , Enron / Halliburton and beyond .

[ Amazon Kindle Store ]
OTTAWA ( Reuters ) - The Canadian Parliament was set to overrule the country ’s nuclear watchdog on Wednesday and order a reactor that makes crucial radioisotopes for cancer tests be restarted immediately .
The Chalk River reactor -- which makes more than two - thirds of global supply of the medical isotopes -- was shut down in November , quickly triggering shortages .
The Conservative government , under heavy political pressure to solve the problem , is pushing through legislation that will allow the reactor to resume operations for 120 days .
This would involve using back - up safety systems , an action that the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission says is unsafe .
The House of Commons approved the bill on Tuesday night and the Senate is expected to follow suit on Wednesday .
Once the reactor is restarted it will take three or four days before operator Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd can begin delivering isotopes .
When injected into the body , the isotopes give off radiation that can be seen by a camera to diagnose cancer , heart disease and other medical conditions .
Government ministers insist there is no danger in restarting the reactor now .
“ This was always an issue of public interest and it was the right thing to do .
We ’ve had absolute reassurance that we could resume production of medical isotopes , and 100 percent assurances of safety and that ’s what our goal was all along , ” Natural Resources Minister Gary Lunn told Reuters .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper strongly criticized nuclear commission boss Linda Keen on Tuesday , saying she was being unreasonable , but Keen did not change her opposition to the government ’s plan .
“ This provides significant risk not only to the reactor but to the employees and the communities that live around this reactor , ” she told a special meeting of legislators late on Tuesday night .
At least one medical specialist hailed the emergency move , saying it would be welcomed by hospitals everywhere .
“ This is a crucial thing , a great Christmas present for us , for sure , ” said Dr Andrew Ross , a nuclear medicine specialist in the eastern Canadian city of Halifax .
“ We have been living day to day , ” he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. on Wednesday .
AECL , the government - owned nuclear technology company that operates the reactor , had earlier said it would not be back to full output until early to mid-January .
But on Tuesday it said “ heroic efforts ” by staff meant the facility could be restarted on December 20 without having to resort to the back - up safety procedure .
Chalk River produces medical isotopes for Canadian health care company MDS Inc and its MDS Nordion division , which is responsible for about 50 percent of world supply .
Edit :
So if you 're not interested in the technical details , and just want web stats for your S3 account , you can head over to
Web Stats for Amazon S3
This was written before we launched S3stat , a service that parses your Amazon S3 server access logs and delivers usage reports back to your S3 bucket .
So if you 're not interested in the technical details , and just want web stats for your S3 account , you can head over to www.S3stat.com and save yourself a bunch of hassle .
Amazon 's Simple Storage Service ( S3 ) is a great content delivery network for those of us with modest needs .
It 's got all the buzzwords you could possibly want : geo - targeted delivery , fully redundant storage , guaranteed 99.9 % uptime , and a bunch of other stuff that you could never pull off on your own .
And it 's dirt cheap .
Of course , there 's always a catch , and in S3's case you 'll soon find that your $ 4.83 a month does n't buy you much in the way of reports .
With some digging around at Amazon 's AWS site , you can find out how much you were charged last month , but that 's about it .
( OK , If you 're persistent , you can download a CSV report full of tiny fractions of pennies that , when added together , tell you how much you were charged last month . )
The Motivation
I love my web statistics .
I 'm up and waiting at 12:07 am every morning for the nightly Webalizer job to run so that I can see how many unique visitors came in to Blogabond today ( 1227 ) , and what they were searching for ( tourist trap in Beijing ) .
I 've been hosting my user 's photos out at S3 for a few months now , and though I 've watched my bandwidth usage drop through the floor , I 've also been missing my web stats fix for all those precious pageviews .
Something had to be done .
I started digging around through Amazon 's AWS docs .
It turns out that you can actually get detailed usage logs out of S3 , and if you 're willing to suffer through some tedium , you can even get useful reports out of them .
Setting it up
Turning on Server Access Logging is just about the easiest thing that you can do in S3 .
If you 've ever tried to use Amazon 's APIs , you can translate that to mean that it 's hard .
It takes two steps , and unless you 're looking at a Unix command prompt , you 'll need to write some custom code to pull it off .
Here 's what you do :
1 . Set the proper permissions for the bucket you 'd like to log .
You 'll need to add a special Logging user to the Access Control List for the bucket , and give that user permission to upload and modify files .
2 . Send the " Start Logging " command , including a little XML packet filled with settings for your bucket .
The nice people at Amazon have put together a simple 4 page walkthrough that you can follow to accomplish the above .
I 've run through it , and it works as advertised
Parsing the logs
Now we 're getting to the fun part .
Remember above where we noted that S3 has servers living all over the world delivering redundant copies of your content to users in different countries ?
Well now we get to pay the price for that .
You see , Amazon sort of punted on the issue of how to put all those server logs back together into something you can use .
Instead , every once in a while , each server will hand you back a little log fragment containing anywhere between 1 and 1,000,000 lines of data .
Over a 24 hour period , you can expect to accumulate about 200 files , ordered roughly by date but overlapping substantially with one another .
So , now in order to get a single day 's logs into a usable form , we get to :
3. Download the day 's logs .
This is simple enough , as the S3 Rest API gives us a nice ListBucket ( ) method that accepts a file filter .
We can ask for , say all files that match the pattern " log/access_log-2007-10-25-* " , and download each file individually .
We 'll end up with a folder containing something like this :

4. Transform columns from S3's Server Access Log Format into the more useful Combined Logfile Format .
In the Unix world , we could easily pull this off with sed .
In this case though , we might actually want to process each line by hand , since we still need to ...
5. Concatenate and Sort records into a single file .
There are lots of ways to accomplish this , and they 're all a bit painful and slow .
When I did this myself , I wrote a little combined transformer / sorter that spun through all the files at once and accomplished steps 4 and 5 in a single pass .
Still , there 's lots of room here for speed tweaking , so I 'll leave this one as an exercise for the reader .
6 . Feed the output from Step 5 into your favorite Web Log Analyzer .
This is the big payoff , since you 'll soon be looking at some tasty HTML files full of charts and graphs .
I prefer the output produced by The Webalizer , but there are plenty of free and cheap options out there for this .
Wrapping up
And that 's about it .
Now all that 's left is to tape it all together into a single script and set it to run as a nightly job .
Keep in mind that S3 dates its files using Greenwich Mean Time , so , depending where you live , you might have to wait a few extra hours past midnight before you can process your logs .
All together , this took me a little more than a day of effort to get a good script running .
It was n't easy , but then nothing about administering S3 ever is .
Epilogue ( the birth of S3 STAT .com )
I went through this pain and wrote this article about a week ago .
Before posting it , it occurred to me that hardly anybody will ever actually follow the steps that I outlined above .
It 's just too much work , with too little payoff .
What the world needs is a simple service that people can use to just automate the process .
Type in your access keys and bucket name , and it will just set everything up for you .
Let 's see ...
People need this thing ...
I 've already built it ... ...umm... Hey !
I 've got an idea !
Variant Perception in Science
I love finding disconnects in the market ( i.e. , the PPI data today ) ;
Unfortunately , the people who fail to understand what the scientific methodology entails are pressing in the political realm -- rather than in the market place .
We have seen they dare not try their silly little stunts in the peer reviewed scientific sphere .
If only these people were investors -- we would be emptying their bank accounts !
In politics , perception is reality , and so , for the most part , the penalty for deviating from reality is de minimus .
In the stock market , you cannot create your own reality -- at least not for long .
Eventually , the market place comes around to the numerical facts -- i.e economics , revenues , and earnings .
For example :
In surveys conducted in 2005 , people in the United States and 32 European countries ( The same question was posed to Japanese adults in 2001 ) .
Respondants were asked whether to respond “ true , ” “ false ” or “ not sure ” to this statement :
“ Human beings , as we know them , developed from earlier species of animals . ”
It turns out that the United States had the second - highest percentage of adults who said the statement was false -- and the second - lowest percentage who said the statement was true , researchers reported in the current issue of Science .
( Only adults in Turkey expressed more doubts on evolution ) .
What is the penalty for this belief system ?
Well , you probably wo n't get a Science - based job -- but that 's about it .
The acceptance of evolution is lower in the United States than in Japan or Europe , largely because of widespread fundamentalism and the politicization of science in the United States .
That -- and the lack of any sort of financial or societal disincentive for the belief system .
At least so far . . .

It is a body of techniques for investigating natural phenomena and acquiring new knowledge , as well as for correcting and integrating previous knowledge .
It posits theories which are used until better theories come along .
Example : Gravity is a theory that works so well we assume it to be a fact .
And if one day a better theory of gravitation comes along that predicts the motion of bodies and interaction of masses better than the present one , well then we will throw out the old theory and replace it with the better one .
Scientific Method assumes that its theories are subject to revision as additional evidence is acquired .
No axioms are invioable , every thesis is subject to rigorous testing and peer review ;
Every theory is based on observable , empirical , measurable evidence , and subject to laws of reasoning .
All the acquired data are collectively called scientific evidence .

Soldiers fired machine guns and tear gas into massive crowds of demonstrators in Burma 's largest city on Thursday , reportedly killing nine people and wounding 11 others in a crackdown on anti-government protests that havegripped the isolated country for almost two weeks .

Ye Htut , a spokesman for the ruling military junta , said riot police clashed with anti-government protesters in Rangoon on Thursday , killing nine people and injuring 11 .
Thirty - one government troops were also injured , he said .
Themilitary 's use of deadly forceagainst Buddhist monks and their supporters has drawn fierce condemnation from the international community , as well asacall for " restraint " for the first time Thursdayfrom the Burmese junta 's traditional ally and trading partner , China .
Thursday 's gunshots sent people fleeing through the streets of Rangoon , while at least 100 protesters were seized by soldiers and carted off in trucks .
Among the dead in today 's clashes is Kenji Nagai , 50 , a journalist covering the protests inRangoon for Japanese video news agency APF News .
He was confirmed dead after his father and company representative identified him in a photo .
The crowds , estimated at between 70,000 and 100,000 people , swelled Thursday after the military made sweeping arrests of hundreds of Burmese monks shortly before dawn .
Soldiers reportedly broke into monasteries in the city of Rangoon and elsewhere , and took awaymonks who have been part of a protest movement that has led anti-government demonstrations for 11 straight days in Burma , a poor southeast Asian country also known as Myanmar .
In this photo made available by the Mandalay Gazette , blood soaked sandals commonly worn by monks are shown on a street following a shooting by soldiers during the Rangoon protest .
( ( Associated Press ) )
Some of the Buddhist monks were beaten during the arrests , eyewitnesses said .
Ally China urges ' restraint '
Most foreign journalists have been barred fromBurma and thegovernment is now consideringcurbing cellphone and internet access in the country , the CBC's Michael MacAuliffe reported fromBangkok , in neighbouring Thailand .
Reports of the violence are coming from eyewitnesses who are calling reporters abroad and sending photographs and videos by theinternet , said Burmese exile Kyan Moe , who now lives in Ottawa .
" We have a lot of citizen reporters helping us to get the message out , " he told CBC News on Thursday .
" They are very committed . …
The public anger is growing . "
The international community has sought China ' shelp to use its influence overBurma 's military regime toquell the violent clampdown .
On Wednesday , China and Russia used their veto powers in the United Nations Security Council toblock U.S. and European efforts to condemn the military 's actions .
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang
Yu said in Beijing on Thursday that " China hopes that all parties in Myanmar exercise restraint and properly handle the current issue so as to ensure the situation there does not escalate and get complicated . "
Burma 's foreign ministerinformed UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon thatthe governmentwill allowUN special envoy Ibrahim Gambari into the country to investigate the situation , the UN said .
Also on Thursday , the U.S. Treasury Departmentimposed economic sanctions against 14senior Burmese officials , includingthe junta leader , Senior Gen .
Than Shwe , and the No. 2 man in the military regime , Deputy Senior Gen. Maung Aye .
" Every civilized nation has a responsibility to stand up for people suffering under a brutal military regime like the one that has ruled Burma for too long , " U.S. President George W. Bush said in a statement .
Standoffs in front of monasteries
While protesters came under fire in downtown Rangoon , in front of the Sule Pagoda , monks gathered at the Ngwe Kyar Yan monastery eight kilometres away were surrounded by at least 250 pro-government supporters armed with bamboo poles .
Japanese video journalist Kenji Nagai , shown in this April 2003 photo , was found dead in Rangoon after the military fired on the protesters .
(( Kyodo TV News / Associated Press ) )
Standoffs were also reported in the city of Mandalay , while witnesses said five men were arrested and severely beaten as soldiers moved in on a crowd gathered near a bridge east of downtown Rangoon .
The demonstrations , led by the country 's revered monks , have been staged daily since Sept. 17 , as protesters demand more democratic freedom , the release of political activists and economic reforms in a country that has been ruled by a military junta in one form or another since 1962 .
The demonstrations were sparked by the government 's decision in August to double the price of fuel , bringing more hardship to the impoverished country .
Initially the government handled the protests with restraint , but Wednesday , soldiers moved into the crowd and media reports said between two and eight monks were killed .
The government has acknowledged that one man died .
The government Tuesday night banned public gatherings of more than five people and imposed a 9 p.m. curfews .
The first mass arrests came Wednesday , with well - known anti-government figures like comedian Zarganar carted away .
' Soldiers slammed the monastery gate with the car '
On Thursday morning , security forces raided at least four monasteries considered hotbeds of the pro-democracy movement .
" Soldiers slammed the monastery gate with the car , breaking the lock and forcing it into the monastery , " said one monk at the Ngwe Kyar Yan monastery as he pointed to bloodstains on the monastery floor , which was littered with broken doors , furniture and glass .
" They smashed the doors down , broke windows and furniture .
When the monks resisted , they shot at the monks and used tear gas and beat up the monks and dragged them into trucks . "
The monk , who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal , said between 100 and 150 monks were taken away .
Freelance journalist Andrew Chant , speaking to CBC News from Bangkok , said the action against Buddhist monks , who are highly revered in Burma , will not be well - received in the country .
" This kind of action against the monks , and the brutality toward the monks will only enrage the population of Rangoon , " he said .
Also Thursday , more than 100 soldiers surrounded the house of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi , a Nobel Peace Prize winner who has been under house arrest for several years .
There were rumours she had been taken into custody , but an Asian diplomat speaking under condition of anonymity said she was still in her house .
Burma 's state - run newspaper on Thursday blamed the media for exaggerating the size of the daily demonstrations and said Burma 's unrest was fuelled by " saboteurs " inside and outside the country .
The last time Burma has seen such a scope of unrest was in 1988 , when soldiers cracked down on a large pro-democracy demonstration in Rangoon .
At least 3,000 people were killed .
Said blogger , one who is anonymous , can be found here .
He / she has posted around a dozen entries of profound insight to the inner workings of the Total Surveillance Program ( TSP ) and the FISA investigation happening now in Congress .
The depth and detail in the blogger 's posts suggest he / she is in a high level cabinet position .
His / her intent is to expose the WH and its cronies , and to shine the light of day on the ongoing deception within the Executive Branch .
Further , he / she discusses the fact that the TSP began earlier than had been reported .
When you get to TPMM's , scroll down till the first anonymous poster .
There will be several posts , all dealing with incredibly detailed information that leads to the WH .
He / she does n't disclose everything , and invites the reader to work certain things out , certainly to protect himself / herself .
Then there will be an anymous poster who is not the same .
The one we are discussing is obvious -- lots of links to google information , lots of technical jargon .
I sent several of the longest posts to representatives , and other bloggers have forwarded it on to Keith Olbermann and Amy Goodman .
In short , this is amazing stuff .
Here are a few of his / her entries , for your reading pleasure :
Also , if the Senate 's Leahy / Specter do not trust Gonzalez , why would they trust him on this AG - certifications under FISA ?
If he 's been lying to the Senate , then his AG - certifications on " OK to do this without a warrant " are also in doubt .
He could define anything -- rightly or wrongly -- as being under that umbrella .
Question becomes :
What certification has the AG made on things that not even the Gang of 8 was told about ; and how was the NSC ( not NSA ) involved with the oversight of this , outside FISA - Gang of 8 review ?
" National security " could mean : " Maintaining morale " or " maintaining confidence " :
That could mean providing false information to the public ; or , based on data mining , issuing public news releases to justify public support for illegal activity ; or maintain confidence in something that was an illegal contract .
This would involve capture through NSA of meta - language ; then stripping out identifying information ; ; then transferring that data to a firm like Flieshman Hilliard which would examine it , and issue public news releases on various government " public oversight " and " media messaging issues " : Smith
Act issues in re domestic propaganda : Possibly a " public service " announcement to maintain loyalty in non-sense .
Something for AT&T to discuss .
And , in response to our drational : ( partial quote )
Recall , it 's CIA that was sharing info with the EU on the rendition ; and Plame was retaliated against by OVP : and the OVP blocking the archivist audit .
Addington knew about the European Detention centers .
Not getting info on the naval - based detention centers .
Recall , Iran- Contra was an NSC - run operation : Cheney was involved .
Could be the same kid of thing -- something run out of NSC , not the DoJ or NSA .
Not clear that the " NSA " vs " NSC " is a typo : Suspect its different : NSC , not NSA , appears to be running these things .
Recall DoJ met with the intelligence personnel at various sports facilitates in DC .
Keep thinking Plame and Cheney were about sending a message to Cheney ' private intelligence network -- likely linked through Halliburton -- to send a message : " Plame outing " is what will happen if you crosss the VP .
Seems to simplistic to say this is only about oil , and retaliating against others who spill the beans .
Libby 's name was mentioned in the context of " basketball , " another program -- that came up during the Grand Jury reviews ; his counsel was worried Fitzgerald had access to NSA - GCHQ - intercepted information of legal counsel .
And ,
SUMMARY
Mueller appears to be referring to a sub- contracted effort which indirectly supports the NSC with a special domestic security unit .
These units engage in direct engagement with state - side personnel and civilians .
Contractors , law enforcement , and intelligence personnel are assigned under non-direct - NSC - NSA units , but are hidden inside commercial entities .
The groups appear capable of moving quickly , with no direct supervision , but act as internal security forces , completely outside FISA oversight .
They appear to be entities unrelated to FISA , but are front line units which verify information , gather intelligence domestically , and help NSC pinpoint targets which NSC contractors are assigned .
RECOMMENDATIONS
A. Congress examine the Operation Falcon ; determine which NSA / NSC personnel were assigned to oversee .
B. Examine the budget lines inside the DOD foreign entities support accounts ; and determine which banks are used to challenge those funds .
Determine how the DOD funds are funnelled overseas through the NSC entities , then back to the US to these individual groups .
C. Review the " investigative leads " and ground rules JTTF and local law enforcement use to dissuade detection of the domestic intelligence gathering efforts .
D. Review the destruction logs of the CIFA ; and determine who was supposed to keep the logs related to these classified documents .
Determine which signalling systems , monitoring , and other intelligence gathering the JTTF are using ; and where this information is sent .
Ultimately , it winds up somewhere :
Which contractors , NSC staffers have access to these reports .
E. Examine with Congressional Counsel whether it is the intent that these domestic security services operate this way ; and whether , as FISA is written , this type of activity would fall outside what the FISA Court can engage .
F. Review the DHS domestic interrogation facilities .
Look at the gas mileage for the DHS pick up teams .
Review the files they 've had access to ; and the basis for detaining someone .
Review the complaints of citizens being forcibly removed from their cars , engines running , or being taken from their homes while school children are present in the early morning .
Evidence includes car impound fees .
G. Discuss with POST and local LE efforts used to dissuade public awareness of intelligence gathering : Excuses given to hide pre-textual stops ; and examine whether local officials do or do not keep adequate records related to officer complaints and requests for civilian oversight to examine officer misconduct .
H. Examine problems during audits :
To what extent officers in LE , FBI , and DHS are concerned when reports of officer misconduct arise ; and what methods auditors are aware to segregate complaints about officer misconduct from auditors :
Have they been asked to leave the room ; were concerns explained away ; were officers complaining they were " short manned " an unable to supervise ; and how do these explanations square with the officer conduct .
How often are these units employed to provoke innocent civilians to respond to abuse ?
To what extent are these domestic units used to harass civilians based on a " hunch " ?
Would these units put the children of minors at risk to entrap a suspected target ?
Is there no report of any of these personnel ever exposing a minor to a potentially unsafe situation to engage a target ?
Has the FISA court , Congress , and Judiciary been fully apprised of how these units operate ; their procedures ; and oversight requirement to ensure 42 USC 1983 claims are minimized ?
What insurance do these units have if they are engaged in liable action ?

These are just a few of his / her posts .
Some of them are very long ; took me almost an hour and a half to parse through it all .
in /tech / haskell
In my last post about HXT I had gotten stuck at a performance problem in HXT that rendered it unusable .
Since then , I ’ve exchanged a number of emails with Uwe Schmidt , the maintainer .
He found where the exponential blowup was happening in the regex engine and fixed that problem .
With that fix , my spider ran for a bit longer , but eventually failed due to hitting the per-process limit on open file descriptors .
I tried adding strictA in a couple places in the code , but it did not resolve the resource leak .
Uwe claims this is a bug in Network .
HTTP , and suggested the a_use_curl option to spawn an external curl program to do the fetching .
While it sucks to be spawning hundreds of processes for this task , it did fix the resource leak .
With those problems out of the way , I was able to focus on some issues in my own program , like trying to validate JPG images as XML , or to fetch mailto : links .
I ’m now reasonably happy with the program , which you can see in the HXT / Practical section of the Haskell wiki .
The major area where this could still be improved is parallelization .
Verifying about 700 pages and links on my site takes 45 minutes , during which the program is only doing something for about 8 , while the rest is waiting on the network .
It would definitely be a good exercise to learn more about the concurrency capabilities of Haskell , although the hidden system state in HXT makes me nervous about whether it ’ll work at all .
I ’d probably want to do a couple simpler exercises in concurrent programming first , before attempting to parallelize this one .
The BitTorrent trackers sitting in the depths of The Pirate Bay are there for the benefit of the people , to help them distribute bandwidth intensive media worldwide at no cost .
But when anti-piracy companies like Media Defender of MiiVi infamy abuse that service , it 's time to bring out the plank .
They 're not welcome .
The guys at The Pirate Bay are n’t happy .
Certain commercial outfits have been trying to use their trackers to hunt down pirates – companies like Media Defender who will be fresh in your mind following the MiiVi incident .
Certain counter - measures have been put in place to deal with this situation .
Brokep explained that steps are taken to block Media Defender from accessing their trackers .
“ We block them and some other torrent sites do as well . ”
Holding out a helping hand to other tracker administrators worldwide he continued , “ if any other torrent site need some IP ranges to block , just talk to us . ”
It ’s clear that Brokep and the crew have had enough of Media Defender , and the Miivi incident seems to be the straw that broke the camels back .
“ Since the Miivi - incident we ca n’t keep quiet about them anymore ” he said .
“ We want their employers to stop using them so they go bankrupt . ”
In the meantime , The Pirate Bay has introduced a Usage Policy for their trackers , engineered to keep certain commercial organizations out , while ensuring that service continues as usual for everyone else .
For most companies , this will simply involve them getting a nod from the guys to use the tracker .
Companies like Media Defender ( who have already had their attention drawn to the changes ) should take extra care to read this part of the Usage Policy .
“ The tracker may not be used by anyone with the intention to track usage , log ip addresses / usage or anything else that we consider intrusion of privacy or disruption of tracker service .
If you are not sure if this would be the case for your usage , please contact us in order to get our permission . ”
Brokep has informed Media Defender that if they manage to access the tracker , they will be breaking the terms of the Usage Policy and unfortunately , The Pirate Bay will have no choice but to invoice them at the following rates :
Basic Fee : EUR 5000
plus bandwidth
plus other costs that may arise due to the violation .
Of course , individuals , organizations and companies who use the trackers for “ well meaning ” purposes , such as distributing works of cultural benefit for the end user , do not need to ask permission .
Hugging all over the world : Amma in New York , Santiago , Zurich , Rio
By Mario Cacciottolo
BBC News
" Yes , " replies the bus driver , somewhat wearily , for the third time , " this does go to Alexandra Palace " .
Amma , the " Hugging Saint " , is in town .
And this procession of slightly disoriented passengers are among the crowds making their way to be embraced by her at the north London venue .
For 30 years Indian spiritual leader Mata Amritanandamayi , to give her her real name , has been hugging people , leading some to give her a saintly nickname .
The time it takes and money it costs to fly over from Australia is worth it for a hug with Amma
Suraj Vagjiani
This really is as simple as it sounds .
Amma sits on a slightly elevated seat .
Strangers come before her , kneeling , and she embraces each as though they were her own flesh and blood .
Time spent with Amma is free and she does not promote any particular faith , being for " all religions and none " .
She is said to have doled out some 26 million hugs , or " darshan " , as the experience is known .
Each is counted off with a clicker .
She has said that to hug someone is to symbolise giving , and that her embrace should help awaken the spirit of selflessness in people .
But there 's more than just a cuddle being dished out here .
Her charity , the Mata Amritanandamayi Math , has UN consultative status and claims to have built more than 36,000 homes and several hospitals for India 's poor .
Small hours
Now , for the 20th year , she is back in the UK , and the main hall at Alexandra Palace thrives with the smell of incense and the sound of musical chanting .
Katarina Diss said she was left " dazed " by her hug
One such volunteer Julia Lewis , a 36 - year - old management consultant , says no - one leaves unhugged .
" Amma will stay until 2 am , 3 am , 4 am or later , until there is no - one left .
She does not get up , she 'll just sit there the entire time and has about an hour and a half to sleep before she starts again . "
Katarina Diss , 52 , of Bedfordshire , is one of those at the event who has experienced darshan for the first time .
" It 's difficult to put into words , " she says .
" You are touched by something very profound that ripples through you .
It 's something that 's going to unravel itself over time , I think . "
Australian Suraj Vagjiani is testament to the sort of devotion that Amma commands .
When he heard she was appearing in London he scraped together £ 650 for a one - way ticket just to see her - although a trip to India would have used fewer air miles .
12,000 - mile hug
" I love to experience time with Amma .
The time it takes and money it costs to fly over from Australia is worth it for a hug with Amma . "
I do n't expect anything from anyone - my life is to give , not to take
Amma
Psychologist Dr Elvidina Adamson - Macedo says being hugged can release powerful natural chemicals in the body .
" Beta - endorphins are released when you are relaxed , and are a natural opium .
A hug can induce that in a person .
" Opening your arms is the act of a mother , who is ready to comfort her child .
But it 's not only the action , it 's everything that comes with it - the emotions and affection that 's translated into a non-verbal action .
" But it has to be right .
It would not work if it was just a performance . "
It sounds credible , but Amma does n't have a monopoly on embracing .
So what 's her magic ?
Special vibrations
I 'm about to find out .
I approach as she holds a constant stream of people close , murmuring in their ears , laughing and smiling like a playful schoolgirl at those who kneel before her .
She hands out sweets , presses apples into palms and swiftly scatters flower petals through the air .
Your correspondent gets a hug and some comforting words
While continuing to hug , she explains through a translator that " everything in this world has a vibration " .
" Every emotion that you can think of has a vibration , " she says .
" Love is a very special , very uplifting vibration .
" That 's what I 'm trying to give people .
It 's like visiting a perfume factory .
Consciously or unconsciously you will carry that fragrance around with you . "
When asked what she gets out of hugging people , she lets out a short , excited giggle , as though the question had caught her by surprise .
" I do n't expect anything from anyone .
My life is to give , not to take . "
Now it 's my turn to experience darshan .
I kneel before Amma and shuffle forwards .
She flings her arms open with a delighted smile that reminds me of the infrequent occasions that I go back to see my mother .
Heart leap
Amma takes me in her arms and I melt naturally into her embrace .
Everything goes black .
There is noise out there , but it seems to just become an indecipherable hum .
It 's just calm and comfortable in my head and heart .
Her robes are beautifully fragrant , and for the rest of the day I keep getting wafts of it , distracting me momentarily from whatever I 'm doing .
Amma murmurs into my ear , repeating something that sounds like " Lo , Lo , Lo . "
Whatever the words , they have a power .
She kisses my forehead and cheek , and finally we part .
She lifts up my hands and kisses them , and that for some reason makes my heart leap .
There are beaming smiles all round .
I thank her and to my surprise , as I stand , I 'm a little wobbly on my feet .
Amma , incidentally , means mother .
On the way home , I call mine .
Amma is appearing at Alexandra Palace until Friday , 7 December .
Sessions begin at 1000 and 1900 GMT .
You should all take the time to show the people that you love how much they mean to you .
My Mum died three weeks ago , the day before I was due to drive 220 miles visit her .
I can't remember if we hugged last time that we met , but hope that we did .
Now , before I come back to Leeds , I always hug my Dad - something I never used to do .
But I never know if each time will be the last .
Life is too short to be self - conscious about things like hugging , and it gets easier the more you do it .
Give someone you love a hug today !
Andrew B , Leeds , England
What ?
she hugs people , lots of people , that 's her job ?
Peter , Dundee Scotland
As a nation we do not show enough positive emotion towards each other .
A simple hug has a huge meaning , yet we do not like to do it openly in public .
I will hug my grandmother in the middle of Tesco 's if it feels right .
Oliver Nash , Poole
I was hugged ( received darshan ) by Amma a few times in my home country Mauritius a few years ago .
She indeed leaves you feeling comforted and so loved , and to this day , every time I think of her I can still smell the lovely smell of the incense and her sari .
Just the memory of that hug helps to calm me when I 'm distressed about something .
It 's something everyone should experience at least once in their life .
Hema , Surbiton
I find my mothers hug to be just as good , if not better .
It 's also free to get to her and nicer and more private .
It is followed by nice food and some cool drinks .
Sanjay , Manchester
All the people in the queue should spend a day watching derren brown instead .
This is the placebo effect on a grand scale .
Hug your friends not some stranger with a good PR campaign .
Paul M , London UK
As a Scot living in the States I do NOT like hugs , especially from people I do n't know and Americans are hug crazy .
My American wife 's friends thought of me as very odd when I told them there was only one person I wanted to hug and I do n't need to tell you who .
They do n't hug ME .
Andy , Atlanta , U.S.A .
Thank you , BBC , for reporting some GOOD news in this sad old world .
Max , London
Nothing but a waste of time , money and faith , a big sign of stupidity , another Hindu Dogma , There is no reality in it at all .
Ijaz , Aberdeen
Best news story I 've read all week .
Thank you so much for sharing it !
Annette , Hertfordshire , UK
Sad and pathetic !
It 's just a stupid gimmick .
Some people travel all that way to hug someone , just because they read or heard about it .
I wonder if they behave as open and welcoming to the people they meet in their everyday lives .
Doubt it .
,
I grew up in Kerala , India , where " Amma " has made regular news from as far back as I can remember .
But , I never once contemplated a darshan , always clubbing her with the multitude of " saints " who populate Indian society .
However , Reading this article definitely makes me regret those days of reflexive disbelief and cynicysm .
Perhaps it is the ethos , or maybe the pathos I associate with the BBC .
I wonder if this opinion is shared by others ?
Rahul Radhakrishnan , Highland Park , NJ , USA
Just reading this I was in tears .
I felt the love of a mother .
Thank you .
Caroline , Bristol , UK
Quite remarkable that someone in the world is so caring a pity every citizen in the world was like this lady , a very caring women who i would love to meet to be embraced with her love .

There was an important development on Tuesday at Guantánamo .
A ruling by the judge in Salim Hamdan ’s military commission appears to require entirely new hearings for any prisoners who claim to be POWs .
Hamdan had appealed for a POW status hearing under Article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention .
The ruling by Navy Captain Keith Allred went strongly in his favor .
Allred rejects the Congressional view that Combatant Status Review Tribunals had been adequate to determine POW status .
That view was asserted forcefully by Sen. Lindsay Graham in 2006 during hearings for the Military Commissions Act .
Allred , however , concludes that CSRTs concerned themselves with whether the prisoners were " enemy combatants " and therefore were n’t competent to determine whether the men were prisoners of war .
The military commissions are defective by design and should not be permitted to stand in for civil trials , but at least one prisoner has been assigned a judge who is willing to face up to the plain flaws in the legal " system " that the Bush administration slapped together .
The decision reaffirms that the Geneva Conventions apply to the men at Guantánamo .
Article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention states that if there is any doubt whether someone held by a government is a prisoner of war , they should be presumed to be a prisoner of war , and therefore entitled to the protections the Conventions provide for prisoners of war , until their status is determined by a " competent tribunal . "
The decision then goes on to state that the Combatant Status Review Tribunals ( CSRT ’s ) are not competent tribunals for the purpose of determining whether a detainee qualifies for all prisoner of war protections .
( In Hamdan ’s case , the military commission judge will now make that determination . )...
The opinion holds that the men at Guantánamo are entitled to the protections guaranteed to prisoners of war , at least until they have hearings before a competent tribunal .
Those protections include prohibitions on torture and coercive interrogations .
In other words , as Lyle Denniston points out , the ruling implies that none of the prisoners at Gitmo are necessarily subject to the Military Commissions
Act until a competent tribunal finds that they are .
Although the Military Commission
Act provides that those covered by it cannot rely upon the Geneva Convention " as a source of rights , " Judge Allred said that Hamdan has not yet been determined to be an " unlawful enemy combatant " — the status he must be assigned in order to bring him under the MCA .
Of course " the CSRT process was an irremediable sham " , as the declaration by Lt. Col.
Stephen Abraham documented for the case of Al Odah .
The CSRTs existed to give the appearance of due process without granting prisoners any actual ability to gain their freedom , prove their innocence , or even confront their accusers .
The new system of military commissions was built upon a foundation of sand , the ridiculous claims that CSRTs ( i ) constituted an adequate substitute for habeas review , and ( ii ) cut off any appeal to rights under the Geneva Conventions .
Now that foundation is crumbling badly .
If Allred ’s ruling is upheld , it could greatly complicate the question of the Guantanamo prisoners ’ rights — while at the same time forcing the US to grant Geneva protections to many or perhaps all prisoners for the time being .
" For almost six years the Bush administration has treated those imprisoned at Guantanamo as bereft of any rights under the Geneva Convention and as without the protections of POWs , " said Center for Constitutional Rights president Michael Ratner .
" This was never the law , and now the Bush administration may finally be forced to do what it should have done from the very beginning : comply with the Geneva Conventions . "
The CSRTs loom large in the background of the consolidated Boumediene / Al Odah cases heard by the Supreme Court on Dec. 5 .
The main issue before SCOTUS was whether the MCA may strip Gitmo prisoners of access to civil courts .
The government argued that the MCA ’s jurisdiction - stripping provision is reasonable because the CSRTs had already substituted for habeas review .
But as the Allred ruling highlights , the CSRTs were ad hoc tribunals and extremely narrowly focused .
Even if the CSRT were not the kangaroo court that Stephen Abraham documents , they still should n’t be treated as substitutes for anything — certainly nothing as fundamental as habeas review .
The quality of the oral arguments in Boumediene two weeks ago was abysmal on the central issue of due process .
It was especially disappointing to find Justice Ginsburg joining Roberts in trying to identify an excuse to send the cases back for District court review in determining whether CSRTs are an adequate substitute for habeas .
Roberts appears to reject the plaintiffs ’ argument that they ’ve been waiting too damned long already for habeas review .
He wonders why the Court should care that for six long years they ’ve been given the run around .
Your argument would n’t be any different with respect to the availability of habeas if these people were held for one day , would it ?
We do n’t look at the length of detention in deciding whether habeas is available , do we ? ...
Your argument is that somebody held one day in Guantanamo has the right to habeas .
So the extent of detention is irrelevant to your assertion .
Justice Kennedy later chimed in as if the six - year wait were merely a footnote to the larger questions .
Such arrogance .
Or could Roberts , Kennedy , and Ginsburg possibly be that ignorant of the facts of existence at Gitmo ?
The central point is one that I ’m astonished anybody could fail to see : Prolonged confinement at Guantánamo is torture .
The military carefully created conditions of confinement in order to crush the prisoners ’ mental resilience .
Amnesty International has found that 80 % of prisoners were held in solitary confinement .
Most of the prison buildings at Gitmo are designed specifically to further that goal .
What do these fools on the Supreme Court suppose happens to the human mind after prolonged solitary confinement ?
It ’s absolutely sickening that , six years into a series of delaying tactics engineered by the Bush administration , there ’s any need to discuss whether the habeas review needs to be expedited .
Here , SCOTUS , take a good look .
This is what occurs after years of such confinement :
A British resident being held in Guantanamo Bay may be close to suicide after five years of captivity and torture at the hands of the Americans , the Foreign Secretary David Miliband has been warned in a medical report sent to the Government this week .
The report concludes that Binyam Mohamed , from Kensington , west London , is at the end of his " psychological tether " after guards at the US naval base in Cuba switched off the water supply to his cell when he began spreading his own faeces over the walls ...
A preliminary medical opinion , commissioned by Reprieve , has found Mr Mohamed to be suffering from severe depression and post - traumatic stress disorder .
Dr Daniel Creson , a respected psychiatrist from Texas who has extensive experience in the treatment of the victims of torture , warns that the deterioration in Mr Mohamed 's health suggests that he " is reaching the end of his psychological tether " .
Binyam Mohamed , like all the other prisoners at Guantánamo , continues to wait in vain for a habeas review .
As far as several Supreme Court justices are concerned , his five years of mental torture is just another footnote to more important issues .

Court Orders Justice Department to Provide Further Explanation for Withholding Documents
WASHINGTON ‑ A federal judge today rejected the government ’s broad claims of secrecy in its refusal to make public documents involving the National Security Agency ’s ( NSA ) warrantless wiretapping program .
U.S. District Judge Henry Kennedy ’s ruling comes in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought last year by the American Civil Liberties Union , the National Security Archive and the Electronic Privacy Information Center .
According to the court order , the Department of Justice must , by October 26 , provide more substantial reasons for refusing to turn over certain documents .
" Today ’s ruling deals a blow to the administration ’s sweeping and often unfounded secrecy claims , " said Nasrina Bargzie , an attorney with the ACLU ’s National Security Project .
" When documents are withheld under the Freedom of Information Act , the government must have a better excuse for keeping the documents secret than ‘ because we said so . ’ "
In December 2005 , the ACLU and the National Security Archive submitted requests under the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) seeking records relating to the NSA 's warrantless wiretapping program .
The ACLU and the Archive filed a lawsuit to enforce the FOIA requests and the case was consolidated with a similar lawsuit brought by the Electronic Privacy Information Center ( EPIC ) .
The government asked the court to permit it to keep the NSA documents secret .
Although allowing the government to withhold some information , Judge Kennedy , in today ’s 24 - page ruling , wrote that the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) , the FBI and the NSA must provide additional explanations for withholding many documents related to the NSA wiretapping program , particularly those that relate to legal justifications for the program .
The judge wrote that when documents are withheld under the Freedom of Information Act , the government is required to provide adequate reasons for why the documents are being withheld .
Judge Kennedy found that the government ’s " justifications for withholding various records …are insufficient . "
In addition , Judge Kennedy stated that he would review the documents himself if the government ’s future submissions continued to be unsatisfactory .
The court noted the excessiveness of the government ’s secrecy claims at various points of the opinion .
For example , Judge Kennedy expressed " substantial frustration " with the fact that although his law clerk had received a high level security clearance , the government would not allow the clerk access to relevant materials .
Judge Kennedy also rejected the government ’s claim that it had to keep secret the number of pages of relevant Office of Legal Counsel memoranda on the NSA program , calling the argument " implausible . "
" The American people deserve information about its government ’s surveillance program , particularly documents about the government ’s legal justification for choosing to conduct surveillance in violation of a statute for over five years , " said Melissa Goodman , an attorney with the ACLU ’s National Security Project .
" Time and time again this administration has attempted to keep secret vital information necessary for an informed debate without sufficient explanation , as if justifying its secrecy were optional .
That is not acceptable in a democracy .
We are heartened that , in this case , the court recognized that . "
In early 2006 , soon after the NSA ’s illegal activities became public , the ACLU filed a separate lawsuit on behalf of criminal defense attorneys , journalists and scholars challenging the NSA ’s warrantless surveillance of Americans ’ calls and e-mails .
The government responded to the legal challenge not by defending the legality of the NSA ’s surveillance activities , but by invoking secrecy as the basis for dismissing the lawsuit .
The administration argued that the NSA ’s surveillance was so secret that not even a court could determine its legality .
On August 17 , 2006 , a federal court in Michigan agreed with the ACLU that the program was illegal .
The government appealed that ruling to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals , which dismissed the legal challenge finding that plaintiffs did not have " standing " to bring the case because they could not prove with certainty they were secretly spied upon .
The appellate court did not decide the merits of the case .
The ACLU is considering its legal options , including appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court .
In another related matter , the ACLU last month filed legal papers with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ( FISC ) asking for the release of its orders and legal opinions that reportedly led to the recent expansion of the government ’s wiretapping authority under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
In response to a court order , the government responded on August 31 , claiming that the FISC should simply defer to the government ’s claims of secrecy .
The ACLU plans to file its own response by September 14 .
Attorneys in the consolidated FOIA cases are Bargzie , and Jameel Jaffer of the national ACLU , Meredith Fuchs of the National Security Archive , Marc Rotenberg of EPIC , and Art Spitzer of the ACLU of the National Capital Area .

A lightning storm over the town of Turbo , the center of banana and plantain production in Northern Colombia .
Turbo is also the main port of departure for cocaine headed to the United States and Europe , a city still in the grip of paramilitary and smuggler activity .
Colombia , June–August 2007
When the trumpet sounded ,
everything was prepared on earth ,
and Jehovah divided the world
among Coca - Cola Inc. , Anaconda ,
Ford Motors , and other corporations :
The United Fruit Company Inc .
reserved for itself the juiciest piece ,
the central coast of my own land ,
the sweet waist of America .
— Pablo Neruda , “ The United Fruit Co . ”
Our flight from Bogotá to Apartadó headed north along the great verdant spine of the Andes .
Flying over Medellín , a city of brick high - rises surrounded by mountains , you can look down onto the cocaine mansions and see if there is anyone in the pool .
All of the country ’s cities have growing slums on their peripheries , filled with war - displaced peasants and the dispossessed looking for work .
Neighborhoods lit with a single bulb .
Corrugated metal roofs on rough shacks lining red - dirt roads .
The inhabitants of the poor barrios are the refugees from a war that has lasted more than forty years .
White veils of clouds drifted over the ridges as we landed in Medellín then took off again a few minutes later for Apartadó .
From the air you want to buy a parcel , you want to get in on all that beauty .
We flew down out of the cool air of the Andes toward an airport that was nothing more than a few lines of asphalt cut out of the bright green banana plantations .
The plane touched down and we were in the belly of the organism , but we did n’t know it yet .
When the beat - up taxi pulled away from the airport onto the shaded road , the air pouring through the windows was rich with the smell of wet earth and rotting leaves .
Black men walked slowly through the fields with machetes .
Most are the descendants of African slaves , and they still get the jobs that keep a man out in the sun .
Spanish colonists brought the ancestors of these men here and worked them until they simply gave out .
Today , the banana region exports hundreds of millions of dollars of bananas and plantains , but the workers at the bottom of the export pyramid have little to show for it .
They live in the slums at the edge of town , such as barrio Obrero , where paramilitary groups targeted them in the late nineties and murdered them in their homes .
During this time of extreme militarization in Urabá , anyone suspected of labor activism or sympathy with the leftist rebels was at risk of being assassinated .
The Colombian military let the gunmen work without interruption .
“ We patrolled side by side , fighting the guerrillas , ” a former paramilitary fighter told me over beers a few days after we arrived in town .
“ Sometimes we traded with the army .
We gave them hostages in exchange for ammunition . ”
Paracos ( as the paramilitaries are known ) , their hair cut short like a soldier ’s , would come for their victims on motorcycles .
They called it grabbing someone .
It did n’t matter what you said to them ; when the paracos grabbed someone that person always died , and it was always the United Self - Defense Forces of Colombia ( AUC ) that did the grabbing .
In 2004 , AUC leader Salvatore Mancuso negotiated a ceasefire with the Colombian government and surrendered to authorities at a demobilization ceremony that December .
Not all of the blocks demobilized , however , and some of the old AUC groups are still actively looking for new recruits .
As the taxi clattered out of the green labyrinth and into Apartadó , there was no welcome sign , but were there one it should read , founded by united fruit , 1963 .
before us , there was nothing .
population x .
Apartadó was just a small village before the company arrived , and likewise Turbo to the east .
The banana - growing region was a marshy stretch of coast near Panama with a few indigenous people , and that was all .
Then United Fruit , one of the most powerful companies in the history of the Americas , transformed this section of Colombia , remade it in its own protean image and then left it behind .
A couple walks through the barrio Obrero in Apartadó .
The neighborhood , formerly a farm , was occupied several years ago and the land taken away from its owner .
Most of the families who live there today work in the banana industry .
During the nineties , the neighborhood was the scene of several massacres staged by the FARC and paramilitary groups who fought for the control over the industry .
* * * *
Americans did not always eat bananas .
In fact , the tropical staple only came to the nation ’s table through an act of desperation by a Brooklyn railroad speculator named Minor Keith .
In 1871 , Keith went into business with his uncle , Henry Meiggs , to build a railway from the Costa Rican capital , San José , to the port city of Limón .
It was , by all accounts , a miserable undertaking .
Italian workers mutinied over the conditions , and inmates from Louisiana prisons were brought in when no one else would do the job .
Most of them died — as many as five thousand — trying to complete Meiggs and Keith ’s project , an enterprise that was already unpopular and strangled by debt when it finally reached completion in 1890 .
Not longer after the railway began operations , it quickly demonstrated itself to be a losing proposition for passenger transport , but Keith was n’t ready to give up .
During the construction of the railway he had started planting banana groves — to feed his workers — on government - ceded land near the tracks , so he decided to try his hand at the export business .
He moved his trackside bananas to the port at Limón for free — he already owned the train — and freighters sailed with the fruit to the United States , where Keith sold it for a hefty profit .
Soon , his banana gamble was worth more than the railroad .
In 1899 , on the eve of the twentieth century , Minor Keith merged his United Fruit with Boston Fruit , famous for its giant fleet of white ships , and “ the octopus ” — as the company is known among Latin American journalists — was born .
Soon its tentacles reached into the governments of Guatemala , Honduras , Panama , and Costa Rica , and manipulated the political establishment whenever its interests were threatened .
And the company , with its acquisitive genius , kept branching out into new enterprises whenever the need arose .
In 1901 , United Fruit took over the postal system in Guatemala , and in a number of other countries it controlled the railway systems and the telegraph lines .
A CIA - engineered coup codenamed Operation PBSUCCESS overthrew Guatemala ’s elected president in 1954 , when United Fruit ’s business interests were threatened by new land - reform laws .
The company wielded unprecedented power in Latin America , growing into a transnational entity whose appetite for resources drove the politics of the entire region .
By the twenties , United Fruit also had transformed small villages such as Santa Marta , along Colombia ’s Caribbean coast , into booming industrial centers .
Workers flooded into Santa Marta from distant places at a time when paying jobs were scarce .
By the decade ’s end , however , newly elected liberal representatives and labor leaders criticized the company and the tax - free export deal it had brokered with the government .
In 1928 workers went on strike , paralyzing the company .
In response , the right - wing government of Miguel Abadía Méndez called out the army , which promptly sealed off the streets to a plaza full of assembled civilians in Ciénaga and opened fire .
It was a massacre that Gabriel García Márquez would immortalize in One Hundred Years of Solitude .
After the killings in Ciénaga ’s central square , the Abadía Méndez government was voted out of power and the company found its business interests threatened .
United Fruit needed a sympathetic national government to guarantee its profits , and that government had just vanished .
United Fruit did not control Colombia as it did the Central American nations , so it was forced to make deals with the workers .
Between popular liberal politicians , who now openly supported labor unions against the company , and the disruption of shipping caused by the Second World War , the octopus slowly withdrew from Santa Marta , selling its land back to the national land - reform agency at a good price , saving the company from having to abandon its assets .
It was time to move on .
In 1963 , United Fruit found what it was looking for in Urabá , a long - neglected but well - watered Caribbean region of Antioquia , Colombia , closer to Panama than Santa Marta .
It was perfect .
In the nearby fishing village of Turbo , United Fruit then repeated its well - worn and successful pattern .
The company found an underdeveloped stretch of coastline , offered to build a port and bring in jobs in exchange for export concessions , then hung on as long as possible in the face of violent uprisings and popular discontent .
What they tried desperately to avoid was the labor unrest that set them back in Santa Marta in the early part of the century .
To get around it , United Fruit created an entirely new system of production .
It was brilliant ; they would create a virtual banana operation .
The big innovation was simple — the company would n’t own land at all .
If United Fruit owned land , the workers would agitate against them .
Instead , Colombian growers would own it and sell their entire crops to the company as contractors .
United Fruit put ads in the paper looking for investors and got people who had never worked on a farm in their lives .
Dentists and doctors suddenly became ranchers in Urabá .
It was a gold rush for cheap land and the promise of big profits with the octopus .
To get the growers started in business , the company handed out big development loans to the new arrivals from Medellín who proved they could cultivate bananas .
With the loans and the contracts , the company locked the growers into an exclusive arrangement , and for the next five years , 100 percent of everything grown in Urabá went out on United Fruit freighters at the price the company set .
Meanwhile , another conservative government in Bogotá promised to hunt down leftist dissenters and hold back the tide of Communism in the hemisphere , a crackdown that would have terrible consequences for the country .
In 1966 , three years after United Fruit arrived in Urabá , a group of liberal intellectuals that the government had been chasing across the country founded the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) , and Colombia plunged headlong into forty years of civil war .
Small growers receive $ 6 for each 45 - pound box of plantains they harvest , but they must pay for all packaging , so the cost falls to roughly $ 3.50 per carton , a small fraction of its value in the United States .
This fruit is then resold by the Colombian agricultural corporation Banacol to Chiquita brands and Dole for delivery to the US market .
Chiquita sets the prices with Banacol through a long - term contract .
It was bound to happen .
In the 1980s , Communist revolutionaries arrived in the banana fields of Urabá after a period of calm and high profits for United Fruit .
The promise of the rebels was electrifying and straightforward : “ You are poor , the company is rich , and this land could be yours if you are willing to take it . ”
Of course , this was nearly the same promise the company dangled before the growers .
Groups such as FARC successfully infiltrated the unions and kidnapped the managers of the farms .
But profits continued to climb ; Urabá looked like a good investment for the company except for the violence , which accelerated steadily into the 1990s .
Then , in 1997 , the AUC arrived in force and offered to solve everyone ’s problems .
One of the first items on its agenda was to meet with company officials .
The company , in the meantime , had changed its name from United Fruit to Chiquita , a deliberate reincarnation in the form of the smiling , banana - form woman that the firm hoped would distract the public from its dark history .

Carlos , my photographer , had arranged for us to meet with Captain Jaime Garcia of the Guardacostas in the port of Turbo .
Captain Garcia offered to take Carlos out on a drug interdiction patrol on one of his fast boats , and now I ’d been invited along for the ride .
“ This could be bullshit , ” Carlos said , looking around for the bus to Turbo .
“ It could be interesting , ” I said .
“ I am thinking it could be total bullshit , you know , a pony show . ”
“ A dog and pony show . ”
“ Exact . ”
* * * *
We caught a packed buseta from Apartadó to Turbo with thirty other Colombians and watched the banana fields roll by for an hour , all carefully cordoned off by barbed wire .
Banana trees with broad flop - eared leaves and their unpicked fruit hermetically sealed in blue plastic , the trees growing a prepackaged product for the American buyer which comes without blemishes or bruises .
Once we hit the end of the line , the driver took us out to the military base where the captain was waiting for us in the sun .
“ You guys came in that ? ”
“ Yes . ”
“ That ’s a weird - looking taxi . ”
The captain laughed .
Our bus driver turned out to be an informant who told everybody , including the demobilized paramilitaries , that two foreigners just showed up at the Guardacostas station .
There was no way to hide from it , the whole town knew who we were from the moment we landed .
Captain Garcia took us inside the severely air - conditioned office and introduced us to his men .
The captain treated us to an American - style PowerPoint briefing , cataloguing the tons of cocaine intercepted every year by his crews .
Dozens and dozens of tons according to the slides .
A respectable amount but still a fraction of the hundreds of tons of cocaine that make it through .
Carlos talked about his time in the jungle photographing the FARC and unnerved the captain with his extensive knowledge of cocaine smuggling .
Captain Garcia conceded that there was really no stopping the drugs , and there has n’t been .
According to the DEA , the quantity available in the United States has not dropped since the advent of the Plan Colombia , the multibillion - dollar eradication program .
Colombian production actually went up during a period of intense spraying and military actions : the growers just moved to different parts of the country .
Who is behind the trade ?
Although the FARC is involved deeply in the business , it is the right - wing AUC that worked closely with the cartels to organize the smuggling system .
Coca growers , who are usually poor peasants or campesinos , earn the least of all .
As the cocaine flows down the Atrato River into the Gulf of Urabá , it eventually makes its way toward the US and Europe through a network of shifting routes .
The drug traffickers send the drugs overland through Mexico , as well as by sea with stops in intermediate countries .
At each stage , the value of each pure kilogram increases , and by the time it reaches the United States the street cost has reached as much as $ 100,000 .
The more varied the routes , the lower the risk to the trafficker — a system that rewards creativity with millions of dollars .
Captain Garcia ’s job is to intercept these shipments in the Gulf of Urabá in an American - made fast boat called Midnight Express .
Smugglers also use their own fast boats to move the cocaine , sealing the kilogram bricks inside small custom - built fiberglass hulls .
At the destination , they remove the cargo and destroy the boat .
On his base , Garcia keeps a haphazard museum of these intercepted lanchas , their hulls ripped open .
The Midnight Express is a steroidal machine , and it has a drug - runner feel to it , even though in its normal configuration the boat is sold as a half - million - dollar fishing vessel .
It is a mystery why anyone would need a thousand horsepower to go catch sea bass and marlin , but it is great for going fast .
Garcia ’s 30 - foot boat has four outboard engines , an excellent radar system with GPS and coastal maps , sonar , and a mount for a .50 caliber machine gun on the deck .
The captain raced us out into the gulf where we found a line of banana freighters towing barges on a choppy afternoon sea .
The lumbering freighters rose out of the water above us , rust - streaked leviathans .
Carmen Palencia , a banana exporter , packs her products along with her husband .
Palencia ’s first husband was assassinated by paramilitaries in Cordoba state .
She ran away with her children to Urabá .
There she became a union organizer and fought for land she and others farmers squatted on for years .
She was shot five times by paramilitaries but narrowly survived after being in a coma for weeks .
We drew alongside one of these vessels , the reefer ship Nelson Star , while Garcia called her skipper on his cell phone and said we were going to board with the German shepherd .
The captain of the Nelson was not happy about it , although he agreed .
Garcia ’s Midnight Express pilot maneuvered his vessel with skill , but the seas were too rough and we were too low in the water to reach the descending gangway .
It reminded me of two species unable to mate .
The captain called off the attempt .
The crew of the Nelson had gathered by the railing to watch Garcia , all of them wearing the same grease - stained blue coveralls .
They did not wave or make any gesture of greeting .
If we could have yelled out questions over the water , they could have explained that they were carrying fruit in refrigerated holds like all the other freighters in the Gulf of Urabá .
A longtime member of her crew might have also told us that the Nelson had not always been the Nelson , but had changed her name from the Chiquita Jean when , in 2003 , Chiquita Brands sold her back to a Norwegian shipping company along with the rest of its entire fleet .
In fact , from the moment of her birth in the Norwegian yards in 1992 until 2003 , the ship was a Chiquita freighter , designed to keep the fruit in perfect condition on its long voyage over the oceans .
The captain said , “ Sometimes they put the drugs on the banana boats . ” I was stunned .
I had been under the impression that drug traffickers only used small fast boats to move cocaine from place to place , but this is n’t true .
The freighters are difficult to search and blend into normal shipping traffic — because that is exactly what they are .
They can also haul a ton at a time if the kilo bricks are well hidden .

In the late eighties , the ancestor of the AUC began as an extreme right - wing confederation of armed bands — largely funded by cocaine trafficking — that fought the FARC across large regions of Colombia .
Naturally , their political interests were allied with the Colombian government , which also wanted to destroy the FARC — but , unlike the army , the AUC could operate without restrictions .
In the space of a few short years , the AUC would be responsible for the vast majority of political killings in the country , and the group ’s leaders would boast that a significant percentage of the nation ’s legislators were under their direct control .
From 2000 to the end of 2002 , there were at least 11,500 political killings in Colombia , most of which the AUC committed .
It was a long - running human rights nightmare .
In 1997 , shortly after the AUC arrived in Urabá , it began to consolidate power through a series of massacres and assassinations intended to drive out the FARC , which had organized in the banana fields .
Swept up in the paramilitary net were civilians who had no connection to any armed groups .
A large number of villagers and workers were summarily executed after being tortured or fingered as sympathetic to the FARC .
Many of the killings took place around river towns .
AUC gunmen would arrive , assemble the villagers in a central place and begin to interrogate them .
Often , they were killed regardless of their answers .
Establishing guilt in this system is just a pretext for widespread murder .
It was a tremendous success .
Eventually , the AUC controlled the entire banana - growing region of Urabá , any leftist agitators were in hiding , and the AUC had access to the Chiquita port .
They controlled it , but the commanders were still engaged in a brutal fight for control of the banana and coca fields .
They faced a serious logistics problem .
The paramilitary group was winning , but it badly needed war material to expand its influence .
On November 5 , 2001 , four years after the AUC arrived in Urabá , a mysterious shipment of thousands of AK - 47 assault rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition arrived at the Chiquita docks , a lethal cargo that went directly to the AUC commanders .
Aside from an Organization of American States ( OAS ) report that focused on the two Israeli arms dealers who arranged the deal from Guatemala and Panama , there have been few details to emerge about how the weapons were handled on the Colombian side .
It is also true that people directly associated with the shipment have had a tendency to disappear .
The Mexican captain of the Otterloo , Jesús Iturrios Maciél , sailed with the ship on November 9 to Barranquilla and then vanished .
The shipping company that owned the Otterloo closed its offices in Panama a few days after news of the weapons broke in a Colombian newspaper .
The information in the OAS report suggests that someone formed the company just to deliver the weapons to the AUC .
In a front - page deal reached with the US government this year , Chiquita pleaded guilty to making millions of dollars in payments to a group on the State Department list of foreign terrorist organizations : the AUC .
Lawyers for the company argued that they were forced into the making payments out of fear for the safety of its workers .
Chiquita also admitted that they had a similar arrangement with the FARC .
The result of the plea deal was a $ 25 million fine for a business that earned $ 3.9 billion in revenue in 2006 , and there were no charges filed over the weapons shipment .
It is not surprising that Chiquita Brands was forced to make protection payments to armed groups operating around their plantations , but that is not the entire story .
In March 2007 , Chiquita told CNN that the weapons shipment and the protection payments to the paramilitaries were unrelated .
This may well be true — the weapons shipments to the AUC were connected to a dark series of events at the company ’s port .
The Colombian government cast doubt on the company ’s claims of being the victim of extortion by the AUC .
Mario Iguarán , the Colombian attorney general , said , “ It was a criminal relationship : money and arms for the bloody pacification of Urabá . ”

I first saw the AUC man sitting at the roof bar of the Almirante José Hotel , hunched over a beer .
When a waiter walked close to him , the man looked him up and down , but the glance was sidelong and hooded .
He looked nervous and did n’t want anyone walking up next to him .
In the darkness on the roof of the hotel , he said nothing for long periods and then spoke rapidly , slamming his hands down on the table .
He said he felt betrayed and abandoned by his former commanders .
He was broke ; demobilizing did n’t help him at all .
Killings and vendettas followed him around , hovering over him wraithlike and invisible .
I have noticed that all assassins have something in common , and it is present in the dead look the AUC man gives the waiter .
The girl behind the bar went into the back room .
She did n’t want to hear what he was talking about .
It grew late .
I have changed the name of the AUC man to Lorenzo to protect him from being killed by members of the paramilitary group , his former comrades .
It is something he thinks about all the time , how talking about this subject is dangerous .
In the distance there were veins of lightning in a mass of black clouds as a storm came in .
Lorenzo was still hunched over the counter as though nervous about people seeing his face .
The girl had come back to bring us more beer .
We were drinking Aguilas and the night was winding down and I was half - listening to the conversation .
Everyone else had gone downstairs .
Carlos turned to me and said , “ Is there anything you want to ask him before he goes home ? ”
“ I want to know if he heard anything about a shipment of guns that arrived at the Chiquita docks . ”
Years had passed , but it was worth a shot .
“ Sure , ” Lorenzo said , “ I was there .
I supervised the unloading of the rifles . ”
Everyone fell silent .
We listened to sporadic gunfire coming from a nearby neighborhood .
Finally , Lorenzo started to tell us how the weapons arrived , how they were packed , and what he did that night , how he made sure his men put them on the trucks and that none were missing .
They had been disassembled and carefully sealed in plastic bags for the trip over the sea , tucked away in farm supplies in the containers .
As he talked , there was another burst of gunfire .
“ Was there more than one shipment ? ” I asked him .
“ Yes .
I heard there were others , but they did n’t arrive at the Chiquita docks , they arrived somewhere else . ”
Freddy Rendón , who commanded the Bananero Block of the AUC , confirmed this detail from prison in an interview with El Tiempo a few weeks after we talked to Lorenzo in Apartadó .
The Urabá region is where the AUC received its weapons .
It ’s a perfect contraband port , which is why it was so prized .
And there was not a single shipment but a series of them , and these deliveries occurred at the time when the AUC was taking new territory , killing with impunity , and making millions .
The AUC had come up with a brilliant system to import weapons to Urabá after a great deal of thought and effort .
Like the octopus , the paramilitary group adapted and thus solved a critical problem in its environment : its need to supply a growing army .
After the rifles arrived at the Chiquita docks , there was an epidemic of AUC killings .
As we were leaving , I asked Lorenzo if we could tape an interview with him in the morning .
He agreed on the condition that his face be hidden .
* * * *
The next morning , the three of us took the buseta back to Apartadó , not far from where the big weapons shipment arrived on the Chiquita docks .
Seeing three men enter a dive hotel with a video camera , the maid tending the rooms thought a porno film was in the works .
When we tried to explain , she laughed and turned down the beds .
We had arrived in the middle of a driving rainstorm .
We set up the camera and adjusted the lighting to obscure Lorenzo ’s face .
Lorenzo has the face and the dark skin of an indigenous South American .
His habits are rural , and other Colombians think he is coarse and without manners .
They are also afraid of him .
Lorenzo is a spitter who leaves a constellation of saliva spatters on the floor .
He ca n’t help it ; he ca n’t stop the saliva from filling his mouth .
A demobilized paramilitary fighter , “ Lorenzo , ” in Turbo .
After turning in their arms , many AUC fighters have not found productive work and are under pressure to return to their former activities .
Lorenzo described how paramilitary groups were reactivating in his area .
We started by discussing Lorenzo ’s position in the AUC , his rise through the ranks .
Lorenzo lifted his shirt to show the bullet scars on his chest and legs .
He has at least six wounds on his body , including exit holes , some from combat with the FARC , the rest from a robbery attempt when he was traveling alone , carrying the supply money for his AUC brigade .
Three of his own men robbed him , shot him and left him for dead in the city market .
“ I was so confident , I just went to the market alone with the money , ” he told me .
Lorenzo still keeps his revolver handy , in case he runs into one of them .
Over time he rose to the level of commander in the AUC .
“ I worked with the Bananero Block .
Those arms made it to many blocks .
They divided it among I do n’t know how many .
The company gave a lot of support , and that armaments were divided among many blocks .
And I realized that they were distributing it everywhere and that Mancuso ’s people were getting the arms , too .
So I found out about that and I noticed that .
Different blocks shared it .
Some of them would be M9s , Monterus , there were lots of AK - 47s , there were M60s and PKMs .
They were all brand - new and they went to different fronts . ”
When the Otterloo arrived , Lorenzo worked from evening to dawn at the port loading the AUC trucks .
It was a large shipment , fourteen container - loads of equipment , and it took a long time to move .
“ Another thing I noticed was the exchange of drugs for weapons , ” he said .
I caught this statement after I had the entire tape translated in Bogotá a few days later .
What exactly was happening at the Chiquita docks ?
When I saw the transcript of the interview , I decided to fly back to Turbo with Carlos and ask Lorenzo about the drugs - for - weapons exchange and the Chiquita freighters .
I wanted to understand how the system worked .
* * * *
Everyone in the state of Antioquia awoke to the news that an image of Christ had appeared on the wings of a moth .
Our friend , the former AUC killer , was an hour late for a meeting .
Maybe he had lost his nerve .
Maybe he was dead .
In any case , there was nothing to do except wait on the roof and watch the Colombian newscasters compare portraits of Jesus to the markings on the televised insect .
The tone was serious .
No one on the television was joking about a potential miracle happening around the time of the Feast of the Virgin of Carmen .
Carlos swore there was no resemblance , but he just did n’t want to admit it .
There was a resemblance , although it could also have been Mary trapped in the moth wings , covered in a dark hejab , or an Iraqi girl framed by dun-colored sand .
On the roof of the Almirante José Hotel , the air was warm and thick .
Across the Gulf of Urabá to the west , we could see the hills of the Darién Gap , which leads to the border of Panama .
Above us , the sky was another sea .
Tropical storms born in the Atlantic were growing in strength as they made for the Caribbean coast of Colombia , where they would flood the streets and the fields .
It was impossible to sit still and simply wait , but there was nothing we could do .
It was hard to know whether to be worried or not .
“ Man , I really think that he ’s not going to show .
We scared him off , ” Carlos said when we were sitting at the table .
The killer had always been friendly to us , but at this moment , he was down on his luck and paranoid ; he could have changed his mind .
In the past , when we called him , he arrived within minutes .
Lorenzo has come to trust me .
All of this has taken some time to work out , over long nights of drinking .
I asked questions only when he seemed relaxed enough to answer them , and even then he was often careful not to say the names of the men he worked for .
He grew up poor in a mountain village and joined a left - wing revolutionary militia called the Popular Liberation Army ( ELP ) when he was eight , after they promised to pay him a salary .
Of course , what really happened was that he was taken as a child soldier by a group that would eventually be defeated by an up - and - coming right - wing organization .
After growing up in the jungle and learning how to fight , Lorenzo ran away from the ELP when he was fifteen and then joined AUC in the mid-nineties .
For assassins at the time , it was like Silicon Valley during the great boom .
Lorenzo worked first as a soldier and later commanded 600 men in the Medio Atrato river zone , where he fought against the FARC .
Lorenzo then worked for El Aleman — “ the German ” — the commander of the Bananero Block , whose real name is Freddy Rendón .
From 1997 until its dissolution in 2003 , the Bananero Block of the AUC controlled the territory where the Chiquita Brands subsidiary , Banadex , had its vast banana and plantain operations .
During his time with them , the AUC , under the leadership of Salvatore Mancuso and the Castaño brothers ( Carlos and Fidel ) , committed some of the worst atrocities in the Americas .
And despite a well - publicized government amnesty program , the AUC still exists in a clandestine way .
Before turning in his rifle last year , Lorenzo was responsible for his own share of killings , a number of them in cold blood .
Over the course of our two weeks in Urabá , it became clear that he had learned a great deal from his time working for the Bananero Block of the AUC .
Lorenzo is a living archive of paramilitary data , and his commanders , the duros , the hard men at the top , trusted him with some of the most sensitive tasks .
A masked paramilitary soldier from the Metro Bloc guards his commanders at a meeting in Antioquia in September 2003 .
Just as we were about to give up , Lorenzo appeared , smiling as if nothing was wrong .
We found a table in the corner and I asked him about the drugs - for - weapons exchange and the Chiquita freighters .
“ Look , for every kilo of drugs they put in , they had to pay 500,000 pesos .
If you ’re a drug trafficker , and I ’m in control , you ’d have to pay me .
You have 20 kilos of coca , or you have some other cargo , and I own that region — you understand me ?
You pay me 500,000 pesos for me to ship those drugs as if they were mine , in the boats .
You understand ?
Chiquita ’s boats .
That ’s what the Bananero Block had going on here . ”
Lorenzo watched the AUC load drugs onto Chiquita boats ; he knew about it because he was there when it happened .
“ Look , there were drugs , and there were times that they sent drugs for weapons .
They sent the kilos of drugs , and from out there , those duros said we are going to send this many kilos of drugs and I need this many rifles , ” Lorenzo said .
What Lorenzo described was a successful scheme that allowed the AUC to act as a contraband - freight consolidator .
The AUC could ship their own cocaine on the company freighters or they could ship product belonging to someone else for a tax of roughly $ 250 per kilo , which works out to a quarter of the Colombian value of the brick .
And the smuggling scheme was a direct side effect of gaining access to the port .
Lorenzo insisted more than once that Chiquita employees knew about the cocaine : everyone in the chain was paid a percentage to keep quiet , including the freighter captains .
To place a metric ton of someone else ’s product on a ship they did not own , the AUC would have made $ 500,000 , not a bad haul for taking no real risk .
And the paramilitaries received the money whether the product was intercepted or not .
When they shipped their own cocaine , the AUC took the same risks as everyone else .
Hiding cocaine in regular freighter traffic makes it hard to find .
The freighters are enormous vessels .
Without access to the Chiquita port , the AUC could n’t have exported drugs and bought weapons so easily and could not have grown quite so fast as it did in the late nineties .
It was a key part of their metabolism during that time — if you make money from exports , you need to get them to market so you can further expand the business .
Chiquita , after a hundred years in the banana trade , understood this very well .
For the paramilitaries , using the port was a straightforward decision based on necessity .
Lorenzo believed that the AUC must have shipped tons of cocaine using this system , because it went on for years .
But did Chiquita know how its ports were being used ?
We asked him that question many times and his answers did not vary : “ From Chiquita there had been people who knew that they were shipping drugs .
Employees .
People trusted by them , ” he said .
He was adamant : Chiquita employees knew about the drugs as well as the weapons .
On our last night in Turbo we went to drink a farewell beer at a place on the main drag .
Lorenzo was nervous because he was not in his own neighborhood , but he was too polite to say that we picked a bad spot .
In the neighborhood around his house , there are men endlessly riding around on bikes who watch out for him , let him know what ’s going on .
We saw those men ride by , checking up on him .
They all had the close - cropped haircuts of paramilitaries but wore civilian clothes .
Lorenzo leaned close to tell me that , given some time , he could find other AUC soldiers who could talk to us about the weapons and drugs , that he had some names , but that he had to be careful because some of these men were still active .
Before long , the rains arrived with such force that the streets became riverbeds , torrents of mud-colored water coursing down them .
Kids rode their bikes through the deluge , sending rooster - tails of water into the lightning - charged air .

* * * *
There are beggars and a mentally retarded boy who hang around the gates of the maximum - security prison at Itagüí looking for tips .
One old woman offers to clean the fingerprint ink from your hands when you leave in exchange for a few coins .
It is a good business because everyone has ink - stained hands if they leave through the gates .
This was the most important aspect of the security at Itagüí , the pressing of blackened digits into ledgers .
The guards were relaxed and so were the senior officials and the secretaries in their clean blue uniforms with their American - style Velcro patches .
Everyone was having a normal day in a beautiful town in the Andes behind a high fence .
Above us the mountains intercepted the clouds .
The guards waved me through the checkpoints in a friendly and reassuring way .
A few minutes later , I was waiting in an office in the administration building for Salvatore Mancuso , leader of the AUC , to appear — but he did n’t appear .
Out in the hall an official from the Colombian prosecutor ’s office was also waiting to talk to Mancuso , but the official would n’t come into the room .
The young prosecutor walked in slow circles in the dark hallway , waved once , and then went back into the gloom .
A senior prison official came in after an hour and apologized for the delay .
“ I am sorry .
Mr. Mancuso is getting a massage from a girl , and he has to shower and get dressed .
He will come and talk to you when he is ready , ” he explained .
“ His life here is very slow , ” I said .
Mancuso was going to make us all wait so we would know who was in charge .
“ It certainly is .
Patience is very important , ” the officer said and smiled sadly .
We waited in the office a long time , long enough to notice how the light changed on the mountains .
The prosecutor who was waiting outside finally could n’t take it anymore and came into the office with me .
He sat at a nearby desk .
The prosecutor held some information about me in a portfolio that he wanted to verify .
I could hear the leader ’s voice coming up the stairs before he came through the door .
Mancuso has a great voice , a deep baritone that could have come from the opera house .
The boss brought two of his friends with him .
One of them , an older professorial man named Juan Rubbini , edits his website and writes about the AUC political program .
The boss towered over them all .
Salvatore Mancuso , the former English student at the University of Pittsburgh who became the leader of the AUC following the death of Carlos Castaño , was now ready for his audience .
In the past , he has implicated officials as high as the Colombian vice president in connection with paramilitary groups , and he is still a powerful man .
We all shook hands , and then Mancuso disappeared with the official from the prosecutor ’s office and promised to return soon .
Under the Justicia y Paz law , Mancuso is supposed to confess the details of crimes he committed while he ran the AUC .
In exchange , he is allowed to serve a comfortable eight - year sentence in Colombia .
The government has not taken his money or forced him to reveal the exact extent of his criminal organization .
Mancuso ’s comforts in prison abound .
The former head of the AUC has internet access , a phone , and regular visits from friends and family .
In fact , he has the run of the place and walks around without an armed escort .
The guards call him by his first name .
In May , La Semana , an investigative weekly in Colombia , published a report based on telephone and e‑mail intercepts of paramilitary members in Cellblock 1 , where Mancuso lives .
In the intercepted calls , men close to AUC leaders instructed men on the outside to continue extortion schemes and commit murder .
One man close to Mancuso called El Flaco was recorded as he handled orders for the purchase and sale of cocaine .
It would appear from these conversations that the AUC , all cooped up in a single cellblock in Itagüí , did not give up all its power .
AUC duros on the outside still wait for orders .
Rubbini , Mancuso ’s friend , turned to me while I waited for Mancuso to return and said , “ This man demobilized 30,000 men , and they put him in a prison ! ” I said I thought it was remarkable .
Rubbini clearly loves Mancuso and admires him and spends serious time writing down his political views .
Finally the boss returned and I had to ask the other two men to leave .
Mancuso was nervous at first .
It might be that he does n’t often speak to Americans or that he does n’t trust the press .
When I took out my recorder , Mancuso produced his own digital voice recorder and asked if it would bother me if he used it .
I said , no problem at all .
I started by asking him about his political ideas .
It was the FARC that started the whole business with coca , he told me , and that ’s how the AUC got interested in it .
Finally , when he seemed completely at ease , I asked Mancuso about Chiquita and the shipment of weapons that arrived at the Chiquita docks on the Otterloo in November 2001 .
Mancuso ’s demeanor instantly changed as he listened to the question .
It was an intense moment , watching him respond to an unexpected development , calculating his odds , weighing his answer more carefully .
He began by appealing for an appreciation of the broader milieu .
“ What must also be clearly understood is the historical context that existed at that time .
What were the pressures [ Chiquita ] faced , what was happening with them in that area .
The part of Urabá where they had their banana investments was completely dominated by the guerrillas .
The Colombian state was precarious there .
They had to do what the guerrillas told them .
In fact , they were thinking of selling their property and leaving the country at that time .
When we entered the area and confronted the guerrilla phenomenon , we told [ Chiquita ] , ‘ Look , you are the best generators of jobs , of labor , of stability in the area .
Stay here , do n’t leave , keep investing .
We ’ll provide you with protection , but in exchange for that we want you to pay a tax . ’”
On the central question of drug exports from the Banadex port , Mancuso said in his clear , educated Spanish , “ In the specific case of Chiquita , I do n’t know .
But surely they must have loaded up a lot of ships there .
Now , I do n’t know if Chiquita had its own fleet or not .
I think that they did n’t have one , that the ships that came in were from the shipping line , and surely those boats were used and loaded with drugs . ”
In fact , from the time of the weapons shipment until 2003 , Chiquita maintained its own fleet of ships , which regularly used port facilities in Urabá , the site controlled by the AUC .
These are the boats that Lorenzo trusted men to load with the cocaine .
Mancuso tried more than once to say that it was the drug traffickers who managed the smuggling , not the AUC , but this is hard to believe for a number of reasons , not the least being Mancuso ’s own description of his organization ’s involvement in the trade .
His evasiveness is understandable ; he is under an extradition threat and does not want to admit to more direct knowledge of drug smuggling than he has to .
I asked him if the AUC ever traded cocaine for weapons .
Mancuso leaned over the desk and said , “ Phillip , we did it many times .
We exchanged drugs for guns .
Basically , almost all the arms transactions were made either in drugs or [ US ] dollars . ”
He confirmed that this was a main part of their growth strategy , and then spoke about AUC export taxes for cocaine in Urabá .
“ They charged $ 500,000 per kilo ?
Look , there were blocks up there that charged a $ 100 , $ 150 , $ 200 , $ 300 tax to dispatch a boat , or whatever was going out — a boat , a ship , whatever .
It was the AUC block that charged . ”
If I wanted to know the exact details , Mancuso said , I would have to talk to the commanders of the Bananero Block of the AUC , his subordinates .
Lorenzo also insisted that Chiquita people had meetings with AUC duros about drug smuggling and weapons .
Lorenzo knew the exact place where they had meetings , but Mancuso would n’t admit to knowing about a specific agreement to export drugs from the port , although he would go on to describe the AUC drug - export scenario in vivid detail .
Mancuso said he did not believe that executives of the company knew about the drugs - for - weapons exchange , because it was n’t necessary for them to know .
“ The people who run the port at an operational level had to be involved ; those are the people who would notice all this . ”
“ How hard is it to exchange cocaine for weapons ? ” I asked .
“ It ’s the easiest thing in the world , ” he said and smiled .
Chiquita relies heavily on bananas grown in the Urabá region .
During the 1980s and ’90s , Communist rebels of the FARC and members of the AUC fought bitterly for control of this region .
* * * *
The company will no doubt say that if there were any drugs shipped on its freighters when the AUC controlled its port , it did not know about them .
But over the years , people did find out about it and were either intimidated or paid to stay silent .
This export scheme was the exact mechanism that allowed the AUC to grow and to commit crimes on a vast scale .
To acquire weapons it had to ship cocaine to the United States and Europe , so it looked for an export channel .
Simple .
In Urabá , AUC was merely a symbiont on the body of a larger corporation that happened to share its interests .
It , too , was a kind of corporation .
They fed off each other .
Outside the gate of the prison , the old woman asked me how it went .
I said that it went well while she cleaned the ink from my fingers with a spray bottle .
The air had warmed up since the morning .
The same police officer smiled and waved , and I started walking down the hill to town .
Below the mountains of Itagüí , people were getting ready for the Festival of Flowers , while above them drifted the legions of Colombian ghosts who follow their every move .
Phillip Robertson and Carlos Villalon traveled to Colombia on a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting .
More about this project on the Center ’s website .
I am writing to you regarding the bill ( H.R. 1955 ) which you drafted and introduced to the House , Rep. Harmon and which you Sen.
Collins are introducing to the Senate ( S. 1959 ) , “ To Establish the National Commission on the Prevention of Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism , and for other purposes . ”
The purpose of this open letter to yourselves and the public is to :
A ) Address the concerns of terrorism on the rise and make a suggestion
B ) Publicly expose the war on terror for what it is : A fake
C ) Prove that you are using the term “ terrorism ” as code language really targeting vocal Americans .
Anyone who doubts this assertion will have little room left for doubt after reading this letter and reading a few of the links provided .
Those who read all of these links will have zero room left for doubt .
And the public will begin to see right through your “ war on terrorism ” charade .
D ) Discuss your proposed law in a fact - based way .
I will disprove your claims that this bill does not crack down on civil liberties , especially in conjunction with the Patriot Act .
E ) Issue a public call for you both to resign , because you have the boldness to introduce legislation targeting free thought rather than action , as occurs only in Red China - like dictatorships .
F ) Request that any readers who agree with these conclusions demand your resignation .
After reading Atsushi Igarashi’s paper Deriving Compilers and Virtual Machines for a Multi-Level Language , I gave myself the following exercise : given an interpreter of a small language , derive a virtual machine and a corresponding compiler .
Such techniques probably date back to Ager et al. , where they built connections between not one but five pairs of denotational semantics and existing abstract machines ( Krivine ’s , CEK , CLS , SECD , and Categorical Abstract Machine ) .
They continued to explore a number of variations in subsequent papers .
Igarashi’s paper also deals with a more difficult topic — to derive an abstract machine for a language with quotes / unquotes .
As a starting point to appreciating their work , I tried this small example one could do in one afternoon .
Let us start with this simple language with numerical values , a binary operator for addition , lambda abstraction and variables represented by de Bruijn notation , and application :
data Exp = Val Int | Var Int | Plus Exp Exp | Lam Exp | App Exp Exp deriving Show
The expression ( λf a b. f a + f b ) ( ( λc d. c + d) 1 ) 2 3 , for example , would be represented by :
( App ( App ( App ( Lam ( Lam ( Lam ( Plus ( App ( Var 2 ) ( Var 1 ) ) ( App ( Var 2 ) ( Var 0 ) ) ) ) ) ) ( App ( Lam ( Lam ( Plus ( Var 0 ) ( Var 1 ) ) ) ) ( Val 1 ) ) ) ( Val 2 ) ) ( Val 3 ) )
An expression evaluates to either a number or a closure :
data Val = Num Int | Clos Env Exp deriving Show
And the evaluator can be defined , in an almost standard manner , in the continuation passing style :
type Cont = Val -> Val type Env = [ Val ] eval :: Exp -> Env ->
Cont ->
Val eval ( Val n ) _ k = k ( Num n ) eval ( Var n ) env k = k ( env !! n ) eval ( Plus e1 e2 ) env k = eval e1 env ( \( Num i ) -> eval e2 env ( \( Num j ) -> k ( Num ( i + j ) ) ) ) eval ( Lam e ) env k = k ( Clos env e ) eval ( App e1 e2 ) env k = eval e1 env ( \( Clos env' body ) -> eval e2 env ( \v -> eval body ( v : env ' ) k ) )
Like in many derivations , we have cheated a little from the beginning .
The use of de Bruijn indices makes env act like a stack , while CPS abstracts the control flow of the virtual machine to be derived .
Defunctionalising the Continuation
The derivation relies on Reynolds ’ defunctionalisation : to enumerate the instances where a higher order function is used , and represent them by first - order structures .
As the first step , we aim to replace the continuation Cont , a synonym of Val ->
Val , by some datatype :
data Cont = Cont 0 | Cont1 ... | Cont2 ... | ...
and to define a function appK :: Cont -> Val ->
Val pattern - matching Cont and performing the actions that were to be done in eval .
Where there used to be a continuation application in eval , we replace it with an application of appK :
eval :: Exp -> Env ->
Cont ->
Val eval ( Val n ) _ k = appK k ( Num n ) eval ( Var n ) env k = appK k ( env !! n)
The case for Plus is more complicated .
In the original definition :
eval ( Plus e1 e2 ) env k = eval e1 env ( \( Num i ) -> eval e2 env ( \( Num j ) -> k ( Num ( i + j ) ) ) )
the red subexpression should be replaced by a first - order data structure .
We call it Cont1 , leaving the free variables e2 , env , and k as its parameters :
eval ( Plus e1 e2 ) env k = eval e1 env ( Cont1 e2 env k )
the function appK , upon matching Cont1 , carries out what was supposed to be computed in eval :
appK ( Cont1 e2 env k) ( Num i ) = eval e2 env ( \( Num j ) -> k ( Num ( i + j ) ) )
However , the red subexpression should be replaced by a first order construct too .
Introducing a new constructor Cont2 and abstracting over the free variables i and k , we get :
appK ( Cont1 e2 env k) ( Num i ) = eval e2 env ( Cont2 i k ) appK ( Cont2 i k ) ( Num j ) = appK k ( Num ( i + j ) )
The next few cases are dealt with in the same way .
Eventually we get the code below .
The modified parts are marked in red :
data Cont = Cont0 | Cont1 Exp Env Cont | Cont2 Int Cont | Cont3 Exp Env Cont | Cont4 Exp Env Cont deriving
Show eval :: Exp -> Env ->
Cont ->
Val eval ( Val n ) _ k = appK k ( Num n ) eval ( Var n ) env k = appK k ( env !! n ) eval ( Plus e1 e2 ) env k = eval e1 env ( Cont1 e2 env k ) eval ( Lam e ) env k = appK k ( Clos env e ) eval ( App e1 e2 ) env k = eval e1 env ( Cont3 e2 env k ) appK :: Cont -> Val ->
Val appK Cont0 v = v appK ( Cont1 e2 env k) ( Num i ) = eval e2 env ( Cont2 i k ) appK ( Cont2 i k ) ( Num j ) = appK k ( Num ( i + j ) ) appK ( Cont3 e2 env k ) ( Clos env' body ) = eval e2 env ( Cont4 body env' k ) appK ( Cont4 body env ' k ) v = eval body ( v : env ' ) k
Separating the Evaluator from the Virtual Machine
The functions eval and appK are mutually recursive .
Later , however , appK is to evolve into a part of the virtual machine and eval the compiler .
We do not want to mix the two stages .
The next task is therefore to separate them .
In the definition of appK , the function eval is called in three places .
In all these cases , eval is applied to an expression captured in Cont .
Rather than performing the application in appK , we can also make it happen earlier in eval and store the partially applied result in Cont :
eval :: Exp -> Env ->
Cont ->
Val eval ( Val n ) _ k = appK k ( Num n ) eval ( Var n ) env k = appK k ( env !! n ) eval ( Plus e1 e2 ) env k = eval e1 env ( Cont1 ( eval e2 ) env k ) eval ( Lam e ) env k = appK k ( Clos env ( eval e ) ) eval ( App e1 e2 ) env k = eval e1 env ( Cont3 ( eval e2 ) env k ) appK :: Cont -> Val ->
Val appK Cont0 v = v appK ( Cont1 c2 env k) ( Num i ) = c2 env ( Cont2 i k ) appK ( Cont2 i k ) ( Num j ) = appK k ( Num ( i + j ) ) appK ( Cont3 c2 env k ) ( Clos env ' cb ) = c2 env ( Cont4 cb env' k ) appK ( Cont4 cb env ' k ) v = cb ( v : env ' ) k
The datatypes Cont and Val no longer store expressions , but partially applied instances of eval .
Define :
type Compt = Env ->
Cont ->
Val
The datatypes are updated to :
data Val = Num Int | Clos Env Compt data Cont = Cont0 | Cont1 Compt Env Cont | Cont2 Int Cont | Cont3 Compt Env Cont | Cont4 Compt Env Cont
Notice that while Env is a data stack , Cont , having a list - like structure , acts as a control stack .
Constructors Cont1 , Cont3 , and Cont4 store a pointer ( Env ) into the data stack .
What about Compt ?
As we will soon see , by applying another defunctionalisation , Compt becomes a list of instructions .
The pointer in Cont with type Compt can therefore be seen as an instruction pointer .
Defunctionalising the Computation
By defunctionalising , we replace Compt by a first - order data structure , and create a function appC :: Compt -> Env -> Cont -> Val .
This time , however , we try to choose more telling names for the introduced instructions .
The first two clauses of eval , for example , is split into :
data Compt = Lit Int | Access Int | ... eval :: Exp ->
Compt eval ( Val m ) =
Lit m eval ( Var n ) = Access n appC :: Compt -> Env ->
Cont ->
Val appC ( Lit m ) env k = appK k ( Num m ) appC ( Access n ) env k = appK k ( env !! n)
Examining the more interesting case eval ( Plus e1 e2 ) env k = eval e1 env ( Cont1 ( eval e2 ) env k ) , we realise that we only have to abstract the two calls to eval as parameters :
data Compt = Lit Int | Access Int | Push Compt Compt ... eval ( Plus e1 e2 ) = Push1 ( eval e1 ) ( eval e2 ) appC ( Push1 is1 is2 ) env k = appC is1 env ( Cont1 is2 env k )
The transformed program is given below .
We also rename the constructors of Cont to more telling names , roughly following the naming by Igarashi :
data Cont = Halt | EvOpnd Compt Env Cont | EvSum Int Cont | EvArg Compt Env Cont | EvBody Compt Env Cont deriving Show data Compt = Lit Int | Access Int | Close Compt | Push1 Compt Compt | Push2 Compt Compt eval :: Exp ->
Compt eval ( Val m ) =
Lit m eval ( Var n ) = Access n eval ( Plus e1 e2 ) = Push1 ( eval e1 ) ( eval e2 ) eval ( Lam e ) = Close ( eval e ) eval ( App e1 e2 ) = Push2 ( eval e1 ) ( eval e2 ) appC :: Compt -> Env ->
Cont ->
Val appC ( Lit m ) env k = appK k ( Num m ) appC ( Access n ) env k = appK k ( env !! n) appC ( Close is ) env k = appK k ( Clos env is ) appC ( Push1 is1 is2 ) env k = appC is1 env ( EvOpnd is2 env k ) appC ( Push2 is1 is2 ) env k = appC is1 env ( EvArg is2 env k ) appK :: Cont -> Val ->
Val appK Halt v = v appK ( EvOpnd c2 env k) ( Num i ) = appC c2 env ( EvSum i k ) appK ( EvSum i k ) ( Num j ) = appK k ( Num ( i + j ) ) appK ( EvArg c2 env k ) ( Clos env ' cb ) = appC c2 env ( EvBody cb env' k ) appK ( EvBody cb env' k ) v = appC cb ( v : env ' ) k
Now , functions appC and appK together constitute a virtual machine , while eval compiles a program to its machine code Compt .
The sample expression ( λf a b. f a + f b ) ( ( λc d. c + d) 1 ) 2 3 , for example , is compiled to :
Push2 ( Push2 ( Push2 ( Close ( Close ( Close ( Push1 ( Push2 ( Access 2 ) ( Access 1 ) ) ( Push2 ( Access 2 ) ( Access 0 ) ) ) ) ) )
( Push2 ( Close ( Close ( Push1 ( Access 0 ) ( Access 1 ) ) ) ) ( Lit 1 ) ) ) ( Lit 2 ) ) ( Lit 3 )
Once you understand how it works , the derived result is not so surprising .
Igarashi sort of mentioned that it is not too difficult to add recursion .
See his paper for more interesting results , such as extension to multi- level languages — programs that generate programs .
Dean Baker reviews the economic plans of the Republican presidential candidates :
Creative thinking , by Dean Baker , Comment is Free : Since several of the Republican presidential candidates regard creationism as a serious theory in biology , it should not be surprising that their economic views also have little connection to reality .
In fact , the Republicans ' test scores in biology are probably somewhat higher than in economics .
Creationism is a minority view ...
By contrast , all of them seem to be spouting some pretty crazy views on the economy .
Of course tax cuts are central to the Republicans ' economic story .
They have great plans to reduce taxes , especially for people who do n't work for a living .
For example , Mitt Romney ... insists that anyone with an income of less than $ 200,000 a year should pay no tax on any income from dividends , capital gains or interest .
Under the Romney plan , a person who collects $ 200,000 a year in interest on $ 4 m held in government bonds would pay zero tax .
By contrast , a custodian working two jobs to earn $ 40,000 a year can look to pay around $ 4,000 a year in taxes .
In the same vein , Mike Huckabee has proposed the " Fair Tax " , which his website claims is " based on wealth " , although it is described as a sales tax .
Huckabee proposes to have his Fair Tax replace all other forms of taxation ...
If a national sales tax is to replace all other federal taxes , then it would have to be in the neighbourhood of 25 % to 30 % .
...
If we do n't tax items like healthcare and house sales ... , we might be up to 40 % with Huckabee 's Fair Tax .
But this is where the fun comes in .
Typical workers will probably have to pay President Huckabee 's Fair Tax on almost everything they buy throughout their life .
But , the smart folks who make their money by inheritance , strike it rich on Wall Street or work in highly paid professions can simple skip out on the Fair Tax .
...
Their tax burden will get passed on to the teachers , fire fighters , custodians and others who are left behind .
What could be fairer ?
Fred Thompson also deserves credit for creativity .
He proposes the option to pay tax at a marginal rate of 10 % for couples on earnings below $ 100,000 and 25 % on earnings over $ 100,000 .
This would be a modest cut in taxes for most workers , but it would reduce taxes by more than a third for the richest 1 % . ...
All the Republican candidates claim to be devout believers in tax cut creationism : the view that tax cuts pay for themselves due to their effect on stimulating growth .
Even Rudy Giuliani and former straight talker John McCain claim to believe that tax cuts pay for themselves .
It is important to understand that this one is not a debatable point , as often claimed in the media .
Tax cuts do not come close to paying for themselves .
There is no serious dispute among economists on this issue .
The Congressional Budget Office recently did a study examining the range of predictions from the available theoretical models on this topic .
It found that the most optimistic model showed that growth replaces less than one - third of the lost revenue , and even this gain was only possible for a limited period of time .
In short , when the Republicans claim that they can have large tax cuts without any offsetting cuts in spending , they are prescribing a route to really large deficits .
Of course , this suggests an important reason why some people may opt to support the Republican contenders .
With the Democrats backing down from plans to end the war in Iraq , the war may continue long into the future if Democrats take the White House .
On the other hand , the tax cuts proposed by the leading Republicans could take away the money needed to prosecute the war .
In short , when it comes to the war in Iraq , the only way out may be to " starve the beast " .
Since I 've been noting reality - based Laffer curve reporting lately , I should acknowledge this from Ross Douthat ( as pointed out at Crooked Timber , it 's helpful to realize that David Frum is one of Giuliani's " senior policy advisers " ) :
Anti-Intellectualism , the Right , and Rudy , by Ross Douthat : David Frum , on populism and anti-intellectualism : Conservatives have drawn strength from populism .
But you can overdo any good thing — and I am beginning to think that on this one , we 've zoomed the car into the red zone .
For me , the lights started flashing in 2005 , during the battle over the nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court of the United States .
Defenders of the president 's under - qualified nominee began attacking the concept of qualification .
One wrote : " The GOP is not the party which idolizes Ivy League acceptability as the criterion of intellectual and mental fitness .
Nor does the Supreme Court ideally consist of the nine greatest legal scholars . "
Harriet Miers , we were told , had a good Christian heart .
That was enough ...
In the end , it was not quite enough for Ms. Miers .
But it may be enough for many voters in 2008 .
The currently front - running candidate in Iowa , former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee , has built his campaign on a plan to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and replace the federal income tax with a national sales tax ...
Economists and tax experts virtually unanimously agree that the plan is beyond unworkable -- that it is downright absurd .
...
Just a little lower down in the polls is a libertarian candidate named Ron Paul .
Paul is best known for his vehemently isolationist foreign policy views .
But his core supporters also thrill to his self - taught monetary views , which amount to a rejection of everything taught by modern economists from Alfred Marshall to Milton Friedman .
Huckabee and Paul have not the faintest idea of what they are talking about .
The problem is not that their answers are wrong -- that can happen to anyone .
The problem is that they do n't understand the questions , and are too lazy or too arrogant to learn .
Fair points all : ... , and Frum 's larger worry about anti-intellectualism in the contemporary Right is one I share in spades .
But if you 're going to be hard on the current crop of Republican candidates for making bogus claims about public policy , it seems awfully unfair to leave out the candidate given to running ads in which he announces : " I know that reducing taxes produces more revenue .
The Democrats do n't know that .
They do n't believe that . "
( They do n't believe it , of course , because in the current fiscal landscape you can't find a serious conservative economist who thinks it 's true . )
Or penning op - eds in which he explains that " the meaning of fiscal conservatism " includes the principle that " lower taxes can result in higher revenue . "
Or telling a GOP debate audience , in response to a question about whether we need to raise taxes to fix up our nation 's transportation infrastructure , that the way “ to do it sometimes is to reduce taxes and raise more money . ”
Now it ’s true that occasionally Rudy Giuliani hedges his bets ( “ sometimes , ” “ can , ” and so forth ) on this topic , and it ’s true as well that he may not actually believe the extreme supply - side talking points he ’s spouting , in the way that Huckabee presumably believes in the Fair Tax and Paul in the gold standard .
On the other hand , neither of those ideas are likely to serve as the basis for economic policy in the United States any time soon , and both are marginal even within the right - wing coalition ; the “ tax cuts raise revenue ” canard that Giuliani keeps promoting , on the other hand , is a staple of Bush Administration rhetoric and probably the dominant view among movement conservatives .
If you ’re looking for cases where the Right ’s anti-elitism has shaded into outright anti-intellectualism - for cases where , in Frum 's words , a GOP politician has deliberately failed to " study the problem , master the evidence , and face criticism " - Giuliani ’s frequent channeling of Larry Kudlow seems like at least as telling an example as anything Mike Huckabee and Ron Paul are peddling .
I do n't believe it's " anti-intellectualism , " i.e .
I do n't believe that Giuliani is unaware of the evidence on this issue ( and his policy advisers ought to be aware of it - if they are n't , or if they are reluctant to correct his misleading , untrue statements , that 's a big worry ) .
This is a character issue .
I do n't believe Giuliani has deliberately ' failed to " study the problem , master the evidence , and face criticism " ' through a deliberate act of anti-intellectualism .
The chances that the campaign is unaware of all the fact checks on this issue are zero .
It seems to me that what is deliberate is the willingness to pander to the movement conservative base even if it requires ignoring the evidence and saying things he knows in his heart of hearts are n't true .
He 's not deliberately ignorant , he 's deliberately calculating and we should n't excuse it by acknowledging the occasional hedge ( “ sometimes , ” “ can , ” and so forth ) when the intent is to mislead , or use terms like anti-intellectualism to describe the behavior .
We should n't just say , " when the Republicans claim that they can have large tax cuts without any offsetting cuts in spending , they are prescribing a route to really large deficits , " we should also note that there is an intent to deceive , that they are not telling the truth , or they are so ignorant of the truth that it ought to raise questions about their fitness for office .
Giuliani and others who make this claim know what they are doing .
When it comes to , say , selling a war with Iran , reforming Social Security , or other issues , will they also be willing to ignore evidence , to only accept " facts " that confirm their preconceived beliefs instead of objectively reviewing the situation , will they be willing to look you in the eye and mislead in order to convince you to go along with their plans ?
Those who continue to make misleading claims about tax cuts in spite of the very public debunking of that position have given every indication that the answer is yes .
The government has appealed a September federal court ruling that struck down the National Security Letter ( NSL ) provision of the PATRIOT Act .
The NSL provision , which can be used without probable cause or judicial oversight , gives the FBI the ability to secretly demand access to the private records of libraries , Internet service providers , and other organizations .
National Security Letters also impose gag restrictions on recipients , which forbid them from disclosing that they have received the letter .
In a strongly - worded ruling issued earlier this year in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of an anonymous Internet service provider , federal court judge Victor Marrero wrote that the NSL provision of the PATRIOT
Act represents an unconstitutional deprivation of First Amendment rights and threatens to undermine the Separation of Powers doctrine by expanding the executive branch 's authority to the detriment of governmental accountability .
The government has now appealed Marerro 's ruling and will continue to fight for the preservation of the PATRIOT Act in court .
" If Congress were able not only to enact the substance of legislation , but also to prescribe the precise corresponding rule telling the courts what level of scrutiny to apply in properly gauging the constitutionality of the statute 's application in practice , " wrote Marerro in his ruling , " the barriers against government abuse that the principles of separation and balance of powers were designed to erect could be severely compromised , and may eventually collapse , with consequential diminution of the judiciary 's function , and hence potential dire effects to individual freedoms . "
Critics of the controversial NSL provision argue that it enables law enforcement agents to circumvent due process .
This criticism is particularly significant in light of recent revelations of troubling irregularities discovered by the Office of the Inspector General during an investigation of the FBI 's NSL practices .
Critics also point out that the NSL gag orders conflict with basic First Amendment rights by censoring affected parties and preventing them from participating in any debate about the implications of the PATRIOT Act .
In a statement issued yesterday by the American Civil Liberties Union , a representative of an ISP voiced concerns about the National Security Letter gag orders and expressed frustration at being unable to testify during recent Congressional inquiry regarding the involvement of telecommunications companies in the NSA wiretap program .
As a result of the gag order , the speaker is forced to remain anonymous and cannot disclose specific details regarding the National Security Letters that his company has received .
" Perhaps the most harmful consequence of the gag provisions is that they make it difficult or impossible for people like me — people who have firsthand experience with the NSL statute — to discuss their specific concerns with the public , the press , and Congress .
This seems to be counterintuitive to everything I assumed about this country 's commitment to free speech and the value of political discourse , " the ISP representative wrote .
" It has been especially frustrating to be operating under a gag order while Congress is considering whether to grant immunity to telecommunication companies that illegally disclosed information to the NSA .
It is unfathomable to me that Congress is considering granting immunity to these companies that acted illegally while those who resisted illegal demands are prohibited even from identifying themselves or explaining their actions publicly . "
Advocacy groups like the ACLU hope that the courts will uphold Judge Marrero 's ruling so that National Security Letter provision can be eliminated and the FBI will be forced to adhere to the rule of law as it pursues future investigations .
Mr. Pitt said he had been attached to New Orleans for more than a decade .
“ I ’ve always had a fondness for this place — it ’s like no other , ” he said .
“ Seeing the frustration firsthand made me want to return the kindness this city has shown me . ”

Rather than bemoan the slow pace of redevelopment in the Ninth Ward , Mr. Pitt said he decided to address the problem directly by teaming with William McDonough , the green design expert ; Graft , a Los Angeles architecture firm ; and Cherokee , an investment firm based in Raleigh , N.C. , that specializes in sustainable redevelopment .
John Williams of New Orleans is the executive architect for the project .
“ If you have this blank slate and this great technology out there , what better test than low - income housing ? ” Mr. Pitt said .
“ It ’s got to work at all levels to really be viable . ”
When Make It Right was announced at the meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative in September , Mr. Pitt pledged to match $ 5 million in contributions to the project , as did Steve Bing , the philanthropist .
Nine other firms — all of whom donated their services — are involved , including Adjaye Associates ; Billes Architecture ; BNIM Architects ; Constructs ; Eskew & Dumez & Ripple ; MVRDV ; Pugh and Scarpa Architecture ; Shigeru Ban Architects ; and Trahan Architects .
“ We wanted to have a mixture of voices , ” Mr. Pitt said .
Beyond serving a public need , Mr. Pitt — who has a longstanding interest in architecture — was eager to see what the designers came up with .
“ I was most curious about advancing the discussion further , ” he said .
“ That was certainly one of the benefits of this exercise .
There is no other reason to call on these great minds if you ’re just going to shackle them . ”
As noted by the uniquely vigilant Charlie Savage in the Boston Globe , President Bush in November issued a signing statement unconstitutionally overturning 10 sections of H.R. 3222 , the " Department of Defense Appropriations Act , 2008 . "
Among the little technical details Bush just erased was the requirement that he not take funds appropriated to the Pentagon for one thing and use them for something else .
So , for example , were Congress to stop passing bills to fund the occupation of Iraq , or never pass a bill to fund an attack on Iran , it would n't matter to Bush and Cheney .
( Cheney 's lawyer writes the signing statements . )
On January 31 , 2007 , the House Judiciary Committee held hearings on Bush 's signing statements at which John Elwood , Deputy Assistant Attorney General , testified that signing statements carry no more force than press releases .
Then in June 2007 , the Government Accountability Office reported that in a sample of Bush signing statements the office had studied , for 30 percent of them the Bush administration had already proceeded to violate the laws the statements claimed the right to violate .
So , the signing statements may carry no force , but they offer good predictions of future crimes .
And someone should let our Supreme Court justices know that the statements have no force , so they stop citing them .
Someone should also inform recent victims of U.S. torture .
On September 10 , 2007 , General David Petraeus testified before the House Armed Services Committee , where Rep. Brad Sherman asked Petraeus what he would do if Congress stopped funding the occupation of Iraq and Bush illegally ordered him to keep it going .
Petraeus ' answer that he'd have to ask his lawyer is less interesting than Sherman 's question , which demonstrated awareness of how Bush would react to a cut off of funds .
On November 6 , Sherman voted against tabling the impeachment of Cheney , but he has not sponsored a resolution for it or moved to begin hearings .
Little known to American media consumers are the following basic facts :
The Pentagon is rolling in mountains of money and could fund the occupation of Iraq without receiving money for that purpose .
The President misappropriated funds from the Pentagon to lay the groundwork for the invasion of Iraq , and Congress knows this but has never complained .
Congress has banned the use of funds for the construction of permanent U.S. military bases in Iraq , and Bush has continued their construction .
Bush has used massive amounts of money for a long list of programs that were not only never funded but also illegal for other reasons .
These include spying programs that violate the Fourth Amendment and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
All of this suggests that were Congress to cut off the funding for the occupation of Iraq , Bush would continue it anyway .
His latest signing statement will be read by Congress as an announcement of that fact .
But this point will appear to the average American media consumer as irrelevant , given the Democrats ' supposed inability to cut off the funding anyway .
One of the two biggest open secrets in American politics is that no bill is needed to end the legal funding of the occupation of Iraq .
The occupation can be ended with an announcement by Congressional leaders that there will be no more funding .
Any proposal to fund it can be blocked by 41 senators , or by one if his name is Reid .
Bush has plenty of money for withdrawal ( an understatement so dramatic it feels dishonest ) and could be given more for that exclusive purpose ( if Congress insisted ) .
When your television tells you that the Democrats need 60 or 67 senators in order to end the occupation , your television is lying to you .
Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid could if they wanted announce today that the House and Senate will no longer bring to a vote any bills to fund anything other than withdrawal .
They have many colleagues already on board with that position , not to mention two thirds of the country .
It would take 218 signatures on a discharge petition to force a bill to the floor of the House without Pelosi 's approval .
It is unlikely enough Democrats would oppose their party to fund Bush 's occupation in that way .
In the Senate , Reid alone could refuse to bring a bill to the floor , or another senator could put a secret hold on a bill .
And , while not all bills can be filibustered ( appropriations bills can be , budget reconciliation bills cannot ) , you can hardly claim you need 60 votes to get past a filibuster without admitting that with only 41 you could launch your own filibuster and that with 51 you could defeat any bill .
Once we understand the goal as blocking bills rather than passing them , the number of allies we need shrinks dramatically .
Blocking a bill in either the House or the Senate is sufficient to block it .
Here 's a transcript of Reid admitting that he could block the funding but wo n't .
Of course , Reid and many other Senators are routinely referred to as " critics " of the Iraq " war " .
But a war is something that can be won or lost , a contest between two nation 's armies .
What we have in Iraq is a hostile foreign occupation that can never be won .
And a critic is someone who sits on the sidelines and critiques .
Senators do not sit on the sidelines of this occupation .
On the contrary , they fund it .
They fund it by refusing every time to filibuster the funding bills .
( When Senator Dodd threatened to filibuster immunity for telecoms , his colleagues backed off , but he refuses to filibuster the occupation . )
And they fund it by ignoring Bush 's announcement that he will take money from elsewhere if he needs to .
Why is Congress so scared to act against the least popular project in many years by confronting the least popular president and vice president this country has ever seen ?
Why do some in Congress choose to fund the occupation precisely because Bush would fund it anyway ?
Why does the House Judiciary Committee allow open crimes to be publicly announced with signing statements posted on the White House website , and not stir ?
Why has Congress allowed executive refusal to comply with subpoenas to become routine , after the precedent of passing an article of impeachment against Nixon for a similar refusal ?
I think , fairly clearly , the primary reason for all of this is Nancy Pelosi 's unconstitutional , unconscionable , and even politically unjustifiable , aversion to impeachment .
Her arguments have , however , long since been answered .
But what about peace activist organizations ?
Why do they go along with the pretense of supporting bills destined to be vetoed rather than demanding a cut off of funds or - what is ultimately required - impeachment ?
I do n't have a good answer , but part of he answer is the influence on activists of politicians who tell them that they are friends , who make them feel powerful , and who echo what everyone hears on their televisions about the Democrats ' inability to act no matter how much they supposedly want to , and about the supposedly all - important elections 12 months away .
The other of the two biggest public secrets in U.S. politics is that you , dear reader , are not a freak .
You imagine that you are in a minority wanting to end the occupation , and so you worry about persuading your neighbors rather than forcing your congress members to act .
You suppose that only a handful of people want impeachment or single - payer health care or green energy , even though these are all majority positions .
And , most dramatically , you imagine that because you are a freak , the candidates you feel inclined to support for public office must be different from the candidates you should , as an educated TV viewer , actually support .
But this is how democracy dies .
This is democracy stripped from our souls , where Walt Whitman tried to plant it , and installed in the machinations of corporate pundits and corrupt parties .
Until we can believe that who we like and what we want of them are things that others share , until we define our personal preferences as precisely what is most " viable " , we can have no growing democracy .
We are currently keeping secret from ourselves the idea that we even want it .

OreScript時代の幕開け - yukobaの日 記
http://d.hatena.ne.jp/yukoba/20071108/p1
巷で OreScript ブームが巻き起こる中、某所ではさらに局地的に Javascript での言語実装ブーム 。
××さん が ******* を試作したり、西尾さんが python4js を試作したりして、うーむこんなおもしろそうなお祭りは看過できんでわないか。Ruby 成分の多い中谷としてはここはやっぱ Javascript で Ruby かっ！？
そういえばだれか Javascript でパーサ書いてはったよなあ。それを使わせてもらえば
Ruby の構文木をさっくり得られて、ちょこちょこっとインタプリタ書いたら、FizzBuzz くらいなら動くんじゃないの？ という思いついてしまったからには、もう作ってみるしか。
というわけで言った者勝ち(笑 ) の JSRuby をこしらえてみました 。
リンク先のページで簡単な演算や FizzBuzz の実行テストを行えます。一応 IE6 , Firefox2 , Opera9 , Safari3 β で動作確認はしてみました 。Safari2 では RegExp.rightContext がサポートされていないそうなので動きません( amachang サンクス ) 。すいません 。
コードは < script type =" text / ruby " > で埋め込んであるのを拾って textarea に出しているので、編集して実行することもできるようにしてあります。
んが、正直今のところ 「 Ruby で書かれた FizzBuzz を実行できる 、Ruby っぽい何か 」なので、普通の Ruby スクリプトを入れてもまだまず動きません( 苦笑 ) 。
実装範囲 は
・演算子 + , - , * , / , == , ..
・演算の優先順位は有効
・数値、文字列リテラル
・代入
・組み込み関数 puts
・ if ～ then ～ elsif ～ else ～ end
・配列に対する each メソッ ド
以上！ って本当に FizzBuzz しか見てません ……
とはいえ一応代入も if もちゃんと値を返すので、a=b=4 とか puts if x % 2 == 0 then " even " else " odd " end という書き方はちゃんとできます 。
実装済みの範囲でも怪しいところはちらほら。特に前者はやばめ。
・パーサの時点で識別子をメソッドか変数か決定してしまっている(ミスった)
・ Ruby の型を扱っていない（整数の割り算が実数になる、 .. 演 算子が( javascriptの ) 配列を返す、など）
あと残念ながら、パーサは当初考えていた
Gin ではなく、自前で再帰下降パーサを手書きしてます( 隠れ左再帰を見つけられず、too much recursion を解消できなかった …… ) 。
まあ半分ネタとはいえせっかく作ったので、上に書いた識別子の問題を解消し、ソースを分割、テストコードを付け、CodeRepos にアップさせてもらえれば、みんなでよってたかってつついてくれて、あれーいつの間にかできてる！ とか妄想中ｗ
フル実装は夢としても、どう書く？org の Rubyコードの７割がたが動く、くらいならかなり現実的な気もしますです。
この状態で使ってみようという人はいないと思いますが、簡単な使い方。
jsruby.js を組み込んで、
var parser = new RubyEngine .
Parser ( ) ; var ruby = new RubyEngine .
Interpreter ( ) ; ruby.run(parser.parse ( " puts 2*3+4*5 ; 9*9*9 " ) )
とやれば指定の ruby コードを実行します 。
ruby.run ( ) の返値は最終の式の評価なので、この場合 729 が返ってきます。
また、標準出力の値は ruby . stdout から取り出せます( この場 合 " 26
" が入っている ) 。
標準出力への書き出しは ruby.writeStdout ( ) を上書きすることで変更できます。例えば ruby.run ( ) の前に
ruby.writeStdout = function ( st ) { alert ( st ) ; }
と入れれば、都度ダイアログで表示されます。
There ’s been a welcome resurgence of interest in web typography over the past year or so , with many articles and conference talks offering techniques and theory .
Frequently asserted is the notion that good typography requires accurate control of font size and line - height .
But this is the web : it ’s a special medium where the reader can have as much control as the designer — the implication being that text on the web , while bending to the designer ’s will , must also be reliably resizable across browsers and platforms .
Article Continues Below
In this article , we will reconcile the designer ’s requirement for accuracy with the user ’s need to resize text on demand , arriving at a best practice that satisfies designers and users and works across browsers and platforms .
We ’ll reach our destination by the traditional method of trial and error .
With more than a nod to Owen Briggs ’s pioneering work of 2002 , I have created a base case with six iterations and 161 screenshots .
Follow along , wo n’t you ?
The test suite#section2
The content used for testing purposes was a two - column layout with body copy on the left and a sidebar on the right .
Text was set in Arial to aid consistency across operating systems and platforms .
The browsers used for testing were Safari 2 , Firefox 2 and Opera 9.5α running on Mac OS X Tiger , along with Internet Explorer 6 ( IE6 ) and Internet Explorer 7 ( IE7 ) running on Windows XP with ClearType turned on .
Clearly this is not an exhaustive list of browsers , operating systems , or rendering engines , but it covers the majority of users out there today .
Each operating system and browser was run using its default settings .
Every iteration was tested to see how each browser rendered text at smaller , medium , larger , and largest sizes , along with 90 % , 100 % , 110 % , and 120 % page zoom levels , where applicable .
Base case #section3
First it was necessary to verify that browsers provided a consistent baseline from which to start .
The base case shows that in each browser , the default text size is consistently 16px when no styles are applied ( other than the browser defaults ) , and the text scales fairly consistently across the board .
Text size in pixels – iteration 1#section4
The default text size of the base case is a good starting point , but for most people ( designers , clients , and their customers ) 16 px is too large for body text .
In our example , the body text was reduced to 14px , with the sidebar set at 12 px .
This first iteration does just that , setting the fonts in pixels :
. bodytext p { font - size : 14 px ; }.sidenote { font - size : 12 px ; }
The result is that Safari and Firefox still resize the text , whereas IE6 and IE7 do not .
The text can be resized in Opera and IE7 by using the page zoom tool , which magnifies the page layout , text and images within .
Text size in ems – iteration 2#section5
Although browser market share differs from site to site , and browser share statistics are drawn in sand , it ’s safe to say that IE6 is still used by many people .
So setting text in pixels would leave many people no means of resizing it .
There ’s also an argument that says IE7 users should be able to resize text without being forced to use the zoom control .
The next unit to try for text sizing is ems .
The em is a true typographic unit , recommended by the W3C , and affords a precision keywords lack .
Working from a default of 16px , the following styles should give the desired text sizes :
. bodytext p { font - size : 0.875em ; /* 16x.875=14 */ }.sidenote { font - size : 0.75em ; /* 16x0.75=12 */ }
The results show that , across all browsers , text at the medium browser setting is rendered identically to text set in pixels .
It also demonstrates that text sized in ems can be resized across all browsers .
However IE6 and IE7 unacceptably exaggerate the smallness and largeness of the resized text .
Body sized as percentage – iteration 3#section6
A fix to the exaggerated text resizing of IE6 and IE7 is to size the body using a percentage .
So retaining the ems on our content , the following styles were tested :
body { font - size : 100 % ; }.bodytext p { font - size : 0.875em ; }.sidenote { font - size : 0.75em ; }
The results show that the difference between larger and smaller browser settings in IE6 and IE7 is now less pronounced , meaning we now have all browsers rendering text at an identical size on their medium setting , and resizing text consistently .
Setting line height in pixels – iteration 4#section7
Recent web typography articles such as “ Setting Type on the Web to a Baseline Grid ” ( A List Apart , April 2007 ) stress that good typography requires a vertical grid , that is to say a solid vertical rhythm achieved with a consistent , measured line - height .
The key implication is that line - height should be the same regardless of the size of the text ( so that line - height , or the vertical grid , remains consistent , regardless of font size ) .
For our example , a suitable line - height is 18 px , so that is added to the body as follows :
body { font - size : 100 % ; line - height : 18 px ; }.bodytext p { font - size : 0.875em ; }.sidenote { font - size : 0.75em ; }
The results show that the 18px line - height is inherited by all text on the page — note how the sidebar text has the same regular rhythm as the body copy .
Specifying a unit ( in this case , px ) when setting the line - height enables the value to be inherited throughout the page .
If a unitless line - height had been specified , the multiplier would have been inherited , resulting in line - heights being rendered proportionally to the text size , thus breaking the vertical rhythm .
Unfortunately the results show that the 18px line - height is not scaled by IE6 and IE7 when text is resized , meaning the largest setting appears to squash the text .
Setting line height in ems – iteration 5#section8
When pixels failed before , we turned to ems .
Repeating the logic gives us the following styles :
body { font - size : 100 % ; line - height : 1.125em ; /* 16×1.125=18 */ }.bodytext p { font - size : 0.875em ; }.sidenote { font - size : 0.75em ; }
The results show accurate , consistently resized text and line - height across all browsers .
Perfect .
Or nearly so .
The Safari monospace problem – iteration 6#section9
The observant among you may have noticed a wee glitch in the Safari screenshots : the monospaced font included in the body text is rendered inconsistently .
For text set in pixels , Safari renders the monospaced font at the same size as the proportional - width text surrounding it .
When text is set in ems , however , Safari renders monospace text much smaller than the surrounding text .
The inconsistency appears to stem from Safari ’s default text sizes , which are 16px for “ standard fonts ” and 13px for “ fixed - width fonts . ”
Safari 3α on OS
X does not appear to suffer from this problem .
You could decide that undersized monospace text in Safari is something you and your readers can live with , and as Safari 3 is included in OS X Leopard and the latest update to Tiger , it will not be long until the problem pretty much disappears .
For the nervous control freak who can’t wait , an alternative fix is to send text sized in pixels to Safari .
The following code appends a downlevel - revealed conditional comment to our styles , so that pixels are sent to all browsers except IE6 and IE7 ( note the [ if ! IE ] syntax , instructing IE / Win to ignore the markup that follows ) .
< style type =" text /css " > body { font - size : 100 % ; line - height : 1.125em ; }.bodytext p { font - size : 0.875em ; }.sidenote { font - size : 0.75em ; } </style ><!--[ if !IE ] >-->< style type =" text /css " > body { font - size : 16 px ; } </style ><!--<[ endif ]-->
The results show consistently resized text and line - height across all browsers , including the monospaced text in Safari 2 .
Conditional comments are controversial , with many detractors and proponents , but I believe the approach is appropriate in this case , as we are using a browser feature ( conditional comments ) to work around a browser behaviour ( non-resizing of pixels ) .
It should also be noted that , for the sake of clarity , the code listed above presents CSS rules within style elements ; best practice would dictate the use of linked style sheets instead .
Our task was to find a way to size text that allows designers to retain accurate control of typography , without sacrificing the user ’s ability to adjust his or her reading environment .
We tested various units across common browsers .
Sizing text and line - height in ems , with a percentage specified on the body ( and an optional caveat for Safari 2 ) , was shown to provide accurate , resizable text across all browsers in common use today .
This is a technique you can put in your kit bag and use as a best practice for sizing text in CSS that satisfies both designers and readers .
Ems can be tricky to work with , especially when nesting elements deeply , as it can be hard to keep track of the maths .

" The Government is increasing aid to the Palestinians by an additional SEK 90 million .
Sweden is currently one of the single largest donors to the Palestinian people and our ambition is to continue as such in the future as well .
The increase means that Sweden 's total aid will amount to some SEK 670 million in 2007 and close to SEK 700 million in 2008 .
" In order to achieve success , the peace negotiations that resumed in Annapolis on 27 November must be combined with extensive measures to strengthen the Palestinian National Authority .
Today 's discussions in Paris are an important step in this process . "
This statement was made by Minister for Foreign Affairs Carl Bildt on Monday when a large number of countries gathered in Paris to provide concrete and firm support to the work on constructing a Palestinian state .
New Palestinian reform and development plan
At today 's donor conference in Paris , Prime Minister Salam Fayyad will present a Palestinian reform and development plan for 2008 - 2010 .
Its focus will be on such matters as the rule of law , more transparent exercise of public authority and improving the efficiency of public sector services .
The international community plays a central role in strengthening the Palestinian institutions , but the main responsibility for this naturally rests with the parties .
Reform of the Palestinian National Authority 's administration , as well as continued efforts to tackle corruption , are necessary .
A series of reports - the most recent by the World Bank - have documented the increasingly serious economic and social situation in the West Bank .
And in his address in Annapolis , UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon strongly warned about the consequences of the isolation of Gaza , which is unacceptable in humanitarian terms .

The meticulous disguise was almost perfect – hair , makeup , outfit .
But cross -dressing bank robber Aston Barth did n’t fool anyone – after he forgot to hide his mustache in a Citibank stickup in Central Islip on Aug. 23 .
Wearing a brown skirt suit , blond wig , open - toe sandals and makeup , Barth , 28 , passed a note demanding cash and left with a pocketbook full of several thousand dollars , cops said .
“ He was accessorized , ” said Suffolk Detective Sgt. Robert Doyle .
“ He really threw himself into the part . ”
A tipster called cops with Barth ’s real name and gender and he was spotted Tuesday on a Central Islip street by two uniformed officers , who put him in cuffs and charged him with robbery .
Doyle said Barth dressed up in his mother ’s clothing and makeup simply “ to disguise his identity . ”
He said Barth had a prior conviction for an armed robbery , for which he was sentenced to three years behind bars in 2001 .
Yesterday , he was ordered held in lieu of $ 1 million bail .

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia ’s parliament voted unanimously on Wednesday to suspend a key arms treaty limiting conventional forces in Europe , saying the United States and NATO were using the pact to undermine Russia ’s defenses .

Ignoring appeals from the United States , the Duma ( lower house of parliament ) approved 418 - 0 a law allowing Moscow to stop complying with the Conventional Forces in Europe ( CFE ) Treaty , seen by the West as a cornerstone of European security .
The suspension , ordered by President Vladimir Putin as part of a wave of increasingly aggressive moves against the West ahead of elections , will take effect on December 12 .
Russia ’s top general Yuri Baluyevsky said the CFE treaty , which limits the number of heavy conventional weapons deployed and stored between the Atlantic and Russia ’s Ural mountains , unfairly penalized Moscow .
“ The current treaty fully suits the United States and NATO , ” Baluyevsky , the chief of general staff , told parliament .
“ The treaty allows , practically without any limits , the realization of the strategy for NATO to move eastwards , carrying out the reconfiguration of the U.S. ’s military presence in Europe and for constant monitoring of the composition and state of Russia ’s military in the European zone . ”
Russia had no plans to immediately deploy more forces in the West and in the Caucasus , he added , though it reserved the right to do so .
Russia ’s move comes after months of sparring with the United States and European Union over plans for a missile defense shield and proposed independence for Serbia ’s Kosovo province .
Putin , who has sought to restore the Kremlin ’s international clout after the chaos which accompanied the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union , gave formal 150 - day notice in July about suspending the treaty .
The United States , Europe and NATO have all urged Russia not to scrap the treaty , saying it is a vital guarantor of stability in post Cold War Europe .
But Moscow has been adamant it will suspend the pact unless NATO agrees to major changes .
NATO did not offer immediate comment on the Duma vote but one official said the alliance ’s position remained unchanged .
“ We do not want to see any suspension on the treaty and there are intensive consultations continuing among the parties , ” said the official , who requested anonymity .
MOSCOW “ NOT HEARD ”
Russian diplomats said Moscow was trying to send a message to the West that the treaty needed to be reworked and ratified but that the West had “ not heard ” Moscow ’s concerns .
“ Russia ’s actions do not have an aggressive or destructive character -- they are directed not to destroy the system of current agreements but to attract attention of our partners to our concerns , ” said Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Kislyak .
“ We are not trying to bring any damage to arms control but to give an impulse to the resumption of a workable treaty , ” Kislyak , who deals with U.S. relations , told parliament .
The debate in parliament was full of references to how Russia had been “ deceived ” by the United States and NATO .
The law approved on Wednesday -- just three clauses long -- gives Putin a free hand to suspend Russia ’s participation in the treaty or to restore it at any time in the future .
The draft still needs final approval from the upper house of parliament and from Putin before becoming law but these steps are regarded as formalities .
The CFE treaty , signed in 1990 and updated in 1999 , limits the number of tanks , combat aircraft and heavy artillery which can be deployed or stored in the vast area stretching from the Atlantic to Russia ’s Ural mountains .
Western partners have refused to ratify an amended version of the pact until Russia pulls its forces out of Georgia and Moldova , as it promised in 1999 when the treaty was reviewed .
Russian forces are being withdrawn from Georgia .
But Russia has so far been reluctant to pull out peacekeepers from Moldova ’s breakaway province of Transdniestria .
Russia , unhappy about NATO ’s expansion eastwards into territory formerly occupied by the Soviet - led Warsaw Pact , says U.S. plans to open bases for several thousand soldiers in Romania and Bulgaria this year are in breach of the CFE .
NATO officials insist that the bases are not intended as permanent and thus can not be seen as a breach .

nXML mode
nXML mode is an addon for GNU Emacs , which makes GNU Emacs into a powerful XML editor .
It 's called nXML mode because in Emacs terminology addons that customize Emacs for editing text of a particular sort are called modes .
Emacs already has a simple mode for XML ; nXML mode is a new mode for XML .
You should realize that Emacs with nXML mode differs from most XML editors in that XML is edited as text .
What you see while you are editing is similar to what you would see if you were using a non-XML aware text editor .
nXML mode does not attempt to conceal the XML tags .
The big advantage is that you do not lose any functionality in moving from a text editor to nXML mode .
All normal text editing commands can be used with nXML mode without restriction .
nXML mode does not require that the XML document always be valid or even well - formed .
nXML mode allows a schema to be associated with the XML document being edited .
The schema is used to provide two key features :
Continuous validation .
nXML validates as you type , highlighting any invalid parts of your document .
Completion .
nXML can assist you in entering an element name , attribute name or data value by using information about what is allowed by the schema in that context .
nXML mode uses Relax NG as its schema language .
Relax NG has two alternative syntaxes : an XML syntax and a more readable , non-XML compact syntax .
nXML mode supports the compact syntax .
There are tools available to translate from DTDs and other schema languages into Relax NG compact syntax .
Schemas for DocBook , XHTML , XSLT , RDF and RELAX NG are included in the nXML mode download .
nXML mode can also be used without any schema .
Features that work without any schema include support for inserting end - tags easily .
nXML mode is implemented entirely in Emacs Lisp ( Emacs ' builtin extension language ) .
This allows nXML mode to work on any platform that Emacs supports , without any modifications to Emacs .
It consists of approximately 17,000 lines of Emacs Lisp .
Requirements
GNU Emacs version 21.x is required , preferably 21.3 .
Emacs 20 will not work , nor will XEmacs .
Download
nXML mode can be downloaded from http://www.thaiopensource.com/download/.
Look for a file with a name of the form nxml- mode - YYYYMMDD .tar.gz .
After downloading , extract the files from the .tar.gz archive and read the README file for how to get started .

DOUGLASVILLE , Georgia ( CNN ) -- Civil rights leader Al Sharpton blasted Georgia 's attorney general Thursday for challenging the release of a man serving 10 years in prison for a teenage sexual encounter , saying , " People did not suffer for your career . "
Sharpton did not mention Attorney General Thurbert Baker by name , but called on " those that are in office because of us " to take action to get 21 - year - old Genarlow Wilson freed .
" Do n't walk over the bodies of martyrs and achieve a position of personal stature , and then forget how you got there and sit there in silence while your children are locked in jail for unjust sentences , " said Sharpton , a radio talk - show host and former Democratic presidential candidate .
" There 's something ungrateful about those who would benefit off the blood of martyrs and not stand up for those that put you there in the first place . "
Baker , one of two African - American officials elected statewide in Georgia , said in response , " I have the utmost respect and appreciation for the sacrifices made by Dr. King and the other leaders of the civil rights movement who changed America for the better .
" Those leaders also believed in a system governed by laws , because the alternative is a lawless society .
I am doing no less than following the law that I have sworn to uphold . "
Sharpton , the Rev. Joseph Lowery and other civil rights leaders led a rally Thursday to the Douglas County Courthouse to protest the handling of the Wilson case .
Wilson , now 21 , was convicted of aggravated child molestation for having consensual oral sex with a 15 - year - old girl when he was 17 .
Under the state law in effect at the time , Wilson received a mandatory 10 - year sentence , of which he has already served more than two years .
Watch Thursday 's rally for Wilson »
Partly as a result of Wilson 's conviction , state legislators changed the law to make such consensual conduct between teenagers a misdemeanor , rather than a felony .
But that change was n't made retroactive , so it did not help Wilson .
Do n't miss
No bail for Genarlow Wilson
A state judge ruled in June that Wilson 's punishment was cruel and unusual and voided it on constitutional grounds , reducing the term to one year and ordering Wilson to be kept off Georgia 's sex offender registry , as the old law required .
But Baker announced he would appeal the decision , arguing that the judge did not have the authority " to reduce or modify the judgment of the trial court . "
The move has kept Wilson behind bars while his lawyers seek the approval of the state Supreme Court to allow his release on bond .
Sharpton called Wilson 's sentence " wicked , punitive , immoral and illegal , and he threw in a jab at President Bush 's decision to spare former White House aide I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby from prison by commuting Libby 's 30 - month sentence for perjury , obstruction of justice and lying to investigators probing the leak of a CIA operative 's identity .
" If this young man 's name was Scooter Wilson , he would n't be in jail , " Sharpton told supporters at a " rally for justice " at the Douglas County courthouse , west of Atlanta .
" If he had a different complexion , and a different connection , we'd be having a welcome - home party .
But since he did n't have anybody in the Oval Office to deal with excessive sentencing for him , he got hundreds in the streets that will speak on his behalf . "

WHEN it comes to being awarded patents , the Japanese are world champions .
Japan has more than 1,200 patents per million people — more than twice as many as Switzerland , the next most prolific country ( with 500 patents per million ) , and more than three times as many as third - ranking America ( with 350 patents per million ) .
Does that make Japan the most innovative country in the world ?
Difficult to say .
But something rather exceptional is at work in Japan that encourages its scientists , engineers , workers and even housewives to seek fame and fortune by patenting their brainwaves .
There 's a problem , of course , with using patents as an index of national performance .
Patents are awarded for something that is novel , useful and non-obvious .
As such , they measure success in discovering or inventing new things .
They do not measure innovation , nor the economic activity that ensues .
In the grand scheme of things , inventions are the easy part .
Turning inventions or discoveries into innovations — ie , products and processes that enrich our lives or improve our well - being — is a vastly more demanding business .
Inventions and discoveries are made in the lab or on the kitchen table by a handful of individuals .
By contrast , innovations absorb the energies and fortunes of large corporate teams and can take years to bring to fruition .
An invention that cost $ 1,000 to conceive can easily cost $ 10 m to turn into a successful innovation .
Even so , with nothing better at hand , patents are often used as a proxy for innovation .
And Japan 's high patenting performance says much about the country 's instincts for innovation .
However , Japanese patents tell a mixed story .
As noted in our “ At a glance ” feature on inventiveness , published on Economist.com on July 30th ( see article ) , there 's a lot of multiple - counting in Japanese patent figures .
The reasons are as much cultural as historical .
Although Japan is not a particularly litigious society , Japanese courts are more preoccupied with the letter than the spirit of the law , and can be extraordinarily pernickety when cases do go to trial .
Until recently , when Japan 's patent standards began to converge with American and European ones , that forced Japanese patent examiners to adopt a far more atomistic view of what constitutes a patentable invention .
Thus , were a bicycle to be patented in Japan , it could not be defined simply as a human - powered , two - wheeled vehicle , but would have to be considered as a family of patents covering the frame , wheels , crank , pedals , handlebars and saddle .
AFP
Dreaming up the next big thing
But even after discounting for the Japan Patent Office 's multiple - counting , Japan still patents way over its weight .
What was not mentioned in “ At a glance ” was that the Economist Intelligence Unit ( EIU ) white paper it was based on ( which , in the interest of full disclosure , your columnist had a hand in writing ) handicapped Japan by discarding one - third of its patents from the start .
And still it came out top .
Also left unsaid — and most intriguing of all — was that Japan achieves its stellar performance with rather mediocre inputs .
The EIU study created four indices for each of the 82 countries examined .
Apart from the innovation index based on patents granted , two further indices ranked each country 's direct drivers of innovation ( national research effort , education standards , technical skills , broadband penetration , etc ) as well as those indirect environmental factors considered conducive for innovation ( such as rule of law , tax regime , economic stability , labour flexibility and patent protection ) .
Finally , an aggregate enabling index was created from a 70/30 weighting of the direct and indirect drivers .
Despite having one of the best - educated workforces in the world , superb IT infrastructure , a well - oiled administration , good rule of law and protection of intellectual property , Japan ranks a lowly 14th in terms of its enablers for innovation .
So , why does the country perform so well on the output side of the innovation equation , despite having such feeble drivers on the input side ?
No one really knows .
You can make educated guesses .
The concentration of talent in manufacturing .
The pursuit of excellence .
The ferocious rivalry between Japan 's large electronics firms .
The lingering relic of the country 's post - war catch - up mentality .
Fears of economic isolation given the expansion of the European Union and the emergence of the North American Free - Trade Area .
Anxiety about a rapidly ageing society facing a formidable pensions and health - care crisis .
All this may or may not play a part .
But beyond the more obvious economic imperatives lie certain social factors that appear to be at work as well .
In the early 1980s the Hakuhodo Institute of Life and Living ( HILL ) in Tokyo sought to capture the spirit of the times by looking at Japanese society through a prism of hitonami — a national tendency of wanting to be like others .
HILL argued that the old feudal habit of watching neighbours closely to see what behaviour the local war lord condoned or forbade had served modern society well .
In particular , it helped explain why Japanese consumers had traditionally been quick to embrace new products .
In certain ways , the customers were being even more innovative than the suppliers .
Back in Japan for his biannual pilgrimage , your columnist is beginning to feel that this tendency may explain much of the country 's natural talent for innovation .
Certainly , coming up with bright ideas for future products involves a lot of informal and subjective “ tacit ” knowledge as well as documented “ explicit ” know - how .
The accumulation and sharing of this tacit understanding ( which is largely impossible to record ) is what makes Japan tick .
You only have to go into a Japanese pub in the evening to hear animated businessmen carrying on their after - hours office discussions .
Perhaps it is the birru , jizake and shochu that are the real tonics for innovation .
AUSTRALIAN primary school students spend more time in school assemblies and religious education than they do studying science , a national study shows .
The Federal Government - commissioned study of 160 public and private primary schools found that teachers spent more than half ( 56 per cent ) of their time teaching English and maths .
They spent 4 per cent on school assemblies and 4 per cent on religious education , but 3 per cent on teaching science .
Physical education received 11 per cent of teaching time .

" There is unexpected beauty hidden everywhere in this world — one just has to be open to seeing it .
Remember that the next time you sneeze on your monitor . " — Nathan Walton .
Dead LCD screen pixels
So you just bought a superb ultra - flat 25 ¾ " LCD monitor , but it looks like there are a few ' spots ' on it .
Depending on how many and it'll mean return to the vendor or live with it .
Or you could be about to buy one in a store and want to make sure there are n't any dead pixels .
Just come to this page !
Testing for dead pixels is very simple , there 's nothing to install .
All you need to do is click on all the links below to load the various test pages and look carefully at the images for any sign of dead ( black ) pixel , lit ( white ) pixel or also colored pixel ( here yellow and blue , even if it 's difficult to tell the colors ) .
The links below will open a JavaScript window full screen .
If your browser cannot do JavaScript or wo n't scale full screen either , you still have the option , once you are on one of the pages below , to right click it , do [ Set as wallpaper ] and hide all your windows ( Press [ Win ] [ D ] ) .
If you still do n't see the dot pattern covering the full screen , you need to ' tile ' the wallpaper with the following method in Windows : right - click on the Desktop , chose [ Properties ] and then chose [ Tile ] as the [ Picture Display option ] .
Once you have tested all the images , go put some better looking wallpaper .
Now do n't confuse a dead pixel with a fleck of dirt on the screen or a piece of dried snot .
Wipe gently your screen with a dry clean rag before using the test procedure .
How can you tell the difference ?
Easy : move your head to the side of the screen : if the error moves to the next pixel , it 's dried snot !
If you notice dead pixels , sometimes you can massage them back to life : just rub the screen by pressing a finger gently through a rag around the pixel .
No guaranty but sometimes it works ; LCD monitors are fairly fragile and easily scratched , so take it easy .
So even if you are lucky enough to not have any dead pixels on your monitor , you can still come back to this page when you are cleaning it in order to check that all the specks are gone .
Some people pretend that you can also bring a pixel back to life by alternating its color very fast .
I 'm not convinced but you can always try to leave the ' cycle them ' window open overnight ...
It may do the job if it does n't kill your video card first or if your monitor does n't go in sleep mode from sheer boredom .
Normal Without JavaScript Large static image Click below .
If the window that opens is n't full screen , press [ F11 ] .
When you are done looking closely , press [ Ctrl ] [ F4 ] or [ Alt ] [ F4 ] to close the window and proceed with the next one .
Click below , then press [ F11 ] to view full screen followed by the [ Backspace ] key to come back to this page before you try the next one .
If the two versions on the left fail , try the large images below and try and display them at 100 % ( no reduction , page fit or anything ) .
This might work better on mobile devices which automatically change the size of whatever is displayed to fit the screen .
Since the images are 2560x2560 you should see scroll bars ( which you do n't need to use ) .
Low memory devices may choke on them ...

Some advice about getting the best out of your screen :
Use it at its highest color mode ( 32 bits ) to avoid dithering ( display options of the control panel ) .
24 bits is okay , but avoid 16 bits modes .
( 32 bits ) to avoid dithering ( display options of the control panel ) .
24 bits is okay , but avoid 16 bits modes .
Use it at its highest frequency to lower flickering ( advanced display options of the control panel ) , although the frequency is a lot less important for LCD than for normal monitors .
Note that pivot monitors sometimes have lower frequencies in vertical position than horizontal and the driver will refuse to rotate the image if the horizontal frequency is set too high .

Unlike classic monitors , LCD screens have only one optimal resolution : the highest .
If your screen is given for 1200x1024 , do n't try to use it at 1024x768 even if characters get too small to read , instead change the default system font size in the advanced display options of the control panel ; you 'll get better quality and readability this way .

If both your video card and your monitor have classic analog ( VGA ) and digital ( DVI ) outputs , always use the digital cable .
The images above can also be used to test the bleeding of the pixels onto one another .
If you look closely you should see a fine tiny mesh .
Otherwise if you see a grey mess or very flickery lines , then it's a sign of lack of quality from the screen or the video card .
There can also be a lot of quality difference from one video card to the next , even on identical models .

Dead digital camera pixels
LCD , plasma or OLED screens are not the only high - tech equipment to exhibit wrong pixels .
A similar thing happens to digital cameras .
A pixel of the CCD sensor that does n't react to light is always black ( dead pixel ) , while one with a short circuit always shows white ( hot or stuck pixel ) , with the possibility that one of the 3 base colors only is dead or hot .
Most recent cameras have special circuits that detect and remove such pixels from the final image , often as part of the noise reduction function applied during the creation of the image file .
Note that a dead pixel may look very similar to a speck of dust on the sensor although a dead or hot pixel will stay in the exact same position between pictures while a speck of dust may move somewhat .
A speck of dust will also often cover more than just one pixel .
How can you find if your digital camera has dead or hot pixels ?
Well , it depends on the camera , but here is a general procedure for hot or stuck pixels :
Set the camera to save images as RAW .
If your camera does n't create RAW , then you are mostly out of luck .
Put the tap on the lens and if you have a reflex , block the viewfinder ( as some parasite light may go through ) .
Set the mode to [ M ] anual , with the aperture as closed as possible : f9 , f22 , f32 , as high as your lens can go .
Take one image with a short exposure time ( 1/8000s or as fast as your shutter goes ) and another one around 1 second ( stuck pixels stay the same no matter the exposure time while hot pixels become more visible when the exposure time increases due to increased leakage ) .
Many camera have a process called ' black subtract ' or ' dark removal ' when taking images above a certain exposure time ( usually 1 to 15 seconds ) .
Make sure this mode does n't kick in or it will remove the defective pixels .
' or ' ' when taking images above a certain exposure time ( usually 1 to 15 seconds ) .
Make sure this mode does n't kick in or it will remove the defective pixels .
Now transfer the RAW file to the PC and load it up in your RAW editor of choice .
The image should look perfectly dark .
If not then there is parasite light going though .
Use the default setting for most options , but make sure to NOT use the noise reduction and neither the sharpness .
Look around the options and make sure there 's no dead / hot pixel removal option in the software ( some will automatically detect them on the first images you submit and then remove them on all subsequent images ) .
and neither the .
Look around the options and make sure there 's no dead / hot pixel removal option in the software ( some will automatically detect them on the first images you submit and then remove them on all subsequent images ) .
Now export the RAW files as TIF ( or PNG but not not JPG ) and transfer them to an image editing program such as Photoshop or Paint Shop Pro .
In PSP you can use [ Effects ] [ Edge Effects ] [ Find all Edges ] , but functions such as [ Image ] [ Negative ] + [ Effects ] [ Edge Effects ] [ Enhance Edges ] will produce a similar result .
Now look closely at the resulting white picture at 100 % zoom ( or more ) , panning around the whole image : there will be a few black specks such as shown on the right .
Those are hot pixels ( the image is shown in negative for readability ) .
If you see a LOT of them with all kinds of colors , then they are most likely not hot pixels but electronic noise in the sensor .
Try again making sure no light arrives at the sensor and shorten the exposure time .
Some cameras like the Ricoh GRd or special astronomy cameras have a special noise reduction function called ' dark removal ' which handles this kind of issue ( but also gets rid of the dead / hot pixels in the process ) .
BTW , when you perform this procedure , make sure your monitor is clean as you do n't want to stack dust on the screen with dead screen pixels with dead camera pixels with sensor dust with dandruff on your glasses ... C ;-)
The opposite procedure of taking an all - white image to see dead sensor pixels does n't work as well because of light diffusion and bleeding between the pixels .
A light grey defocused image would work better .
Right :
Four dead pixels off a real digital camera CCD , the image is shown at 100 % zoom , but because of the Edge effect , they show up bigger .
I 've grouped them to make them more visible ; they all have similar shapes probably due to the demosaicing alogithm used .

Let 's Meet a Romanian eBay Scammer Hello , Ghiuri Simionescu ...
The past few years have seen an increase in eBay and phishing scams out of Romania .
Our resident scambusters have privately been tracking one operation in particular -- a group of young Romanians that have been scamming people around the world for thousands of dollars over the past year .
The scammers hack machines for use as eBay phishing hosts , then use the acquired Paypal accounts and passwords to buy expensive items on eBay .
The phishing efforts also net them plenty of eBay accounts , which are then used to hold bogus online auctions .
" Florin , " who helps coordinate drops and pickups .
By tracking a number of these scams over the past year , our users were able to identify a major young Romanian phisher and scammer named Ghiuri Simionescu .
That 's him at the right , chilling out with his dad after a hard day ripping people off .
Our resident scambusters also managed to identify a Romanian friend of his living in Spain namedwho helps coordinate drops and pickups .
Ghiuri ( above , left ) is a charmer .
This is an e-mail he sent to a victim after they realized a deal to buy Nokia phones was a scam : quote :

Have a good day and see you in HELL .
The eloquent Mr. Simionescu has since shifted his attention toward selling nonexistent
The eloquent Mr. Simionescu has since shifted his attention toward selling nonexistent Nintendo Wiis Users were able to identify a number of his accounts , compromise many of the e-mail addresses being used , and even nab pictures of his family ( who sometimes participate in the scams ) .
They have also been using the data to warn potential victims , keeping at least some money out of Ghiuri 's pockets .
One Russian victim lost $ 2,000 when trying to buy mobile phones .
The victim became rather distressed -- going so far as to hint at suicide after losing his life 's savings in the deal gone bad :
The story then takes an entertaining turn .
" Florin you ripped off the Russian mafia you *******.
- Our phish chaser Our chief resident scambuster decided to lend the Russian victim a hand in what he calls a " longshot . "
He called the scammers and pretended to be the victim 's uncle and a member of the Russian mafia .
After rattling off complete details of Florin and Ghiuri 's operation , he says they 're being watched , and that they have eight hours to give the kid a full refund .
His description of " the chat " : quote :
So it goes something like this .
I said .
" Florin hey Florin " ... silence ....
" Hey Florin this is Ghiuri 's friend " .... he says " who are you I do n't know you " I said " listen very carefully Florin or you will know me real soon " .
" Florin you ripped of the Russian mafia you ******* "
He says " I do n't know what you are talking about , you must have the wrong number " I start to yell .
" Florin you ripped off my stupid nephew " he says " who are you talking about " I said " you know who , the Russian kid , you took his $ 2,000 " .
" now pay attention Florin , and make sure you tell this to Ghiuri too , do n't send him his cut " " I know where you are right now ******, I have people that are less than 30 minutes away from you " .
" I know which Western Union you picked up the money from " " I know every move you are making " I then told him the mobile service carrier he was using ( I looked it up first ) .
" I said now listen carefully Florin , you have 8 ***** hours to send my nephed his money back , 8 hours "
If not I will ship you ass back to Romania in a box , with one phone stuffed down your throat and another up your ass , do you hear me " " Russian mafia are everywhere Florin , " and I swear if that money is not on the way back in 8 hours , you will go back to Romoland in a box , I will even write your obituary on the outside " .
He goes yes !!
I said you call Ghiuri right now and tell him also , I have people in Bucheresti and Constanta .
If that money aint back to that kid , tell Ghiuri that they will be taking him , Ana Serban , and the rest of the Simonescu family on a one way trip to the mountains in the boot of that ***** taxi .
I said " we scam more **** people before breakfast than you a Ghiuri do in six months " " Now Florin , you call Ghiuri right now and get this kid his money back "
He goes " I will take care of it " I said " if you never want to hear form me again you better , oh and dont ever **** with the Russian Mob again ...... oh and Florian tell Ghiuri to call the kid and tell him ...... Hurry ...... Comprende Amigo .. Capiche ?...
He goes " Yes Yes Goodbye "
The pair of Romanian scammers quickly refunded the money , the victim is beyond grateful .

Like many a performer , Internet junkie or just an idiot with too much spare time , I was lured into creating a MySpace account .
You know , that " networking "  site where you can potentially link to millions , all of whom are your " friends . " 
I 'd heard it was a great way to publicize oneself without actually having anything to publicize but your ass cheeks .
Dane Cook shrewdly capitalized on this new phenomenon and was the first comedian to develop an audience based on his computer skills .
Before I knew it , after becoming " friends "  with an assortment of people I actually knew , I was getting requests from total strangers to be my " friend . " 
I could see their profile , pictures , and other friends , and could then approve or deny their friend request if I liked their face .
Sort of like a postmodern country club , where the membership applicants provide homemade porn .
At first , it was fascinating to see who was connected to whom , as well peruse their pictures and watch their videos .
I confess to one late night four hour marathon of mind - numbing , addictive MySpace hell .
I am flabbergasted at just how much personal information people are willing to post for the entire world to see .
Vacation pictures , family photos , and previously secret X - rated fantasies are no longer for the album hidden under the bed .
The first warning signal was when Rupert Murdoch bought MySpace in yet another attempt at world domination .
Big Brother is not just watching , we 're providing him the stuff to watch .
I trust Rupert Murdoch about as much as I trust herpes .
I became instantly uneasy about one of the world 's largest media empires knowing who my " friends "  are , or having access to pictures of me on the beach or dressed in drag at a Halloween party .
Remember the scenes in classic thrillers where someone would get an anonymous letter or phone call saying , " We know who you are and we know who your friends are "  ?
Now they DO , and can find out in the brief moment you 're away from your computer on the toilet , which is probably the only private " My Space "  left .
The second warning signal was receiving all these annoying MySpace emails like " Wonder Rectum wants to be your friend ! " 
And it was more than a little scary when I was performing in Las Vegas and three drunken biker chicks , who looked like they came to see me because Criss Angel " Mindfreak "  was sold out , showed up after a show and screamed , " JIM !!!
WE'RE YOU'RE MYSPACE FRIENDS !!!
HEY , BUDDY !!! " 
I wanted to say , " Buddy ?
I do n't believe I 've had the pleasure , madam . " 
After I declined their invitation to hop on one of their cycles , drink Wild Turkey and go " tear up this motherfucking town , "  they refused to leave and had to be yanked out by the security guards , who were anxious to kick some butt and grateful for the exercise .
I actually felt a twinge of guilt about treating my " friends "  this way , which made it clear that the world has gone completely mental and I had just crossed over into the Twilight Zone .
Another warning occurred when assorted strangers who had taken a photo with me at an event suddenly posted them the site , forwarding them to God knows how many people .
I 'm not the world 's most photogenic creature , so imagine my horror viewing pictures of me looking like Don Knotts after a gang rape .
I thought , wait a minute , idiot , this was just for your personal keepsake , not some pedophile hiding out in Thailand .
I henceforth vow to become a control freak regulating every picture of me available to the world .
Just like Barbra Streisand 's , the right side of my face will be as visible as the dark side of the moon .
The Internet is convenient , dangerous , and now a part of our lives whether we like it or not , like cell phones or staph infections .
It 's very disconcerting that my personal information , previously available only to , well , me , is now potentially in the hands of everyone on the planet with hacking skills .
It 's TOO MUCH INFORMATION IN THE HANDS OF TOO MANY PEOPLE .
Yes , it 's wonderful to be having an argument with someone and then just be able to Google it and say , " See , you 're wrong , Mitt Romney did flip - flop . " 
But there 's something really sick about being able to have instant access to a naked picture of some bozo in Waukegan , Illinois .
The straw that broke the MySpace back came when some maniac hacked into my profile and started sending out mass emails , as me , inviting people to some porn hook - up site .
Aside from the embarrassment , I would have hoped that my real " friends ' would realize that if I was inviting them to a porn site , the people would be a hell of a lot better looking .
After contacting MySpace and receiving instructions about as useful as " Larry Craig 's Gay Guide To Airports , " I deleted my entire profile , a process only slightly less difficult than changing my entire identity .
I have now left this fifth circle of Internet hell .
If you are a MySpace member , pause for a moment and consider that you are friends with someone who is friends with someone who is friends with someone who wants to be the next Charles Manson .
They can find you .
The world may not have been as convenient and connected a few years ago , but we all had a little thing called " privacy , "  and in order to be famous , one had to have a little thing called " talent . " 
From now on , if you want to know who my " friends "  are , you will just have to be invited to my Christmas party .
Good luck with that .

WASHINGTON  A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a hearing into whether the Central Intelligence Agency ’s destruction of interrogation videotapes in 2005 violated his order that summer to preserve evidence in a lawsuit brought on behalf of 16 prisoners held at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba .
The hearing , set for Friday in Washington by District Judge Henry H. Kennedy Jr. , will be the first public forum in which government officials submit to questioning about the tapes ’ destruction in November 2005 .
The Justice Department has asked Congress to postpone inquiries into the matter and had opposed a court hearing , saying any such actions would interfere with a preliminary investigation by the department and the Central Intelligence Agency into whether the destruction of the tapes violated the law .
“ We hope to establish a procedure to review the government ’s handling of evidence in our case , ” said David H. Remes , a lawyer representing the 16 Guantánamo prisoners challenging their detention .
“ We ’re grateful to Judge Kennedy for giving us that opportunity . ”
There is no publicly known connection between the 16 plaintiffs , who include 14 Yemenis , one Algerian and one Pakistani , and the C.I.A. videotapes .
Officials have said those tapes , recorded during harsh interrogations in 2002 and destroyed in 2005 , showed two suspected Al Qaeda operatives , Abu Zubaydah and Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri .
Having determined that the tyranny and woe that drove emigrants to Ellis Island is too much for their tourist descendants to handle , the National Park Service said 15 graphic photos of the Ottoman government 's 1915 campaign against Armenians are " too gruesome " to show at the island museum .
Armenian Americans are crying censorship at the removal of the pictures that document one of the century 's bloodiest genocides .
Moving from IE to Firefox
* Update : This is a old post that i wrote when Firefox 3 was still in early days of development and before the performance improvements were done .*
I switched from IE to Firefox 1.5 because of its amazing features like tabs , better session saver , add - ons and most of all its developer friendly tools like FireBug which to me came as a breather for web - development .
And needless to say i never missed IE .
But then , as i became addicted to the tabbed browsing , like many others even i cultivated a bad habit of opening the links that i would like to read and come back later when i had time .
so usually i had i atleast 15 - 20 tabs in each window and atleast 2 - 3 windows open .
see it was just convenience …!!
Memory leaks in Firefox and moving onto Opera
But because of my bad habit of having so many tabs open , the memory hogging in Firefox was * ahem * unbearable …and lo…to add to that it also started crashing … and at times i
would restart the Firefox manually when the memory usage was very high and i was hoping that this would be fixed in the future versions , but nothing much happened on those lines and i was looking for some alternative , and then i tried Opera ( without the ads 😉 and it had all the features that i wanted except for the FireBug .
But hey .. that was okay .. when i had to test my sites , i would go to Firefox , but for normal web - browsing , i never missed Firefox , just the way i never missed IE when i switched to Firefox .
Opera was just freakin… awesome ..!!!
and i loved it for the memory footprint that it occupied and it never crashed for me ( though , YMMV 😉 and to add to that , Opera had lot more features like integrated mail client , newsgroups , saving multiple sessions , needless to say i loved it 😉
Flock
So when i came across the beta release of flock , i was just curious to try it out and my first thoughts were , oh its a replica of Firefox with few more functionalities , primary among those being a integrated access to various social networking sites from its sidebar .
well .. which was not bad ..* ahem * quite good , just like you do n’t want to open different mail clients for each and every mail account that you have , you would like to have an integrated access to all these social networking sites instead of logging into each one of them .
so this integration was quite a welcome feature given the fad for social networking sites .
But , hey …is that reason enough for altogether a new browser ..?
i do n’t think so .. but to be fair , Flock also has other features like Web Clipboard , Blogging client , Media bar , and obviously the sidebar .
But another interesting point that i came across was regarding the memory usage comparison of Flock vs firefox 3.0 . well just to double check on this , i fired up all my tabs in Opera in Flock and also in firefox 3.0 and boy Opera beats them all and Firefox crashes as usual :) , but though , Flock initially used more memory footprint than Firefox , it never crashed :) , which was interesting and i’m just curious what tweaks did Flock guys do to the Firefox engine and why is firefox still not fixing it ?
i see that firefox 3.0 has loads of features but why are they not fixing this serios issue of frequent crashes ..? what will we do with those features when the browser would crash anyway ..? well in that sense , kudos to Flock and i hope to see how flock catches up with the new versions of the firefox 3.0 engine .
And if they do manage to catch up , then i would n’t see why people who wants to move to firefox 3.0 should not move to Flock if not my fav browser Opera 🙂
But hey ..i am not going to switch my loyalty from Opera to this new browser for just the side - bar 😉
Opera ROCKS !!!

By By David Silverberg Dec 19 , 2007 in Science Last month , a major stem - cell breakthrough had everyone talking , even President Bush .
But researchers at Harvard University warn the new method is n't safe for humans and they say embryonic stem cell research is still the Holy Grail of science .
Digital Journal —
It was the discovery of the decade , so said headlines around the world : Scientists found a way to But Harvard researchers say this might be putting the cart before the horse .
Scientists at one of the world ’s leading stem cell laboratories say IPS is too dangerous to implement in real situations .
The method may never be safe for humans , they explain , which means pursuing more controversial techniques of stem cell replication is still necessary .
Dr. George Q. Daley , a stem cell researcher at Children 's Hospital Boston , For doing basic research on human cells , IPS as a method has won — it 's huge .
But for the ultimate goal of getting cells into a patient , it 's a lot less clear .
These cells may never be useful for direct therapy .
Although
It ’s no surprise that Harvard is powering forward with its embryonic stem cell research .
While more controversial , the method still has the most potential to treat human ailments ranging from severed spinal chord to heart disease .
Stem cells are viewed as the Holy Grail of science because they can be developed into 220 types of cell in the human body .
The main roadblock embryonic research faces is the high - profile moral mess .
President Bush and his supporters claim human embryos can become human beings , saying scientists who experiment with embryos are in fact committing a form of murder .
Scientists acknowledge the ethical difficulty in this field of research but they say the medical advantages outweigh the religious and moral issues .
For now , leading stem cell scientists do n’t want to close any doors .
They want to remain open to any possible methods that can be explored in this vital field of science .
Konrad Hochedlinger , a Massachusetts General Hospital lab leader , said recently : [ Reprogrammed cells represent ] a gigantic part of the future of stem cell research , but not the whole future .
Maybe in a few years all efforts will go in this direction .
But right now that would be a very foolish and maybe tragic bet .
Digital Journal —
It was the discovery of the decade , so said headlines around the world : Scientists found a way to create stem cells from human skin .
This reprogramming technique , called induced pluripotent stem cells or IPS , turned back the clock on normal cells and reverted them to a desired “ blank slate . ”
The White House even praised the breakthrough as a way to solve medical problems “ without compromising either the high aims of science or the sanctity of human life .
" But Harvard researchers say this might be putting the cart before the horse .
Scientists at one of the world ’s leading stem cell laboratories say IPS is too dangerous to implement in real situations .
The method may never be safe for humans , they explain , which means pursuing more controversial techniques of stem cell replication is still necessary .
Dr. George Q. Daley , a stem cell researcher at Children 's Hospital Boston , told the Boston Globe Although IPS is incredibly promising — it takes just four genes to turn the skin cell into a stem cell — there are several downfalls : inducing the reprogramming may cause quirks in the cells , making them too unpredictable for human therapy .
Another problem is that IPS uses retroviruses to bring the genes into cells .
These viruses can tangle with the normal function of DNA and also cause the birth of cancer cells .
It ’s no surprise that Harvard is powering forward with its embryonic stem cell research .

Here are 5 such disorders that might just be cool enough to get you laid .
Now , when we say " troubled , " we 're not talking about that one naked dude on the subway who constantly masturbates and can only talk in machine code .
No , we mean the complex and difficult soul , present in 70 percent of Oscar - winning movies , who spends two hours battling against his inner demons while being submerged up to neck level in pussy .
You can be that guy , if only you re lucky enough to contract an inconvenient and traumatic brain condition .
We do n't want to make light of mental disorders or its sufferers , but you have to admit sometimes a person can be just mentally ill enough to be cool .
After all , chicks totally dig troubled guys .
Foreign Accent Syndrome
This very rare condition arises as a result of a stroke or head trauma in which the brain 's speech center is damaged , causing the sufferer to regain consciousness with a totally different accent .
In addition , some people pick up a " bizarre intonation . "
We 're not sure what this means , but we 're guessing it's how you would sound if you tried to have a conversation while being enthusiastically fellated .

Will it get me laid ?
Foreign accents immediately make you more interesting and exotic to the opposite sex , even if you 're a fat , balding IT tech with a cubicle papered in Battlestar Galactica posters .
The trouble is , you do n't know which accent you 're going to get .
Some ( Irish , for example ) are business - class tickets to vaginatown , whereas others make you want to claw your own ears off and then eat them .
You could get lucky , like the lady who woke up speaking a strong Jamaican patois .
Or , in a chilling worst - case scenario , you might end up like the woman who regained consciousness thinking she was French .

Jesus .
How do I get it ?
From the cases we found online , the primary cause seems to be falling off motorbikes .
As you 'll see throughout this list , if our research is reliable -- and we have no reason to suspect that a cursory scan of Wikipedia could be anything else -- then approximately 90 percent of interesting mental disorders happen this way .
So , if you 're in the mood for a change , and you 're the kind of guy who likes fun surprises , just ride your bike into a truck and see what you wake up with .
Is it worth it ?
Although some sufferers acquire specific dialects , most just end up with a " general foreign accent , " which could make you sound like a brain - damaged Mrs. Doubtfire - type .
Not sexy .
However , the condition is usually short - lived , so go for it !
What have you got to lose ?

Three senior members of the House Judiciary Committee have called for the immediate opening of impeachment hearings for Vice President Richard Cheney .
Democrats Robert Wexler of Florida , Luis Gutierrez of Illinois and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin on Friday distributed a statement , “ A Case for Hearings , ” that declares , “ The issues at hand are too serious to ignore , including credible allegations of abuse of power that if proven may well constitute high crimes and misdemeanors under our constitution .
The charges against Vice President Cheney relate to his deceptive actions leading up to the Iraq war , the revelation of the identity of a covert agent for political retaliation , and the illegal wiretapping of American citizens . ”

It would be easy to imagine Reno , Ohio , as the type of place that would be hit hardest by outsourcing - a small American town losing out to the invisible hand shifting jobs to places like Bangalore and Guangzhou .
Instead , outsourcing is bringing the jobs to Reno .
Across the street from an Army Reserve center and next to a farm , a customer - service call center hums , its 250 workers answering phones for online travel agency Expedia .
The center 's owner ?
Indian conglomerate Tata Group .
The phenomenon has a name : " insourcing , " the term experts are starting to use when foreign multinationals open offices on U.S. soil and hire Americans , at a higher price , to do the very jobs they once lured overseas .
In this case the center in Reno is targeted toward companies willing to pay a premium - its workers there cost up to 40 percent more than their counterparts in India - to give their U.S. customers a more culturally fluent , less frustrating 1- 800 experience .
( No more hearing someone read from a script ten time zones away . )
Tata , which is based in Mumbai , established its Reno roots last year when its business services unit , SerWizSol , bought the call - center business of travel - processing firm TRX ; the deal also gave it a call center in Milton , Fla .
" We want to be able to say to a client , If there 's a piece [ of call - center operations ] you want to keep in America , we can do that for you , " says Ricardo Layun , head of U.S. operations for SerWizSol .
Multinational corporations , of course , have been hanging shingles in the U.S. for years .
According to the Organization for International Investment , firms headquartered abroad employ 5.1 million Americans in their U.S. offices .
But while these jobs have typically been in manufacturing ( think German carmakers ' factories in the South ) , the mix is changing , and more companies are finding that hiring Americans offers distinct advantages .
Some companies feel hearing a fellow American makes callers feel more comfortable .
Other foreign firms think Americans bring a more entrepreneurial attitude to their work .
In Expedia 's case , its call - center workers need a firm grasp on U.S. geography .
Tata is trying hard to make a connection here .
The company , which has a history in India of caring about social causes , has encouraged workers in Reno to get more involved in the community .
There was a Tata float in the local Thanksgiving parade .
Workers recently swept up a playground that had fallen into disrepair .
And when an employee was injured in a car accident , Tata donated $ 500 to the family .
Christy Rice , senior team leader , says those efforts demonstrate the biggest difference under the new owners .
" It 's less about numbers and more about people , " she says .
The above public service announcement has been running during Hockey Night In Canada on CBC up north .
It is definitive proof that Canadians are terrifying .

A group of computer scientists , mathematicians , and biologists from around the world have developed a computer algorithm that can help trace the genetic ancestry of thousands of individuals in minutes , without any prior knowledge of their background .
Unlike previous computer programs of its kind that require prior knowledge of an individual 's ancestry and background , this new algorithm looks for specific DNA markers known as single nucleotide polymorphisms , or SNPs ( pronounced snips ) , and needs nothing more than a DNA sample in the form of a simple cheek swab .
The researchers used genetic data from previous studies to perform and confirm their research , including the new HapMap database , which is working to uncover and map variations in the human genome .
" Now that we have found that the program works well , we hope to implement it on a much larger scale , using hundreds of thousands of SNPs and thousands of individuals , " said Petros Drineas , the senior author of the study and assistant professor of computer science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute .
" The program will be a valuable tool for understanding our genetic ancestry and targeting drugs and other medical treatments because it might be possible that these can affect people of different ancestry in very different ways . "
Understanding our unique genetic makeup is a crucial step to unraveling the genetic basis for complex diseases , according to the paper .
Although the human genome is 99 percent the same from human to human , it is that 1 percent that can have a major impact on our response to diseases , viruses , medications , and toxins .
If researchers can uncover the minute genetic details that set each of us apart , biomedical research and treatments can be better customized for each individual , Drineas said .
This program will help people understand their unique backgrounds and aid historians and anthropologists in their study of where different populations originated and how humans became such a hugely diverse , global society .
Their program was more than 99 percent accurate and correctly identified the ancestry of hundreds of individuals .
This included people from genetically similar populations ( such as Chinese and Japanese ) and complex genetic populations like Puerto Ricans who can come from a variety of backgrounds including Native American , European , and African .
" When we compared our findings to the existing datasets , only one individual was incorrectly identified and his background was almost equally close between Chinese and Japanese , " Drineas said .
In addition to Drineas , the algorithm was developed by scientists from California , Puerto Rico , and Greece .
The researchers involved include lead author Peristera Paschou from the Democritus University of Thrace in Greece ; Elad Ziv , Esteban G. Burchard , and Shweta Choudhry from the University of California , San Francisco ; William Rodriguez - Cintron from the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine in San Juan ; and Michael W. Mahoney from Yahoo !
Research in California .
The team 's findings will be published in the September 2007 edition of the journal PLoS Genetics .
Drineas ' research was funded by his National Science Foundation Career award .

The article , called Dr. Drug Rep , chronicles his introduction into the world of lecturing for drug companies -- a company hires you to give a talk about a topic or drug to a bunch of doctors -- and the effects of the lecturing on doctors and himself , and then his pulling out .
For context , Carlat is a fairly famous psychiatrist blogger who is both a sort of watchdog of Pharma , as well as a source of information about psychiatric drugs .
The general message is that Pharma softly manipulates doctors to act as proxy drug reps , which in turn lends credibility / celebrity endorsement to the Pharma message , and thus influences other doctors to prescribe the medicine .
Ok , I hear you .
I have no beef with Carlat , his point is not unique .
But break it down :
So we do n't want doctors lecturing about the drugs .
Okay .
Well , who do we want ?
More reps ?
Here 's where it all falls apart , and I defy anyone to contradict me : .
Doctors would n't know anything about the medicines if it were not for Pharma and its tentacles ( reps , speakers , drug company research and publications , etc. )
Carlat himself has written extensively about the supposedly objective " Continuing Medical Education " process being a Pharma - sham .
( Not to mention horrendously useless . )
There is no objective education in medicine .
None .
Stop pretending there is .
If you want evidence of this , consider that the despite the cardiac risks of Vioxx being publicly -- as in Yahoo !
News publicly -- known even in 1999 , doctors were surprised when it was pulled .
" What ?
They never told us about that ...
" And do n't tell me there are journals .
They 're worse than literary quarterlies , and no one reads them anyway .
Do n't believe me ?
Ask your doctor to name one single article in any of this month 's journals .
Not if he read it ; just the title .
You say : well , we do n't mind the lectures , per se , we just want them separated from Pharma money .
Oh .
Whose money do you intend to use ?
There 's a bit of a misconception about what goes on in these lectures .
A doctor does n't stand up and say , " I 've used Effexor , and it 's awesome .
Way better than Celexa .
Which kills puppies . "
They actually have to use an FDA approved slide deck from which they cannot deviate , even if it 's a fact .
For example , you can't say the following sentence : " There was a study published in the New England Journal ... " unless the FDAyou to say that .
And doctors are obligated to give " fair balance , " which means you must talk about the risks as well as the benefits .
Risks which are prominently featured on the slides .
But that 's besides the point .
I am not an idiot , of course , and I understand marketing and how to lean a lecture .
But let 's be rigorous .
These lectures are intended to get you to prescribe Zoloft over Prozac , not over penicillin .
If I'm " influenced " to prescribe Zoloft instead of Prozac , what 's the harm ?
Not in theory -- in actuality .
Tell me when Zoloft is inappropriate that Prozac is appropriate .
And if you do discover such a mythical patient , then my choosing Zoloft for that person is n't a case of Pharma manipulation , it 's a case of me sucking as a doctor .
The simple problem is that it sounds really bad to have Pharma be so much a part of medical education .
And it is , but there 's no other system in place .
If today you fire all drug reps , then you will effectively freeze medical care to November 2007 .
Because there is no " objective " system for evaluating and disseminating information , the only way to form an educated opinion is to listen to the different pitches and stories and parse out the truth .
And Pharma is very good at this : Zyprexa 's diabetes risks were firstby Pfizer , who were defending against Lilly 's attack on Geodon about QTc prolongation .
( And do n't think for a moment doctors would have figured out QTc risks on their own . )
I think it would be great if academics , or some objective body , could be in charge of this , and in charge of publishing their findings , but this does n't exist .
It would be great if legal issues could be resolved " objectively , " too .
Wish it all you want ; that system does not exist , all you have to work with is this the Pharma adversarial system .
That 's it .
You know what a Pharma free system looks like ?
Cuba .
Pharma is the backbone of medicine , because , unfortuantely , medicine is about treatment , not prevention .
If a doctor recommends exercise , or garlic , or even aspirin , it 's a sidenote , and a quaint one .
" Oh , my doctor thinks I should move to Florida for my asthma ! "
Meanwhile , they 'll give out the amoxicillin to every crying toddler , even though theythat that is detrimental .
you know why ?
Because it looks like a treatment .
It 's not all the doctors ' fault ; but that 's the system .
I 'm going to repeat this because I know people are going to misunderstand me : the system that you want is impossible to construct in the framework of modern medicine , if for no other reason than doctors do n't read -- derive no benefit from reading .
The system does not exist , and you cannot create it .
Psychiatry is politics ; medicine is the justice system .
Pharma are the opposing lawyers , and doctors are the jury .
The jury must decide the fate of the defendant - patient .
And the FDA - - judge simply makes sure everyone is civil .
Not accurate , save for outright perjury ; just civil .
Does this scare you ?
Me , too .
But that 's the system .
Learn to work in it .
I should mention that this system is the only one that allows the public -- patients -- access to the information .
In a closed , hierarchical system free of Pharma marketing , patients would have no choice but to completely trust their doctors to know about the medications .
Think about that .
A strange part of all of this is that the target " consumer " for Pharma is doctors ; those are the people we want to protect from drug company influence .
But doctors are the most educated consumers anywhere ; if they can't separate truth from marketing , what hope does the Chevy Truck demographic have , who hear about no money down ?
Do we ban all advertising ?
Blaming Pharma is a diversion .
It gets the world distracted from the real issue , which is that medicine is set up -- incentivized -- for mediocrity .
To : Michael Dell
From : Gregg Gordon
Subject : Why I Did Not Buy A Dell Computer
Dear Mr. Dell :
I recently was in the market for a new laptop computer and considered your products along with several others .
There were a number of factors that pointed in the direction of Dell .
I know people who own Dells who seem satisfied with their performance , plus I used to be a neighbor of yours in Austin and know several people who work for your company , and I would like to see them prosper .
But ultimately I decided to go with another brand , and here 's why .
As I said , I used to live in Austin , including in the late '90s when our then - governor was gearing up his presidential campaign , so we both had a chance to observe him up close .
I do n't know what you saw , but I saw a man who sometime in his 40s , out of the blue , realized he had the money , connections , a well - known name , personal charm , and sufficiently ruthless friends to make a serious go of it , thought it would be a kick to try , and he might even be able to finally one - up his dad .
I saw a man who proudly claimed not to lose a minute of sleep when sending people to their death .
Not even the Pope could give him pause -- not once -- and when a woman who proclaimed Christ as her savior asked for his mercy , he thought it was funny and later mocked her publicly to a reporter .
I gave him the benefit of the doubt and assumed he was merely putting on a macho front for craven , political purposes , because the only alternative explanation was that he was a dangerous sociopath who badly needed help .
But an emotionless , cynical , dilettante president , with Oedipal issues and a mid-life crisis , armed with the most powerful arsenal in the history of the world and with the futures of billions of people in his hands -- no , that 's not what we needed .
So in 2000 , when friends would jokingly speculate about the possibility of George Bush actually becoming president , I would literally get cold chills .
While you were maxing out your legally allowable campaign contribution to him and lending your name to various public appeals for his support , I was begging my Naderite friends to vote for Gore instead .
Alas , I had no pull with the US Supreme Court , and the unthinkable happened .
( Who would have thought , before he was even out of office , Gore would have the Nobel Peace Prize , while Bush would be the most despised person on the planet ?
You sure know how to pick ' em . )
Once in office , his very first act was to push for tax cuts which plunged the nation into unprecedented debt but which , to someone in your tax bracket , must have made your comparatively trifling campaign contribution seem like one of the best investments you ever made .
Then he acted as if he thought his job was done .
Even when the CIA warned him the country was in danger of imminent attack , he blew it off and went back to his vacation .
Only when that attack in fact came did he re-engage in his responsibilities , and that proved to be worse still .
Meanwhile , you continued your generous giving to a rogue 's gallery of Bush enablers , including a $ 250,000 soft - money donation to the Republican National State Elections Committee and contributions to such weirdly - named political action committees as Conservative and Republican Together Equals Results , and Every Republican Is Crucial .
Most galling were your contributions to Tom DeLay and his Americans for a Republican Majority PAC , who promptly showed his gratitude by dismembering our hometown Congressional district , once represented by giants like LBJ and Jake Pickle , into minority status split among three separate districts , stretching to the suburbs of Houston , the deserts of West Texas , and the Mexican border .
Gee , thanks Mike .
But after the fiasco in Iraq began to unfold , I realized even I had underestimated just how big a disaster a Bush presidency would be , so in 2004 I upped my efforts , knocking on doors in Florida and New Mexico and even helping organize pro-Kerry military veterans in the hopeless cause of Texas .
But you upped yours , too , and eventually gave $ 250,000 to the Bush inaugural fund .
I 'm sure it was a good party , but not for the people working and too often dying in the nation 's uninspected coal mines , not for children who need to see doctors or like to play with toys , and not for the people of New Orleans .
Do you even begin to appreciate the damage to our country and the world you have helped do -- eight precious years irretrievably lost to confront the most serious threat to our planet 's health ever faced , millions of Americans facing this holiday season on the brink of losing their homes , the value of the dollar evaporating as fast as our international reputation , the Constitution reduced , in the words of the President , to " just a piece of paper , " and of course , more than $ 1 trillion dumped down the sewer of Iraq , thousands of American lives lost , tens of thousands more broken , and hundreds of thousands innocent Iraqis dead , some of whose crime was nothing more than approaching the wrong intersection at the wrong time .
And who has benefited ?
Just you and a tiny percentage of the wealthiest Americans .
I see now that , according to the Forbes 400 , your personal fortune has reached $ 17.2 billion -- up $ 4 billion just since 2003 , a cool billion per year .
How nice for you .
I congratulate your children on their good luck .
But now that you have accumulated more money than you could spend in 10 lifetimes , can you finally , like King Midas , say , " Enough .
Enough . "
I notice also that you 've recently begun to hedge your bets , donating money to a " pro-business " Democratic PAC .
Well , your business savvy is legendary , but I 'm afraid that just wo n't cut it .
For unlike Mr. Bush , I believe in redemption .
I would humbly suggest you find more serious ways to begin to make amends , and soon .
I 'm sure you wo n't notice my small impact on your market share , but I think you will find it good for your soul .

Dr. Anthony Hannan , along with Dr Caitlin McOmish , Emma Burrows and colleagues , characterised a genetically altered mouse and discovered that it had schizophrenia - like behaviours , including learning and memory problems , the inability to process complex information , and abnormal responses to particular sensory stimuli .
The scientists found the mouse ’s condition significantly improved by simply giving them enhanced mental and physical exercise – putting running wheels in their cages , plus interesting items to smell , see and touch .
Not only did the mouse ’s schizophrenia - like symptoms ease through this environmental enrichment , but a specific chemical transmitter pathway found to be abnormal in the cerebral cortex of the mice was selectively rescued .
An anti-psychotic drug used by humans also improved the mouse ’s condition , indicating that this mouse is a valid model for schizophrenia in humans .
Dr Hannan said this discovery could pave the way for the development of better treatments for schizophrenia .
“ Through our research , and that of others , we hope a new class of therapeutic drugs will be developed that mimic the effects of environmental enrichment in the brain to treat various brain disorders , possibly including schizophrenia , ” Dr Hannan said .
“ Pharmaceutical approaches may not be the sole answer for a given brain disease .
People may still need optimal levels of physical and mental activity , as well as a healthy diet , plus the right drugs .
“ We have already identified specific molecules that could be targets for what I call ‘ enviromimetics ’ and these may have relevance for other brain diseases .
“ However , there are obviously major differences between mice and men , and large - scale clinical trials are needed to identify the most beneficial drugs , “ he said .
Schizophrenia is a brain disorder that is brought on through a complex and largely unknown interaction of genes and environment .
There is a nature - nurture aspect to schizophrenia because in human identical twins , if one twin develops schizophrenia , there is only a 50 % chance the other twin , who has identical genes , will develop the illness .
Dr Anthony Hannan ’s ground - breaking environmental enrichment studies have previously shown that a combination of mental and physical exercise could delay the onset and progression of Huntington ’s disease .
As well as movement problems ( e.g. chorea ) and cognitive deficits ( culminating in dementia ) this disease has psychiatric symptoms , which can include depression and psychosis .

The head of MI5 has sensationally accused Russia and China of undermining the fight against terrorism by running Cold War espionage operations in Britain .
Jonathan Evans voiced " disappointment " that his agents are having to track spies from major countries that are diplomatic allies when they should be taking on Islamist extremists .
His decision to single out two of the world 's most powerful nations caused anger at the Foreign Office and is likely to trigger outrage in Moscow and Beijing .
Relations with Russia are in the deep freeze following last summer 's diplomatic row that saw London expel four suspected spies after Moscow refused to extradite the chief suspect in the murder of former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko .
Tit for tat expulsions , followed by threats from Moscow politicians and shows of strength near British airspace by Russian bombers , have cast a pall over the Government 's relations with the regime of president Vladimir Putin .
The decision by the head of the MI5 to single out Russia and China is understood to have caused consternation at the Foreign Office .
It could deal a blow to Gordon Brown 's hopes to visit Beijing in the New Year .
But Mr Evans , who took over as director general of Security Service earlier this year , is frustrated by the way his overstretched resources are being diverted by the volume of spy activity by Russian and Chinese agents .
He is also concerned by the potential " reputational hit " to Britain if allies such as the United States come to believe the UK is unable to protect high - value economic secrets .
The Russian ambassador was summoned to the Foreign Office in the summer for a diplomatic " carpeting " over the networks being run out of his office .
Four of his diplomats were expelled , all said by sources to be agents of the FSB - the successor to the KGB .
More than 30 intelligence officers working under diplomatic cover in London are blamed for what Mr Evans said was a level of activity that had not diminished since the end of the Cold War nearly 20 years ago .
In his first public speech since taking over the job earlier this year , Mr Evans said : " This year , yet again , there have been high levels of covert activity by foreign intelligence organisations in our country .
" Since the end of the Cold War we have seen no decrease in the numbers of undeclared Russian intelligence officers in the UK - at the Russian Embassy and associated organisations conducting covert activity in this country .
" So despite the Cold War ending nearly two decades ago , my Service is still expending resources to defend the UK against unreconstructed attempts by Russia , China and others , to spy on us .
" A number of countries continue to devote considerable time and energy trying to steal our sensitive technology on civilian and military projects , and trying to obtain political and economic intelligence at our expense .
" They do not only use traditional methods to collect intelligence but increasingly deploy sophisticated technical attacks , using the internet to penetrate computer networks .
" It is a matter of some disappointment to me that I still have to devote significant amounts of equipment , money and staff to countering this threat .
They are resources which I would far rather devote to countering the threat from international terrorism - a threat to the whole international community , not just the UK . "
Mr Evans is said to be personally frustrated that money , personnel and equipment is being " wasted " pursuing foreign spies when it should be devoted to tracking al - Qaeda .
Russian spies are known to be focused on acquiring military and industrial secrets , with a particular focus on science and technology .
They specifically target major companies in the defence field such as Rolls Royce , BAe and other companies at the cutting edge of technology , as well as Whitehall departments .
Using techniques that have little changed since the days of the Cold War , they seek to cultivate executives and officials using money and other inducements .
Whereas Russia often relies on undercover spies stationed in London as diplomats who are immune from prosecution , it is understood the Chinese operate differently , prefering agents who come to the UK under cover as businessmen , academics and students .
They " hoover up " any information they can get hold of , and then analyse it back in China for any intelligence it may offer .
" The Chinese have a lower threshhold for what qualifies as intelligence and do n't target in the same way , " one source said .
Otto , the first of the two ALMA antenna transporters , was given its name at a ceremony on the compounds of heavy - vehicle specialist Scheuerle Fahrzeugfabrik GmbH , in Baden - Württemberg .
This new colossus is 10 meters wide , 20 meters long and 6 meters high and will be shipped to Chile by the end of the month .
The transporter was named ' Otto ' in honor of Otto Rettenmaier , the owner of the Scheuerle company .
" The rather unusual move to name a vehicle is a recognition of the remarkable achievement these unique machines represent , " said Hans Rykaczewski , the European ALMA Project Manager .
" Their sizes alone would justify using superlatives to describe them .
But they are also outstanding as they will operate at 5000 metres altitude , where the air is rare , and they have to be able to place 115 - ton antennas with a precision of a few millimetres , " he added .
The ALMA Project , in which ESO leads the construction and the operations on behalf of Europe , is a giant , international observatory currently in construction on the high - altitude Chajnantor site in Chile , which will be composed initially of 66 high - precision telescopes , operating at wavelengths of 0.3 to 9.6 mm .
The ALMA antennas will be electronically combined and provide astronomical observations which are equivalent to a single large telescope of tremendous size and resolution .
Given their important functions in transporting high - tech antennas with the required care , the transport vehicles must live up to very demanding operational requirements , since the two engines of Otto will lose about half of their power ( compared to sea level ) because of the reduced oxygen content of the air .
With their two 500 kW diesel engines ( nearly as much as two Formula 1 engines ) , the ALMA transporters will be able to move at the speed of 20 km/h when empty and 12 km/h when loaded with an antenna .
Notwithstanding its impressive dimensions , the transporter can be maneuvered by a single operator , the precise positioning being made possible by a hydrostatic system while the electronic 28 - wheel drive allows very precise motions .
" When completed in 2012 , ALMA will be the largest and most capable imaging array of telescopes in the world , " said Massimo Tarenghi , the ALMA Director .
" The ALMA antenna transporters , which are unique technological jewels , beautifully illustrate how we are actively progressing towards this goal . "

In a computer model , researchers at Illinois were able to simulate the photosynthetic behavior of actual leaves .
Here , a gas exchange system measures the rate of carbon dioxide and electron transport in intact leaves .

University of Illinois researchers have built a better plant , one that produces more leaves and fruit without needing extra fertilizer .
The researchers accomplished the feat using a computer model that mimics the process of evolution .
Theirs is the first model to simulate every step of the photosynthetic process .
The research findings appear in the October issue of Plant Physiology , and will be presented today at the BIO - Asia 2007 Conference in Bangkok , Thailand .
Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy in plants , algae , phytoplankton and some species of bacteria and archaea .
Photosynthesis in plants involves an elaborate array of chemical reactions requiring dozens of protein enzymes and other chemical components .
Most photosynthesis occurs in a plant ’s leaves .
“ The question we wanted to ask , was , ‘ Can we do better than the plant , in terms of productivity ? ’ ” said principal investigator Steve Long , a professor of plant biology and crop sciences at the University of Illinois .
It was n’t feasible to tackle this question with experiments on actual plants , Long said .
With more than 100 proteins involved in photosynthesis , testing one protein at a time would require an enormous investment of time and money .
“ But now that we have the photosynthetic process ‘ in silico , ’ we can test all possible permutations on the supercomputer , ” he said .
The researchers first had to build a reliable model of photosynthesis , one that would accurately mimic the photosynthetic response to changes in the environment .
This formidable task relied on the computational resources available at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications .
Xin-Guang
Zhu , a research scientist at the center and in plant biology , worked with Long and Eric de Sturler , formerly a specialist in computational mathematics in computer sciences at Illinois , to realize this model .
After determining the relative abundance of each of the proteins involved in photosynthesis , the researchers created a series of linked differential equations , each mimicking a single photosynthetic step .
The team tested and adjusted the model until it successfully predicted the outcome of experiments conducted on real leaves , including their dynamic response to environmental variation .
The researchers then programmed the model to randomly alter levels of individual enzymes in the photosynthetic process .
Before a crop plant , like wheat , produces grain , most of the nitrogen it takes in goes into the photosynthetic proteins of its leaves .
Knowing that it was undesirable to add more nitrogen to the plants , Long said , the researchers asked a simple question : “ Can we do a better job than the plant in the way this fixed amount of nitrogen is invested in the different photosynthetic proteins ? ”
Using “ evolutionary algorithms , ” which mimic evolution by selecting for desirable traits , the model hunted for enzymes that – if increased – would enhance plant productivity .
If higher concentrations of an enzyme relative to others improved photosynthetic efficiency , the model used the results of that experiment as a parent for the next generation of tests .
This process identified several proteins that could , if present in higher concentrations relative to others , greatly enhance the productivity of the plant .
The new findings are consistent with results from other researchers , who found that increases in one of these proteins in transgenic plants increased productivity .
“ By rearranging the investment of nitrogen , we could almost double efficiency , ” Long said .
An obvious question that stems from the research is why plant productivity can be increased so much , Long said .
Why have n’t plants already evolved to be as efficient as possible ?
“ The answer may lie in the fact that evolution selects for survival and fecundity , while we were selecting for increased productivity , ” he said .
The changes suggested in the model might undermine the survival of a plant living in the wild , he said , “ but our analyses suggest they will be viable in the farmer ’s field . ”
The research was sponsored by the National Science Foundation .

The story that ’s buried on CNN ’s Political Ticker , instead of on the front page is hard to believe if you read it carefully , and also the response from the Republican Committee :
Please note the areas in italics :
Bill Clinton : George H.W. Bush will help President Hillary
ORANGEBURG , South Carolina ( CNN ) – Former President Bill Clinton said Monday that the first thing his wife Hillary will do when she reaches the White House is dispatch him and his predecessor , President George H.W. Bush , on an around - the - world mission to repair the damage done to America ’s reputation by the current president —
Bush ’s son , George W. Bush .
“ Well , the first thing she intends to do , because you can do this without passing a bill , the first thing she intends to do is to send me and former President Bush and a number of other people around the world to tell them that America is open for business and cooperation again , ” Clinton said in response to a question from a supporter about what his wife ’s “ number one priority ” would be as president .
A spokesman for the George H.W. Bush was not immediately available to comment on whether the former president would chip in some diplomatic help after his son leaves office next year .

If Bush Sr. is willing to go “ on an around - the - world mission to repair the damage done to America ’s reputation by the current president — Bush ’s son , George W. Bush ” the immediate conclusion drawn from that statement is that President Bush ’s own father has admitted that his son ’s administration , George W , Bush , has screwed - up America ’s image so badly that it will take two ex-Presidents to act as diplomats in an attempt to rebuild our image .
It ’s hard for me to believe what Bill Clinton stated , however when you read the Republican Committee ’s response , it certainly is n’t a denial ; in fact , it does n’t say much at all :
UPDATE : The Republican National Committee issued this statement in response to Clinton ’s comments : “ In 2009 , a Republican president will be working with our friends and allies abroad to continue to keep our nation safe , ” said RNC spokesman Danny Diaz .
“ The American people expect our leaders — both current and former — to present serious solutions to the very real challenges confronting our nation . ” – CNN South Carolina Producer Peter Hamby LINK
I would n’t have expected Bush Sr. to admit , albeit by innuendo , to say he was going out to repair his son ’s errors , but something less stunning in nature .
( Or did he say it ?
President Bush has to be looking very dimly upon the fact his own father has offered to go out into the world with Bill Clinton to “ help repair the damage . ” )
Bill Clinton said it , and I ’ll be curious to see how this one plays out in the coming days .
Bush Sr. refused to capture Husein based on advice from his advisor ’s - that it would destabilize the entire Middle - East ; he is said to have been the forging factor in James Baker re-entering the political landscape with the formation of The Iraq Study Group , and now Sr. is offering to help and repair the image to America and “ repair the damage ” because of the ??????? of his son ?
Would Clinton make such a political blunder that Sr. will have to publicly speak to spin what was said , or will it get tackier with Sr. asking for an apology , that he had agreed to no such thing ?
Or will he simply remain silent ?
( Which would be a tacit admission . )
Bush and Cheney see no damage , only the chance of more profit , greed , and power - and now it appears that Bush Sr. , who I have to respect for agreeing to face so many we have wronged , in his own son ’s name …
To me , that ’s shocking news and I believe it ’s front page material and does n’t belong buried in the Political Ticker .
This signals that Bush Senior is predicting a Democratic win ( IMO ) , he is n’t siding with the Republicans and instead is more interested in protecting our image - and his legacy , and whatever he can save ( if any ) of his sons tarnished service as President .

The State Department has launched an investigation into another Blackwater shooting of an innocent in Baghdad – but this time the victim was the pet pooch of the New York Times bureau .
The paper ’s representatives in the Iraqi capital said yesterday that security guards from the embattled private firm killed their beloved dog , named Hentish , last week .
The State Department would not say yesterday whether the Times – which has strongly denounced Blackwater and opposed the war in Iraq on its editorial pages – had requested the probe .
Blackwater , already under investigation for killing 17 Iraqis in a Baghdad gunfight in September , insisted that Hentish started it – by attacking one of the firm ’s own bomb - sniffing security dogs .
“ The dog attacked our canine and attempts to calm the other dog were unsuccessful , ” said Anny Tyrell , a spokeswoman for the North Carolina - based company .
The Times said the incident occurred before a US diplomat was to visit the newspaper ’s Baghdad compound .
Blackwater , which protects senior US diplomatic and other civilian officers in Iraq , said it sent a security team to sweep the area for explosives .
But Hentish fought one of the bomb - sniffing dogs and could n’t be contained by a Blackwater official , the firm said .
“ The K - 9 handler made several unsuccessful attempts to get the dog to retreat , including placing himself between the dogs , ” Tyrell said .
“ When those efforts failed , the K - 9 handler unfortunately was forced to use a pistol to protect the company ’s K - 9 and himself , ” she said .
The State Department would not say yesterday how it became involved .
A spokeswoman said only it was “ looking into ” the reports .
But officials from the US embassy began an investigation .
Embassy officials made two visits to the Times compound , correspondent Alissa Rubin told Reuters .
Efforts to reach the Times in Baghdad were unsuccessful and a spokesman in New York did not return a call seeking comment .
The Times under its publisher , Arthur “ Pinch ” Sulzberger Jr. , has blasted Blackwater in the aftermath of the September shootings .
LAHORE , Pakistan ( CNN ) --
Police in Pakistan are searching for a man linked to an alleged plot to blow up trans -Atlantic airliners who escaped over the weekend from police custody .
Rashid Rauf reportedly slipped out of his handcuffs after appearing in court in islamabad .
Rashid Rauf , 25 , who has joint British and Pakistani nationality , escaped Saturday as he was being taken to a court in Islamabad for an extradition hearing , a Pakistani police source said .
Two police officers who were accompanying the suspect at the time of his escape have been arrested and are being interrogated , the police source told CNN .
Britain is seeking Rauf 's extradition on charges stemming from the 2002 murder of his uncle in Birmingham , England .
British security sources last year identified Rauf as the leader of the group that allegedly plotted to simultaneously blow up airliners traveling between Britain and the United States .
After details of the allegations emerged in August 2006 , Rauf was picked up in central Pakistan .
More than 20 suspects are being held in Britain in connection with the case .
Last December , an anti-terrorism court in Pakistan threw out terrorism charges against Rauf .
Although an order to dismiss the charges was suspended after the Punjab government appealed , intelligence sources in Pakistan told CNN that no " concrete " evidence had emerged tying Rauf to the alleged plot .
Rauf has denied involvement in the alleged conspiracy .
A spokesman for the British Foreign Office said they were in contact with Pakistani authorities , who were calling the search a " priority . "

The U.S. military has been using games for decades to train its troops .
Now , for the first time , the Army has set up a project office , just for building and deploying games .
No , the Army is n't about to start handing out copies of Halo 3 to troops , TSJOnline.com notes .
“ I have n’t seen a game built for the entertainment industry that fills a training gap , ” said
Col .
Jack Millar , director of the service ’s Training and Doctrine
Command ’s ( TRADOC ) Project Office for Gaming , or TPO Gaming .
Instead , the new office – part of the Army 's Kansas - based National Simulation
Center – will focus on using videogame graphics to make those dull military simulations more realistic , and better - looking .
TPO Gaming is also starting work on a tool kit that would let soldiers " build and customize their own training scenarios without waiting for a contractor to do it for them , " the trade journal notes .
" The Marine Corps has already pioneered this concept with its
Virtual Battlespace 2 , an adaptation of the Armed Assault
first - person - shooter . "
The game is " one of the candidates under consideration for the Army tool kit . "
But , by then , it wo n't exactly be cutting edge .
The kit may not deploy until as late as 2015 .
( You gotta love those fast - moving military bureaucracies . )
By then , DARPA 's made - to - order sim tool could already be in the works , too .
TPO Gaming is hardly the Army 's first foray into the field .
Five years ago , the service developed the America 's Army shoot - em - up , to recruit potential soldiers .
The game proved so popular , it became a military training tool .
The Army has also poured millions into the Institute for Creative
Technologies at the University of Southern California , to use Hollywood know - how to develop next - gen sims .
But while some military offices encourage videogame development , others are looking to crack down on the games troops play , TSJOnline observes .

Each time a probe visits , it does so with better instruments
Enlarge Image
New images and analyses of the massive planet have revealed surprising details of its atmosphere , rings and moons .
They include never - seen - before observations of Jupiter : lightning displays at the poles , mysterious clumps embedded in its rings , and the first movie of volcanic eruption on its moon Io .
Scientist took advantage of the flyby , designed to give New Horizons a gravity boost and shorten its journey to Pluto , to learn more about the Jovian system , and to follow up on previous missions to the gas giant .
" It was a very close flyby - three times closer than Cassini - and our first mission with really modern instruments , " said Amy Simon - Miller , a planetary scientist at the Nasa Goddard Space Flight Center .
It 's a planet on steroids ; it rules the Solar System
Harold Weaver , JHU / APL
The pictures , taken during the spacecraft 's closest approach to Jupiter in February and March this year , were presented at the American Astronomical Society 's Division of Planetary Sciences meeting in Orlando , Florida , in anticipation of their publication in the journal Science .
Big sparks
One result is a comprehensive picture of volcanism on Io .
Along with identifying new volcanic hot spots , the New Horizon movie camera captured a 350 km - high plume spewing from Tvashtar , a volcano near the moon 's north pole .
It is the first observation of an eruption in motion on Io .
" We 've seen glimpses of eruptions like this before , " said John Spencer , from the Southwest Research Institute , " but we got a lot more detail than we were able to get with any previous spacecraft . "
Dr Spencer suggested that some of the sulphur material gushing from
Io might become charged , flow along magnetic field lines , and rain into the Jovian atmosphere .
The largest - and most turbulent - planet in the Solar System , the gas giant is 320 times more massive than Earth .
" It 's a planet on steroids , " said Harold Weaver , from Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory .
" It rules the Solar System . "
New Horizons has provided insight into the forces driving Jupiter 's atmospheric dynamics - in particular , its circulation , along with its thermal convection .
Its instruments captured the first - seen flashes of Jovian lightning at the poles , when the spacecraft sailed around the dark side of the planet .
" These are superbolts , a thousand times stronger than what we usually see on Earth , " said Dr Simon - Miller .
Scientists had previously seen lightning at the planet 's mid-section , but not at high latitudes .
Lightning on Earth draws its energy , in part , from the Sun ; the electric display at Jupiter 's poles , where sunlight is weaker , suggests an internal heat source that is distributed throughout the planet .
Lumpy rings
Saturn 's rings are iconic , but Jupiter has rings too ; dusty and faint .
Two Jovian moons , Adrastea and Metis , travel along them , like marbles on a track .
New Horizons scientists failed to discover new moons in the ring system , as they had anticipated , but did detect two clumps of moon - like material embedded in it .
It is not known why they are clumps - and not spread out - and what keeps them in place .
" We 've seen similar phenomena in the rings of Saturn and Neptune , " he said , " but in this case we can't explain why they 're there . "
He suggested that perhaps they were held in place by the gravitational tug of Metis .
As scientists continue to analyse New Horizons data , the spacecraft continues its journey to Pluto .
The $ 700 m ( £ 350 m ) probe was launched in January last year .
The Jupiter pass was needed to accelerate the spacecraft away from the Sun by an additional 14,500 km/h ( 9,000 mph ) , pushing it past 84,000 km/h ( 52,000 mph ) .
This shortens the journey time to Pluto by four years .
John Jones had collected items for more than 20 years
John Jones ' house in Aberystwyth was so full that he built a network of tunnels so he could move around in it .
Four tonnes of rubbish was removed from the 62 - year - old 's bedroom where police carried his body out through a window , the inquest was told .
Ceredigion coroner Peter Brunton recorded a verdict of accidental death .
The inquest in Aberystwyth was told Mr Jones , a widower who weighed 20 stone and had mobility problems , had collected rubbish for more than 20 years .
His garden and sheds at his home were packed full of rubbish , along with several garages which he had rented from Ceredigion Council .
The easiest way was to carry the body through the window
Sgt Wyn Griffiths
Mr Jones ' body was found in a bedroom at his home in September , after he had not been seen by his neighbours for some time .
Coroner Mr Brunton said it was likely some of the rubbish had fallen on Mr Jones and he had probably died from asphyxiation .
But pathologist Christopher Simpson told the inquest that the cause of death was unknown because the body was so badly decomposed .
Sgt Wyn Griffiths of Dyfed - Powys Police said Mr Jones was found under bags of rubbish .
He added that 4.2 tonnes was removed from a bedroom and landing area .
He told the inquest that the body was carried out of the bedroom window , which had been entirely removed by fire fighters because the house was so packed full of items .
Easiest way
" Nobody could have entered the bedroom .
There was some sort of tunnel system so he could climb through the house , " added Sgt Griffiths .
" There were items up against the sides of the walls , in the hallways , bedrooms , landing and items hanging from the ceiling .
" The easiest way was to carry the body through the window . "
Mr Brunton said Mr Jones was a " compulsive collector of rubbish " .
" On the balance of probabilities , part of the rubbish that Mr Jones had accumulated in his bedroom collapsed on his body . "

炭素でできた極細の筒・カーボンナノチューブは、夢の新素材、ナノテクの旗手として各方面の大きな注目を浴びています。化学・材料・物理学・生物など、ここ数年学術誌にナノチューブの文字が載らない日はまず一日もないというほど、各分野で盛んな研究が進められています。
しかしこうした応用研究を阻む大きな要因として、ナノチューブが各種の溶媒に溶けないという点が挙げられます。ナノチューブは互いに引きつけ合ってがっちりと絡み合った束を作る性質があり、これをほぐして溶媒に分散させるのは至難の業なのです。化学の世界において、反応や精製はたいてい溶媒に溶かして行うものですから、何にも溶けないという性質は極めてやっかいなものなのです。
また生物学方面の応用を考えるとき、生命を支える媒質である「水」に溶ける（分散させる）ことはほぼ必須の条件です。しかし炭素でできたナノチューブはまさに「水と油」で、ただの水には全く混じりません。これを克服するため、水や各種溶媒に分散・溶解させる技術が様々に工夫されてきました。
ところが最近になり、九州大学の中嶋直敏教授のグループが、実に意外なものにナノチューブが溶けることを報告して話題を集めています（Chem. Lett.36 ( 2007 ) , 1140 ）。研究室にあるあらゆる溶媒を受け付けないナノチューブを溶かしてしまう「魔法の液体」は、実はコンビニで150円も出せば容易に入手できます。その液体の名はなんとサントリーの緑茶「伊右衛門 濃いめ」です。
なんでまた伊右衛門茶にナノチューブが溶けるのか――。その秘密は緑茶の主要成分であるカテキン類にあるようです。一般に、芳香環（ベンゼン環など、いわゆる「亀の甲」）を持つ化合物同士は表面のπ電子によって引きつけ合い、積み重なるように寄り集まる性質があります（πスタッキング）。カテキン類は多数の芳香環を持っていますのでナノチューブ表面に引きつけられて集まりますが、一方でたくさんの水酸基をも保持しているため水ともうまくなじみます。要するにナノチューブと水の両方に似た部分構造を持つカテキンがうまく両者の仲立ちをし、本来犬猿の仲である両者をなじませてしまうというのが伊右衛門茶の秘密であるようです。

論文では、代表的なカテキン類であるエピガロカテキンガレート（EGCG）の水溶液にナノチューブが溶けることも示されています。というわけですからこの現象は何も「伊右衛門」に限ったことではなく、「生茶」でも「一（はじめ）」でも同じことが起こると思われます。カテキン類の濃度が高い方が有利でしょうから、「ヘルシア緑茶」あたりにはもっとよく溶けるのかもしれません。
（カテキンの代表的成分・エピガロカテキンガレート）
しかしこんなことがどうやって発見されたのでしょうか？偶然こぼれてしまった昼ご飯のお茶に、そばに置いてあったナノチューブが溶けてしまった――というようなことなら面白いのですが、おそらくそうではなさそうです。中嶋教授のグループではナノチューブの分散・溶解について深い研究を重ねており、ピレンの誘導体などを使った可溶化の報告をすでに行っているからです。さらに入手しやすい成分での可溶化を追求するうち、カテキン類にたどり着いたと見る方が自然でしょう（このあたり詳しいことをご存じの方がおられたらご一報願います）。
（可溶化に用いられるピレン誘導体）
それにしてもユニークな研究です。「エピガロカテキンガレートによる単層カーボンナノチューブの可溶化」などというよりも「伊右衛門にナノチューブが溶けた！」の方がはるかにインパクトがあるのは言うまでもなく、このあたりは実験者のセンスによるところが大きいのではないでしょうか。
この発見が、ナノチューブの研究に実際に応用されるかどうかはまだ未知数です。しかしいずれにせよ非常に身近なものが、科学の最先端の難題解決に役立つ可能性があるというのは面白いことです。寒天などもそうですが、実験に行き詰まった時には身の回りのなじみ深い品に着目してみるのも時には有効なのかもしれません。

Some rebels overpowered the prison guards Pic : S Karimuddin
A police spokesman said 298 of the 377 inmates in Dantewada prison in Chhattisgarh state had escaped .
Some 105 of these inmates were Maoist rebels , the police said .
Thousands of people have died in the course of a 30 - year insurgency being fought by the Maoists across a swathe of central and southern India .
The rebels say that they are fighting for the rights of landless farmers and neglected tribes .
The inmates overpowered the prison guards , broke open the prison gate locks and fled amid gunfire , reports said .
The incident happened when the prisoners came out of their barracks and assembled in the grounds for food .
Reports said there were only four security guards on the ground and the jailor was not in his office .
Strong presence
The prisoners overpowered the guards , shot at them , and then broke open the locks at the gates enabling the prisoners to escape , a local journalist in the area said .
The state interior minister and the chief of the police are visiting the area today .
The rebels have a strong presence in the area
The rebels have a strong presence in eight of 16 districts of Chhattisgarh state .
In July , at least 24 soldiers and police and 20 Maoists were killed in clashes in the state .
In March , 55 policemen were killed in an attack on a security post , the worst Maoist assault in Chhattisgarh .
More than 6,000 people have died during the rebels ' decades - long fight for a communist state in parts of India .
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh says the Maoists pose the most serious threat to national security in India .
The rebels operate in 182 districts in India , mainly in the states of Jharkhand , Bihar , Andhra Pradesh , Chhattisgarh , Madhya Pradesh , Maharashtra and West Bengal .

Zhao Ping Hua describes a sacrifice worth paying for his children 's future
Twenty years of a booming China have meant 20 years of back - breaking work for him .
He is a labourer on the city 's new metro system , and one of the millions of farmers who leave the countryside every year for the riches of the city .
The wages are good here , as much as $ 250 ( 170 euros ; £ 119 ) a month , with overtime .
But for him it means sacrifice , living away from his family , and he misses his children .
" I work really hard , for the wages I earn , to improve my family 's life , " he says .
" I tell my children to study hard , to improve their lives .
Do n't be like their Dad - a migrant labourer , working away from home .
It 's not a good life . "
But he says has no choice .
In Shanghai 's building boom , he can earn four times as much as he would back in the countryside .
His is a journey that tens of millions of workers make every year , leaving their villages and their families behind .
China says there are as many as 20 million migrant workers , but unofficial estimates put the figure far higher .
No complaints
It is a drive of about six hours to get to Zhao Ping Hua 's village in Jiangsu province , to the north of Shanghai .
In a country the size of China that is not very far .
But for Mr Zhao and his family , distance is not the issue .
I miss my Dad very much .
I want to be with him when I grow up
Zhao Hui
Every penny counts , so he can only get home to see his wife and daughter once or maybe twice a year .
His wife Guo Xiumei is a housewife .
She does a little farming on the side , growing rice , in the fields behind their simple home .
She will not see her husband for many months to come , he only makes it back during China 's national holidays .
It 's her job to bring up their two children .
Despite the hardships , she has no complaints .
Migrant workers commonly live in communal accommodation
" Our children need to get a proper education - that 's our priority .
It does n't matter if life is difficult for us , we want the best education for them .
It 's their only hope of a better life , " she says .
Their son is at boarding school , but their daughter , Zhao Hui , has lessons at a school just round the corner .
She is a shy 13 - year - old , but she already knows that she wants a different life to that of her parents .
" I miss my Dad very much - I 'm so happy when he comes back .
" I want to be with him when I grow up .
Some day I 'll take care of him , " she says .
Great sacrifice
Despite her father 's hard work , the family lead a modest life .
Most of the money is spent on school fees .
" We have more money now , but everything is more expensive - rice , pork , it all costs more .
" And we have to pay extra for good schools , " Guo Xiumei adds .
Back in Shanghai , Zhao Ping Hua 's day is ending .
He lives in a communal dorm with other workers .
The thin metal walls means it is freezing during the winter nights , but he stays awake late , writing his diary .
He knows that there is nothing unusual about parents going without for their children 's benefit .
But , as he writes in his diary , here in China , the sacrifice is far greater and the struggle is much harder .
For Mr Zhao and his wife , 20 years of living apart is a price worth paying , if their children do not have to do the same .

Message to Congress :
No one believes Bush and this is dangerous to the country !
There is an urgent warning today from the FBI , that Al - Qaeda might attack shopping malls over the holiday season .
See Exclusive : FBI : Al Qaeda May Strike U.S. Shopping Malls in LA , Chicago ,
The FBI is warning that al Qaeda may be preparing a series of holiday attacks on U.S. shopping malls in Los Angeles and Chicago , according to an intelligence bulletin distributed to law enforcement authorities across the country this morning .
Is there a single person in this country who does n't wonder if this is another Bush trick ?
Be honest , it crossed your mind , did n't it ?
But what if it 's true ?
Meanwhile , hardly a day goes by without another dramatic statement from Bush or Cheney claiming that Iran poses a grave threat to the world .
But few bother to listen anymore .
People just roll their eyes .
Bush cried wolf over Iraq .
Bush raised the terror threat level and announced arrests or warnings for political purposes .
Bush pumped fear into the country to win elections .
And now another warning .
But what if it 's true ?
Listen up , people !
The FBI is warning about an al Queda attack on shopping malls this Christmas and almost no one will pay attention because no one believes this government anymore .
Everyone has seen them manipulate terror threats , pump the fear for elections -- or just to get another capital gains tax cut passed .
Bush has lost credibility , but the world remains dangerous .
Congress must act !
Congress must remove Bush and Cheney for lying to the country to start a war .
Congress must restore the public 's trust in our country 's leadership .
The current situation is dangerous .
If the government says we are about to be attacked we need to be able to believe them and act on it , instead of rolling our eyes and wondering how these clowns think they can get away with more of this fear - pumping .
Because there just might BE a time when we ARE about to be attacked .
One more time : Congress , stop posturing .
Stop worrying about the political fallout .
Start doing what is right for the country .
Bush and Cheney have to be removed from office because they lied to us to get us to support war in Iraq , and now no one believes the government , and this is dangerous .

What Islam Wants : Islam 's Diabolical Plan According to Pakistan 's Jamat-e- Islami Party
Jamhooria Islamia , a monthly Baluchi magazine published from Panj - gar , published an interview in its 1999 February issue with Maulana Nawabzadaa Nabiullah Khan , a confidant of and adviser to Maulana Qazi Ahmed — the Amir of the leading Pakistani Islamic party , Jamaat - e - Islami .
The interview was conducted by Jalil Amir .
The following constitutes are excerpts from that conversation which reveals the fundamentalist ideology and designs of the organization and its leader .
EQUALITY OF MEN AND WOMEN IS STUPIDITY Q :
The women issue is very controversial nowadays .
Taliban and some fundamentalist organizations restrict the freedom of women while some progressive Muslim intellectuals are insisting that the women are equal to men in all spheres .
What are Qazi 's views on women ?
A : As I said earlier , the Prophet Mohammad 's ( PBUH ) views on women are the exact views of Qazi Ahmed and the Jamat .
Equality of men and women is stupidity .
What men can do , women can not do .
Women are weak physically and mentally compared to men .
Men have to take care of women all the time .
WOMEN MUST STAY HOME Women should not have a life outside the family .
Education can be provided to them , but not to compete with men in public .
NO VOTING RIGHTS FOR WOMEN UNDER SHARIA Qazi had said once that when JI comes to power in Pakistan , he will abolish the voting rights of women and minorities .
Only the Muslim men can participate in voting or standing for elections .
When I asked the proof from Hadiths , he had quoted many Hadiths in support of that .
I asked him why is it that it is never talked about openly in the public by the Jamaat ?
Qazi had said that the hints are all over the place .
But JI did not make it a big issue since the women who currently have the voting rights may vote against JI in the elections if such a thing is said openly .
NON MUSLIMS IN MUSLIM COUNTRIES MUST PAY JIZYA Q :
That brings us to the question of minorities .
Will they have to pay Jizya tax ?
A : Yes .
They have to pay the tax .
As explained by Qazi Ahmed , the idea of Jizya is not protection money .
But it is a monetary force on the non-Muslim to convert to Islam .
Once the Jamaat comes to power , the minorities will be induced ( forced ) to become Muslims either by monetary or psychological factors .
ALL INDIAN HINDUS WILL BE CONVERTED INTO ISLAM JI is already equating India with Hindus so that the Hindus of Pakistan will be forced to become Muslims .
This was a very successful strategy during the Babri Masjid riots .
JI was actively involved in destroying the Hindu temples in Punjab and Sindh .
We ordered the destruction of the Hindu family property too .
But our main aim was to destroy the Hindu temples .
We wrote in the JI pamphlets that destroying each pagan temple makes a Muslim move closer to the heaven of Allah .
We used the Hadiths in all the pamphlets .
Babar destroyed the Ram temple in Ayodhya because he was a true believer .
The same way , every Muslim should take it upon himself to destroy the Hindu temples in Pakistan .
O! ur idea was to encourage the Muslims of India also to destroy the Hindu temples in India .
But this was not met with much success since the Hindu police in India started attacking the Muslims who were doing Allah 's duty .
Q : What kind of government does JI envisage for Pakistan ?
A : It will be the Sharia government .
Sharia will be made our constitution so that the eminent Muslim scholars who had completed the schooling in Madrasas will be appointed as the Judges in every court .
Qazi wanted to make the presidium on the same model as the Khalifa .
Presently our idea is that the entire top leadership of JI as well as all three military Generals will be part of the presidium for which the Qazi will be the Khalifa .
OUR MOTTO IS CONSTANT JIHAD
Our motto is " Constant Jihad " .
The idea is to keep Pakistan in a constant state of Jihad all the time .
Qazi's vision is that Pakistan will be !
the centre of the new Islamic Empire that stretches from Burma to Afghanistan and from Srilanka to Tajikistan including Kashmir Towards that end , the Jamaat will use all tactics from terrorism in the kafir - controlled areas to negotiations in the Muslim controlled areas .
Already the Jamaat leaders of Bangladesh and Jamaat leaders of India have accepted the primacy of Pakistani leadership in this regard .
SRI LANKA AND BURMA WILL BE PRESSURIZED TO CONVERT TO ISLAM Q : What about Srilanka and Burma ?
A : Both are Buddhist nations .
For that matter even Baluchistan and Afghanistan were Buddhist once while Sindh and Punjab were Hindu earlier .
Buddhists are generally weaker in matters of faith .
Hence we hope they will become Muslim with a little pressure .
But that will happen only after Jamaat conquers first Pakistan and then India .
Q : What are the plans for India ?
It looks like the entire India policy of the Jamaat revolves around Kashmir .
A : Yes that is true .
But that is for a very good reason .
See Kashmir is like a keystone that sits on top of the arch .
It is true that the arch holds the entire weight of the keystone .
But if you remove the keystone , then the whole arch falls down .
That is why it is called the keystone .
Kashmir is the keystone for India .
Once you remove that , then India can no longer be secular and it will not be a united country either .
Once Kashmir is taken out , these militancy movements will break India by asking the similar freedom for Nagaland , Kerala , Mizoram , Meghalaya , Manipur , Assam , Jharkand , Tamil Nadu , West Bengal and Khalistan .
INDIA WILL BE MADE A 100 % MUSLIM NATION Q : Coming back to the same point , if India was to become many countries , how do you deal with the individual Hindu States ?
They may even become big enemies of Pakistan .
Or they may again re-group to challenge Pakistan .
A : Given the differences between the nationalities in India , the options for Pakistan are endless .
Qazi's vision is to make the entire India a 100 % Muslim Nation .
A United India , where Hindus are majority is an impediment to that .
Like Prophet Mohammad ( PBUH ) made Muslims out of pagans of Arabia , Qazi also wants to make Muslims out of the pagans of India .
Q : This is a great vision since this was not even possible for the Muslim dynasties and Moguls who ruled India for the last 700 years .
A : True .
That is because they had never really established the Muslim Empire .
Though the Kings were Muslims , they had entertained the Hindus in positions of power .
When you make an unequivocal statement that only Muslims are voters and declare that India is an Islamic Republic , then automatically the people will become Muslims .
Little bit of terror had to be applied to the heart of Hindus and Christians .
I will give you a best example .
The portions which now constitute Pakistan had 25 % Hindu population before Independence .
TERRORIZATION IS THE BEST CONVERSION TOOL After Independence , a lot of Hindus migrated to India .
Yet after the migration , the Pakistani Hindu population was 15 % .
Do you know what is the percentage now ?
It is less than 1 % .
How was this made possible ?
How did the Hindus convert to Islam in a short span of 20 years whereas for 700 years they had never converted to Islam ?
That is purely because of the terror of the Partition .
That terror forced the Hindus who remained in Pakistan to become Muslims .
Pure and simple .
JI used similar techniques in Punjab and Sindh .
Each time a riot breaks out in India , we had used that pretext to strike terror among the Hindus , Christians and Ahmaddiahs .
The similar terror will be at the heart of every non-Muslim , both Hindu as well as Christian , in the coming years in the entire of India .
PRPOHET SUCCEEDED WITH TERROR SO CAN WE Qazi is an analytical genius who knows every strategy that was used by Prophet Mohammad ( PBUH ) and which will be and should be used in India to achieve the total submission to Allah .
Q : Do you envision a possibility that when Kashmir becomes part of Pakistan , there could be large - scale riots in India against Indian Muslims ?
Hence unwittingly Kashmir could lead to more deaths of Indian Muslims and damage Islamic Ummah .
ANY MUSLIM ASSOCIATING WITH A POLYTHEIST BECOMES A POLYTHEIST A : Yes that is a possibility .
But our ideology is based on Quran and Hadiths .
Prophet Mohammad ( PBUH ) in numerous Hadiths and Allah in Quran had said that any Muslim who associates with a polytheist is a polytheist .
Muslims cannot be friendly with a non-Muslim .
This includes the Christians , Jews and Hindus .
Also Mohammad ( PBUH ) says that even if the Muslim ruler is not good , the Muslims stay with the ruler rather than go out to a non-Muslim country .
Hadiths and Quran are very explicit regarding this .
All the Muslims who did not migrate to Pakistan during Partition are in essence Hindus .
They may think that they are Muslims .
But not before Allah .
They are as self - deluded as the Ahmaddiahs who think they are Muslims when everyone knows that they are not Muslims .
Hence the Muslims of India who had decided to stay in India during Partition are not Muslims and their progeny are not Muslim ( since they did not migrate to Muslim lands ) .
Another thing that I noticed in my journeys in India is that the Hindu farmers generally offer their entire harvest to their gods at the end of their harvesting season .
This makes the entire crop as haram for Muslims .
Yet these so - called Muslims of India are forced to eat this food which was already offered to some other God other than Allah .
This is explicitly forbidden in Quran .
MUSLIMS GOING TO NON MUSLIM COUNTRIES TO SETTLE DOWN ARE KAFIRS
And this is one of the serious problems of living in non-Muslim countries .
Prophet Mohammad ( PBUH ) knew such things ; that is why he ordered Muslims not to live in non-Muslim areas .
Yet knowingly these so - called Muslims live in India .
AGAIN ALL THE MUSLIMS WHO MIGRATE TO OTHER NON MUSLIM COUNTRIES AND US ARE NON MUSLIMS .
Only the Muslims who intend to come back are Muslims not the ones who decide to stay in such countries .
Hence we do not care if such Indian Muslims die in the riots .
But due to strategy reasons we do have excellent relations with these Muslims .
All the Muslims who work for Pakistan and for the glory of Ummah are real Muslims .
They are our front line troops in non-Muslim countries .
Hence we have to distribute the arms and ammunitions to these real Muslims in case riots come to their door .
The Kashmiri Muslims are pure Muslims who are toiling under the yoke of Hindu rule .
They are victimized by the international conspiracy to keep them under the Hindu rule .
That issue is part of the incomplete Partition , whereas the Indian Muslims have accepted Partition and stayed on in India knowingly .
JAMAT WILL BRING SLAVERY BACK TO PAKISTAN Arabians own slaves .
Though Allah says that the slaves should be treated in a nice manner , he did not advocate the abolition of slavery .
If slavery is bad as considered in today 's world , Allah certainly would have said that slavery is wrong .
Prophet Mohammad ( PBUH ) also said that the slaves should be treated in a good manner and the slaves should be released often .
But if there is no slavery , how can anyone release slaves ?
Hence the re-introduction of slavery in Pakistan is one of the future plans of the Jamaat .
ALL CAPTURED HINDUS WILL BE MADE SLAVES
All the captured Hindu Indians and Srilankans will be made slaves to work for Pakistani Muslims .
Every God-abiding Pakistani Muslim will get slaves once we conquer India .
All the slaves who embrace Islam will be set free .
Slavery is Islamic .
Jamaat is the only political party , which does not voice any opposition to the slavery in Pakistan .
We went around all over Arabia .
We were surprised to know that there are some Hindus in Yemen .
These ancient Yemeni Hindus are not Indians .
In my opinion , these Hindus are traders from India in the ancient times .
I was also surprised to know that they have a Shiva temple in Yemen .
Qazi was very unhappy over this .
When he talked to the Yemen leaders , he broached this subject .
But the Yemeni leaders refused Qazi 's suggestion of forced conversion of these people to Islam .
I do n't know why they refused .
I think it may be due to the large population of Hindus from India who work in Yemen and Arabia .
He disliked the current leadership of Arabia for this reason .
In his opinion , Arabia should not allow any non-Muslim into the holy lands of Arabia .
Arabia should be 100 % pure .
A large number of Hindus in Arabia is corrupting the Arabians .
Though they live as contractors , they have the potential to corrupt the minds of the Arabians .
HINDU TEMPLES POLLUTE MUSLIM LANDS
One such thing is the presence of Arabians in the Qatar Hindu temple .
First the king allowed the Hindus to build a temple and church in the holy lands , thereby polluting the Holy Land .
Second is that even a member of the Royal family visited that temple to inaugurate that temple .
To the horror of Qazi , he had learnt that one of the powerful members of the Qatar Royal family is a devotee of a god called Aayappan .
This news resolved Qazi to fight the force of the devil thousand fold .
Q : Such things happen in Pakistan today .
I mean a friend of mine goes to a Hindu temple .
Another friend goes to church meetings .
A : Yes .
One of Qazi 's relatives wanted to become a Hindu .
He did not have a child for many years and it seems he had prayed to a Hindu God and got the child .
Hence he felt thankful to that god and wanted to become a Hindu .
Qazi got to know of this and called him and threatened him with dire consequences .
That relative did not become a Hindu .
But that incident made Qazi read more about apostasy .
PUNISHMENT FOR APOSTASY IS DEATH Quran and Hadith clearly say the punishment for abandonment of Islam is death .
Since Sharia is not the law in Pakistan , and the current Pakistani Constitution grants the right to change religion , it is legally correct to declare oneself as Hindu or Christian .
But once the JI takes over the government , it will make Sharia as the Constitution .
Then Pakistan will also legally execute any person who leaves Islam and joins Ahmaddiah , Christianity or Hinduism the same way Iran and Taliban treats its apostates .
He also opined that the presence of the Hindu temples in Pakistan is the root cause of the problem and hence we want to destroy all the Hindu temples and Churches in Pakistan .
Q : This brings us into another area .
Right now the Internet is becoming widespread .
Even Saudi Arabia is connected with the outside world .
Destroying the temples may be good , but how can we insulate the Pakistani and Muslim people against the corrupting knowledge totally ?
A : JI had taken a principled stand on the matter of science and religion .
Religion is far superior to science .
ALL THE WORLD�S KNOWLEDGE IS IN QURAN AND HADITHS
Whatever man needs to know is in the Quran and Hadiths .
Knowing more will create problems like the Atom bomb and Television .
MUSIC TV AND PHOTOGRAPHY ARE SATANIC AND HARAM Quran and Hadiths are explicit in denouncing pictures .
Yet the lure of Satan in the form of photography and television is eating our lives .
Music previously was confined only to the vocal singing .
Now science and technology made the music widespread at a cheaper price .
These are the lures of Satan .
We have to be on guard against these harami things .
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ARE BAD FOR CIVILIZATION
Hence , more science and technology is bad for the civilization .
I had completed civil engineering .
Hence I am privy to scientific knowledge .
I can tell you how corrupting that is .
It even makes you question the glorious Quran .
EARTH IS FLAT
There are many Hadiths , which say that the earth is flat .
But any science will tell you the earth is a sphere .
But you can use the same science like the relativity theory to prove that the earth is flat .
It is the same case with evolution .
But the point being that doubt is sown in the minds of the people on the validity of the Quran as the word of God .
More and more we work hard to prove the Quran 's scientific correctness , more and more people will get apprehensive of the truth of the Quran .
This is an abomination .
WHEN ISLAM TALKS OF GET EDUCATED IT MEANS QURANIC EDUCATION
This is why when we talk of education , we talk of religious education and not scientific education .
It is true that science grew after the Prophet 's revolution in Arabia .
That was the start of science .
Now each and every science is filled with anti-god stuff .
If you want to become a doctor , you have to read evolution .
If you have to read any engineering , you have to believe in the billions of years old universe theory which effectively says that human beings came to the world only just one or two million years back .
Q : But we still need the arms and knowledge of the Western world , which believes in science .
And again you had referred to television as evil .
If we abolish photography how can we have passports or identification cards ?
A : Yes .
That is strategic .
With the help of Allah , we will be given oil for them to run their cars and we will have arms in that place .
We will use their arms to destroy them in the course of time .
PHOTOGRAPHY WILL BE BANNED UNDER JI As far as photos are concerned , they will be banned as it was done in Afghanistan under Taliban .
If there is no need for people to go out of Pakistan , where is the need for the passports ?
For those who have to travel to other countries like the leaders of the revolution , they only will be given the passport with photos .
For that , we will allow limited photography licensed only to the government .
And the biggest corruption in today 's Pakistan is Indian satellite TV and Indian cinemas and Indian songs .
We have to abolish these too .
ARABIC WILL BE MADE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE OF PAKISTAN Q : Currently we have a lot of opposition from Mohajirs regarding reservations .
What kind of reservation policy will the JI will have in Pakistan ?
A : We approach that problem as the problem of language .
Urdu-speaking Muslims and Sindhi- speaking Muslims are fighting now .
We plan to abolish all the regional languages like Pashto , Sindhi , Baluchi , Urdu , Punjabi and Brahvi .
We want all the people of Pakistan to speak Arabic which is our divine language .
This will make everyone equal before everyone else and there would not be any need for language or region based reservations .
We also hope that this will make the Quran and Hadiths easier to understand and will make the people follow the Quran and Hadiths to the letter .
Q : There could be language riots .
One such language riot resulted in Bangladesh .
A : Bangladesh was not a result of language riot .
The very idea that they are Muslims will bring the Bangladeshis to Arabic .
We already fund heavily the Arabic language courses all over India , Bangladesh and Pakistan .
From Morocco to Iraq speaks in Arabic , I do n't see any reason why from Morocco to Burma we will not bring Arabic to the people .
Even Bangladesh will start speaking in Arabic .
That time there wo n't be any Bangladesh where the country name itself has the name of the language .
Yes .
Right now our aim is just for reunification without touching on the language issue of Bengali .
JI of Bangladesh is working towards this aim .
Q : The secular journalists of Pakistan oppose the JI .
For example the Dawn and News are very critical of the JI .
How do you see their role in the future ?
A : Ardheshir Cowasjee is able to work only because of the present Constitution of Pakistan .
When Sharia becomes the Constitution , he cannot even approach the court , as he is a kafir .
We see secular journalists as our main enemy in the current struggle to reach power .
These secular journalists are digging our statements we made during the pre-Independence days and trying to beat us .
Of course we opposed the creation of Pakistan during the British times .
But that was a different Jamaat .
Our history starts with Independence .
SECULARS ARE KAFIRS
Secular journalists are not Muslims even though some of them are carrying Muslim names .
Let them come to us and let us ask questions on the Quran and Hadiths .
We will prove each and every thing we say is from Quran and Hadiths .
Let them prove what we say as wrong from the Quranic angle .
Then we will accept them .
But they cannot .
They cannot match us in any debate concerning the Quran and Hadiths .
We can comprehensively prove that they are indeed non-Muslims .!
They are like Quadianis who say that the Muslim need not take up Jihad as an obligation .
That is pure nonsense .
Q : Thanks for your time .
A : May Allah 's blessings be with you .

the root of the problem lies in islamic intolerance of other cultures and civilization to a mohemmedan islam stands first and all other identities are secondary . truth be told it is not only palestine see the problems in kashmir , checnya phillipnes , nigeria , china and thailand .
even if palestine is handed back to the mohammedans they will not stop their goal is world domination their philosophy is murder , pillage , and plunder what more can you expect when their satanic prophets philosophy is i was made victorious by terror the mohammedans have lot to learn to be civilised and tolerant of others cultures and religions

A few scribes ( Ulema ) keep the masses of illiterates and uneducated stupid while the modern middle class is too small and to weak .
the government usually works with the ulema in power to stay in power .
If there are problems , and there are of course many problems such as illiteracy and unemployment , they only need to blame the west and all stupid people believe them .
So there is little hope for democracy and progress .

I think deep down these Pakis * hate themselves for the pathetic weakness of their ancestors who were conquered by the Arabs and subsequently rolled over to the conqueror to whom they grovel five times a day with their butts in the air like submissive bitches .
The continued existence of non-Muslim India is a constant reminder of their shame .
Only by bringing non-Muslim India down to their level can they feel less bad about themselves and their wretched existence as conquered bitches of the Arabs .

An old sanskrit adage says " Vinaasha Kale vipareeta buddhihi " meaning -
As times of destruction approch the mind works in reverse .
This is precisely what is happening with muslims .
History is replete with such incidents viz .
Napolean .
Hitler and the British Empire .
Right now the British mind is also working in reverse and the muslims have taken grip of this tiny nation .
Hope they will wake up before any major damage is done .

The root cause of the problem is " islam " .
The pakistanis were hindus who converted to islam by 500 years of islamic rule on the indian subcontinent mostly by force .
As the virus of islam spreads we have with it all the other illeffects .
The Parsees ( Zoroastrians ) who have the highest population in india compared to iran where the religion existed before islam have assimilated in india .
The muslims as is with islam will not assimilate into any other religion .
they also practice a kind of getto culture as islam forbids friendship wit non-believers .
http://voiceofdharma.org/books/mssmi/
http://www.voiceofdharma.com/books/tlmr/index.htm
This sums up what Islam is all about .
No matter who is incharge it will be ISLAM all the way .
Paki , Iran , Saudi are the real axis of evil and till they are strong enough peace on earth will be distant .

Ha ha ha .... "
NO , NO , NO !!!!!
Level Mecca and Medina !
Just use conventional weapons .
Then let cameras in so that Muslims the world over will be able to SEE that the Grand Mosque and the birthplace of Muhammad have been lost to history !
Invite them to pray five times a day toward a hole in the ground .
If the House of Saud wants to spend its oil revenue rebuilding Mecca and Medina , that 's their prerogative .
If we use nuclear weapons on Mecca , no one will be able to see the results and it will only bring on the conspiracy theorists .
Bomb the place , along with the nearest airports , and then let the Muslims see that Allah could n't save their stupid cities .
The hajj will be greatly reduced , if not eliminated , because there will be no air travel .
People will have to drive most of the way .
There will be no hotels , so there will be no place for people to stay .
So maybe the hajj will be stopped for at least ten years .
It will cease to be a revenue source for Saudis .

These crazy Pakis plan to have the Taliban do their dirty work for them , which will never happen because the US will wipe out the Taliban and the rest of Al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan just like we did in Iraq .
We will not allow slavery and we will not allow them to take the vote away from women .
We will also not allow another illiterate dictator like Khomeini to take power , which is what these sickos obviously want since they said they want madrassa - educated judges to rule the country and no madrassa graduate is capable of finding his ass with two hands or has the work ethic to accomplish anything but rape little boys .
It 's just a matter of moving south , and if Kashmir gets crazy again we 'll step in there too .
The Indians will rise up and take it back just like the Israelis did their holy land .
Screw the Muslims .
Everywhere Perv
Mo took a piss is ' sacred ground ' to them , which is the height of demopathic lack of regard for religion and lack of comprehension of the term ' sacred . '
Islam 's psyochpathic lack of regard for human life and other people will be its undoing .
And once the rest of the world sees what Muslims really want , like these titclowns , it wo n't tolerate Islam in the free world either .

It is nice to see a true Muslim practising Islam as it was meant to be practised .
This guy is a true muslim !
I deal with namby - pamby compromised Muslims that are so chock full of Teqiyya and abrogated verses that you can't even recognize their religion to be what it is , that is what is depicted here .
A guy like this can really bring to light many of the unsolvable problems with Islam .
After all , there are good Muslims -- but no good Islam .
My vote will send them all back to the shitholes from whence the come before they turn this place into a shithole .

Islam is a fucking pest and a virus .
Nuke all muslim countries .
I do n't give a damn if those countries will become impossible to live in for thousands of years due to radiation .
As long as islam and muslims are stamped out 100 % we would be free of this sickness forever .
So fuck islam to hell .

Islam
Does not have any statements which justify violence in the name of religion ..
But for spreading the message of islam .
+[ 2:136 ] Say ( O Muslims ) :
We believe in Allah and that which is revealed to us and that which was revealed to Abraham , and Ishmael , and Isaac , and Jacob , and the tribes , and that which Moses and Jesus received , and that which the prophets received from their Lord .
We make no distinction between any of them , and to Him we have surrendered .+++ [ 42:36 -38 ]
So whatever thing you are given , that is only a provision of this world 's life , and what is with Allah is better and more lasting for those who believe and rely on their Lord , and those who shun the great sins and indecencies , and whenever they are angry they forgive , and those who respond to their Lord and keep up prayer , and their rule is to take counsel among themselves , and who spend out of what We have given them .++
Over time , however , as discrimination and persecution resulted to Muslims and the influence of Islam deccreased as the percentage of Muslims in the society forceibily converted or exterminated , the Islamic world declined "
That 's happening in North Africa too !
Even after the 2nd WW Turkey was established as a secular state by its conqurers .
Now go back in recent history and come to modern day .
You will find that the Muslim world has been under oppression by the western governments under the cover of modernization and secular states .
Hitler never slaughtered jews in the name of christianity .
Hitler was championing the cause of germans as a superior race which goes against christianity which declares God loves everyone .
Then did muslims invade countries to get fuel !
did muslims occupy some ones country in pretext that that it was the gods chosen Land !
Yes Hitler didnt kill jews in the name of christianity !
he was mentally ill !!.
If Hitler waz mentally ill why not you apply the same rule for those Zionist backed " Muslim " terrorists who killed innocent people ?

You said " Yes Hitler didnt kill jews in the name of christianity !
he was mentally ill !!.
If Hitler waz mentally ill why not you apply the same rule for those Zionist backed " Muslim " terrorists who killed innocent people ?
" Muslim terrorists are not zionist backed .
They are backed by Al Qaida and Hamas .
Also Hitler could not justify his crimes by quoting Jesus and the Gospel .
Muslims can justify their crimes by quoting quran and hadith .
Proof - Sura ( 8:12 ) - " I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve .
Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them " Sura ( 9:5 ) - " So when the sacred months have passed away , then slay the idolaters wherever you find them , and take them captives and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush , then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor - rate , leave their way free to them .
" Muslim ( 1:33 ) - the Messenger of Allah said : I have been commanded to fight against people till they testify that there is no god but Allah , that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah "
That is the difference between crimes committed by hitler and thos committed by muslim terrorists .
Muslim terrorists are inspired by quran , hadith and the example of their prophet muhamed .

As one person noted , not one islamist has replied to this article ?
How can they ?
This is a muslim leader .
As for CAIR : the founder of CAIR admitted that their purpose in the US is to be the dominant religion .
Khalifs in mosques all around the US have been teaching violence but when cornered they will give another story !
If Israel bombs Iran 's nuke facilities , I hope they send a few in this guy 's direction .

Who was Jesus Christ ?
Did he call him self a Christian .
What religion did he profess while he was alive in this world ?
What was his message .
Why did the rulers want Jesus Christ dead ?
The Christians and Muslims believe that there will be a second coming of Jesus Christ .
What will be the purpose of his second coming ?
The first day of the Ubuntu Developer Summit began with roundtable sessions which focused on high - level planning for Hardy Heron , the next major release of the Ubuntu Linux distribution .
I attended the Hardy Heron desktop roundtable to get the inside scoop about the future of Ubuntu on the desktop .
The primary goal for the Hardy development cycle is to make existing features more usable and robust rather than adding a lot of new functionality .
This differs significantly from the Gutsy Gibbon development cycle which focused on delivering highly experimental features — like compositing by default — that improved the user experience at the expense of robustness in certain documented areas .
Stability and resilience are important for Hardy Heron because it is a long - term support release and will be supported on the desktop for three years .
The guts of Heron
The Compiz window manager , which adds sophisticated visual effects to the Ubuntu user interface , will be a big target for usability improvements .
Keyboard bindings and session management were noted as two areas where Compiz still needs some work .
The potential for better integrating Compiz effects with the Ubuntu look and feel was also briefly discussed .
PolicyKit integration is also another topic that is considered highly relevant for Hardy Heron .
PolicyKit is a new framework for secure privilege elevation .
When programs currently need to perform operations that require permissions higher than those of a regular user , privileges for the entire program must be elevated — typically with a graphical sudo utility .
PolicyKit will instead require developers to isolate functionality that requires higher privileges in individual non-graphical utilities and services that will be accessed by programs through a D - Bus interface .
This will also permit administrators to establish more nuanced controls over which users can perform certain tasks and the contexts in which those tasks are permitted .
Policy Kit will still use password prompts like gksudo , so the switch to Policy Kit will not significantly change the way that users are accustomed to interacting with Ubuntu .
PolicyKit is being developed by Red Hat and will be used with HAL in Fedora 8 .
Improving Tracker integration is another important goal for Hardy Heron .
Tracker is an indexing and search tool that is included by default in Ubuntu 7.10 .
The search tools that come with Tracker are currently very weak and will need a lot of refinement .
Another goal is to find a way to replace inotify , the kernel - level file monitoring component used by Tracker .
Developers have expressed concerns that inotify is too resource - and i/o- intensive .
Developers also hope to use Tracker for system - wide search functionality , replacing the antiquated updatedb mechanism .
Several contributors have also suggested various ways that Ubuntu can better use Tracker 's advanced metadata storage capabilities .
For instance , Robert Carr is working on developing a userspace filesystem with FUSE that will integrate with Tracker and make it possible for users to access their files by using tags , eliminating the need to descend through complex directory structures .
Odds and ends
A complete visual refresh is also planned , including a completely new icon theme that will use more SVG and integrate better with the Tango icons used by GNOME and other upstream projects .
Another topic that was very briefly discussed was the possibility of creating a GTK theme that takes advantage of compositing functionality , something that probably wo n't happen within the Hardy development cycle .
The visual refresh plans are extensive , and were discussed in greater detail during the Hardy theming spec session .
A few other usability issues were discussed as well , like finding more practical ways of enabling users to install content that can't legally be distributed in certain countries .
The new codec installation tools in Ubuntu 7.10 have improved the situation considerably , but there are still holes .
Most of the goals for Hardy Heron look very promising and feasible .
Shifting away from the emphasis on new features in order to improve reliability is a good way to shore up some of the biggest gaps so that the long - term support release is very strong .
As major hardware vendors begin to consider joining Dell in offering Linux preinstallation , the availability of a robust release with three years of support will make Ubuntu much more tempting for these companies .
“ They ’re like Ralph Nader without the politics , ” said Victor Navasky , former publisher and editor of The Nation .
“ So it ’s amusing that what they do comes across in conventional , capitalist terms  helping people who want to spend their money to spend it and get value for it , and pushing corporations to perform better . ”
Mr. Guest sees no incongruity in any of this .
“ We have to think and act like a business , ” he said , seeing readers as the shareholders .
That meant , among other things , more aggressive placement of the magazine in checkout aisles and newsstands , and buying a long list of sponsored search terms on Google and Yahoo .
Fierce competition for terms like “ S.U.V. ” puts those words out of Consumer Reports ’ price range , but there is substantially less clamor for the rights to , say , “ toaster . ”
Subscriptions to the magazine still produce the vast majority of Consumers Union ’s revenue : the dead - tree version of Consumer Reports has a paid circulation of 4.5 million , more than all but a handful of American magazines .
There is relatively little overlap between the print and Web subscribers  about 600,000  which allows the magazine to reach two large , distinct audiences .
More than 60 percent of the print magazine ’s readers are men , but the Web site , where readers are split almost evenly by sex , has helped Consumer Reports draw more women .
Online readers average 50 years old , a decade younger than print readers , and are better off financially .
A reader of the printed magazine might be “ someone who generally wants to be a well - informed consumer , ” said Giselle Benatar , editor in chief of online media .
“ But on the Web site , we ’re attracting very transaction - minded consumers .
They are shoppers .
They ’re looking for a product , they want ratings , they want recommendations , and they want it now , not once a month . ”

The site has been steadily built up , with additions like , this year , crash test videos  front and side impact  on nearly every vehicle sold in the United States .
One of the site ’s primary attractions is its deep well of product ratings  not only more data on some products than will fit in the magazine , but also ratings published months or years ago .
It can also produce reviews of new products like the iPhone much faster than the magazine , as well as safety warnings on things like lead paint in toys , which are always available on the free portion of the site .
Home » forums » LtU Forum Quantifying the Performance of Garbage Collection vs. Explicit Memory Management
I think the real culprit behind the " poor performance " of GC languages is demonstrated in Quantifying the Performance of Garbage Collection vs. Explicit Memory Management , by Matthew Hertz and Emery D. Berger : Garbage collection yields numerous software engineering benefits , but its quantitative impact on performance remains elusive .
One can measure the cost of conservative garbage collection relative to explicit memory management in C / C++ programs by linking in an appropriate collector .
This kind of direct comparison is not possible for languages designed for garbage collection ( e.g. , Java ) , because programs in these languages naturally do not contain calls to free .
Thus , the actual gap between the time and space performance of explicit memory management and precise , copying garbage collection remains unknown .
We take the first steps towards quantifying the performance of precise garbage collection versus explicit memory management .
We present a novel experimental methodology that lets us treat unaltered Java programs as if they used explicit memory management .
Our system generates exact object reachability information by processing heap traces with the Merlin algorithm [ 34 , 35 ] .
It then re-executes the program , invoking free on objects just before they become unreachable .
Since this point is the latest that a programmer could explicitly free objects , our approach conservatively approximates explicit memory management .
By executing inside an architecturally - detailed simulator , this â€œoracularâ€ memory manager eliminates the effects of trace processing while measuring the costs of calling malloc and free .
We compare explicit memory management to both copying and non-copying garbage collectors across a range of benchmarks , and include real ( non-simulated ) runs that validate our results .
These results quantify the time - space tradeoff of garbage collection : with five times as much memory , an Appel - style generational garbage collector with a non-copying mature space matches the performance of explicit memory management .
With only three times as much memory , it runs on average 17 % slower than explicit memory management .
However , with only twice as much memory , garbage collection
degrades performance by nearly 70 % .
When physical memory is scarce , paging causes garbage collection to run an order of magnitude slower than explicit memory management .
Overall , generational collectors can add up to 50 % space overhead and 5 - 10 % runtime overheads if we ignore virtual memory .
Very reasonable given the software engineering benefits .
However , factoring in virtual memory with its attendant faulting paints a very different picture in section 5.2 :
These graphs show that , for reasonable ranges of available memory ( but not enough to hold the entire application ) , both explicit memory managers substantially outperform all of the garbage collectors .
For instance , pseudoJBB running with 63MB of available memory and the Lea allocator completes in 25 seconds .
With the same amount of available memory and using GenMS , it takes more than ten times longer to complete ( 255 seconds ) .
We see similar trends across the benchmark suite .
The most pronounced case is javac : at 36MB with the Lea allocator , total execution time is 14 seconds , while with GenMS , total execution time is 211 seconds , over a 15 - fold increase .
The culprit here is garbage collection activity , which visits far more pages than the application itself [ 60 ]
Considering the prevalence of virtual memory , this poses a significant problem for garbage collected languages , server - side systems in particular .
LTU has covered garbage collectors that co-operate with virtual memory managers before by the same authors .

SAN FRANCISCO — Along parts of the Arctic Ocean floor , currents have driven mud into huge piles , with some " mud waves " nearly 100 feet across .
Around the world , strong currents can produce these features , piling up sediments from the ocean floor to create a wavy surface , but researchers had thought the Arctic was too calm to produce the mud waves .
The Arctic mud waves were discovered on recent expeditions to map the ocean bottom with sonar , which can view layers of sediment up to 1,000 feet below ground .
The expeditions were looking mainly for signs of the ancient ice sheets that once covered the Arctic and found evidence of massive scrapes in the ocean bottom about half a mile ( 1 kilometer ) deep .
Sonar images clearly showed these grooves running in parallel , plus boulders and other debris were revealed , left by the giant ice sheets .
In the continental shelf north of Greenland , sonar found deep scours that were undoubtedly left by ancient ice , the scientists said .
" It shows very , very clearly iceberg scours , " said expedition scientist Martin Jakobsson of Stockholm University in Sweden .
The mud waves , however , were an unexpected surprise .
The scientists are n't sure what formed them .
" The mud waves could be caused by tidal fluctuations , " said expedition scientist Leonard Polyak of Ohio State University .
" But that ’s really just speculation at this point . "

The ' Diebold Whistleblower ' Sees His Charges Reduced to a Misdemeanor , But Unlike Republicans Who Have Committed Far More Serious Crimes , Heller Continues to Pay
Reflections on Selective Criminal Punishment in Bush 's America ...
Steve Heller Byon 12/2/2007 , 5:57 pm PT
Guest Blogged by Stephen Heller
I am no longer a felon .
In brief , I became known to some as the " Diebold Whistleblower " when , in January of 2004 , I stole and exposed legal documents [ PDF ] proving that Diebold Election Systems , Inc. was using and planned to continue using illegal , uncertified software in their California voting machines .
( By the way , Diebold recently changed its name to Premier Election Solutions , but do n't let that fool you ; it 's still the same bunch of idiots . )
Details about my case can be found here and here [ PDF ] .
The documents I stole were covered under attorney - client privilege , so my theft was a serious crime .
In February of 2006 I was charged with three felonies .
On November 20 , 2006 , I plead guilty to one felony count of unauthorized access to a computer , and in exchange for my guilty plea and a restitution payment of $ 10,000 to the law firm from which I stole the documents , the law firm promised they would n't bring a civil suit against me , and I was put on felony probation instead of being sent to jail .
The term of probation was to be at least one year , and as much as three years .
Now , one year after my guilty plea , because I 've stayed out of trouble and because I 'm a first offender , the judge has reduced my felony to a misdemeanor .
Sometime in 2008 , my lawyers will petition the court to have my misdemeanor expunged .
The bad part is that the most troublesome aspect of my probation is still in force .
Before I can accept a job at which I would use a computer networked to one or more other computers ( basically any job for which I 'd be qualified ) , any potential employer must write to the judge in my case , tell him that they know about my conviction and that they still want to hire me , and then we have to wait until the judge responds with a " yes " or a " no " before I can accept the job and start work ( and then only if the judge says " yes " ) .
So as you can see , employers will be falling all over themselves to hire me .
Yeah , right .
Meanwhile , my wife ( an actor , filmmaker and writer ) certainly has n't lost her sense of humor .
She had been calling me Felonious Punk , but now that I 'm no longer a felon , she 's switched to Mister Meanor .
Ain't it great being married to a comedy writer ?
To be clear , breaking attorney - client privilege is a very serious crime , and I accept responsibility for what I did .
I 'm still being punished for it , and so far the punishment has cost my wife and me over $ 210,000 - and counting .
$ 210,000 is an enormous amount of money to us .
My wife and I have paid and are continuing to pay a very high price for my crime .
But , as we 're not Republicans , we might have expected that .
Which got me thinking about other crimes in America that have recently been committed or alleged , and what 's happened to those involved .
Among the first of many , Lewis " Scooter " Libby comes to mind ...
*****
Libby lied to a grand jury and was convicted of obstruction of justice and perjury .
But he was n't punished and never will be .
His old pal , the twice un-elected President , commuted his sentence , and the costs of his legal defense have been covered by his rich Republican friends .
In my case , the punishment for my crime has nearly bankrupted my wife and me .
Okay ; I did the crime and I accept responsibility for it .
But why does Scooter get to walk away from his crime without a scratch ?
Because IOKIYAR .
And why did Ol ' Scoot lie to the grand jury and obstruct justice ?
To protect his bosses in the White House .
But what could Dear Leader and his Minions have done that they would need protection ?
Why , nothing more than expose an undercover C.I.A. agent .
Outing a C.I.A. agent has been called treason by many , including Dear Leader 's father .
Pretty serious crime , outing a C.I.A. agent , especially an agent whose specialty was nuclear proliferation , one of the most serious threats facing our nation and the world .
So Scooter 's obstruction of justice protected people who did something George H.W. Bush described as treasonous .
That 's a very serious crime , at least as serious as violating attorney - client privilege , do n't you think ?
But no punishment for Scooter Libby , because IOKIYAR .
Alberto " Abu Ghraib " Gonzales has hired a high - priced criminal defense attorney , he 's refused to answer questions from the U.S. Inspector General , and there is now a defense fund for him .
Rumor has it that the Inspector General might recommend criminal prosecution for alleged witness tampering and lying under oath during testimony to congress .
It wo n't happen .
Abu Gonzales will never be brought up on charges , and even if he is , Bush will muzzle any subpoenaed witnesses from his " administration " with claims of executive privilege , and order all documents that could prove Gonzales ' guilt be classified as a matter of national security .
And even if Abu Gonzales was charged , tried and convicted ( Satan would have to buy ice skates ) , Bush would pardon him in seconds .
He 'll never be held accountable for his crimes , because IOKIYAR .
In the meantime , Abu makes a nifty $ 40,000 for giving a speech in Florida .
This , while my wife and I struggle to pay my health insurance and our mortgage , and the " gotta write to the judge and get his permission before I can accept a job " provision of my probation has thus far prevented me from obtaining any employment .
But my wife and I are n't Republicans , so we deserve it .
Right ?
*****
Speaking of Abu Gonzales , what about torture ?
Torture is a pretty horrible crime , one of the worst .
But our new Attorney General said he does n't know if water boarding is torture or not .
Attorney General Mukasey really ought to do some reading .
According to Jurist Legal News and Research , " During the U.S. - Philippine War ( 1899 - 1902 ) , five Army officers … were convicted by courts - martial for employing the ' water cure ' in interrogating Philippine prisoners . [ snip ]
Army juries rejected the defense of ' military necessity , ' recognizing the water cure for what it is .
The Army 's Judge Advocate General … derisively noted , ' the resort to torture is attempted to be justified …as the habitual method of obtaining information from individual insurgents . ' " [ emphasis added ]
Sound familiar ?
In 1922 , the Mississippi Supreme Court , in the case White v. State , 182 , 91 So. 903 , 904 ( Miss. 1922 ) reversed the murder conviction of a young black man who had allegedly killed a white man because the defendant 's confession was obtained by using the " water cure . "
Wrote the court :
The " water cure " appears to have consisted of pouring water from a dipper into the nose of appellant , so as to strangle him , thus causing pain and horror , for the purpose of forcing a confession .
Under these barbarous circumstances the appellant readily confessed ...
Think about that .
In 1922 , when the Klan was at the height of its power , the Mississippi Supreme Court threw out the confession of a black man accused of killing a white man because of the use of the " water cure , " which the Court called " barbarous . "
Yet George W. Bush insists that water boarding is n't torture , and Attorney General Mukasey can't find it within himself to disagree .
And more recently , " U.S. domestic courts describe ' the water cure ' and ' water torture ' as human rights violations , and a means to coerce confessions , in In Re Estate of Ferdinand E. Marcos ( D. Hawaii , 1995 ) and U.S. v. Lee ( 5th Cir. , 1984 ) .
Oh , I know , Bush says " We do n't torture . "
But he 's a liar .
He 's redefined what torture is with the help of Jay Bybee and John Yoo .
They claim that it 's only torture if it " would be equivalent to the loss of major organs or leading to imminent death . "
So if you use a prisoner as a human floor mop to clean his own urine , or rape him with a chemical light , or dislocate his arms , that 's not torture , according to Bush and Abu Gonzales .
A guy could redefine wife beating and insist that slapping his wife with an open hand is n't beating her , only punching her with a closed fist constitutes a " beating , " and therefore if he slaps her he 's not guilty of beating his wife .
It 's no different from what Bush has done in regards to torture .
Of course no judge would let a man get away with his " slapping is not beating " argument ; hitting one 's spouse is against the law , period .
But so is torture .
Bush 's decisions on torture are war crimes , they are " violation [s ] of statutory and treaty - based law . "
But he will get away with it because IOKIYAR .
A few low - level soldiers have been punished for it , as they should be .
And General Janis Karpinski has been punished .
But she has been made the scapegoat for the brass and the politicians .
I believe she shares in the responsibility for what happened , but the approval for torture and the orders to torture go way past her and all the way to the top .
Bush .
Cheney .
Rumsfeld .
Gonzales .
Cheney again .
Rumsfeld again .
When will these men be held accountable and punished for allowing , approving and even ordering torture ?
Never .
Because IOKIYAR .
*****
Even if you 're not necessarily a Republican , if you commit crimes for them or in their name , you 'll not be held accountable .
Like say , if you work for Blackwater , and you kill a bunch of people for no reason .
There might be an " investigation " ( so - called ) but do n't worry ; you 'll get immunity .
Because IOKIY ( working for ) AR .
*****
And what about what 's happened to the Justice Department ?
John McKay , the fired former U.S. attorney for Western Washington , said " there was a conspiracy to politicize the Justice Department . "
Richard Thornburg , former Attorney General under Regan and Bush 41 - Thornburg 's certainly no liberal or Democrat - flat - out declared that the Justice Department " targeted Democratic officeholders while looking the other way when presented with evidence of misconduct by Republican officials . "
Here 's just one example : in the case of the now - imprisoned former governor of Alabama Don Siegelman ( a Democrat naturally ) , we learn that the person who fingered Siegelman also had some pretty incriminating things to say about two Republicans --- Alabama 's former attorney general Jeff Sessions , now a U.S. Senator , and William Pryor Jr. , Sessions ' successor as attorney general and now a federal judge .
Yet " none of the Republicans whose campaigns he fingered were investigated in the case , let alone prosecuted . "
That 's because IOKIYAR .
Forty - four former state attorneys general , including both Republicans and Democrats , say the case " call[s ] into question the basic fairness that is the linchpin of our system of justice . "
" The prosecution may have been a political hit " involving Karl Rove , Bill Canary , a Republican operative and a Karl Rove protégé , Canary 's wife , the United States attorney in Montgomery , and Alice Martin , the United States attorney in Birmingham .
According to Scott Horton , writing for Harper 's , " It was recently disclosed that the two most senior career prosecutors assigned to the Siegelman case had concluded that the facts did not justify the pursuit of a criminal case against the former governor . "
More --- lots more --- on the Siegelman case can be found here .
But why take the time to read it ?
None of the people who allegedly committed crimes in regards to Siegelman 's prosecution will be held accountable or even investigated .
IOKIYAR .
*****
Let 's talk about the telecom companies and a little thing called the Fourth Amendment .
Big Telecom helped the Bush administration spy on Americans without a warrant .
They claim they were just doing their patriotic duty in helping the administration protect the country after the attacks of September 11th .
But they lie , because we now know that they began this unconstitutional violation of our rights six months BEFORE September 11 .
And now , some federal judges are granting search warrants without probable cause , letting the Feds spy on you and use your cell phones to track you .
Who will go to jail , or even just pay a fine for violating the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution ?
No one .
In fact , there is a strong push to give the telecoms retroactive immunity , despite the fact that legal scholars say it would set a dangerous precedent .
But after all , the telecoms helped a Republican administration violate the constitution , and IOKIY ( helping ) AR .
*****
And then there 's my favorite issue , Election Integrity .
We in the EI community continue to try to save our democratic republic , even in the face of the Bush junta 's criminal tactics .
Where to begin listing them ?
Bradley Schlozman brought indictments for voter registration fraud just days before an election , thereby violating the Justice Department 's own rules against filing election - related indictments close to an election .
He later was forced to admit he could have waited until after the election , but instead chose to time the indictments in an attempt to influence voters away from the presumed winner , a Democrat .
Schlozman has also " admitted that he'd once urged hiring certain prosecutors for his office based on their political affiliation .
It 's against civil service laws to do so . "
Emails have been obtained showing that the Republican National Committee engaged in voter suppression in five states .
This vote caging effort was spearheaded by Tim Griffin , former opposition researcher for the RNC , and was done in league with the White House and Bush / Cheney ' 04 campaign officials .
( Griffin was eventually promoted to the White House to serve as an aide to Karl Rove , then appointed Interim U.S. Attorney for Arkansas before resigning under a teary cloud in the U.S. Attorney Purge scandal earlier this year . )
The " loyal Bushies " also blocked attempts to enforce laws protecting the rights of minority voters .
Hans von Spakovsky , " a former Justice Department political appointee , blocked career lawyers from filing at least three lawsuits charging local and county governments with violating the voting rights of African - Americans and other minorities , seven former senior department employees charged . "
" Hans von Spakovsky also derailed at least two investigations into possible voter discrimination , the former employees of the Voting Rights Section said in interviews and in a letter to the Senate Rules and Administration Committee .
They urged the panel to reject von Spakovsky 's nomination to the Federal Election Commission . "
But Hans wo n't get in any trouble for it , and he may well be confirmed to the FEC .
Because IOKIYAR .
In recent years , one of the worst cases of voter suppression and intimidation occurred in Ohio on the day of the 2004 election .
I was in Columbus , Ohio that day helping Democratic GOTV efforts , and I saw Jim Crow alive and well and strutting through the streets of inner-city Columbus .
Attorneys have filed voter suppression suits in the state , but it does n't look they 'll get very far , because the evidence was destroyed .
According to BRAD BLOG and RAW STORY , ballots and election records from the 2004 election have been ' accidentally ' destroyed , despite a federal order to preserve them , in 56 out of Ohio 's 88 counties .
Cliff Arnebeck , an attorney working for the King Lincoln Bronzeville Neighborhood Association , said " The extent of the destruction of records is consistent with the covering up of the fraud that we believe occurred in the presidential election . "
So who will be punished for destroying the evidence that a federal judge had ordered must be preserved ?
No one .
Because IOKIY ( protecting ) AR .
Going back a little further , on Election Day in 2002 the Republicans illegally mounted a phone jamming scam in New Hampshire targeting the state 's Democratic GOTV phone lines .
There is ample evidence that the effort was coordinated by the White House .
James Tobin , Bush 's New England campaign chairman , was convicted of telephone harassment , but his conviction was overturned on appeal .
He is awaiting retrial .
Meanwhile , the RNC paid Tobin 's $ 2.5 million bill for legal fees .
( I also had a defense fund , and people from all over America and many parts of the world contributed to it .
It helped a lot , and my wife and I were and still are very grateful .
It did n't cover all my legal bills , but I understand that my wife and I do n't deserve the kind of deep - pocket help that nice folks like Mr. Tobin or Mr. Libby got , because I 'm not a Republican and my crime did n't help Republicans .
It 's definitely not OKIY not AR . )
Who will be held accountable for these election crimes , crimes that strike at the very heart of our democracy ?
No one .
Because ( say it with me now ) IOKIYAR .
*****
But do n't worry ; the Rule of Law is not dead in America , at least not yet .
The really dangerous criminals do get punished for their crimes .
For example , just recently I read about Katie White .
She 's a war mom , with a son in Afghanistan and another son who has been in Iraq .
In spring of this year , she and some other people blocked the doors of the U.S. District Courthouse in Erie , Pennsylvania to protest the war .
Katie 's sentence was a $ 500 fine , but she refused to pay it , so she was sentenced to five days in jail .
During the 2004 Republican National Convention , NYC police rounded up thousands of people , some of them protesters , some of them journalists , some just bystanders .
In 2006 two women wore t- shirts with politically - related phrases on them to the State of the Union address .
The one whose son had been killed in Iraq was arrested , dragged out in handcuffs and detained for hours .
The other was later asked politely to leave the chamber .
The former was Cindy Sheehan , the latter was , of course , a Republican .
On Veteran 's Day this year , over a dozen veterans ( including a 92 - year - old vet ) who are opposed to the Iraq war were arrested and charged with disturbing a public assembly .
Except they were n't disturbing anything .
They were standing in silent protest at a Veteran 's Day event from which they had been barred from speaking because they do n't support the war .
And then there are the people who were arrested for displaying a banner outside of the New York City public library .
The cops lied in the police report .
They charged them with " obstructing the entire intersection so no cars or pedestrians could pass through " and with " refusal to obey a police order and leading a parade through the intersection without a permit " even though the video of the incident showed that they had never left the library steps .
Those damn dirty hippie America - hating protestors and phony soldiers had better learn .
This is a law 'n order nation , and in this country we 're tough on crime .
Unless you 're a Republican .
If you 're a Republican and you order people to torture prisoners , or you spy on Americans without warrants , or you suppress legally registered voters , or you " out " a C.I.A. agent , or you lie under oath and obstruct justice , or you engage in selective prosecution of your political opponents and ignore criminal acts committed by your political allies , or you turn the Justice Department into an arm of the Republican party , hell , even if you have a few beers and shoot an old man in the face , do n't worry about it .
You wo n't be in any trouble for it , because … well , you get the idea .
The " supermarket " tattoo is here to stay
The 19 - year - old from Darlington paid £ 80 for the Chinese artwork in 2004 and was delighted with the results .
That was until she showed it off in a Chinese takeaway and found out it actually spelled " supermarket . "
The pair have now split up , but Miss Raine said she will keep the tattoo because she cannot afford a new one .
She said : " I did it because I wanted to show him how much I loved him and he had one done as well .
" I did not think about whether it meant forever .
I 'm just going to have to keep it as I can't afford to get another one done . "
MOSCOW , Russia ( CNN ) --
At least two sailors died and 23 were missing Sunday when five ships sank in storms in the Black Sea and the Azov Sea , the official Russia Today Web site said .
One of several ships that were in distress near Russia that spilled fuel into a crucial waterway .
The strong winds and high surf caused the Volgoneft - 139 to split in two , spilling up 560,000 gallons of fuel oil , an official from Russia 's Emergency Situations Ministry told CNN .
That is approximately 1,000 tons .
In addition to the five ships that sank , many others were grounded , Russia Today reported .
The weather was hampering efforts to control the spill , which occurred in the Kerch Strait , the official said .
The channel separates the Black Sea from the Sea of Azov .
The spill was moving toward the Ukrainian coast and Russia and Ukraine have set up a joint crisis center to deal with the disaster , the official said .
Watch enormous waves rock ships »
The Volnogorsk and the Nakhichevan -- each carrying about 2,000 tons of sulfur -- also broke apart as a result of the high waves and strong winds , a local transport official told RIA Novosti news agency .
And a third sulfur - transporting vessel , the Kovel , went down later after striking the Volnogorsk , the agency reported .
A spokesman for the federal agency for sea and inland water transport , Aleksandr Davydenko , said conditions in the Kerch Strait were worsening .
Twenty - foot waves and winds gusting to 78 mph were making the rescuers ' task difficult , Davydenko said .
Emergencies Ministry spokesman Viktor Beltsov says the Volganeft - 139 was anchored near the port of Kavkaz .
" At the moment specialists are trying to work out the size of the oil spill and the direction it 's heading , " he said .
" We will alert the respective Ukrainian services if the spill moves in their direction . "
Near the city of Sevastopol on the Black Sea , the storm wrecked a freighter carrying scrap metal .
Two of its crew members were found alive , but 15 others were missing .
Another cargo ship was in distress .
Russia and Ukraine were working together to deal with the accidents , but according to news reports , strong winds had caused several more dry - cargo ships to run aground .
Among them were Turkish vessels , a Georgian and a Greek ship .
Oleg Mitvol , deputy head of Russia 's environmental watchdog and a member of the United Nations International Panel for Sustainable Resource Management , said the fuel oil spill could lead to long - term contamination .
" My forecast is that the coastline of the Kerch Strait and the strait itself will need deep re-cultivation " lasting 10 to 15 years , he said .
The storm 's effects extended to Crimea , where power cuts led to suspension of heating and water supplies on parts of the peninsula .
" This is a major ecological catastrophe , " said Vladimir Slivyak , head of Ekozashchita , or Ecodefense , a Russian environmental group , according to Interfax news agency .
The Kerch Strait is a key waterway for transporting fuel oil from the Caspian Sea onto tankers waiting in the Black Sea .
The Volgoneft - 139 was carrying fuel oil from the southern Russian city of Samara on the Volga River to an oil terminal in Ukraine , according to Interfax .
Previous fuel spills have been smaller than Sunday 's disaster .
In November 2002 , the Liberian oil tanker Prestige broke up and sank , spewing 64,000 tons of fuel oil into the waters and polluting thousands of miles along the Atlantic coast of France , Spain and Portugal .

Four reasons Mario Galaxy is everything a Wii game should be
1 : It 's beautiful
There can no longer be a real argument over whether or not the Wii can create wonderful graphics .
While Mario Galaxy benefits from a ton of polish and love , the art style is as big of a advantage as the technology .
The graphics feature some very nice technological polishes .
As you scamper around the body of a huge bee , you 'll see soft fuzz effects on her body , the water throughout the game is lovely , and you 'll notice the frame rate is rock solid .
While the Wii can't output high - definition graphics , the majority of gamers wo n't care : Mario Galaxy is a great - looking game that is simply filled with graphical flourishes and little areas of beauty .
The small planetoids usually hold a few surprises
The game is also filled with tiny details and some amazing - looking sequences : wait until you see how large , well - animated , and fluid some of the boss characters are .
While many Wii developers get lazy and hope a few waggle controls will be enough on the Wii , Nintendo knows that a truly great game should look as good as possible , while also providing the game play .
Sure , style never beats substance , but as long as you have the substance there , a few extra bits of style only makes everything better .
2 : You wo n't beat this in an afternoon
We live in a time of seven - hour games , and while you can blow through the story of Mario Galaxy in maybe 12 to 15 hours , to collect all 120 stars and get the surprise at the end ( which wo n't be ruined here ) you 'll have to spend a lot of time , put in a lot of practice , and master many platforming skills .
I 'm not going to put an hour amount on the total experience , but 30 or more hours would n't surprise me .
If you take your time , see everything there is to see , and explore all the corners , then that time is only going to go up .
What 's as impressive about the overall quality of the play is that it 's sustained across the entire game .
While there are galaxies I liked more than others , it never feels like the developers ran out of ideas or got bored .
You 'll be just as delighted with what you see in the beginning , middle , and ending levels .
Some galaxies only have one star and have you finishing a single puzzle , or race , or other such diversion from the main type of game play .
It 's nearly impossible to get bored , and you 'll never feel like you 're grinding through the game to get your stars .
That 's a nearly impossible feat in a five - hour game , much less one of this scope .
3 : The game uses the Wiimote without resorting to minigames
We get it , guys ; the Wiimote can be used to make fun little games that anyone can pick up and play .
But we have enough of those ; we want a game we can sit down for hours and focus on , single - player style .
Mario Galaxy does n't stoop to the level of giving you a side - collection of minigames , although it does feature some nifty uses for the Wii controls .
You 'll be aiming cannons , slingshotting Mario off stretchy plants by grabbing them and pulling back , and there is even an odd two - player mechanic where another player can pick up a Wiimote and shoot at the enemies for you while also picking up star bits .
Instead of minigames , Mario Galaxy weaves all these little gameplay tweaks into the main experience , keeping things fresh without overstaying their welcome .
Mario spends much of the game flying from galaxy to galaxy
Nintendo gives many good examples of how to use the Wiimote to its fullest without having to beat the player over the head with it , and none of the control methods felt shaky or imprecise .
Compare this to the gimmicky and unsatisfying controls of Mario and Sonic at the Olympics and you have an example of how to use the Wii technology well and how to get it wrong .
4 : It 's a-me , Mario !
Nintendo is dependent on its franchises , and Mario has taken part of every fad and played nearly every sport , but at least in Mario Galaxy there are many clever references to past Mario games , as well as many little winks at the player .
Nintendo knows some of these jokes and situations border on the ridiculous , but at least they can come right out and hint that they know we know they know .
The humor is n't as self - referential as Super Paper Mario , but there are many times where we get the sense that the development team had fun with the idea that this was just another Mario title .
The game takes the characters seriously while also having fun with the idea of Mario 's world .
Why Big Media Slimes Al Gore New York Times columnist Paul Krugman has a point when he describes the rabid reaction of right - wingers to Al Gore , with the latest foaming at the mouth over the former vice president winning the Nobel Peace Prize for his work on global warming .
Bookmark

But the Right is not alone in its pathological demeaning of Gore .
The major news media , including the Washington Post and the New York Times , have taken their share of unfair shots at Gore , ironically for reasons similar to those that Krugman attributes to the Right .
In his column on Oct. 15 , Krugman observed that the Wall Street Journal ’s editorial page commented on Gore ’s prize simply by running a list of people whom it considered more deserving .
A National Review Online article linked Gore to Osama bin Laden because the Saudi terrorist once made a remark about the dangers of global warming .
“ What is it about Mr. Gore that drives right - wingers insane ? ” Krugman asked .
“ Partly it ’s a reaction to what happened in 2000 , when the American people chose Mr. Gore but his opponent somehow ended up in the White House .
“ Both the personality cult the Right tried to build around President Bush and the often hysterical denigration of Mr. Gore were , I believe , largely motivated by the desire to expunge the stain of illegitimacy from the Bush administration . ”
[ See “ Gore Derangement Syndrome , ” NYT , Oct. 15 , 2007 ]
But the major U.S. news media , including Krugman ’s own newspaper , appears to have acted with much the same goal , protecting Bush ’s legitimacy at the start of his presidency and insulating him from doubts about his competence after the 9/11 attacks .
This favoritism toward Bush dates back even further to the earliest days of Campaign 2000 when Gore was depicted as a “ delusional ” braggart and Bush was the “ straight shooter ” who would bring the “ adults ” back to Washington .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Al Gore v. the Media ” or “ Protecting Bush / Cheney ” or our new book , Neck Deep . ]
During the Florida recount battle , it was Gore who was viewed as the interloper who should spare the country a bitter election stalemate and simply concede defeat , even though he had won the national popular vote by more than a half million ballots .
Washington
Post columnist Richard Cohen spoke for many colleagues when he wrote that “ given the present bitterness , given the angry irresponsible charges being hurled by both camps , the nation will be in dire need of a conciliator , a likable guy who will make things better and not worse .
That man is not Al Gore .
That man is George W. Bush . ”
After the unprecedented ruling by five Republicans on the U.S. Supreme Court to stop the Florida recount and hand the presidency to Bush , the big news outlets turned to helping the nation heal its wounds by putting Bush ’s illegitimacy off limits .
Happy Days While Bill Clinton faced what amounted to hazing during his presidential transition , major U.S. news outlets granted Bush an extended honeymoon .
Washington welcomed the return of the “ adults , ” such as Colin Powell and Dick Cheney , who would surround the novice President with sound advice .
On Inauguration Day , network news coverage largely looked the other way when angry demonstrators surged toward Pennsylvania Avenue and Bush chose to forego a stately ride to the White House in favor of Secret Service agents hitting the accelerators .
Meanwhile , Gore was banished from politically respectable society .
When he grew a beard or gained some weight , he became the butt of jokes not just from right - wing journalists but from mainstream pundits as well .
After the 9/11 attacks , the U.S. news media pulled the wagons even tighter around the shaky , inexperienced Bush .
It was in this climate of perceived national crisis that Bush ’s “ cult of personality ” took flight .
However , Bush ’s dubious election “ victory ” remained a shadow over his presidency , made worse when a media examination of legally cast Florida ballots was completed in November 2001 and found that Gore would have won a full recount regardless of which standard was applied to the “ chads . ”
Under a normal news judgment , the American people would have awakened to the startling headline that “ Gore Would Have Won Full Florida Recount ; Should Be the President . ”
But that would have provoked a political firestorm and raised fresh doubts about Bush ’s legitimacy just two months after 9/11 .
So , senior editors at the major mainstream news outlets chose to bury their own lede , focusing instead on hypothetical partial recounts that Bush still might have won .
“ Florida Recounts Would Have Favored Bush , ” according to the Washington Post ’s headline on Nov. 12 , 2001 .
Both the Post and the New York Times referred to Americans who questioned this interpretation as “ Gore partisans . ”
Post media critic Howard Kurtz ridiculed these doubters as “ conspiracy theorists ” in an article entitled “ George W. Bush , Now More Than Ever . ”
Kurtz also mocked people who believed that winning an election fairly , based on the will of the voters , was important in a democracy .
“ Now the question is : How many people still care about the election deadlock that last fall felt like the story of the century – and now faintly echoes like some distant Civil War battle ? ” he wrote .
Real Results
A reader had to dig into the actual data – and ignore the ridicule – to find the real story .
“ Full Review Favors Gore , ” the Washington Post acknowledged in a box on page 10 , showing that under all standards applied to the ballots , Gore came out on top .
The New York Times ’ graphic revealed the same outcome .
After reading these stories , I wrote an article noting that the obvious lede should have been that Gore won .
I suggested that the news judgments of senior editors might have been influenced by a desire to appear patriotic at a time of national crisis .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Gore ’s Victory . ” ]
The article had been on the Internet for only an hour or two when I received an angry phone call from New York Times media writer Felicity Barringer , who accused me of impugning the journalistic integrity of then Times executive editor Howell Raines .
It was as if Barringer had been on the look - out for some deviant analysis that had to be stamped out .
By the end of 2001 – after the initial U.S. military victory in Afghanistan – the major U.S. media slid into full - scale Bush hagiography .
On Dec. 23 , 2001 , for instance , NBC's Tim Russert joined New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani , Cardinal Theodore McCarrick and First Lady Laura Bush in ruminating about whether divine intervention put Bush in the White House to handle the 9/11 crisis .
Russert asked Mrs. Bush if “ in an extraordinary way , this is why he was elected . ”
Mrs. Bush objected to Russert ’s suggestion that “ God picks the president , which he does n’t . ”
Giuliani thought otherwise : “ I do think , Mrs. Bush , that there was some divine guidance in the president being elected .
I do . ” McCarrick also saw some larger purpose , saying : “ I think I do n’t thoroughly agree with the First Lady .
I think that the president really , he was where he was when we needed him . ”
Bush was soon the subject of flattering books , such as David Frum ’s “ The Right Man ” and Bob Woodward ’s “ Bush at War . ”
The public fawning appeared to go to Bush ’s head as he told Woodward that his presidential judgments were beyond questioning .
“ I am the commander , see , ” Bush said .
“ I do not need to explain why I say things .
That ’s the interesting thing about being the president .
Maybe somebody needs to explain to me why they need to say something , but I do n't feel like I owe anybody an explanation . ”
Before long , most major U.S. news outlets were lapping up whatever Bush and his team were pouring out about Iraq ’s weapons of mass destruction .
Gore ’s Netherworld
When Al Gore emerged from the political netherworld to question the wisdom of Bush ’s plan for a preemptive war against Iraq , the former vice president was alternatively ignored and ridiculed .
Gore ’s Sept. 23 , 2002 , speech to the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco got little coverage – except to the extent that Bush ’s supporters trashed it .
“ Gore ’s speech was one no decent politician could have delivered , ” wrote Washington Post columnist Michael Kelly .
“ It was dishonest , cheap , low .
It was hollow .
It was bereft of policy , of solutions , of constructive ideas , very nearly of facts – bereft of anything other than taunts and jibes and embarrassingly obvious lies .
It was breathtakingly hypocritical , a naked political assault delivered in tones of moral condescension from a man pretending to be superior to mere politics .
It was wretched .
It was vile .
It was contemptible . ” [ Washington Post , Sept. 25 , 2002 ]
“ A pudding with no theme but much poison , ” declared another Post columnist , Charles Krauthammer .
“ It was a disgrace – a series of cheap shots strung together without logic or coherence . ”
[ Washington Post , Sept. 27 , 2002 ]
While some depicted Gore ’s motivation as political “ opportunism , ” columnist William Bennett mocked Gore for sealing his political doom and banishing himself “ from the mainstream of public opinion . ”
Even as Gore ’s warnings proved prescient , he remained an object of disdain from a mainstream press corps that had no stomach for reexamining how it failed in its duty to ask the White House tough questions .
When the political pundits have deigned to mention the possibility of Gore running for president in 2008 , they talk mostly about his waist line .
This mainstream tendency to mock Gore has continued in the wake of his Nobel Peace Prize on Oct. 12 .
Almost every time Gore ’s prize was mentioned on CNN , it was accompanied by a reference to a ruling by an obscure British judge named Michael Burton , who claimed to detect “ nine errors ” in Gore ’s slide - show presentation for “ An Inconvenient Truth . ”
On Oct. 13 , the Washington Post noted Gore ’s prize in a snarky editorial that elevated Burton ’s “ nine errors ” to “ nine significant errors ” and faulted Gore for “ factual misstatements and exaggerations . ”
The reality , however , was that Burton ’s ruling was based on misrepresentations of what Gore actually said in the documentary .
At best , Burton ’s objections could be considered quibbles .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Smearing Al Gore : Here We Go Again . ” ]
So , Krugman is surely correct to note the extraordinary hostility that Gore engenders from the Right .
As Krugman wrote at the end of his Oct. 15 column , “ Which brings us to the biggest reason the Right hates Mr. Gore : in his case the smear campaign has failed .
He ’s taken everything they could throw at him , and emerged more respected , and more credible , than ever .
And it drives them crazy . ”
Yet it is perhaps even more troubling that much of the mainstream U.S. news media has refused to give up its own animus toward Gore .
From CNN to the Washington Post ’s editorial page , senior news executives apparently still feel that it is more important to ingratiate themselves with President Bush and his powerful admirers than it is to show some fairness to the man who was the choice of a plurality of American voters in 2000 .

Shipping Means Prioritizing
So I ’ve gotten a sizable stream of feedback regarding my Linked List quip regarding Java developers who are pissed at Apple about Leopard ’s crummy Java support .
I wrote :
I fail to see why anyone ( other than Java developers themselves ) would care .
And , of course , just about every message I ’ve gotten telling me that I ’m wrong or arrogant ( or both ) has been from a Java developer .
This is not complicated .
Leopard was already late .
Apple originally stated it would ship in the “ first half ” of 2007 .
It slipped four months and they got a ton of negative publicity when they had to announce the slip .
And , from what I can tell , talking to friends at Apple and judging by the developer seeds over the last few months , a lot of engineers at Apple have been working their asses off for a long time to get Leopard into the state it ’s in today .
Shipping is hard .
The only way to ship software is to prioritize , and prioritizing means dropping things that are less essential in exchange for things that are more essential .
Obviously , for Apple , Java 6 is not a priority .
And , judging by reports that even Java 5 support is worse on Leopard than it was on Tiger , Java as a whole is not a priority for Apple .
[ Update : Several readers say that reports of Java 5 ’s suckage on Leopard are greatly exaggerated — different , yes , but the UI changes are an improvement , at least in some Java developers ’ eyes . ]
But it ’s not like Apple is sitting on a top - notch Java - 6 - for - Mac - OS - X and withholding it out of spite .
They simply decided to allocate engineering resources elsewhere .
In the case of Java , I do n’t think it was even a close call .
What should they have done ?
Delayed Leopard even further ?
Pulled engineering resources from something that did ship with Leopard for Java ?
Java simply is n’t relevant to the Mac .
Several irritated Java developers suggested that I ’d feel differently if it were a developer runtime that I personally cared about — that I ’d be irate if , say , Perl or Ruby or Python were dropped or degraded in Leopard .
But that ’s not a good comparison ; Perl , Python , and Ruby pretty much compile out of the box on Mac OS X .
Apple does n’t have to do much at all — at least relative to Java — to include them on Mac OS X .
Why ?
Because that ’s how these tools are designed and engineered — they ’re made to “ just build ” on any Unix - like OS .
It ’s not Apple ’s responsibility that Java is n’t like that — it ’s Sun’s .
Apple made all sorts of compromises in order to ship Leopard .
Look no further than 64 - bit Carbon , which was in when Leopard was initially announced at WWDC 2006 , but was dropped at WWDC 2007 .
Carbon is directly relevant to the Mac ; it remains the foundation for many of the most popular apps on the platform .
As John Siracusa wrote in his Leopard review :
In the end , Apple made the hard choice instead of the easy one .
I think it will pay off , though the short - term consequences could be pretty grim .
After all , just look at how long it ’s taking to get an Intel - native version of Microsoft Office for the Mac .
Should we expect a 64 - bit Cocoa version in , say , 2012 ?
And I have no idea what Adobe ’s going to do about 64 - bit versions of its products .
That ’s many millions of lines of Carbon code between those two companies alone .
We may be in for a rough patch , so buckle up .
Compared to the decision to abandon work on 64 - bit Carbon , Apple ’s decision to abandon ( or postpone , for all we know ) work on Java 6 was easy .
Some of the most important software for the Mac depends on Carbon .
No important software for the Mac depends on Java .

Ron Paul once again roiled Republican presidential politics on the issue of foreign policy during last night ’s debate , finishing second in the post - debate poll conducted by Fox News and first in the poll conducted by MSNBC .
Pointing out that U.S. foreign policy is the root cause of the anger and hatred that has engendered terrorism against the United States , including the 9/11 attacks , Paul suggested that America would be better off ending the U.S. government ’s role as world policeman as wells its longtime policy of interventionism .
He pointed to Vietnam as an example of where 60,000 American men died in a senseless war while today Americans are instead peacefully investing and trading with the Vietnamese despite their communist regime .
Paul ’s point ignited an attack by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani , who indignantly announced that he had never heard such a theory in his life and asked Paul to retract it .
Instead ,
Paul steadfastly stood his ground , pointing out that the CIA itself has pointed out the blowback that U.S. foreign policy has engendered .
He cited the CIA ’s installation of the shah of Iran in 1953 for producing the blowback that resulted in the taking of the U.S. hostages in Iran many years later .
In a post - debate interview , Giuliani clarified his point by reciting the official U.S. canard that was issued immediately after the 9/11 attacks — that the terrorists hate us for our freedom and values . 
Giuliani suggested that it was because of our freedom of religion and freedom for women . 
When Paul mentioned Iran as an example of blowback from U.S. foreign policy , he was referring to the 1953 coup in which the CIA secretly and surreptitiously engineered the ouster of the democratically elected prime minister of Iran , Mohammed Mossadegh , who had been selected Time Magazine ’s Man of the Year .
In his place , the CIA installed the shah of Iran , whose secret police proceeded to terrorize and torture the Iranian people for the next 25 years , with the ardent support of the U.S. government .
As the Iranian people discovered the U.S. government ’s role in all this , their anger and rage ultimately erupted in 1979 with the Iranian Revolution and the taking of the U.S. hostages .
Consider U.S. foreign policy toward Iraq :
The U.S. support of Saddam Hussein .
The U.S. furnishing of weapons of mass destruction to Saddam Hussein and the correlative assistance provided by the U.S. in the use of such weaponry .
The Persian Gulf intervention .
The intentional destruction of Iraq ’s water and sewage facilities , with full knowledge as to what effect such action would have on the long - term health of the Iraqi people .
The more than 10 years of brutal sanctions , which contributed to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children from sickness and disease .
The deadly no - fly zones , which had not been authorized by either the UN or the U.S. Congress , and whose enforcement entailed the firing of missiles and the dropping of bombs that killed even more Iraqis .
U.S. Ambassador to the UN Madeleine Albright ’s infamous statement to  Sixty Minutes  that reverberated throughout the Middle East that the deaths of half - a- million Iraqi children had been worth it .
The invasion and occupation of Iraq , which has killed and maimed hundreds of thousands of more Iraqis .
The torture and sex abuse of Iraqi men at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere in Iraq , photographs and videos of which are still being kept hidden by U.S. officials because of their potential blowback .
The periodic rapes and murders that some U.S. troops have committed against the Iraqi people during the occupation .
The arbitrary and indiscriminate searches and seizures without warrants being conducted by U.S. troops .
The indefinite detentions without trial of some 20,000 Iraqi men and women in overcrowded prisons .
How can anyone honestly believe that such actions would not engender horrible anger and rage throughout the Middle East and , indeed , throughout the world ?
As Ron Paul emphasized in last night ’s debate , imagine if some foreign power — such as China — had done these types of things to the United States .
Would n’t Americans experience anger and rage ?
Indeed , closer to home , suppose Venezuela imposed sanctions and no-fly zones on the Southeastern part of the United States and then sent in Venezuelan troops to wage the war on terrorism in Florida .
After all , do n’t forget that the U.S. government ’s refusal to turn over accused terrorist Luis Posada Carriles to the Venezuelan government for trial is no different in principle from the Taliban ’s refusal to turn Osama bin Laden over to the United States after the 9/11 attacks .
In fact , Venezuela ’s case is stronger than the Taliban ’s because Venezuela , unlike Afghanistan , has an extradition agreement with the United States .
Moreover , Venezuela , unlike Washington ’s response to the Taliban regime , is ready and willing to offer evidence of Posada ’s role in the terrorist bombing of a Cuban airliner , which took the lives of 73 innocent people , including the young members of a Cuban sports team .
What Ron Paul ’s participation in the 2008 presidential race is accomplishing is this :
It is making people such as Rudy Giuliani think about things they ’ve never thought about before and causing them to view the U.S. government and its long - time paradigm of empire and interventionism in an entirely different way .
It ’s also why he is engendering considerable discomfort among people who have long believed that the federal government is a deity whose foreign policies are beyond reproach .
Do n’t be surprised to hear more calls for suppressing Paul ’s participation in future debates , even while the critics continue to wax eloquent about how U.S. soldiers are killing and dying in Iraq for the sake of democracy . 
In last night ’s debate Rudy Giuliani made a mistake that is commonly made by those who view the federal government as a deity .
Conflating the U.S. government and the American people , he suggested in the post - debate interview that Ron Paul was blaming America . 
Actually , Paul did no such thing .
He blamed the U.S. government ’s interventionist foreign policies for the morass in which our nation now finds itself .
Like our Founding Fathers and the Framers , Paul understands that the federal government and the country are two separate and distinct groups , which in fact is precisely why the Bill of Rights expressly protects the country from the federal government .
Ron Paul ’s answers in last night ’s debate reflect how differently he approaches societal problems as compared to such politicians as Rudy Giuliani .
Keep in mind that Ron Paul is , first and foremost , a physician .
As a doctor , he is trained in diagnosing an ailment correctly because he knows that a correct prescription almost always depends on the right diagnosis .
Equally important , he is n’t going to lie to a patient or feed him a false reality about the seriousness of his ailment .
In order for the patient to make the correct decision as to whether to embark on a certain course of treatment , Paul knows that it is necessary that the patient confront the reality of his condition .
Therefore , during last night ’s debate Ron Paul simply was doing what he has done for many years , both as a doctor and as a congressman .
He was diagnosing what ails the American body politic and prescribed the radical treatment that is necessary to heal the patient .
The patient can obviously go into denial , preferring to believe instead the lies and false realities of charlatans but deep down the patient always knows that ultimately reality will not enable him to escape the consequences of having done so .

Augusto
Odone refused to give up on his son
His remarkable survival is due to his parents ' single minded refusal to accept the doctors ' grim prognosis .
With no scientific training they took on the medical establishment and set about finding a cure .
And in 1986 it seemed they had succeeded .
I asked the doctor if I could read the medical papers .
He said : ' Do n't bother , you wo n't understand them ' .
Augusto Odone
The movie painted a fairytale picture of a miracle cure , and gave hope to thousands of young children suffering the same devastating illness .
But these claims have always been controversial .
Now , as BBC television documentary series Medical Mysteries reports , a 10 year study into the effects of Lorenzo 's Oil has come up with surprising results .
The oil does n't seem to work for people who are already ill - but it does seem to prevent illness in those whose genes make them vulnerable to developing symptoms .
Lorenzo suffered from Adrenoleucodystrophy ( ALD ) , a genetic disease that progressively destroys the brain of young boys .
Within a year children are paralysed , blind , unable to speak .
It is invariably fatal .
Desperation
When he was diagnosed , Lorenzo 's father Augusto was desperate .
" I was terrorised , I was shocked .
Well , it 's a death sentence .
" So I asked the doctor if I could read the medical papers .
He said : ' Do n't bother , you wo n't understand them ' . "
Both the Stafford brothers had ALD genes
He discovered that the brain damage seemed to be linked to a build up of dangerous fatty acids in the blood - long chain fatty acids .
He invited all the world experts to a conference to discuss the research , and it was at the conference that he first found a glimmer of hope .
An oil - oleic acid - was able to destroy these fatty acids .
Less than a year later Augusto and his wife Michaela had a treatment : a combination of oils that effectively reduced the long chain fatty acids in the blood .
It was astonishing .
Where the entire medical profession had failed , two ordinary parents had succeeded .
Optimism
Dr Hugo Moser , the world authority on ALD , remembers that early optimism .
" Lorenzo's oil lowered the fatty acids more effectively than any other medical approach that had been tried .
We would be foolish not to give it very serious consideration . "
Augusto published his findings and Dr Moser started putting all of his young ALD patients on the oil .
For one family in Britain , news of the Odones ' triumph could n't have come at a better time .
The Stafford family had just discovered that their seven - year - old son Barry had just been diagnosed with ALD .
They flew over to America and Barry became the first British patient to be put on Lorenzo 's oil .
Within weeks his long chain fatty acid levels had dropped to normal .
Younger brother at risk
But the Staffords anguish was n't over .
Because ALD is a genetic condition there was a 50:50 chance that Barry 's younger brother Glenn would have the defective gene too .
Barry Stafford was the first Briton to use the oil
But a blood test confirmed their worst fears .
Glenn too had the faulty gene .
Alfie Stafford , the boy 's father , said : " It felt like our world was turned upside down again .
We could lose two boys .
We could lose two boys within 10 years . "
Very little is known about how ALD is inherited .
Girls who have the gene do not show any symptoms , and not every boy with the faulty gene goes on to develop the devastating childhood form - ALD .
Glenn might not develop ALD , but Dr Moser put him on Lorenzo 's oil in any event .
In fact , Glenn became the first non-symptomatic child to be put on the oil .
Reality different
Over the next few years , the movie Lorenzo 's oil , starring Susan Sarandon and Nick Nolte , was released .
It received huge acclaim , and Susan Sarandon was Oscar nominated for her role as Lorenzo 's mother .
It showed a miracle cure but the reality was beginning to look very different .
Lorenzo himself was still alive , but was not getting better ; and one by one , other children on the oil died .
Barry Stafford was getting worse and worse , and his mother Chris was upset at the hype round the film .
" Lovely film - but I did have a problem - it made it seem like a miracle cure , but it 's not and I 've proved that with Barry , " she said .
Seven years after being put on the oil , Barry died .
The disease had caused massive brain damage and the oil did n't seem to be able to stop the progression .
Barry 's fate was not unique .
Other children were also dying , despite being on Lorenzo 's oil .
Doctors all over the world stopped prescribing the oil .
Preventative effect
It 's due to the oil that I 'm here now .
Glenn Stafford
Dr Moser , however , was not prepared to give up .
He decided to focus on boys who had the ALD gene but had not yet developed the symptoms .
Perhaps the oil could prevent the disease ever appearing .
Boys like Barry 's younger brother Glenn were put on the oil .
After 10 years the results are finally through .
And they are dramatic .
Of 120 boys in the trial 83 are still free of the disease .
Lorenzo's
Oil is showing a significant preventative effect .
According to Dr Moser taking the oil reduced the chance of getting the disease by half .
And Glenn Stafford , the first non-symptomatic patient to be out on the oil is now 21 years old and fully fit .
" If they had n't caught the disease and put me on the oil then I do n't think I would be here now , " he said .
" So it 's due to the oil that I 'm here now . "
So now there is real hope .
Tests can identify boys with the gene , and the oil gives them a hugely improved chance of escaping the horrific disease .
And Augusto Odone ?
He 's delighted with the findings .
But he 's still , 15 years on , looking for a cure for his son who lies at home , paralysed by the ALD .
Medical Mysteries - Lorenzo's
Oil was broadcast on BBC One on 21 July at 2235 BST .

How difficult , how exquisitely difficult it is to know where to begin .
Anyone who has had the time or disposition to read the comments that readers have submitted to these pages over the last three weeks or so will be aware of a number of issues that need addressing .
Firstly and most crucially : how do Terry Pratchett readers eat soup ?
We ’ll answer that vital point momentarily , as they say here in the US .
I do enjoy hearing American waiters using that word ; as you enter a restaurant they might say , “ I ’ll be with you momentarily ” .
They are usually righter than they know : a fleeting vision that flickers before your eyes and then is gone .
I suppose ‘ in a moment ’ takes too long to say in their busy lives and ‘ presently ’ is English English to the point of being more or less flagrantly homosexual , so ‘ momentarily ’ it is .
MomentARily of course rather than the English MOment ’rily .
Anyhoo … other things :
Do I know how to spell ‘ Whoa ’ ?
Clearly not .
Thanks for the spanky botty from one sensitive commentator , fully deserved .
Back to the boiling question of the moment – Pratchett fans and their soup - stylings .
Let me quote the ‘ offending ’ sentence from the first Guardian ‘ Dork Talk ’ article reproduced on this site : ‘ Nor does it [ being deeply dippy about all things digital ] mean I read Terry Pratchett , breathe only through my mouth and bring my head slightly too close to the bowl when I eat soup . ’
Now , in what possible world does that mean Terry Pratchett readers bring their heads slightly too close to the bowl when they eat soup ?
In what universe ( whether supported by turtles , elephants or badminton rackets ) does it follow from the above that I , Stephen Fry , do not like , reverence or appreciate Terry Pratchett and his works ?
By what black arts can it further be construed that I believe Pratchett ’s books to be useless , his readers stupid and his whole world contemptible ?
My use of the conjunction ‘ and ’ rather than ‘ or ’ might just allow some to make that construction , but surely they can see they would be entirely wrong to do so ?
I was addressing the whole issue of stereotyping here : being a device geek does n’t make one a predictably anoraky nerd , I ( thought I ) was saying .
You ca n’t make assumptions , that was the message .
I could just have easily written : ‘ Being deeply dippy about Terry Pratchett does n’t mean I love digital devices , breathe only through my mouth and bring my head closer … etc ’ .
Do n’t you see that , you silly little Pratcheteers ?
C’mon now .
Do n’t be so insecure .
Just be grateful I did n’t include the lines about halitosis , scurfy shoulders and bottle - end spectacles .
As references to the public image of dorks , he hastens to add , not as observations on Pratchett fans .
Phew !
Talk about sensitive …
As for the books themselves .
I suppose I ought to come clean .
I ’ve never read one .
Not a one .
I have a friend whose opinion I respect .
He tells me they ’re actually damned good , so I ’ll probably get round to it .
I ’d like Captain Nimes , apparently .
( I am suspicious though of character names I am unsure how to pronounce : Nimes rhymes with reams or rhymes with rhymes ? )
But why have n’t I read one , you wonder ?
What claim do I have to call myself a rounded human being ( aside from pointing to my swelling tummy – thanks , American food – obliged to you , high fructose corn syrup ) if I have not bothered to glance at so much as one of the works of this astoundingly popular author ?
Good point .
I think it ’s the fans really .
So insecure .
Such strange ways of tackling soup .
And my dear the breath !
* ducks *
Another apology : I used the phrase “ paint a scenario ” which enraged one reader ( or perhaps delighted that reader , because it afforded them the opportunity to give me a damned good ticking off in public ) – I bow my head in meek submission .
Back to America .
Aside from my enjoyment of the way waiters here say ‘ I ’ll be with you momentarily ’ , I ’m also fond of a phrasal mannerism common amongst shop assistants , or clerks as I suppose they should be called .
Suppose you go up to the till with no more than a stick of chewing gum .
You hand over the money and he or she will invariably hand back your change and a till receipt with these words , “ Okay , you ’re all set . ”
As if they ’ve just kitted you out for some perilous adventure up the Amazon or across the Himalayas .
Inoculations , visas , anti-malarials , stout boots ?
Okay , you ’re all set .
I do love it .
Hurrah for being all set .
Hurrah for America .
At Gettysburg , Pennsylvania
Many readers have left comments containing recommendations as to what to do on my Great American Journey , which reminds me of the poster campaign Time
Out ran when they launched a New York edition .
“ Time Out : The Perfect Magazine For New Yorkers : it Tells You Where to Go and What to Do With Yourself ” .
Will I visit Galena , Illinois or Hoglick , Iowa or Sweetwater Creek , Oregon or any of the other tempting destinations American readers have been recommending I be sure to stop off at ?
Well , all suggestions welcome naturally , but it is very difficult on such a cursory tour to be able to visit every village , burg , town , city and county no matter how appealing they sound .
For those of you who are not aware , I have been in the US since the middle of October filming a documentary for the BBC in which I visit every State in the Union .
The purpose , as I wrote earlier , is twofold , to see the continental United States and to experience American life at local level .
One of the most charming and endearing features of America is the intensely passionate civic and statal ( if only there were such a word ) pride exhibited by so many of its citizens .
Mainers are extraordinarily proud to be from Maine .
The people of Delaware really want you to understand and appreciate the character and qualities of the Delawarian ( ‘ slow and low ’ it would appear ) .
West Virginians will always take time to tell you how much they love their state and how much they want you to love it too .
Clearly this is less true of those from New York City ( the huge expanse of beautiful countryside that is New York State is another matter ) for their city is as a whole other territory to itself .
So far these are the states I have visited and filmed in :- Maine , Vermont , New Hampshire , New York , Connecticut , Rhode Island , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Maryland , Delaware , ( Washington DC ) , Virginia , West Virginia , Kentucky , Tennessee and North Carolina .
Still to come on this southern leg are South Carolina , Georgia , Alabama and Florida .
I have sailed , hunted , gone down a coal mine , followed a Presidential candidate for the day , talked to a witch , got drunk at a distillery , fished for lobster , chatted to the founder of Wikipedia , dealt blackjack , listened to the Vice President of the United States make a speech , bumped my head in a nuclear submarine , created my own Ben and Jerry ’s ice - cream flavour and driven a London taxi some three thousand miles around the turnpikes , parkways , interstates and freeways of the Eastern United States .
Some of you may be wondering why I do n’t blog , post to the blog , make a blog , embloggulate or whatever damned word I ’m supposed to use ( there ’s been a debate on these pages about how the verb ‘ to blog ’ should properly be used ) on this very subject : My American Travels .
Well , here I must confess I ’m in something of a bind .
Much as I ’d like to share all the details of my journey with you , I am , as I travel , making a programme for the BBC and I would n’t want to spoil any of its surprises : it would be unfair on the network , the production company , the director and crew if too much was known a year before broadcast .
In addition , I ’m writing a book about it all and the publishers would have fifty thousand fits if I did n’t give them my more or less undivided attention .
While I ’m happy then , to give those of you interested the broad outlines of my peregrinations , I ’m afraid I wo n’t be plunging much deeper than that .
Do hope you understand .
I will however tell you a story that does say something about a difference between American and British approaches to debate .
See below .
Another question that has been asked a fair amount boils down to this : “ Now that you ’re writing a Guardian article and sending it to this site , does that mean you sha n’t also be contributing those longer and more individual pieces that rejoice in the name blessay ? ”
Well , no it does n’t , as see below again .
I ’m sorry about the long intervals of time between these blessays , but I really am so very , very busy with the trip , with the weekly Dork Talk articles , with writing up notes for the book , with sundry other duties to be done that … well , a fully fledged blessay is n’t something I can come up with week in and week out .
The word ‘ occasional ’ is beating its wings overhead … for the moment at least .
Mind you , just wait till I decide the time is right to tell you about the other documentary I ’m doing for the BBC , one that takes me all round the world … but that can wait for the moment .
Sufficient unto the day are the evils thereof .
In casting my mind around for a subject for a blessay I have come up with one that was forced to my attention the other night when I participated in a regrettable and unhappy verbal spat with an American gentleman .
I shan’t give details about him , it would n’t be fair , so let ’s call him Jim and leave his statehood , profession and other details unventilated .
I will try and be as fair to him and as scrupulously honest about myself as I can be .
It was an upsetting evening and I wish it had n’t happened , but I suspect evenings like it are taking place everywhere around the planet .
Getting Overheated
We must begin with a few round truths about myself : when I get into a debate I can get very , very hot under the collar , very impassioned , and I dare say , very maddening , for once the light of battle is in my eye I find it almost impossible to let go and calm down .
I like to think I ’m never vituperative or too ad hominem but I do know that I fall on ideas as hungry wolves fall on strayed lambs and the result is n’t always pretty .
This is especially dangerous in America .
I was warned many , many years ago by the great Jonathan Lynn , co-creator of Yes Minister and director of the comic masterpiece My Cousin Vinnie , that Americans are not raised in a tradition of debate and that the adversarial ferocity common around a dinner table in Britain is more or less unheard of in America .
When Jonathan first went to live in LA he could n’t understand the terrible silences that would fall when he trashed an statement he disagreed with and said something like “ yes , but that ’s just arrant nonsense , is n’t it ?
It does n’t make sense .
It ’s self - contradictory . ”
To a Briton pointing out that something is nonsense , rubbish , tosh or logically impossible in its own terms is not an attack on the person saying it – it ’s often no more than a salvo in what one hopes might become an enjoyable intellectual tussle .
Jonathan soon found that most Americans responded with offence , hurt or anger to this order of cut and thrust .
Yes , one hesitates ever to make generalizations , but let ’s be honest the cultures are different , if they were n’t how much poorer the world would be and Americans really do n’t seem to be very good at or very used to the idea of a good no -holds barred verbal scrap .
I ’m not talking about inter-family ‘ discussions ’ here , I do n’t doubt that within American families and amongst close friends , all kinds of liveliness and hoo - hah is possible , I ’m talking about what for good or ill one might as well call dinner - party conversation .
Disagreement and energetic debate appears to leave a loud smell in the air .
Certainly my experience of the other night bears out Jonathan ’s experience and I ’ve been punching myself very hard on the inside ever since for committing the crime of allowing myself to get too heated .
On the other hand the argument was an important one .
For another difference we have to face between our cultures is that the average position on global warming in Britain seems to be : ‘ It exists , we humans are causing it , we ’d better do something about it ’ , whereas the average position in America might be interpreted as , ‘ I ’m not convinced and anyway America certainly should n’t sign up to do anything about it if China does n’t . ’
It started amicably enough .
We had been filming all day with Jim who had been kind and hospitable .
He had suggested the restaurant and fine it was too .
So there ’s Jim , four Britons and one Bosnian in the crew plus our two American driver / fixers .
And there ’s me .
Or I , if you prefer .
For some reason the conversation came round to the environment and Jim started laying into Al Gore .
He described him as “ a piece of shit ” and “ a hypocrite ” .
Well , I have no particular reason to worship the man .
He has won both an Oscar and a Nobel Prize , but that does n’t necessarily prove him a saint , prophet or hero .
Nonetheless , piece of shit and hypocrite struck me ( and the rest of the table , but I was the one , as usual , who somehow became the mouthy mouthpiece ) as a bit much .
It turned out Al Gore should be regarded as a hypocrite on two counts .
Firstly because much of his family fortune came from coal and secondly because ‘ he goes from place to place in a jet ’ which is apparently not consonant with his self - appointed duty of warning the world about the environment .
We can dismiss this attack on Al Gore fairly easily I should have thought .
The fact that his family made money out of coal seems about as irrelevant to his own moral worth as you can get .
Would Himmler ’s grandson be a hypocrite for not wanting to wipe out the Jews ?
Preposterous .
All of us who have European blood in us will have ancestors who made money from , or whose lives were made infinitely easier by , slavery .
Does that mean we ’d be hypocritical to disapprove of it ?
I am not saying coalmining is a moral equivalent , of course .
It could just as easily be that one ’s grandfather made his money out of meat - packing : would be it then be hypocritical to be a vegetarian ?
Using the jet , though : this one hears more of .
So far as I know Al Gore has n’t gone around saying we should all stop using jets , it seemed to me from his film that his whole argument was that we do n’t have to get all medieval and pre-industrial in order to halt the threat of global warming .
I appreciate it would be terribly convenient to those who deny the problems he has drawn our attention to if he could be leapt upon for not recycling this , not saving that , for actually using electricity , for shamelessly driving a car etc etc .
But even if Al Gore had said that no one should fly around in jets or use electricity , then does it actually mean the world is n’t getting warmer and that we should n’t do something about it ?
I mean it ’s perfectly possible that he ’s a hypocrite , but how does that alter the central facts ?
After all , I can say “ always be kind , always be responsible , always treat others well ” – if I then spent a day being unkind , irresponsible and unpleasant in my treatment of others if might make me something of a Tartuffe but it would not instantly render the ethical standards I had recommended worthless , it would simply mean that I had n’t lived up to them .
So even if Gore is the completest hypocrite , it has no bearing on his claims .
Jim now came to his central argument .
“ I ’m not a scientist .
I do n’t have the technical knowledge to determine whether this global warming is a real , man made threat or not .
Do you ? ”
Well I suppose Jim was accustomed to this argument appearing to be quite a clincher .
Obviously very few people he meets are likely to reply that they do have the technical knowledge .
What is more Jim could spread his hands wide and claim not to be a ‘ global warming denier ’ ( a phrase that made him very angry indeed .
He denounced it as ‘ that cliché ’ , which is not quite what it is , but we ’ll let it pass ) .
‘ I ’m not saying it does n’t exist , I ’m not saying it does .
I ’m just saying I do n’t know . ’
Others around the table interjected with the observation that the vast majority of scientists were united in their views .
This he countered with , ‘ there are plenty of scientists who say it ’s all nonsense ’ .
Well , it ’s undignified to go into the game of listing the academic institutions whose leading professors are in the orthodox majority .
Besides , in that sense , he is right .
I ca n’t catalogue the scientists on each side of the debate and I am aware that leading deniers have adduced their apparent experts who parry the claims of the mainstream with counterclaims of their own .
I do n’t think anyone can deny that it is the majority of scientists who believe that global warming a ) exists and b ) is caused by man ’s industrial activity , pollution and energy consumption , but that does n’t mean they are right .
The vast majority of scientists in the first half of the nineteenth century thought disease was spread by smell .
They were wrong .
So we concede that numbers mean nothing , a thing is true or it is not .
And Jim is right .
I will never know enough , nor will he , about climatology , oceanography , chemistry , biology , metereology and the dozen other ologies I would need to understand in order to arrive at a wholly confident technical , scientific decision .
So can I just , as Jim appears to be able to do , sit back and believe myself logically and morally justified in acting as if global warming and its threat to us is not proven ?
It ’s a jolly thought .
‘ Well , I ’d like to able to believe you , but the case is n’t proven .
There are plenty of scientists who have quibbles .
I ca n’t pretend to know anything about it myself and the orthodox majority in science has been wrong in the past .
So there we have it . ’

When I tell you that Jim has a vested interest , a deeply vested interest , in this whole issue , you may think it weakens his argument .
It does n’t of course make any difference that he is a very senior figure in a company that … no , I want to protect his anonymity so I ’ll just say that he is in the fossil fuels business .
This may explain why he has taken up the argument he has , for the ‘ green agenda ’ is a potential threat to his livelihood , but again , that does n’t make his argument logically wrong .
In fact nothing makes his argument logically wrong , for he is not making an argument , he is stating a bare fact .
He can not know for himself .
The meaning of his stance however is of course that he is , in a transparently faux naïf and disingenuous manner , siding himself with the nay - sayers , and manifestly not occupying some claimed neutral ground of raised - eyebrow abstention .
We ’ll come to that now .
What I tried to explain next to Jim was made difficult by the animosity that was building up as a result of the charged nature of this debate .
I think Jim was not used to being contradicted , I think he found the European admiration for Al Gore disgusting , and the whole British liberal attitude to the environment little short of socialistic , anaemic , pansy and pretentious .
All the usual problems red-blooded Americans of his stamp have with Britons , in fact .
And I have no doubt my tone , my voice , my vocabulary , my whole demeanour , affect and style contributed to this feeling and compounded it .
And I too was upset and angry at his dismissive , illogical , contemptuous tone .
I am not proud that I was unable to have a less strident and , ultimately , mutually intolerant discussion .
But there .
I am not here to abase myself before you , nor unfairly to trash an opponent as it were behind his back .
The subject is too important for any of those considerations to weigh with us .
We ’ll come back to Jim later .
I feel a bit of a heel or dragging him into the blessay at all , which could stand alone as my feeble contribution to the global warming debate , but I think it ’s worth framing it anecdotally as I have , partly because most of us have found ourselves in some similar kind of impassioned debate and partly because it speaks to a particular cultural difference between Britain and America , which , as I say , is a topic I ’ve been asked to think about in my blogging .
So we ’re down to this thought .
One is free to make the entirely valid observation that one cannot know for certain whether the scientific doom - saying on the subject of the planet , its rising temperature and the dire climactic and other consequences is true .
One is free to observe that in the past scientists have been wrong .
One is free to observe inconsistencies , evasions , exaggerations and discrepancies in the supposed ‘ one - voice ’ clarion cry emanating from the scientific community , environmental journalists , the green movement , the carbon off - set industry and others .
In other words one is free to do nothing .
Ye - es but … you see the one overwhelming fact about the great climate debate is what ’s at stake .
Not scientific reputation , not the fortunes and comforts of capitalists and their populations , not pride or reputation but our very civilization .
So let ’s break it broadly down to three responses to such a cataclysmic prophecy of doom .
There is Response A. Type A believes the preponderance of established scientific evidence .
Whether Type A believes it because they are equipped to do so , or whether they believe it because they are gullible , or whether they believe it because they are stupud , or whether they choose to / pretend to believe it because they are anti-progress , anti-capitalist , anti-global economy , communist , hippy or anarchist is neither here nor there .
They believe or profess to believe that there is a pressing threat to the continuation of human life on this planet such as we have known it since the earliest civilizations began to build harbours and ports on the edges of the land .
It ’s a big deal .
Then there is Type B. Type
Bs do not believe this .
They think the evidence is wrong , misinterpreted , flawed , misrepresented , unconvincing , not to be acted upon .
Type A will call Type Bs “ deniers ” which irritates them with that suggestion of holocaust denial , not to mention its accompaniment of that special whiff of sanctimonious self - righteous and political correctness that many
Bs observe will always hang about your classic Type A .
Type B believes the evidence is either manufactured , ignored or slanted .
They believe that the whole eco industry and the thousands of academic departments which have sprung up have a vested interest in those alarm bells .
They think it ’s political correctness , a new orthodoxy , liberal , bossy and dishonest .
Finally there is Type C , the category into which Jim falls .
Type C says : “ I can not possibly know .
I hear this from one side and that from another .
Both seem convinced , both seem to be marshalling impressive technical figures to their side .
I can not make a judgment . ”
Obviously there are views that shade between the three categories but in essence you either believe , deny or sit on the fence .
The consequence of these responses runs something like this : A , the believer , will , or at least should , attempt to do something about the threat they believe in : I mean , look what ’s at stake , how can they not ?
In his or her small way they should support green initiatives through the ballot box , attempt to leave less of a carbon footprint in their personal lives , make environmental restitution for jet travel and other apparently deleterious activities through carbon offset schemes and the like .
All very baffling , bewildering , embarrassing , inadequate , shambling , liberal and possibly useless no doubt , but the planet ’s in danger so surely , ( wringing of hands ) we should try ?
By planet , I mean planet - as - we - know - it , of course .
It is obvious that the good old earth will carry on a -spinning whatever happens to its ozone layer and climate systems .
B meanwhile will carry on as if nothing is different , for as far as he is concerned , nothing is .
Bs only wish they could survive long enough to see the smug self - righteous sorrowful smile wiped from A ’s face when in a hundred years it is made plain that there never was any great threat to the climate , to the environment or the ecosystem and that at worst it was a conspiracy of anti-capitalists and at best a muddled , credulous screw up .
And C ? The Jims of this world ?
Well they , of course , are functionally exactly the same as B .
They do not know .
Case is n’t proven , so why should they vote for massive changes to the way the world does business , massive alterations to the convenience and pleasures of our way of life , just on a 50/50 hunch ?
Ah , but that ’s the point .
It ’s what ’s at stake that matters in a bet like this .
If B is wrong and there really is a threat of the kind A claims , then not doing anything about it will destroy human habitations , make extinct many species , and fundamentally alter our habitats around the planet .
But if A is wrong and actually there is no threat , then acting as if there was will have what consequences ?
It will have saved fuel bills all over the world , reduced noxious emissions which , even if one does n’t believe in global warming , are unpleasant pollutants in anyone ’s reckoning , and slowed down the day when we find that the fossil fuels have run out .
Action would have given us more time to find alternatives .
To be fair , it will also have slowed down world growth and inconvenienced all of us in our personal lives and if A Types do turn to have been wrong they may well owe the world an apology and it ’ll be red faces ( and a brake in the inexorable rise in world economic growth and fuel mineral use ) all round .
But surely that ’s a small price to pay for backing a losing horse when the stakes are the planet itself ?
Doing nothing risks everything and gains comparatively little , doing something risks comparatively little and gains the whole world .
Surely you ’d have to be an idiot not to back the believers in this instance .
I ’ll restate it once more just to be clear .
For the eco - believer it ’s no-lose situation : we all survive if they ’re right and we ’ve acted on their belief , we survive if they ’re wrong and we ’ve acted on their belief .
Whereas for the eco - denier we survive if they ’re right and we ’ve done nothing but we perish if they ’re wrong and we ’ve done nothing .
Some of you may be thinking this is just a reiteration of Pascal ’s Wager .
Better to back the existence of God , the 17th century French mathematician and philosopher argued , because if you ’re wrong it would n’t matter , for after death there ’d be oblivion , while if you were right there would be a great reward .
Being atheist on the other hand risks eternal damnation .
The smart money ’s on taking a chance on God .
You ca n’t lose , it ’s either oblivion or paradise .
For the atheist , it ’s either oblivion or lakes of fire in perpetuity .
So is my suggestion , no more than a restatement of that frankly silly ‘ reason ’ for believing in God ?
Well .
Pascal ’s
Wager is silly because , arch rationalist as he was , he is not giving a reason for belief in God , he is giving a reason for behaving as if God exists , a motive for believing in God , if you like .
Which is all very well , but if God is all that he is cracked up to be he would see through such slippery self - interest and condemn you to those lakes of fire anyway .
God is not asking , or certainly was n’t in Pascal ’s day , for man to follow an ethical code , no religion I know has ever suggested such a thing ( although they might argue ethical codes follow upon religious obervance – but that ’s a whole other can of worms for another day )
God was asking for obedience , belief praise , thanks and observance .
He has never offered in Christianity , Judaism or Islam , so far as I can tell , to reward those who merely punt on the side of his existence .
For that reason , aside from its greasy moral turpitude , Pascal ’s Wager sucks .
Does my wager fall at the same fence ?
Well I do n’t think so , for a motive to behave as if the global warming prognostications were true does not offend some God of Global Warming who will only make the earth safer if full and proper belief is proffered .
Not does it skip round some holy motive for behaving greenly .
No environmentalist will care whether someone does their best because they are a true believer or because they are hedging their bets .
The wager here is fair and good .
So , I suppose I am saying this .
Those who believe , the A types , should take action on global warming .
B types , who do n’t believe , are free not to though they would n’t lose out by taking action , except in small ways which , placed in the scales against the potential losses … well , I ’ve made that point .
But C types .
Types like Jim who sit on the fence and claim not to know enough , they surely are the ones for whom the wager makes the most sense .
“ I do n’t know the science , but I do know that the smart money is on taking action . ”
That ’s all they have to realize .
So , far from justifying inaction , not being sure overwhelmingly justifies action .
Or so it seems to me , and so I tried to express the other night around a table .
I might as well have saved my breath .
It got all very unpleasant .
“ Are you calling me a liar ? ” was the response to my suggestion that claiming neutrality was a dishonest argument because it automatically sided Jim with the deniers .
“ I mean the argument is dishonest ! ” “ You ’re calling me a liar ! ”
When I proffered self - deception over dishonesty it hardly helped .
Two things we must agree on .
One is the feeble stupidity of searching gleefully for signs of hypocrisy in those who believe the world is getting warmer .
You ’d be as well to search for it in Christians , those worried about poverty or anyone else who professes to an ideal .
The other , from the believers themselves , is the foolishness of building a climate of inquisition in which the purity of everyone ’s environmental credentials is tested and exposed .
If you create an atmosphere in which driving a car , going on holiday , leaving a light turned on or failing to recycle a bottle is accounted a crime , a failing , a weakness , something to be loudly condemned , then you will lose the earth , for no self - respecting human being is going to be recruited to a cause whose spokesmen are as self - righteous religious zealots , making impossible demands all at once on fallible human beings .
Experiencing global warming first hand .
On way to Tennessee North Carolina border in the Gt Smoky Mountains National Park
I suppose I must claim self - interest here .
I do think it sensible for us all to respond to the theory of man made global warming and its potentially disastrous impact on the planet as if it were true .
But I am also a useless bag of shit , or human being .
I will therefore be seen from time to time in a car which is n’t an economical planet - pleaser .
I will leave lights on .
I will forget to recycle .
I will travel .
I have paid money to carbon trusts who promise to offset the damage my carbon footprint causes , but apparently ( according to some at least ) this is n’t the way forward .
It ’s all very hard and I ’m not even sure that I can claim that I do my best .
But I am doing my best to do my best .
If that sounds weaselly and flabby and cowardly , that ’s because it is .
But I suspect that ’s how most of us who believe in the threat of global warming are : will we have the courage to vote for a political dispensation that will force through what needs to be forced through and enact what needs to be enacted ?
I do n’t know .
But I do know that we need more heated arguments around dinner tables and less self - delusion and evasion .
Act for the worst and hope for the best .
In some ways I am sorry I seemed to make an enemy , on the other I am glad to have had the fierce evening with him .
Fierce overheated evenings are needed at evening meals all over the world .
This blessay turns out to have been complicated , repetitive and rather laboriously expressed .
I ’m sorry for that , and if I had more time I ’d go back and smooth it out .
Heigh ho .

Apparently , it does n't take much to start a soccer riot in Peru ; all you have to do is trap a soccer ball with your ass .
In Peru , Efrain Viafara , a midfielder for Sport Ancash , created an uproar when he used his buttocks to trap the ball .
His bit of unorthodox skill was interpreted as a mocking act by Universitario players , who chased Viafara .
Fans began to fight in the stands , then poured onto the field before the referee abandoned the game .

Are Peruvians so easily offended ?
They legitimately riot after seeing this trick , to the point that they cancel the game ?
Heavens , we can't imagine how they 'd react to that guy who scored with his penis a few weeks back .
We do n't particularly want to try .

Apparently it ’s been confirmed .
Your new Batman ( for the upcoming Justice League movie ) is none other than the one and only Armie Hammer !
No , not Arm and Hammer … Armie Hammer .
Yes , the legendary actor who has appeared in 1 episode of Desperate Housewives , 1 episode of Veronica Mars and 1 unforgettable episode of Arrested Development .
And let ’s not forget the small roll he had in Flicka too .
Yup , your Batman is 21 years old with a face that could pass for a 14 year old .
This is your new Dark Knight .
He ’s a physically big dude , coming in at about 6 ’ 5 so he ’s certainly got the build I guess .
Look , do n’t take my sarcasm as a knock on Hammer .
For all I know he could be a great actor ( or not ) .
But this just feeds even more to the jokes about “ Teen Titans ” .
Is this REALLY the guy you want as the Batman ?!?!
I ’ve said it before and I ’ll say it again …
This movie , Justice League … is DOOMED .
Part II - Internet Thought Control Bill Under Fire
Internet Thought Control Bill Under Fire
House Committee Dismisses Criticisms of
Internet Thought Control Bill – H.R. 1995 By Michael Collins
Scoop Independent News
Washington , D.C .
Part 2 ( Part 1 )
On Monday , Dec. 17 , the House Committee on Homeland Security posted this document in response to the many criticisms of House Resolution 1955 , The Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007 .
Part 1 of this series examined the dangers that this bill posed to citizens and political groups using the Internet .
Based on the bill contents and the witnesses called to elaborate on the supposed problem of " homegrown terrorism , " it appears that House bill and the Senate look alike ( S.1959 ) pose a significant threat to political expression and free speech , particularly on the Internet ( see Thought Control on the Internet and this collection for more detail ) .
H.R. 1955 passed by a 404- 6 margin on Oct 23 , 2007 .
On Nov. 6 , 2007 , the Subcommittee on Intelligence , Information Sharing and Terrorism Risk Assessment held a one hour plus hearing .
Witnesses from " think tanks " elaborated on the need for the legislation .
( Full video ) Mark Weitzman was highly specific in portraying the Internet as a major source of violent radicalization .
He showed slides of Internet web sites ; he included some domestic political groups with very high visibility , and defined the threats as net - based communication and proselytizing .
( Video of Weitzman testimony )
Sen. Barak Obama ( D - IL ) wrote
The Independent and said
he has no position on S. 1959 ( the Senate equivalent of H.R .
1955 ) .
This followed The Independent 's story that
his emails to constituents indicated support for the bill .
There was a huge reaction to this hearing by U.S. political groups across the political spectrum .
The reaction was so strong that presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) revised his apparent position of support as indicated in emails to constituents .
In a recent email to The Independent the candidate 's staff said that “ Senator Obama has not taken a position on S. 1959 .
Should the bill be considered by the Homeland Security Committee , he will carefully evaluate it , as he does with all pieces of legislation , ”
Committee on Homeland Security Staff Issues Response
Rep .
Harman 's subcommittee hearings sparked the controversy surrounding this legislation .
Yet the main committee staff issued the three page response , not the subcommittee staff .
The use of the committee staff may indicate some serious damage control .
The Internet is not the third rail of U.S. politics but its heading in that direction .
On the first page of their response , the committee staff stated :
This legislation in no way restricts thought or speech .
Both of these are legal activities that should be encouraged by all segments of our society and are welcomed in our system of open debate and dialogue .
Radical thinking is not a crime and this legislation does not turn radical thinking into criminal behavior .
It 's good to know that free thought and speech are still legal .
However , there have been several extended periods in U.S. history where free thought and speech were seriously threatened .
The most recent is the period dominated by McCarthyism from the late 1940 's through the 1950's .
The Smith Act ( Alien Registration Act ) of 1940 has a 20 year jail term for anyone who " prints , publishes , edits , issues , circulates , sells , distributes , or publicly displays " information that would lead to the overthrow of the government .
The McCarran Internal Security
Act also enabled this period calling for " alien exclusion and deportation laws and allowing for the detention of dangerous , disloyal , or subversive persons in times of war or internal security emergency … "
During this time , the House Un- American Activities Committee ( HUAC ) and Sen. Joseph McCarthy ( R - WI ) terrorized citizens by calling them as before congressional committees where they were accused of being disloyal to the United States .
Victims included people who merely attended a rally deemed subversive ; those who formerly sympathized with the left but were disillusioned ; active leftists ; and completely uninvolved citizens smeared through guilt by association .
Few prosecutions came of these hearings .
But for years , the message was clear – " watch what you say , do n’t be too critical , and be careful who you associate with or we 'll defame you by simply calling you before either of these committees . "
Now we 're told , " Trust us . "
We 're supposed to trust despite heavy self censorship by the corporate news media since 911 .
We 're supposed to trust despite the rapidly expanding " legal " options for spying and surveillance by federal law enforcement .
We 're supposed to trust despite the smear tactics used against administration opponents .
" Myths and Facts " from the Committee Staff
The committee devoted a page to what they called " myths and facts " about H.R. 1955 .
Here are their " myths " stated in the exact terms of the document .
These are the errors by critics of the legislation and the committee .
Through our flawed logic and the magic of the Internet , we 've already created " myths " about major legislation passed at a time when the House was supposed to consider only routine bills .
" Myth : H.R. 1955 is a “ thought crime ” bill that attempts to legislate constitutionally - protected speech . "
Staff , Senate Committee on Homeland Security ( Committee staff )
The criticism of the bill was n't that it " attempts to legislate constitutionally - protected speech . "
Rather , the concerns expressed were that the legislation lays the foundation for subsequent laws to do just that .
In the mean time , just the hearings put a chill on those who adamantly oppose the current administration .
Another concern was that strong opposition to elected officials was not the same as opposition the " government " since many administration opponents believe strongly that those officials are subverting the government .
This myth is only in the minds of the committee staff since the bill consists of definitions , findings , and the creation of a commission and academic centers to define what constitutes violent radicalization .
" Myth : H.R. 1955 is a “ thought crime ” bill that attempts to legislate constitutionally - protected speech " .
Committee staff
Who said that ?
As with the first myth , the committee staff has created what 's called a " straw man " – misstating an opponent 's argument .
By refuting what was n't said , the committee staff raise suspicions that the fears expressed are valid ; namely that this bill lays the foundation fur such legislation .
" Myth : H.R. 1955 discriminates against particular races , ethnicities and religions . "
Committee staff
This bill is an equal opportunity enabler of thought control and limitations on free speech .
The key witness supporting the entire concept chose to mention those who doubt the veracity of official explanations for 911 and those who adamantly oppose the government 's immigration and border policies .
These two groups mentioned in slides presented by the witness , slides which just happened to be among others mentioning " pro Iraqi sympathizers .
The guilt by association was no accident .
" Myth : H.R. 1955 will lead to Internet censorship . "
Committee staff
Correctly stated and very accurate !
Both House and Senate bills define " violent radicalization " as a problem leading to " homegrown terrorism . "
The definitions section of H.R. 1955 is clear that simply " facilitating ideologically based violence " is a major threat to national security .
(2) VIOLENT RADICALIZATION -
The term ` violent radicalization ' means the process of adopting or promoting an extremist belief system for the purpose of facilitating ideologically based violence to advance political , religious , or social change .
H.R. 1955 SEC .
899A .
DEFINITIONS
What does " facilitating " mean ?
Posting strongly worded charges against elected officials can inflame terrorists who read the posts .
The Internet poster does n't need to know the individual or be affiliated in any way , by the bill 's definition .
It 's the loosest possible standard allowing a purely arbitrary connection between those with strong views and those who commit violent acts .
Who will make these judgments ?
The Internet is a key part of the process .
(3) The Internet has aided in facilitating violent radicalization , ideologically based violence , and the homegrown terrorism process in the United States by providing access to broad and constant streams of terrorist - related propaganda to United States citizens .
H.R. 1955 SEC .
899B .
FINDINGS .
If you define " facilitating " terrorism over a key medium , the Internet , what else will the bill do but result in restrictions , i.e. , censorship ?
Are they going to study this , then say , " OK , the Internet allows these evil deeds to take place .
Interesting is n't it . "
No , they 're going to hold more hearings , have those doing the " facilitating " called to showcase their inflammatory political views , and then come up with legislation to stop the activity .
They do n't even need a law for these hearings .
Investigation is sufficient cause to ruin a career or movement , as they tried with the 911 Truth movement .
Myth : H.R. 1955 is unnecessary because the threat of violent radicalization and homegrown terrorism does not exist in the United States .
Committee staff
This is a cheap rhetorical trick .
By using the double negative , the committee staff tries to corner critics of the legislation and label them as fools who think that there 's no threat of homegrown terrorism in the United States .
We 've already seen defamation and guilt by association presented to an attentive Harman subcommittee for two domestic political groups mentioned at the hearing .
The Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth ( Video at 5:10 ) seeks to clear up the causes of the WTC towers collapse in order to understand who the true terrorists are .
The anti immigration advocates who so strongly oppose current border policies are clear that one of their concerns in that porous borders are an opportunity that can be turned to the advantage of terrorists .
These groups do n't have to be right to have the right to free speech .
Their views do n't need to be comforting to have the protection necessary to exercise that free speech .
What the committee staff talking about ?
Who thinks that there 's no threat from " homegrown " terrorist acts ?
In Summary
The first , second , and last " myths " are examples of misstating an opponent 's case by creating " a straw man , " then responding to that misstatement .
That leaves just two myths that might characterize the position of the critics .
The stated myth of discrimination against one group is one belied by the cross section of groups opposing the legislation .
It 's the fear that this bill will be universally applied that drives the opposition .
The claim that this is not " internet censorship " is myth propagated by the Committee , subcommittee , and their supporters .
Right now , the bill creates a standard for " facilitating violent radicalization " that could include many individuals and groups on the Internet who simply despise the Bush – Cheney administration and hold Congress in extreme contempt .
On the one " myth " that the committee got straight , that of " Internet censorship , " we 're left with " Trust me . "
Is n't that what Bush and Cheney said when they convinced Congress to pass the Iraq War Resolution ?
Are n't we paying for that naïve trust right now ?
Wo n't the unjust costs continue for decades to come ?
Trust has to be earned .
The characterization of critics and their arguments was misleading as presented by the committee statement .
The response to the one accurately stated criticism , internet censorship , amounts to nothing more than " Trust me . "
The nature of the dialog at this point is hardly encouraging given the response of the committee staff .
Efforts will continue to stop this legislation before it becomes yet another tool in the arsenal of those who wish to end dissent and reinstitute conformity and quiescence .
This is not what 's called for given the state of the nation and the world today .
If Congress is looking for the cause of " violent radicalization , " it need look no further than 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and within its own chambers .
Was n't it the White House that proposed the Iraq War Resolution and the Congress that passed it ?
Are they not responsible for the incredible brutality of the war on Iraq , the clear cause of the severe hostility toward the United States ?
