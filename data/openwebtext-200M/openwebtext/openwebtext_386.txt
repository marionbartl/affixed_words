On Friday nights , the parking lot of an 18 - unit apartment building in Pompano Beach fills with white plastic lawn chairs .
The men who gather there seem , at first blush , to have nothing in common , displaying every look possible , from clean - cut preppy to gaunt heroin chic to sunburned construction worker to dreadlocked roughneck .
It 's the sort of commingling you might expect to glimpse if Abercrombie & Fitch , Calvin Klein , and Ecko decided to shoot a fashion spread together .
But these men , of all ages , have lived a similar nightmare .
An insatiable urge to drink alcohol , pop opiates , and maybe smoke some crack cocaine has landed most of them in jail .
They 're like tornadoes that once destroyed everything in their paths .
Their substance abuse has tormented loved ones , terrorized innocents , and made them feel like the scum of the earth .
At 1st Step Sober House , these guys have a chance to kick the habit .
Make amends .
Start fresh .
" This is frontline recovery , " says Chris Doherty , a director at 1st Step .
" This is n't some Gucci-ass , Kumbaya program . "
On the night of last January 25 , the men arranged their plastic chairs in a circle and Richard Entriken , 1st Step 's 60 - year - old founder , stepped into the center .
He was tall and George Clooney - handsome , with a gray shadow of a beard and eyes that crinkled happily even when he was n't smiling .
Entriken had picked up a few cocaine charges in his wild days and carried on a long love affair with liquor .
But that night in January , he was marking 16 years of sobriety — showing the newbies at the meeting that they too could lead a clean and contented life .
Entriken chose Mike Banas , a 39 - year - old with spiky blond hair whom he had helped to put down the crack pipe ten years earlier , to present him with an Alcoholics Anonymous medallion in honor of the occasion .
A teary - eyed Entriken accepted the token and launched into one of his motivational speeches .
The men sat in rapt attention .
Entriken spoke in his booming baritone of how grateful he was to his wife of 24 years , Sandra , for once kicking his sorry behind to the curb .
One of his favorite mottos was , " Tough love without compassion is just cruelty , " and Sandra had given him the precise dose of tough love that he needed to straighten out .
He spoke of how important it is to share the message of sobriety and to help others learn to navigate life safely .
He employed another favorite saying , about how the elevator to success is broken and those guys would have to take the stairs .
When he was done , the men cheered .
Richard Entriken personified the 12th and final step of Alcoholics Anonymous , the one that asks the reformed to carry the message of sobriety to others .
In his copy of The Big Book , the Bible of Alcoholics Anonymous , Entriken had bookmarked the chapter devoted to " working with others " with a thin American flag .
In the margins of one page , he had scrawled these words in black ink : GIVE ALL YOU HAVE .
On another , he had highlighted in blue this passage : " Your job now is to be at the place where you may be of maximum helpfulness to others ...
You should not hesitate to visit the most sordid spot on earth on such an errand .
Keep on the firing line of life with these motives , and God will keep you unharmed . "
But even God could n't help the effusive rehabilitation promoter that night .
Sobriety is a gift for those who check into the 180 - bed 1st Step , but there are bills to pay .
Rent is a fact of life , and becoming a responsible member of society is part of the recovery process .
Newcomers to 1st
Step get at least three weeks free before they are expected to pony up cash .
Weekly rent of $ 150 is due on Fridays .
No one knows exactly how much money Entriken had collected from his charges that night , but even if only 100 men paid up , there would have been $ 15,000 on the premises .
Entriken had a routine for taking the money offsite .
Well after all the men cleared out of the meeting , the directors of 1st Step would stand lookout around the property while Entriken carried the cash to his car .
Entriken served two tours as an airborne ranger in Vietnam , and his military training stayed with him .
He was always vigilant , always looking over his shoulder .
But as he approached the driver 's side of his truck with the rent money shortly after midnight that Friday night in January , he and his sentries were ambushed .
Chris Doherty was standing guard 20 feet away , on SW Second Street .
Banas was positioned on the passenger side of Entriken 's truck , just ten feet away .
Banas saw three young black men wearing Rasta and ski hats jump out from a nearby hedge .
The robbers did n't bother to cover their faces , and they were carrying guns .
One ran up to Richard Entriken , put a gun to his head , and said , " Hold it . "
As Entriken turned to face his attacker , his eyes seemed to say , What the heck are you doing ?
The young man pulled the trigger .
For Entriken 's protégés on security detail , it was as if time stood still .
Then bullets starting flying .
Rounds whizzed past their legs and over their shoulders .
Banas dove through a hole in a nearby bush , dirt from the bullets hitting his skin .
The assailants fled with the cash .
Entriken was the only man shot .
Chris Doherty ran to his friend and cradled his head in his hands .
Blood was streaming like water from a hose .
A fatal wound .
For the several hundred men he had ushered into the fellowship of sobriety , it felt as if their JFK had been assassinated .
This man , their leader , had overcome much adversity .
He was their hero .
Their idol .
The man they all tried to emulate .
A few weeks later , police arrested Kino Bartholomew , a 30 - year - old former client of 1st Step whom Entriken himself had shepherded to the program from the county courthouse , for allegedly planning the murder .
For residents , it was the ultimate betrayal : Entriken had persuaded a Broward judge to send Bartholomew his way in lieu of jail time .
Courthouse regulars worried that the murder would put an end to the option of diverting nonviolent drug and alcohol offenders to rehab .
The witnesses worried they'd be ambushed again , maybe even outside their own homes .
The remaining directors at 1st Step worried that all their energy and effort combined could not fill the void created by Entriken 's premature departure .
Richard Entriken 's beginnings were so far from the vicissitudes of crime and redemption in South Florida that they seemed almost from another dimension .
He was born in San Francisco , the youngest of Elizabeth and Robert Entriken 's three sons .
His father was an insurance executive , his mother a former billboard model .
Both parents came from well - to - do families , and the Entriken clan was solidly middle class .
When Richard was 5 , his parents divorced and his mother moved to New Jersey , then Manhattan .
She would marry twice more .
Richard and his brother Edward ( " Buck " ) went to live with their mother , but they returned to California each summer to see their father and older brother Robert ( " Rocky " ) .
Buck , who was four years older than Richard , says the marriage split up because he and his baby brother were both abused by an uncle .
Their father refused to believe that the uncle , his brother Van , had touched the boys , Buck says , so their mother left .
For years , nobody in the family discussed the abuse .
" We were in denial , " Buck says .
" Ricky and I have talked about it over the last ten years .
It was n't until my uncle passed that I realized what a huge injustice we were dealt — given a left curve early on .
I do n't think Ricky ever smoked marijuana over that , although it 's a wonderful medicine for someone trying to forget a wrong . "
Rocky , seven years older than Richard , agrees with Buck that Richard always had a sunny disposition .
He was the happy baby brother .
But underneath he was troubled .
As a teenager living on the Upper West Side of Manhattan , Richard started smoking weed .
He did n't play sports and barely went to school .
Buck remembers him befriending young Puerto Ricans like the gang bangers depicted in West Side Story .
He dropped out of school in the tenth grade .
At 17 , Richard joined the Army .
His father , a Navy man , was delighted .
Richard wanted to learn how to parachute out of airplanes , so in 1965 he arrived at Fort Campbell , Kentucky — home of the Screaming Eagles — to train with the 101st Airborne Division .
Then he shipped out to Vietnam .
While in Nam , he picked up two purple hearts , a battered conscience , and an opium habit .
After he returned stateside in 1968 , he lived the rock ' n ' roll lifestyle in Greenwich Village .
He grew his hair down to his shoulders , set up a basement space where musicians could jam , and made crazy money dealing drugs .
To let potential partiers know he could hook them up , Richard wore a gold charm around his neck the size and shape of an aspirin with the number 714 , representing Quaaludes , engraved on it .
Richard may have gotten high with the hardest of the hard drug abusers during the drug revolution of the 1960s and ' 70s — Jimi Hendrix , Janis Joplin , Jim Morrison — but he sure did n't talk much to his brothers about it .
" He did n't tell us about anything he was doing when in the company of drug customers , " Buck says .
Rocky , a straight arrow , worried more about his baby bro's illicit activities than Buck , who felt like everyone at the time was doing drugs .
But Richard was deep into it .
He could have been a wiry , white character in the 1972 movie Super Fly .
He had made so many trips to Colombia that he had to insert extra pages in his passport to accommodate all the immigration stamps .
Soon enough , one of his mules got busted with coke at JFK Airport in New York .
Richard was indicted in 1975 for trafficking cocaine .
" I thought he was a lost cause , " Rocky remembers .
Buck went to Richard 's apartment on Bleecker Street hoping to find a way to help his brother get out of jail .
At the apartment , Buck got a phone call that put his brother 's cocaine cowboy role into perspective .
" A Colombian guy , his Bogotá contact , called and said , ' We 've got a couple pounds coming .
Hope you 're ready . '
I said , ' Holy mackerel ! ' "
Richard served two years in Tallahassee Correctional Institute .
When he got out , he joined his mother in Fort Lauderdale .
And kept partying .
He was styling hair at a salon in an Oakland Park strip mall in 1980 when a customer named Scott Miller sold him out .
Miller had been busted by Fort Lauderdale police for allegedly trying to sell a pound of cocaine .
In an attempt to wriggle into a reduced sentence , Miller told police that , while cutting his hair , Richard had mentioned he could supply dope in quantity .
According to court documents , Miller then told Entriken that some acquaintances visiting from out of town were looking to purchase a kilo of cocaine .
Could he hook them up ?
Miller 's " pals " were actually two undercover cops .
Officer Scott Israel said in a sworn statement that Entriken sold him a gram of powder cocaine for $ 60 outside the now - defunct Press Box Lounge in Wilton Manors .
It was a taster .
Israel added that Entriken agreed to deliver two pounds of coke in four - ounce increments worth about $ 8,000 each .
But after two weeks , Entriken had n't made the drops , so Israel decided to arrest him for selling the gram .
It was a felony , but Entriken got a reduced sentence of community service and probation .
A few years later , in 1983 , Entriken met his wife - to - be .
Sandra showed up at the salon for a haircut .
At six feet , Richard towered over her five - foot - five frame .
Sandra is dainty and soft - spoken ; Richard was sturdy and garrulous .
Sandra shies away from the spotlight ; Richard thrived on being the center of attention .
There 's a photo in the Entriken house of Richard kissing a woman wearing a brown paper bag over her head .
The woman is Sandra , who hates having her picture taken .
Richard cut Sandra 's hair several times before they started dating .
" He was a little wild , fun .
I did n't think it would be a permanent thing , " Sandra recalls .
They married in 1984 , the same year the first of their two daughters was born .
Until she became a mother , Sandra thought Richard 's drinking was manageable .
But sitting at home with a newborn while your husband is out partying is dispiriting .
Sandra noticed that Richard always seemed to have alcohol around , even when he was working or mowing the lawn .
He was a functional drunk , though , able to hold a job and provide for his family .
Then Richard got arrested for a DUI on January 17 , 1992 .
Sandra bailed him out of jail and told him , " No more .
I 'm done .
Finished . "
In AA terms , it was Richard 's moment of clarity .
A cousin took him to his first AA meeting , and Richard Entriken never took a sip of alcohol again .
But he still had to deal with the DUI .
So Entriken hired Fort Lauderdale attorney Mark Skipper .
" He was a hurtin ' cowboy , " Skipper remembers .
Both men were trained paratroopers , and their wives were from the same part of Ohio .
They seemed to have a lot in common , and much to talk about .
" I thought , man , I wish this guy was n't my client because I would like to hang out with him . "
Before long , Entriken would become the kind of guy all sorts of respectable types would want to befriend .
He would become a fixture at the Broward County Courthouse , where he advocated for addicts in court .
And instead of wearing a gold Quaalude tablet around his neck , he now flashed a diamond - studded triangle inside a circle — the AA symbol .
Alcoholics Anonymous formed in 1935 when a small group of addicts realized that they could actually help each other stay sober .
Part of the self - treatment , they believed , involved paying it forward by continually sharing those helpful lessons with others — free of charge .
As former selfish lowlifes , they had incurred a debt to society ; volunteering to help other addicts seemed like the best way to chip away at it .
They 'd even walk into a courtroom and ask a judge to release a problem drinker into their custody after a bender .
In Broward County , the first AA group formed in 1943 and met in Fort Lauderdale .
Courthouse veterans remember an old - timer named Danny Foley working the court alcohol program several decades ago .
Foley was a merchant marine in World War II who became legally blind and started drinking heavily .
He sobered up , though , and concentrated on helping others abandon alcohol .
" People would open up to Danny , " Mark Skipper remembers .
" He had this disarming way about him .
He could manipulate people into realizing that they were addicts . "
By the time Richard Entriken came around , the chain of alcoholics helping one another was well - established in Broward County .
One night early into his recovery , Entriken heard John Williams speak at an AA meeting .
Williams was 12 years his senior and had been sober since 1975 .
Entriken liked what he heard , tapped Williams on the shoulder , and asked the older man to be his sponsor .
Williams took him on .
A few years later , in 1996 , Williams , Entriken , and a friend named Gary Recht started a halfway house in Pompano .
It was the first incarnation of 1st Step , and it was a bumpy ride .
The three made a pact that , if any of them began using again , they 'd be cut off .
They bought a duplex that could sleep eight at a time and spread the word that lost souls could come there to get sober .
One of 1st Step 's early projects was Chris Doherty , a 33 - year - old father who was on the verge of getting sentenced to 17 years in jail as a repeat drug offender .
Mark Skipper was representing Doherty , but the defense attorney was at his wit 's end .
He felt like the young man was incorrigible , like there was n't a chance in the world he could get sober .
Every time Doherty finagled out of a drug charge , he hit the streets looking for crack .
He had stolen from his boss , hocked his own electronics , lied to his wife , and even brought his two - month - old daughter out on drug runs .
Skipper stopped representing him .
Skipper referred Doherty to Richard Entriken , who still saw a glimmer of hope for the young man .
Entriken showed up at his sentencing and pleaded with Judge Richard Eade to turn Chris Doherty over to the 1st Step Sober House rather than send him to jail .
The judge relented .
" I did n't know how to stay clean , " Doherty says .
" I thought I had bad luck . "
Richard Entriken gave him hope , somehow teaching him how to live without drugs or alcohol .
Chris Doherty shocked the hell out of people by getting clean .
Doherty , now 43 , points to a framed certificate hanging inside the 1st Step office that attests to his graduation from the program .
Bruce Springsteen 's " Glory Days " plays on the radio .
" I 'm class of ' 97 . OK , " Doherty says .
" That was one of Richard 's biggest things — he 'd ask for alumni , and class of ' 97 reporting in .
He loved that .
I 'm one of his greatest success stories .
I was able to reinvent my life . "
A few years later , around 2000 , the original founders of 1st Step had a falling out .
Gary Recht had started using again .
And John Williams disagreed with some of Richard Entriken 's methods — such as soliciting clients from jail cells and courtrooms .
" I was not crazy about having these prisoners in there , " Williams says .
Some residents , he adds , were complaining that Entriken was keeping them up late at night with stories and chitchat .
Williams recalls saying , " Richard , do not come around here because as an owner they feel obligated to listen to you . "
If Entriken had a flaw , Williams suggests , it was the way he seemed to play to the crowd .
" He loved to see his success , " Williams says .
" I think he fed off it .
He liked to look at someone and say , ' That guy is alive today because of me . '
One of the reasons I think he liked to pontificate was to impress these guys .
Then you get into that hero worship stuff , which is bullshit .
You did the work .
I only showed you the way . "
Williams says he bought Recht and Entriken out of the partnership , and that Entriken got to keep the 1st Step name .
Until then , Entriken had been helping men find sobriety in his spare time while holding down a sales job at the security firm ADT .
But now he was convinced that he should do it full - time .
He found a few roach - infested buildings in a rough section of Pompano , lined up new partners , and presented his wife Sandra with this plan :
He 'd pick up some odd jobs on the weekends , and the family would live off her income until the sober house started to generate a profit .
" I was scared , financially , " Sandra remembers .
" But I just wanted him to be happy . "
As he drove her past the target properties , though , she remembers squinting and saying repeatedly , " Are you sure ? "
Chris Doherty had been spending a lot of time at 1st Step , helping other men reshape their lives .
So Entriken asked him to join the business .
Chris explains the principle of giving back , talking as if Richard is still there : " I should be in hell for half the things I 've done , just like my partner .
Just like everybody here .
We 've broken a lot of laws , hurt a lot of people in the past .
There 's wreckage we 're constantly cleaning up .
Both Richard and I , our service to the community is how we make amends on a daily basis . "
Richard Entriken seemed to work around the clock .
" I always told him he was gonna die of a heart attack , " Sandra says with a dry laugh .
She remembers the phone ringing at all hours with residents from the house calling about childish stuff like " my roommate stole my blanket . "
Richard was like a father to many of them .
Some even affectionately referred to him as their " old man . "
To show appreciation , those he helped reach recovery might offer him a cigar after an AA meeting .
If they were really looking for approval , though , they'd try to follow in his footsteps and take on a leadership role at 1st Step .
Those devotees were the equivalent of honors students .
For Richard and his imitators , the duties included showing up at the main courthouse in downtown Fort Lauderdale , perhaps five days a week , in a sharp - looking suit at half - past eight in the morning .
Pro bono , they 'd strut into six or more court hearings a day to vouch for defendants desperate for time in a halfway house instead of jail .
Sure , plenty of those defendants would just be looking to beat a prison rap .
But others would truly want to get their acts together .
And how could anyone tell them apart ?
Kino Bartholomew caught his first drug arrest in 1996 , just a few months after he turned 18 .
A confidential informant told cops in Margate that Bartholomew was carrying crack in the waistband of his pants .
When the officers searched him , they found a plastic Krazy Glue container stashed just above his crotch with 2.5 grams of crack cocaine inside .
Bartholomew told the officers that he sold crack as a source of income because he could n't find steady work .
The rocks were going for $ 10 apiece .
In his first police booking photo , Bartholomew looks like Kobe Bryant when he had big hair .
At six - foot - two , maybe Bartholomew could have been a baller .
Instead he became a hustler .
Bartholomew told the officers that he was born in Port of Spain , Trinidad , and that he lived with his grandmother in Pompano .
Bartholomew got busted with crack two more times that year ; Krazy Glue containers seemed to be his hallmark transport vessel for the rocks .
He 'd rattle off a different birthplace for each arrest : Fort Lauderdale , Queens , the Bronx , or simply New York City .
He picked up street names such as " Slim " and " Holdem . "
He sported gold teeth .
In April 1999 , Bartholomew fouled up big - time .
He was parked in a beige 1980 Chevy outside a seedy Motel 6 just east of the Turnpike in Pompano when two Broward Sheriff 's officers pulled up .
Bartholomew , a felon , made a U - turn to avoid them .
In an affidavit , Officer Byron Dickerson said that when he asked the young man for his driver 's license , Kino pulled a silver revolver out of his right front pants pocket .
" I then grabbed the defendant 's hand , at which time the defendant was forced to drop the gun , " Dickerson wrote .
In Bartholomew 's left front pocket , Dickerson said , there were 11 crack rocks inside a Krazy Glue case .
For his actions that night , Kino Bartholomew was looking at a maximum jail sentence of 35 years .
The prosecutor on his case offered him 85 months .
Standing before Judge Stanton Kaplan in 2000 , Bartholomew asked to be considered a youthful offender .
The judge said no .
Bartholomew said he had a drug problem , and asked for leniency .
" I 'm wondering if you can take into consideration that I — I have a family out there that needs me , " Bartholomew said in open court .
" I just had a little girl , you know . "
At that point , Judge Kaplan 's patience seemed to be wearing thin .
" You have told me this already , " he replied .
" I 'm not going to take the blame .
Stay away from guns , stay away from drugs , stay away from driving while your license is suspended — and then you do n't need to go to jail . "
Kino Bartholomew got out of jail in August 2006 .
The following January , he caught the first of several new drug charges .
He hired defense attorney Bill Gelin to represent him .
Gelin got the impression that Bartholomew genuinely wanted to straighten out and that 1st Step could help ; over the years , Gelin had recommended perhaps a hundred people to 1st Step .
He had also gotten to know Richard Entriken at the courthouse .
Richard would regale the lawyer , who was 20 years his junior and fascinated by '60s counterculture , with tales of his days of rubbing elbows with musicians who played Woodstock .
" As soon as you met [ Richard ] , you knew he was the real deal , " says Gelin , who remembers Entriken wearing Jerry Garcia ties to court .
" He 'd been there .
His words were weighted down with experience — you could hear it in his voice , "
Again , Kino Bartholomew went before Judge Stanton Kaplan .
Richard Entriken and Chris Doherty made court appearances on his behalf , asking to have him tossed their way .
The judge released Bartholomew to 1st Step in June 2007 , before Bartholomew 's case even went to trial .
In October , Gelin wrote in a motion for alternative sentencing that Bartholomew " has a sincere desire to attend and complete a residential treatment program . "
Bartholomew was sentenced to complete six more months at the halfway house .
That meant three AA meetings a week .
Curfews .
Rent .
For men living without rules or responsibilities , being at 1st Step felt like boot camp .
And Richard Entriken was their drill sergeant .
Chris Doherty says that , at first , Kino Bartholomew was playing in bounds .
But then he dropped the ball .
He 'd show up late .
Spend nights at his girlfriend 's place in Dania Beach .
" Everything with Kino was a negotiation , " Doherty says .
" He just did n't want to be here anymore .
Richard and him had gotten into it a few times , and when Richard got upset , he was like a bull in a china factory . "
Bartholomew got kicked out of the program in November .
Doherty informed his probation officer of the suspension , and the judge issued a warrant for Bartholomew 's arrest .
Even though Bartholomew had fallen out of 1st Step 's graces , though , he kept dropping by .
In retrospect , Doherty believes Bartholomew was casing the place out .
( Kino Bartholomew , who is being held in the county jail without bail declined to be interviewed by New Times . )
Doherty fumes at the alleged betrayal .
" We both gave of ourselves for him — we would battle for anybody — but Kino turned out to be a fucking monster . "
Chris Doherty has since taken the lead at 1st Step .
He 's at the courthouse every day , dressed to impress like a union boss , standing confidently before the criminal judges , following all the lessons that Richard taught him .
He 's fielding calls from clients , their mothers , and their probation officers .
There are drug tests to be done .
Men to be saved .
He 's leading the mission now .
He still chokes up when he talks about the man whose enormous shoes he 's trying to fill .
" If I wind up being half the man Richard used to be , " Doherty says , his face turning red and eyes filling with tears , " I 'll have lived a full life . "
Mark Skipper still imagines seeing Richard Entriken poking his head around the corner at the courthouse .
" I saw the guy every day and took it for granted .
He was always upbeat .
If you said , ' How you doing ? ' he 'd say ' Fantastic ! '
I mean , I watch out for people like that .
They 're usually mentally ill .
He was a rare breed .
He would talk to everybody .
Some people think you 're crazy if you say ' hello ' to a stranger .
He just loved people .
Everybody in the courthouse knew him . "
And just about everyone at the courthouse suspected that one of Richard 's clients might have orchestrated his murder .
Bill Gelin says : " All of the defense attorneys were saying : ' God , I hope it was n't my guy . '
I drew the short stick . "
Kino Bartholomew was taken into custody in March , accused of premeditated murder .
Gelin emphasizes that Bartholomew is innocent until proven guilty .
Still , he says he could n't possibly represent him in court again .
If Bartholomew was indeed involved in Richard 's death , then he abused Gelin 's trust .
Knowing that he referred Bartholomew to Richard has led Bill Gelin to do a lot of soul - searching in recent weeks .
He says it 's been the toughest blow of his career .
For Sandra Entriken , the pain is unbearable .
Tears stream down her face as she reflects on him from their house in Sunrise .
She stares at a picture of her deceased husband , his gold chain and diamond - studded triangle charm draped over the frame , and says : " I feel numb .
I can't seem to laugh .
This house is too quiet .
He was the most unselfish man .
He saw the good in everybody .
I guess he tried to help the wrong person . "
Richard hoped to retire in a few years , and the couple planned to travel .
They wanted to visit , among other places , Croatia and Alaska .
They talked about buying a second home , maybe in a place where they could dock their 24 - foot boat .
" He was just everything to me and so many people . "
On the evening of January 31 , hundreds of people — former clients , attorneys , judges — crammed into Fred Hunter 's Funeral Home in Davie to pay their respects to Richard Entriken .
The roads leading there , University Drive and Interstate - 595 , were clogged too .
" It looked like going into Joe Robbie stadium for a football game , " Doherty remembers .
Judge Stanton Kaplan made it to the service .
He remembers being approached by dozens of men who thanked him for sending them to 1st Step .
For giving them a chance .
Stanton has been assigned to preside over Entriken 's murder case , but he plans to recuse himself .
His history with both Kino Bartholomew and Richard Entriken would make it impossible to remain impartial , he said in an interview .
Rocky Entriken remembers being completely " knocked back " by the turnout that evening .
He realized his brother had straightened out and that he was helping others do the same , but he never imagined the extent of the positive impact that little Ricky had on other lives .
" I thought : Wow , my kid brother who was such a mess turned out to be a success .
And I was happy for him .
He really had become that person we had always hoped against hope that he'd be . "
Richard Entriken would have liked it — he always did love a room full of people .
VIENNA ( Reuters ) - Glaciers and mountain snow are melting earlier in the year than usual , meaning the water has already gone when millions of people need it during the summer when rainfall is lower , scientists warned on Monday .
Mount Everest , the highest peak in the world , with an altitude of 8,848 metres ( 29,028 feet ) , is seen in this aerial view March 25 , 2008 .

“ This is just a time bomb , ” said hydrologist Wouter Buytaert at a meeting of geoscientists in Vienna .
Those areas most at risk from a lack of water for drinking and agriculture include parts of the Middle East , southern Africa , the United States , South America and the Mediterranean .
Rising global temperatures mean the melt water is occurring earlier and faster in the year and the mountains may no longer be able to provide a vital stop gap .
“ In some areas where the glaciers are small they could be gone in 30 or 50 years time and a very reliable source of water , especially for the summer months , may be gone . ”
Buytaert , from Britain ’s Bristol University , was referring to parts of the Mediterranean where her research is focused but she said this threat also applies to the entire Alps region and other global mountain sources .
Daniel Viviroli , from the University of Berne , believes nearly 40 percent of mountainous regions could be at risk , as they provide water to populations which can not get it elsewhere .
He says the earth ’s sub-tropic zones , which are home to 70 percent of the world ’s population , are the most vulnerable .
And with the global population expected to expand rapidly , there may not always be enough water to drink , let alone to water crops , which use about 70 percent of melt - water .
In Afghanistan , home to some 3,500 of the world ’s glaciers , the effects of global warming are already being felt in the Hindu Kush said U.S. Geological Survey researcher Bruce Molnia .
“ Glaciers are getting smaller and smaller , ” he said adding that this was leading to more frequent flooding .
In some valleys snow has completely disappeared during months when it usually blankets the mountains and many basins have drained , Molnia said .
“ And what I am talking about here is adaptable to almost every one of the Himalayan countries that ’s dependent on glacier - melted water , ” he said .
It has also been difficult to collect data in the region with scientists preferring to rely on satellite imagery rather risk fieldwork in the Taliban - occupied mountains .
Buytaert points out that because only a handful of scientists study the hydrology of mountains , what they do n’t know about them could be just as concerning as what they do .
“ Mountains are seen as having water all the time and everywhere so people think they can take it all the time , ” she said .
“ But mountains are black boxes in the scientific sense , there is so much data missing for our models .
We do n’t quite know what is going on . ”

WisCon May 23 - 26 , Madison , WI Closing Music : “ The Fall ” by Red Hunter .
Tideline
By Elizabeth Bear
They would have called her salvage , if there were anyone left to salvage her .
But she was the last of the war machines , a three - legged oblate teardrop as big as a main battle tank , two big grabs and one fine manipulator folded like a spider ’s palps beneath the turreted head that finished her pointed end , her polyceramic armor spiderwebbed like shatterproof glass .

On May 25 , NASA 's Phoenix Mars lander will enter the Martian atmosphere at nearly 13,000 miles per hour , complete a complex seven - minute series of events , then land on the red planet to begin a three - month mission to explore Martian soil and ice .
Some 500,000 people are expected to watch this on the Web : Few of those people will be more interested than Jeanne Holm , chief knowledge architect for NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , and one of the IT leaders responsible for making sure all the images and video from this high - profile mission get managed and delivered to NASA staffers and the public without a hitch .

Few IT pros will ever work on a project as high - profile as a Mars landing .
For Holm , this is round two :
She also managed content for NASA 's JPL during the last Mars mission in 2004 .
Holm and some of her colleagues gave us a look at the massive amount of data and effort it will take to accomplish their IT mission , as well as the tools and strategies they 're using , from content management to hardware hosting .
By the way , unlike many enterprises today , NASA is not afraid to go Web 2.0 .
This Mars landing will also be broadcast in its own area on Second Life .
Millions of Viewers , One Big Question
This Mars mission seeks answers to some huge questions , the biggest being whether the Martian arctic can support life .
To answer that , the mission will ask what the history of water is in the area , and how polar dynamics shape the climate of Mars , for example .
The scientists will make use of gadgets far more innovative than Apple could imagine , the coolest of which may be a robotic arm built by JPL that will dig , scoop and grab soil and ice for analysis .
( For a more complete description of the mission and the equipment and team involved , see this primer from the University of Arizona . )
A unique robotic scoop arm will work with the lander to dig into Martian soil
The mission team includes scientists from the University of Arizona , NASA engineers from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , and flight systems experts from Lockheed Martin Space Systems .
Holm works on the content management part of the mission along with colleagues including Carla Bitter , education and public outreach manager for the mission for the University of Arizona , and Charles White , JPL 's expert on virtual world technologies , who heads up the Second Life work .
When you see the images coming back from the mission next week , you can thank Bitter and Holm and their teams .
From an amazing array of images , Bitter and an editorial board hand - select which ones are most useful for public , museum and scientific audiences .
Bitter compares it to picking the world 's most exotic flowers from a hothouse each day .
Consider the scope of this content management project .
First , video and images must travel from Mars on a unique journey via NASA deep space antennae , before making their way onto NASA computers and the Web .
As Holm matter - of - factly puts it , " Our data is millions of miles away . "
Yet , beginning with the Mars mission in 2004 , images coming from deep space could appear on the Web within about 15 minutes or so of NASA receiving them .
" It was a huge mindshift , " Holm says .
" Before , scientists would analyze the images for hours , days , weeks , before publishing them with the analysis .
Now that analysis happens with the worldwide community in real time . "
In fact , circa 2002 , NASA 's content management infrastructure was far from sophisticated , Holm says .
A single server in the basement was supporting the NASA website where the public got news of missions , she says .
If you visited the site back then , you might see a message like " Tune in at 3 for a press conference " , she adds .
" That was state of the art for large events at NASA , " Holm says .
" Delivering information via the Web was a " time - consuming , onerous process . "
The 2004 Mars mission benefitted from NASA 's launch of a new portal in 2003 and working with content management vendor Vignette to better manage and publish its content to its internal and public audiences , Holm says .
" For this [ 2008 ] mission , we are continuing what we did in 2004 , where we provide ' real time ' images as they are received on Earth from the spacecraft , " Holm says .
" We see them at the same time as the public sees them . "
The NASA site will serve real - time video of the Earth - based events , conferences , science discussions , and so forth .
The actual video from Mars must travel for a while via deep space antennae then be processed on Earth before it is posted .
So it 's not " real time " video from Mars , but it 's still showing up rather quickly .
How many people will tune in on the Web ?
" Well over 250,000 users watched the mission control proceedings on NASA TV , with more than 50,000 connecting simultaneously , " Holm says .
" In 2004 there were more than 60 million unique visitors and over 550 million page views and 17.5 billion hits .
Based on trends since then for our other missions and launches , we expect to see a significant increase to this , perhaps twice as much . "
The May 25 landing will also be watched live at 100 to 150 large - scale museum events in the United States .
As for the sheer volume of data involved , the group served more than 330 TB of data in 2004 when the last Mars landings occurred , Holm says .
There 's no doubt that figure will increase .
To manage all those images and video , Holm , Bitter and their colleagues rely heavily on in - house content management and outside hardware and caching help .
How NASA Outsources IT
" We get huge peaks of interest , " says Holm .
" We want to handle those peaks — but have a cost - effective organization as well .
The way we architect and serve information is key . "
The images and video that the team is handling are going out multiple ways to various audiences : internally to NASA staffers , and to the public via the University of Arizona 's web servers and the NASA.gov site .
A key tool the team uses in - house to keep the content organized is Vignette 7.2 ( specifically , Vignette Builder and Vignette Portal ) , Holm says .
Remember , the mission 's content is feeding to podcasts , NASA TV on the Web , Second Life , and elsewhere .
" We 're taking the same content and representing it in many different ways and by all means , " Holm says .
Vignette has been key for the teams at University of Arizona and JPL trying to cull the best images from the mission , Bitter says .
" In previous missions , a system like this did n't exist and people were sharing images via external drives , " Bitter says .
Some of the images are put up immediately and captioned , or sent to museum audiences , while others are made part of huge mosaic pictures that display the majesty of what the NASA spacecraft encounters , she says .
In addition to the sheer volume of data that must be sifted through , challenges included the large , dispersed team , Holm says .
" The content management system has to be easy to use and agnostic , " she says , " It 's all about speed and accuracy of data . "
Externally , the group uses SunGard to host the NASA Portal hardware and uses eTouch Systems to manage it for the NASA CIO , Holm says .
Akamai handles the caching .
NASA TV also gets some additional streaming assistance from Yahoo , Holm adds .
Video on the Web represents one of the biggest changes for modern - day missions for the public , Holm says .
" There 's a visceral response we get from people .
They feel like they 're really there . "
And this video failing because of overwhelming demand would be a lot more embarrassing than the now infamous Victoria 's Secret Web fashion show .
" Having the hosting site external to the NASA network means we can get our jobs done , Holm says .
The metrics that NASA measures her group by are a bit different than that for most IT leaders .
" Internally , if we do n't have the accurate data out there , we 're crucified , " she says .
" Our scientists are very specific . "
The second key metric : " The speed at which the content , analysis , video , is being pushed to the public .
To a big extent , we 're judged on our ability to serve that content . "
That 's why working with SunGard , Akamai and Yahoo becomes critical , she says .
" You really have to understand you do n't want to make it so that success is a problem .
We know we 're not going to do it ourselves . "
NASA Ventures into Second Life
Among the content management lessons learned so far , NASA 's content gurus now push harder to target efforts to various audiences .
" Our public audience has become more sophisticated , " Bitter says .
" There are 8 - year - olds out there downloading our podcasts . "
" We work really hard at explaining things to the public , " Holm says .
" Our audience continues to grow .
As the public becomes more educated , the challenge becomes , how do we continue to give new people understandable information , plus give other people more scientific information ? "
Questions like this boil down to information architecture , Holm says .
Her team wants an eight - year - old or a scientist to be able to drill down from the front page to find what he wants .
That 's one reason why the information architecture continues to become much more sophisticated , she notes .
Another difference in this Mars Mission : User - generated content will play a big role , by public request .
In a strange twist of fate , NASA learned its first important lessons about user - generated content at a tragic time .
Holm 's team was working on launching the NASA portal for the four weeks preceding the space shuttle Columbia crash .
" The intent was to bring it up the following Monday , " Holm recalls .
" I decided to do load testing as we went live , " she says , so her team pushed the portal live a bit ahead of schedule .
" Ten hours later , we lost the shuttle , " she says .
Members of Congress and the public alike were able to come into the portal and get updates , she notes .
" It was a horrible tragedy , but in that moment , our IT team was able to help the public . "
Today , her team wrestles with new Web 2.0 technologies , encouraging more dynamic collaboration between the teams using blogs and wikis , and encouraging new public participation via the Second Life project .
Phoenix mission launch , as seen in Second Life
" It 's a huge change , " Holm says .
" If people want to be engaged with NASA , we want them to be part of the family .
It 's brought a huge sense of excitement to us , too . "
On May 25 , people who want to watch the landing in NASA 's new locale in Second Life can come dressed in virtual space suits , sit in virtual bleachers , and hang out in an atmosphere that 's a long way from the beaches of Florida during the famous space race days of the 1960s and 70s .
" We 'll have the entry , descent and landing synchronized with NASA television , " JPL's
White says .
Be sure to check out the spacecraft models and virtual Mars landscape , if you do visit , he adds .
IT Leadership Lesson
On a personal level , what 's it like being part of the IT team supporting a Mars Mission ?
" These events are energizing and exhausting at the same time , " Holm says .
" We bring sleeping bags into the office .
These sorts of events , you just do n't sleep . "
Finally , here 's her IT leadership tip for those of us who are earthbound : " The key is the leader needs to pace the team , " Holm says .
" You ca n't stress out every piece of your team at the same time . "
Stonehenge may have been a cemetery for a ruling dynasty
Stonehenge served as a burial ground for much longer than had previously been believed , new research suggests .
The site was used as a cemetery for 500 years , from the point of its inception .
Archaeologists have said the cremation burials found at the site might represent a single elite family and its descendents - perhaps a ruling dynasty .
One clue to this idea is that there are few burials in the earliest phase , but that the number grows larger in later centuries , as offspring multiplied .
Under the traditional view , cremation burials were dug at the site between 2,700 BC and 2,600 BC , about a century before the large stones - known as sarsens - were put in place .
Professor Mike Parker Pearson , from the department of archaeology at the University of Sheffield , and his colleagues have now carried out radiocarbon dating of burials excavated in the 1950s that were kept at the nearby Salisbury Museum .
Their results suggest burials took place at the site from the initiation of Stonehenge , just after 3,000 BC , until the time the large stones appear at about 2,500 BC .

The earliest cremation burial dated - a small pile of burned bones and teeth - came from one of the pits around the edge of Stonehenge known as the Aubrey Holes and dates to between 3,030 BC and 2,880 BC - roughly the time when the Stonehenge monument was cut into Salisbury Plain .
The second burial , from the ditch surrounding Stonehenge , is that of an adult and dates to between 2,930 BC and 2,870 BC .
The most recent cremation comes from the ditch 's northern side and was of a 25 - year - old woman ; it dates to between 2,570 BC and 2,340 BC , around the time the first arrangements of sarsen stones appeared at Stonehenge .
The latest findings are the result of the Stonehenge Riverside Project , a collaboration between five UK universities .
Details of the research are to be featured in National Geographic magazine .
Royal circle ?
Professor Parker - Pearson , who leads the project , said : " I do n't think it was the common people getting buried at Stonehenge - it was clearly a special place at that time . "
He added : " Archaeologists have long speculated about whether Stonehenge was put up by prehistoric chiefs - perhaps even ancient royalty - and the new results suggest that not only is this likely to have been the case , but it also was the resting place of their mortal remains . "
Two other Stonehenge experts , Professor Tim Darvill , from the University of Bournemouth , and Professor Geoff Wainwright , from the Society of Antiquaries , have a different theory about the monument .
They are convinced that the dominating feature on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire was akin to a " Neolithic Lourdes " - a place where people went on a pilgrimage to get cured .
They recently carried out a two - week excavation at the site to search for clues to why the 4,500 - year - old landmark was erected .

What are these ?
WASHINGTON  State officials say they will soon ask Congress for more power to regulate the marketing of private Medicare insurance plans to older Americans because they are still receiving complaints of high - pressure sales tactics that have led some beneficiaries to sign up for unsuitable policies .
The proposal would be a profound change , but state officials say it is needed to protect consumers and reduce confusion .
Of the 44 million Medicare beneficiaries , 25 million are now enrolled in some type of private plan  either a Medicare Advantage plan , which provides a wide range of health services , or a free - standing prescription drug plan , which covers just medicines .
In the draft of a report prepared by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners , state officials say they have received large numbers of complaints but , in most cases , cannot provide direct assistance to beneficiaries or hold insurers accountable .
In the report , the state officials propose setting common standards for marketing the private plans , which could then be enforced by states that adopt them .

I ’ve written before ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) about discrepancies in the election results from New Jersey ’s February 5 presidential primary .
Yesterday we received yet another set of voting machine result tapes .
They show a new kind of discrepancy which we have n’t seen before – and which contradicts the story told by Sequoia ( the vendor ) and the NJ Secretary of State about what went wrong in the election .
The new records are from three voting machines in Pennsauken , District 6 .
We have the result tapes printed out by all three voting machines in that district ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) .
As usual , each result tape has a “ Candidate Totals ” section giving the vote count for each candidate , and a separate “ Option Switch Totals ” section giving the voter turnout in each party .
We also have the Democratic vote totals reported by the county clerk for that district ( and some others ) , which were apparently calculated from the memory cartridges used in the three machines .
The county clerk ’s totals show 279 votes in Pennsauken District 6 .
The per-candidate counts are Clinton 181 , Obama 94 , Richardson 2 , Edwards 1 , Kucinich 0 , Biden 1 , which adds up correctly to 279 .
The turnout sections of the three result tapes also show a total Democratic turnout of 279 ( 133+126+20 ) .
But the Candidate Totals sections of the tapes tell a different story .
Adding up the three tapes , the totals are Clinton 181 , Obama 95 , Richardson 2 , Edwards 1 , Kucinich 0 , Biden 1 , which adds up to 280 .
The Candidate Totals on the tapes show an extra Obama vote that does n’t appear anywhere else .
( Everything seems to add up on the Republican side . )
The State claimed , in response to some ( but not all ) of the discrepancies I pointed out previously , that I had misread the tapes .
This time the tapes are absolutely clear .
Here are the Democratic candidate totals from the three tapes :
Here are the turnout sections of the three tapes :
( These images are all scans – the original documents Camden County sent me are even clearer . )
This is wrong .
It is inconsistent with Sequoia ’s explanation for the previously - noticed discrepancies .
It is inconsistent with the State ’s theory of what went wrong in the election .
It ’s time for an independent investigation .
Class instantiation performance
I 'm writing a GFF3 file parser .
I have a class which looks like
class GFF3 Feature ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , seqid , source , type , start , end , score , strand , phase , attributes ) : self .seqid = seqid self .
source = source self .
type = type self .
start = start self .
end = end self .
score = score self .
strand = strand self .
phase = phase self .
attributes = attributes
# The normal way class Feature1 ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , seqid , source , type , start , end , score , strand , phase , attributes ) : self . seqid = seqid self .
source = source self .
type = type self .
start = start self .
end = end self .
score = score self .
strand = strand self .
phase = phase self .
attributes = attributes # Copy from locals .
Learned this one from a posting by Alex Martelli . class Feature2 ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , seqid , source , type , start , end , score , strand , phase , attributes ) : self.__dict__.update( locals ( ) ) del self .
self # Bypass normal creation and assume the input is correct class Feature3 ( object ) : def __init__( self , ** kwargs ) : self.__dict__.update( kwargs ) self .
__class__ = Feature1 # __slots__ might give better performance class Feature4 ( object ) : __slots__ = [ " seqid " , " source " , " type " , " start " , " end " , " score " , " strand " , " phase " , " attributes " ] def __init__ ( self , seqid , source , type , start , end , score , strand , phase , attributes ) : self . seqid = seqid self .
source = source self .
type = type self .
start = start self .
end = end self .
score = score self .
strand = strand self .
phase = phase self .

I need to create a lot of these .
What 's the fastest way to instantiate them ?
I know a few ways .
My contraint is the normal ( public ) interface must have a constructor interface which requires all parameters and does not accept other parameters .
Here are the ones I tested : A bit of timing harness
The resultsLooks like my best solution is Feature3 , which uses a private interface to build the class , then do an in - place change to the public interface .
That would be wrong though .
Python classes have extra overhead with keyword arguments vs. positional ones .
I 'll change the code a bit to redo the Feature1 , Feature2 and Feature4 tests with positional arguments .
( The Feature3 approach requires keyword arguments . )
def create ( cls , x ) : for _ in x : a = cls ( " qwe " , " wert " , " exon " , 100 , 1000 , 0.1 , " + " , 0 , {} ) return a
Feature1 min= 0.485749006271 avg= 0.498355899538 stddev= 0.00987560013671 Feature2 min= 0.613602876663 avg= 0.632926872798 stddev= 0.0336558923515 Feature4 min= 0.344656944275 avg= 0.351382800511 stddev= 0.00944194461424
The times are : Calling Python with positional parameters is faster ( by a factor of 2 ! ) than with keyword arguments .
The fastest approach uses __slots__ .
Guido once wrote :
__slots__ is a terrible hack with nasty , hard - to - fathom side effects that should only be used by programmers at grandmaster and wizard levels .
Unfortunately it has gained an enormous undeserved popularity amongst the novices and apprentices , who should know better than to use this magic incantation casually .
Am I a grandmaster ?
I 've never written a metaclass .
My view has been to shy away from cute code and stay with obviously readable code .
There is very little in the way of guidance for when to use __slots__ .
There is guidance of when not to use it , eg , to imply that a class is final / closed and catch accidental typos in instance assignment .
Here 's another quote , this from Alex Martelli :
__slots__ is , essentially , an optimization ( in terms of memory consumption ) intended for classes that are likely to be created in very large numbers : you give up the normal flexibility of being able to add arbitrary attributes to an instance , and what you gain in return is that you save one dictionary per instance ( dozens and dozens of bytes per instance -- that will , of course , not be all that relevant unless the number of instances that are around is at the very least in the tens of thousands ) .
I 'd recommend against using __slots__ ( unless really needed for optimization ) , because it cripples the usefulness and generality of your classes to your and also * to other people 's * code ( weakrefs , pickling , reflection -- all compromised ) .
The first two you could fix ( but are unlikely to , unless you * yourself * need to use weakrefs or pickling of instances of those classes ) , the last one you can't .
The fact that someone 's code using __slots__ makes other peoples code less useful ( because things that work fine for instances without slots suddenly screw up ) makes me think introducing __slots__ was a rather bad idea to start with .
So my advice remains : consider __slots__ for classes which may need to be instantiated a HUGE number of times , if the restrictions that __slots__ imposes can be lived with .
Like for all optimizations , you 'll probably want to measure things , at some level , BEFORE you optimize .
Alexander Schmolck said : Going back to Alex :
My view is that this is a simple data container class .
There is no reason anyone will inherit from it .
It 's more work to inherit from this class than it is to make a new class with the same duck - type interface , such that no one can tell the difference .
The negative problems of __slots__ should not arise .
The 30 % performance boost , at least in micro timings , is significant .
I implemented the code and using __slots__ speeds up my overall timings by about 5 % .
I think in this case it 's worthwhile .

BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - Two Belgian beer fans have launched a video game named ‘ Place to Pee ’ , which allows players to slalom down ski slopes or kill aliens while relieving themselves at urinals .
Werner Dupont , a software developer , and Bart Geraets , an electrical engineer , got the idea while drinking Belgian trappist beers , they told Reuters Television at a local festival on Sunday .
“ This thing had to be invented by Belgian people and that ’s what we are , ” they said .
The ‘ Place to Pee ’ booth is designed for two users at a time and offers two games -- blowing up aliens in outer space or skiing down a virtual slope .
Gamers hit their target by aiming at sensors positioned on either side of the urinal .
A specially designed paper cone allows women to play too , the inventors say .
Their ‘ Place to Pee ’ logo resembles ‘ Manneken Pis ’ , the little urinating boy fountain that is among Brussels ’ top sightseeing attractions .

World affairs correspondent BBC News website
Bush saw the war of the " advance of freedom "
The war in Iraq was supposed to be over long before now .
It was not supposed to provoke a conflict between Sunni and Shia or stir up an al - Qaeda hornet 's nest .
Nor was it supposed to alienate much of the rest of the world from US foreign policy , which post 9/11 was on the crest of a wave of sympathy .
It was intended , its proponents argued , to remove a threat to world peace and to plant the flag of freedom in a Middle East democratic desert .
The critics countered that the threat was an illusion , that the US was invading illegally and sought control over the region and Iraq 's oil .
Bush doctrine
The Iraq invasion was also part of President Bush 's doctrine of pre-emption and of his hopes for what he called the " advance of freedom " .
The war was not supposed to provoke several years of bloodshed
In a speech in November 2003 he declared : " Iraqi democracy will succeed - and that success will send forth the news , from Damascus to Teheran - that freedom can be the future of every nation . "
His doctrine , under which a pre-emptive attack is justified even if the threat is not critical , has been another casualty of the war .
Dr Dana Allin , Senior Fellow for Transatlantic Affairs at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London , said : " All three candidates in the US presidential election will move away from it in significant ways .
" To a significant extent the experience in Iraq has discredited the doctrine of pre-emption , though it has not killed it off .
But the US will not naively invade again and simply hope everything will turn out OK , as seems to have happened in Iraq . "
Hopes rise again
The last chapter on Iraq of course has not been written .
After the recent improvements , there are claims that it will still all work out , not unlike the Korean War , which went through its own disastrous phase .
" This has to be the worst managed foreign policy of any president since the Second World War "
David Rothkopf , Carnegie Endowment
The former White House economist Lawrence Lindsey , who believes the financial cost of the Iraq war is " relatively minor in budgetary terms " , still hopes for the best .
He wrote in Fortune magazine : " A stable Iraqi government selected by its own people would be a first in the Arab world .
It would suggest that there is a third alternative to the current choice between repressive regimes and Islamic fundamentalism . "
One of those who called in 2006 , not for a withdrawal but the surge , was Washington writer Frederick Kagan .
In the neo - conservative bible , the Weekly Standard , he says it has worked and credits the American commander General David Petraeus and his subordinate General Raymond Odierno : " When General Odierno relinquished command of MNC - I [ Multi- National Corps Iraq ] on February 14 , 2008 , the civil war was over .
Civilian casualties were down 60 % , as were weekly attacks .
AQI [ al Qaeda Iraq ] had been driven from its safe havens in and around Baghdad and throughout Anbar and Diyala .
The situation in Iraq had been utterly transformed . "
The cost However , even if the war turns out to be " winnable " , its critics dismiss any suggestion that it was " worth it " .
The Bush administration has faced a public opinion backlash David Rothkopf , a former Clinton administration official and now with the Carnegie Endowment in Washington , said : " Declaring this to be a success based on recent improvements is like saying that a person badly disabled by gunshots has seen his wounds heal .
The damage has been done .
" Bush 's foreign policy has been a failure and it will be judged on Iraq .
He will bear responsibility for an unnecessary and costly war that violated international law , alienated allies and distracted us from the core issues of terrorism , Afghanistan and stopping the spread of nuclear weapons .
" This has to be the worst managed foreign policy of any president since the Second World War .
Even if in the medium term Iraq becomes comparatively peaceful , would it be worth the cost ?
I do not think so . "
The diplomatic fallout As for America 's standing around the world , the war alienated some major American allies , France and Germany most notably .
Others did send troops after the invasion - Spain and Italy among them - but then left as public opinions at home turned hostile .
The war 's critics dismiss suggestions that it was " worth it "
On the other hand , a number of smaller countries , many of them from the former Soviet block , saw an opportunity to show their loyalty to the US and sent contingents - the Czech Republic , Poland , Georgia and others .
For them , a strong and active United States bodes well for their future security .
In turn , Britain 's support for the United States has led to further divisions within Europe .
These had an impact in the Lisbon treaty talks about a future foreign policy for the EU , strengthening the British determination to keep it firmly in the hands of individual governments .
The invasion of Iraq also caused alarm bells to ring in Russia .
There , a new mood of hostility to the West has developed and the Russians have become wary of American power .
Nor has Iraq sparked the democratic revolution in the Middle East that Mr Bush hoped for .
And the Israeli / Palestinian conflict remains unresolved .
Ironically it is Iran , with which the US shares a mutual hostility , that has emerged with greater strength , to the concern of the Gulf Arab states .
The fallout continues .

People Who Brief People : White House stonewalls on its involvement in military analysts scandal Eric Brewer
Published : Tuesday May 20 , 2008
|
Print This Email This White House equates Pentagon propaganda with liberal blogging Wonder of wonders I got called on during the White House briefing without Les Kinsolving putting the press secretary under duress .
That 's the first time that 's happened in two months .
Between March 19 and Monday , I attended 10 briefings and was ignored at every one except for the time Les spoke up on my behalf on April 30 .
Yesterday , I asked Deputy Press Secretary Scott Stanzel about White House involvement in the Pentagon 's recently suspended domestic propaganda program ( also known as the military analysts scandal , or ' Psyops on Steroids ' ) .
Press Secretary Dana Perino had denied White House knowledge of the program in response to my questioning on April 30th , but last week , Salon 's Glenn Greenwald showed that her denial was false .
Glenn published several emails ( gleaned from 8,000 pages of documents relating to the program that the Pentagon was forced to disclose after it lost a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit ) that showed that White House officials Karl Rove and Stephen Hadley had known about the program .
My exchange with Scott Stanzel follows : Me : The White House has denied that it knew about the Pentagon program that used TV military analysts 
Stanzel :
We 've been through this before .
Do you have a question ?
Me : Yeah , there 's something new .
Last week emails surfaced that showed that Pentagon officials , including Donald Rumsfeld , communicated with White House officials , including Karl Rove and Stephen Hadley , about the program .
One email written by a Pentagon official mentions that Rove was approached about arranging a meeting between the military analysts and the President .
My question  Stanzel : Your question is ?
Me :
My question is : what was the nature and extent of the involvement of Karl Rove , Stephen Hadley , and President Bush in the military analyst program ?
Stanzel :
Well , the idea that people in the administration would brief people who are talking to reporters about our programs and our policies does n't seem , like , to be that farfetched of an idea to me .
So in terms of the emails , I have n't been monitoring the staff emails here , so I can't tell you what their conversations were like .
But it 's not unusual for administration officials to brief people who are talking about our plans and our policies , much like I 'm standing here today briefing all of you 
Me : Right , and why was the program kept secret ?
Stanzel : and much like I 'm standing here answering your question , and you go out on your liberal blog and talk about , you know , the way that you see things ; we brief people who talk about the President 's policies .
Me :
Why was the program kept secret ?
Stanzel :
You can talk to the Defense Department .
It was their program which they 've discontinued .
[ calling on another reporter ]
Yes .
Me : Who was in charge at the White House ?
Confronted with evidence of the White House 's involvement , Scott was forced to abandon Dana Perino 's assertion to me three weeks ago that the White House had no knowledge of the program .
Indeed , he implicitly concedes that White House officials discussed the program with their counterparts at the Pentagon .
But in his attempts to defend the program , he equates a secret multimillion - dollar Pentagon psyops operation directed at the American people and , apparently , overseen by the White House with him briefing the press from a podium and my reporting of it on what he describes as my " liberal blog . "
First of all , Scott , RAW STORY is n't a blog , and I 'm a reporter , not a blogger .
Second , unlike many of the military analysts , I do n't have financial ties to corporations that will benefit from the inside information you give me .
Third , if there was nothing wrong with the program , why was it kept secret , why did the Pentagon fight a two - year lawsuit to keep it secret , and why did the Pentagon then stop the program , at least temporarily , after it lost the lawsuit ?
The White House briefings are broadcast on C - SPAN and available to anyone in the world with an Internet connection .
The military analysts , on the other hand , were instructed not to quote their briefers directly or otherwise describe their contacts with the Pentagon .
What were they hiding , Scott ?
And finally , I can understand why you 'd consider most of the rest of the White House press corps to be nothing more than administration " message force multipliers " as the military analysts were termed by the Pentagon but I 'm not .
The only parallel I see is that , just as the Pentagon did with the few military analysts who strayed from their talking points , you have cut off my access when you do n't like what I write .

The preceding article was a White House report from Eric Brewer , who will periodically attend White House press briefings for Raw Story .
Brewer is also a contributor at BTC News .
He was the first person to ask about the Downing Street memo at a White House briefing .
Victims in Chicago Police Detective Timothy J. Murphy ’s homicide cases were leaving behind important clues : cell phones showing incoming calls just before the times of death .
But the calls increasingly led to numbers dialed by prepaid cell - phone users and that ’s a dead end , Detective Murphy explained in a letter sent nearly two years ago to state and federal lawmakers , because phone companies usually do n’t maintain the identities of the phone buyers .
“ In the last several months , many of my homicide investigations have been hindered due to the major obstruction that ‘ prepay ’ or ‘ pay as you go ’ cellular telephones that litter the market cause , ” he wrote .
“ I am seeking your assistance in introducing legislation to regulate this loophole . ”
He ’s still waiting .
“ Nobody did anything , ” the eight - year veteran of the city ’s homicide squad said in a phone interview last week .
Although no bills are pending in Congress , legislation requiring photo identification for prepaid - phone purchases is surfacing in statehouses nationwide .
The National Conference of State Legislatures is following bills in Michigan and Georgia .
Lawmakers in New Jersey , Texas and Pennsylvania also have considered legislation .
Neil Cohen , a Democratic state assemblyman sponsoring a pending bill in New Jersey , said he was required to show photo ID when he recently purchased a cell phone with a normal billing account .
“ If I ’ve got to produce a photo ID , I do n’t think there should be a distinction for a prepaid phone , ” he said .
But privacy advocates and telecommunications and retail groups question whether the bills will do anything to catch criminals .
“ We ’ve had some obvious concerns , ” said Joe Farren , spokesman for Washington - based CTIA , the Wireless Association .
“ You ’ve got 255 million wireless phones in circulation right now .
It ’s going to be terribly difficult to prove whether someone is providing false identification , ” Mr. Farren said , adding that wireless - phone carriers “ work very closely ” with law - enforcement authorities .
“ The overwhelming number of wiretaps are on wireless lines , ” he said .
Verizon Wireless spokesman John Johnson said the company asks for photo identification when a customer wants to buy a prepaid cell phone , but Verizon does n’t retain those records .
“ It ’s only to verify that the person is who he or she says , ” Mr. Johnson said .
Katherine Albrecht , an outspoken privacy advocate , said such legislation raises fears about government intrusion .
She also said that some people , such as victims of stalking , may need to use anonymous phone lines .
“ There are some serious reasons you would want that ability , ” she said .
Larry Frankel , state legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union in Washington , said the bills set a precedent for lawmakers to require identification to purchase other products .
“ There are people who do bad things with every product , ” Mr. Frankel said .
“ What ’s the next item going to be ? ”
Pennsylvania Rep. Eddie Day Pashinski , a Democrat , said his bill provides law - enforcement authorities with a much - needed crime - fighting tool .
“ The drug dealers are very smart , and they ’ll get someone else to purchase the phones , but at least that still gives law enforcement a person to talk to , ” said Mr. Pashinski , whose pending bill would require two forms of identification to buy prepaid cell phones with cash .
“ The retailers and some of the phone companies are definitely going to put up a fight , ” he said .
James Pasco , executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police ( FOP ) , the nation ’s largest law - enforcement union , said difficulty tracking down information on prepaid users can delay or even thwart investigations “ from street - level drug dealers right up to terrorists . ”
In 2006 , the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security issued nationwide bulletins telling police agencies to be on the lookout for bulk purchases of prepaid cell phones .
Authorities cited concern about terrorism links .
“ If there ’s legislation out there that would handle the problem fairly , I think we would support it , ” Mr. Pasco said .
Detective Murphy said he sent letters to the FOP and state and federal lawmakers , including presidential hopeful Sen.
Barack Obama , Illinois Democrat , who forwarded it to the Federal Communications Commission , saying he was “ troubled by the issues raised by Detective Murphy . ”
A response from the FCC ’s Wireless Telecommunications Bureau told the detective what he already knew : “ Wireless carriers typically do not receive or obtain detailed subscriber information from prepaid customers . ”

" To die for an idea ; it is unquestionably noble .
But how much nobler it would be if men died for ideas that were true ! " ~ H. L. Mencken
Before you send Johnnie off to earn his college tuition the hard way — make sure he can read all the " Warning Labels " that pertain to military service .
He wo n’t find these as easily as the Surgeon General ’s Warning on his cigarettes even though cigarettes are slower killers .
There are classes in schools that warn about " casual unprotected sex , " but not many about casual unprotected war .
The government schools , being infested by sycophants beholden to the State , will have coffee and doughnuts ready when the recruiters arrive to make sure Johnny gets a crack at trading an eye or a leg or a mind or a life for some college tuition and some shiny medals — maybe even a Gold Star .
Take some time and look at a couple of the glitzy new recruiting sites for the armed forces of the United States and see if you can find anything in the form of a warning that would really tell the whole truth about what could happen as a result of trying to " be all that you can be . "
Even if they warn about injury and death — they are not going to talk about being ordered to kill people under less than honorable and lawful circumstances .
The military sites are not going to directly criticize their Commander - In - Chief for getting them into an unlawful , unconstitutional war .
They are no more " Fair and Balanced " than Fox News .
And the generals turn into pussycats after they retire , or , worse yet , " War Entrepreneurs " — still shilling for the War Party — with at least One very rare exception .
The Few , The Proud , The Constitutionally Literate ?
If the US Marine Corps were really all about being " Semper Fi " to Honor and the Constitution before anything else , they would treat Major General Smedley D. Butler , USMC , Retired [ the most highly decorated marine ] with a lot more honor and respect .
And if they would do justice to him there could be a lot of injustice prevented .
Go to their site and look for him .
His name is good for naming military bases — but his perspective on lawful and unlawful war is not being taught by the Marine Corps or the other armed services .
There are important reasons for that .
You can search their site for him by clicking here .
Another subject not often mentioned on those enticing recruitment sites : The Constitution .
Major General Butler was never a pure " Peacenik . "
A fierce adversary on the field of battle , he was always in favor of Lawful War for Lawful Defense and Never for Aggression or Plunder .
This is precisely the position of the Founding Fathers and the Framers of the Constitution .
When he found out the truth about war he turned against the Machine .
And that is the honorable reaction for a True Marine and True Patriot .
When confronted with Truth he takes his position on the side of Truth .
It would be one thing to bury his history after he left the Corps if he had turned against his country and dishonored the uniform .
But General Butler continued to serve his country — and its veterans — better and better in the years after his active duty — until he even thwarted a fascist coup to take over our government — and finally risked everything including his reputation to boldly come out against the Warfare State and the Military Industrial Complex — exposing War in general , as the Racket it is and always has been .
Apparently other retired generals have not been so quick to join his ranks .
If this was not a " Marine ’s Marine " there is no such specimen .
Even his Two [ 2 ]
Congressional Medals of Honor cannot do justice to this man , who , even now , in his death , has the potential to save thousands , perhaps millions of American lives , as well as the lives of millions upon millions in other countries , who should not , who must not , be lost to benefit the Warmongers among us who have become drunk on the blood of Empire .
" HELL NO — WE WON ’T GO ! "
In my opinion , no young person who cannot intelligently discuss General Butler ’s book , " War Is A Racket , " should be permitted to join any of the armed forces .
I would further insist that all military personnel be schooled in " War Crimes Avoidance . "
This would primarily be centered on teaching the difference between lawful and unlawful orders and lawful and unlawful wars .
Most military personnel do not consciously think about this until perhaps after their service — or never — according to Smedley Butler .
They just follow orders .
That is why Michael New is such an anomaly .
We put warnings on all sorts of products .
I once went into a store where they sold motorcycles and other sports vehicles etc .
I could n’t help but notice a large yellow tag fastened on the back of a quad cycle seat .
It read , " Caution : You May Fall Off and Be Killed . "
I am not making this up .
My first reaction was a guffaw .
At the time I wrote that off to political correctness .
I thought perhaps " cause and effect " had been educated out of the culture for such a warning to be necessary .
Kids had been falling off of things for a long time .
But if the same kids that need to see a warning like that are joining the military to get money for college I think severe and repeated warnings are definitely in order and should be required by law .
They are already mathematically challenged if they think most college degrees will result in higher lifetime net incomes than many of the trades .
My plumber used to be a brain surgeon .
We must heed the warnings of a true Hero like Smedley Butler if we are ever going the Preempt the next Preemptive War .
If you have never read his book you must read it and get your kids and all of your relatives and friends to read it — and talk about it — to all of their circles of friends and relatives .
It is an extremely powerful little book — and it is Unimpeachable .
Change a few company names ; add a few zeros to the obscene profits of war , and you will see that this 1935 Classic is quite up - to - date .
Get at least one for your coffee table .
I have set aside a dedicated website to promote the reading of General Butler ’s book " War Is A Racket " and another work of perhaps equal value : " The War Prayer , " by Mark Twain , a short story so controversial that its publication was reserved until after Twain ’s death .
There are a few ways for you to read and promote these works , starting with reading them on line at no cost and linking to them in your emails , on your blogs and on your websites .
You can also purchase a new pamphlet with both works at a nominal charge — or go to Amazon and buy the glossy publisher ’s paperback version of Butler ’s book .
The main objective is to get you to read the pamphlet a few times — or at least until it makes a permanent impression on your mind , heart and soul .
Then you can help us to circulate millions of copies .
Let me know if you want to distribute the pamphlet in volume so we can make it more cost effective for you or your organization .
We will be happy to make a special cover for your organization [ unless it is Fox News ] .
Read both works for free by clicking here .
Or copy and paste this link everywhere you can think of .
You can use the hyperlinked graphic below on the web or in emails .
If you have already read these two works you do n’t need to be told how important they are — you have already been " vaccinated . "
But also please consider this a challenge to help circulate them more widely .
We are at a place where both major political parties see perpetual unlawful war as practically a necessity .
This is the chosen method of suicide for Empires .
I am writing most of this on April 19th , the 233rd Anniversary of The Shot Heard ‘ Round the World from near the Old North Bridge in Concorde , Massachusetts .
There are such things as lawful wars of defense and there are those among us who would trade blood for mammon and sacrifice our children to the god of government .
Know the difference — warn your children — and your countrymen !
" It does not require a majority to prevail , but rather an irate , tireless minority keen to set brushfires of freedom in the minds of men . "
~ Samuel Adams , Father of the American Revolution
Please help all you can — increasing your own understanding until you are competent to teach others to teach others .
The Best of Bill Huff
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The amount of two key greenhouse gases in Earth ’s atmosphere rose sharply in 2007 , and carbon dioxide levels this year are literally off the chart , the U.S. government reported on Wednesday .

In its annual index of greenhouse gas emissions , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found atmospheric carbon dioxide , the primary driver of global climate change , rose by 0.6 percent , or 19 billion tons last year .
The amount of methane increased by 0.5 percent , or 27 million tons , after nearly a decade of little or no change , according preliminary figures to scientists at the government ’s Earth System Research Laboratory in Colorado .
Methane ’s greenhouse effect is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide ’s , but there is far less of it in the atmosphere .
Overall , methane has about half the climate impact of carbon dioxide .
The primary source of carbon dioxide is the burning of fossil fuels , which is increasing , with China now the world ’s biggest emitter , said Pieter Tans , who studies greenhouse gases at the laboratory .
The United States is second .
The greenhouse gas index , based on data from 60 sites around the world , showed that that last year ’s carbon dioxide increase added 2.4 molecules to every million molecules of air , a measurement known as parts per million , or ppm .
OFF THE CHART
Carbon dioxide levels were about 270 ppm in the mid-18th century , before the wide use of fossil fuels that began with the Industrial Revolution .
Last year ’s levels were near 390 ppm , and they have been rising more steeply over the last three decades , Tans said in a telephone interview .
“ The average ( annual rise ) over the last five or six years has been 2 ppm and that is actually steeper than it has been in previous decades , ” he said .
“ This whole decade the rate of increase has accelerated , and we have a very clear candidate ( for the cause ) and that ’s emissions from burning fossil fuels . ”
The rise continued in 2008 , according to a chart of global carbon dioxide emissions onlinehere , which showed world emissions of this gas heading off the chart at over 386 ppm .
“ It ’s gloomy , ” Tans said .
“ With carbon dioxide emissions , we ’re on the wrong track , it ’s obvious .
And I ’m also fully convinced that we ’re in actually quite a dangerous situation for climate . ”
The increase in methane emissions after years of little change may indicate that methane locked for thousands of years in frozen Arctic soil known as permafrost is being emitted into the atmosphere as the soil melts .
“ What used to be in the deep freeze is now being taken out in the warming , ” Tans said .
It is also possible that the 2007 rise in methane emissions is due to some other cause .
Methane emissions rose sharply between 1978 and 1998 and then leveled off .
Pulse of American Political Identity February 23 , 2008
Posted by Daniel Downs in abortion
A recent Gallup poll asked a little over 1,000 Americans the following question : “ In politics , as of today , do you consider yourself a Republican , a Democrat , or an independent ? ”
The graph below reveals how Americans responded compared to similar surveys for the past three months .
According to Frank Newport ,
The last time 40 % of Americans identified as Democrats was August 2000 .
Before that , there have been just a handful of Gallup Poll telephone surveys — going back to 1985 — in which 40 % or more of Americans identified as Democrats .
The highest Democratic identification in a Gallup telephone poll was 42 % in July 1987 .
The highest level of identification with the Republican Party , 39 % , has been reached at three points : in May 1991 ( a few months after the first Persian Gulf War ) , December 2003 ( in a poll in the field at the time of Saddam Hussein ’s capture ) , and September 2004 ( after a successful Republican convention at which George W. Bush was nominated for a second term in office ) .
In a January 30 , 2007 Gallup study , surveys dating back to 1988 demonstrate show near equal divide between Americans who identify themselves as Democrat , Independent , and Republican .
The average percent of Americans who see themselves as Independents is 35.4 % .
Those who identify with the Democrat party are 33.4 % and 31.1 % of Americans with the Republican party .
Frank Newport thinks election year change rhetoric of Obama and Clinton ’s rhetoric of experience contribute to nearly 20 % more Americans who believe Democrats are more likely to bring about needed change and they would be better at managing the federal government .
The reason a consistently higher number of Americans who identify themselves as Independents is the rising discontent with status quo party politics .
Today , more Americans may be moved by the campaign rhetoric but tomorrow they continue to be distracted .
Obama ’s message may be exciting but it is back a status quo liberal who vote almost always voted party .
Clinton is a great politician who even McCain believes .
However , good campaign rhetoric is not based on truth but on what people want to hear .
She is nothing less than a hard line liberal Democrat .
If either one of them gets into office , they will not veto universal health care SCHIP , immigrant amnesty bills , gay rights legislation , abortion on - demand at home and abroad , unrestricted embryonic stem cell research , conservative speech discrimination like the Fairness Doctrine , bigger or more welfare entitlements ( read not more better paying jobs ) , bills increasing taxes including on the poor , and the like .
This is what they already have been doing .
The graph above and the historical averages shows Republicans are out of step with the society .
If McCain or Huckabee would get into office either one would continue supporting family and moral values , freedom of speech even for opponents of supposed gay rights , ethically regulated stem cell research , reducing federal deficit , economic growth , etc .
It is doubtful that they could–even if they wanted to–end abortion , non-existing constitutional laws like the Separation of church and state ( a.k.a. , religion and public institution ) and the income tax , unconstitutional protection for gay behaviors , no - fault divorce , or poverty , etc .
Because they , like the Democrats , favor and protect the ever - enlarging oligarchy of corporate power and wealth to the detriment of the small , family business–even those with say 30 employees .
Neither party intends to end poverty because to do so they have to make business pay all employees a livable wage .
They would have to restructure welfare so that it was given to small and medium businesses to create new jobs paying a wage people could live on .
To end poverty , welfare based program like NCLB - ESEA , social services , parts of health care and Medicare -
Medicaid , and other federal power increasing welfare programs would have little to no legitimate reason for continuing to exist .
The growing number of Americans who envision no party loyalty is because of reasons like the above .
Political rhetoric does not actually resolve real problems .
The Republic could reduce the number of Independents had those in Congress been willing to maintain their social conservatism while demonstrating dedication to actually correcting the obvious problems .
Ron Paul is the best candidate the party had for that reason .
In sum :
The polls indicate that higher percentage of Americans see neither party as capable of solving our nation ’s problem good .
This is further support the consistently 60 - 80 % of Americans who rate Congress as doing a bad job of it .
The current high percentage identifying with Democrats is probably due to convincing campaign marketing .
Historically , the little over 30 % indicates the number of Americans who are true believers of secular liberalism represented by the ideology of the Democrat party .
The Republican party has a significantly less number of true believers .
The slightly over 30 % who identify with Republican ideology indicate not only the number of consistent conservatives but also a serious problem that needs seriously addressed .
Let ’s not forget exit speech of southern Democrat Zell Miller at the Republican convention .
The way he existed from politics and the Democrat party at least gave a glimmer of hope that Democrats could actually return to their moral roots and adherence to the Constitution .

Until recently , Fiona Bauld thought her 18 - year - old son Jamie had not fully grasped the gravity of the situation he found himself in .
It brought her solace that her child , who has Down 's syndrome and the mental age of a five - year - old , had n't fully comprehended the charges of racism and assault against him , let alone begun to contemplate the consequences .
Scroll down for more ...
Innocent : Jamie Bauld , who has Down 's Syndrome , was charged with racial assult .
He is pictured with his parents
But one night shortly after Christmas , as the family watched TV , Fiona realised to her horror that Jamie was not as oblivious as she 'd hoped .
A scene featuring a prison appeared on screen , at which point Jamie said quietly : " I do n't want to go to jail , Mum .
Please do n't let them take me away . "
He then burst into tears .
" I rushed over , put my arms around him and told him everything was going to be fine , " says Fiona .
" All through this nightmare I 've done my best to put on a smile and act normally around Jamie , simply to protect him from everything that was happening .
But that night , as he sobbed in my arms , I was n't sure everything would be OK .
" My worst fear was that Jamie would be taken away somewhere that I would n't be able to protect him .
I said : ' Jamie , you 're not going to prison ' , but I found myself in tears , too . "
When Fiona - who lives in Cumbernauld , Lanarkshire , with her husband James , 46 , a telecommunications contractor , and their daughter Stephanie , 17 - uses the word " nightmare " she is making no understatement .
Hers is a situation so ridiculous it would be laughable , had the potential ramifications not been so serious .
Her story also serves as a disturbing example of how extreme political correctness can allow minor of incidents to be blown out of all proportion .
The events which have brought her such anguish in recent months begun with what was effectively a playground spat between two individuals with special needs .
It soon escalated into a seven - month criminal investigation that could have resulted in Fiona 's son being hauled before a court and left with a criminal record .
Last September , Jamie - who is 18 but cannot even tie his own shoelaces , needs help on the lavatory , must n't be left alone in the house and still relies on his mother to tuck him up in bed at night - had an altercation with an Asian girl of a similar age , also a pupil at the special needs department of Motherwell College in Lanarkshire , where Jamie is a student .
Put quite simply - girl irritated boy , boy pushed girl and told her to go away .
Then , girl responded by telling her teacher .
The two were sent their separate ways and their parents informed about the falling out .
Given their mental ages , it was no more significant than a playground spat between two five - year - olds .
That should have been the end of it .
Instead , a notice was placed in the local newspaper - it is not known by whom - asking for witnesses to a " racial assault " at the college on the day in question .
Whether this notice led to the police investigation , or whether the family of the girl contacted them directly is still not clear .
Either way , just over a week later , Jamie was charged with racism and assault .
It was an insane example of overzealous political correctness ; a local zero - tolerance policy on racism taken to its extremes without any common sense being applied , let alone consideration for the unusual circumstances of the individuals involved .
After months of stress and fear , the Baulds ' ordeal came to an end yesterday when , in a remarkable climbdown , the Crown Office issued a formal apology to the family for any distress caused over the past seven months .
All charges have now been dropped , but this , says Fiona , is not enough .
Not only have they encountered confusion , red tape and a lack of compassion in their dealings with the Scottish legal system , they are left fearing that Jamie will forever have a blot on his reputation as a result of being charged at all .
" Our family has been put through a terrible ordeal over nothing , " says Fiona .
" It is utterly ridiculous that the authorities brought adult charges against our son , who was not only innocent , but clearly unable to comprehend why he was in trouble .
" For instance , when the police arrived to interview Jamie , he welcomed them with a big smile and a handshake .
As they read him his rights , he said thank you for coming to see him , and agreed with everything they said . "
Those with Down 's syndrome often agree with whatever they are told simply to please other people .
Fiona continues : " I said : ' Do you realise he does n't understand what you are saying ? ' while the police officers shifted uncomfortably and admitted they had no training in dealing with anyone with special needs .
" But the official process had by then swung into action .
From that point on , it seemed there was nothing my husband or I could do to halt it . "
It 's clear that Fiona dotes on her son .
Not only is she frequently tearful as she recalls the past seven months , but she describes how she happily gave up her career in hairdressing to become Jamie 's full - time carer .
It was , she says , the only thing she could do given the circumstances she found herself in .
" We had no idea before Jamie was born that he had Down 's syndrome , and we were told the diagnosis when he was just 24 hours old , " she recalls .
" At the time , I was deeply upset - to the point where I had to be sedated .
But that passed , and if I 'd known what I know now , I would n't have given two hoots about the diagnosis .
" By the time I fell pregnant with his sister , my attitude was that if she has Down 's syndrome too , then that 's fine by me .
I adored Jamie , and did n't wished things had been different . "
Raising Jamie has , nonetheless , been far from an easy task .
He has suffered from respiratory and bowel problems , which have seen his parents spend weeks sitting at his hospital bedside .
On two occasions - when Jamie was ten months old and when he was four - Fiona and James were told to prepare themselves for the worst .
" Hospitals have become a second home to me over the years , " says Fiona .
" I 've spent weeks - months even - at Jamie 's bedside .
But I 've always seen him as a fighter , and no matter what the doctors have told me , I 've always known I 'll be bringing my boy home again .
" Thankfully , he 's always proven me right , refusing to give up even when doctors said there was no hope . "
Since reaching his teens , Jamie 's health has improved and Fiona has watched her son blossom .
" Jamie has got through school , and is now doing a life skills course at Motherwell College , which makes me burst with pride , " she says .
" He has friends , he 's sociable and chatty .
" He 's a very loving , kind person .
He dotes on his sister , and if she is out , he refuses to go to bed until she gets in . "
Indeed , so placid is Jamie , says Fiona , that he steadfastly refused to respond to the provocation of a year of severe bullying at secondary school .
" One boy really started picking on Jamie when he was about 14 , and made his life a misery , " says Fiona .
" He punched him in the face , kicked him on numerous occasions , ripped his clothes and even smashed his glasses .
" Jamie used to come home and tell us he could n't hit this boy back because they were friends .
My son simply has not a got a streak of violence in him , and is so laid back that we always joke that he 's horizontal . "
With this in mind , Fiona was instantly doubtful when she heard Jamie was being accused of hitting the girl at college .
She was n't , however , surprised to hear a dispute had taken place , because her son had already complained of the girl in question .
" Before this incident at college , Jamie had told us on a couple of occasions that this girl kept following him , staring at him and putting her face really close to his without saying anything , " says Fiona .
" We told him just to ignore her , and she 'd soon get bored .
" Then , on September 4 , we got a call from the college saying they 'd had a falling out and Jamie had hit her .
I talked to him , and he was adamant he had n't hit her , but had pushed her away when he was eating lunch .
" I did n't take the event lightly at all - Jamie was meant to be staying with his aunt that night , but I grounded him , and we took away his Playstation for a few days , too .
" I believed him when he said he had n't hit her , but I 'm not a lax parent and I do n't make allowances because of his disabilities .
I wanted to make it clear to Jamie that falling out with students and pushing other people was not a good thing . "
The family went away on holiday , putting the incident behind them .
But on their return , they were notified by the college that the girl 's family had contacted the police , who had taken it upon themselves to question other students and staff at the college .
They now wanted to talk to Jamie about allegations of racism and assault .
" I have to say , at first , the whole thing was so ridiculous I did n't take it that seriously , " says Fiona .
" That said , I was really annoyed about the racism part of things .
Jamie is far from racist .
He does n't even realise the difference between skin colours .
" But the college said the police were coming to interview Jamie and I thought : ' OK then , it wo n't do him any harm . '
" I still wanted to be sure Jamie understood he should n't have altercations with other students , and I thought a visit from the police would help him fully grasp that fact . "
However , the police interview a few days later , Jamie was charged with racism and assault .
" I was panicking and saying it was crazy , that Jamie does n't even understand things like upstairs and downstairs , whether a door is open or shut , but Jamie stood up , shook their hands and said : ' Thanks very much ' , " says Fiona .
" My husband and I did n't know then that we should have insisted the officers return with someone specialised in dealing with people with special needs , or perhaps we could have stopped the entire thing there and then . "
The officers , says Fiona , were pleasant enough and advised the family " the case probably would n't come to anything " .
They said they would explain to the Procurator Fiscal ( a public officer in Scotland who prosecutes in petty cases ) that Jamie had Down 's syndrome .
They revealed that the girl had also admitted to scratching her own face - either to her family or to police officers .
But shortly after the visit , a letter arrived from the Procurator Fiscal saying the authorities had enough evidence to charge Jamie .
2 That was when all hell broke loose for us as a family , " says Fiona .
" I read the letter with shaking hands , and I was crying my eyes out .
I phoned the Procurator 's office five times and asked if they knew Jamie had Down 's syndrome , but no one would talk about the case with me .
" I went to the police , and no one there seemed to know what was going on .
I would have been able laugh at the total chaos and incompetence were it not for the fact that I knew that , at 18 , Jamie is technically an adult .
" I was genuinely terrified that he would end up in the dock on trial for something he did n't do . "
During December , Fiona asked the family lawyer to write to the Procurator Fiscal 's office explaining the situation .
They did not receive a reply .
" We tried to carry on as normal , but I felt as though we were living on borrowed time , and Jamie was going to be taken away from me , " says Fiona .
" It was as though there was an axe hanging over our head the entire time .
We were living with this terrible sense of foreboding .
" The lowest point came when we were watching the prison scene on TV and Jamie started crying .
It broke my heart because it made me feel as though I 'd failed him .
" My natural instinct as a mother , especially a mother of a child with special needs , was to try and protect him from everything around him , and here he was , sobbing his heart out because he was so frightened . "
It was only a fortnight ago - seven - and - a - half months after the initial incident - that the family received a brief letter from the Procurator Fiscal saying he would not be proceeding with the prosecution .
There was no apology .
And despite the Crown 's official apology yesterday , Fiona still feels that they were the victims of " political correctness gone mad " .
A spokeswoman for Down 's Syndrome Scotland is also horrified by the case and called for better handling and understanding .
She says " I 've never met anyone with Down 's syndrome who was racist .
This incident should have been contained within the college .
It has been very badly handled . "
Next week , Jamie is due to return to college , and his mother thinks it is likely that he will forget the happenings of the past seven months long before she does .
" Jamie has said he 's happy it 's all over , and he is back to being his usual sunny self , " says Fiona .
" At the moment , I still feel like a nervous wreck , and I 'm determined to speak out because I want the people in official positions to think twice about what they are doing , and apply common sense to unique situations like these .
" But at least we can start to get on with our lives again .
Last night , as I tucked Jamie up in bed , he asked me once again whether he was going to jail .
" This time , I was able to tell him that no , he definitely , definitely was n't . "

Answers about Obama
So much nonsense about Reverend Wright and Barack Obama .
Is n't it obvious to everyone that this is only a big deal because the Clintons want to play on white voters ' racial fears ?
Obama has never said or done anything to suggest that he shares any of Wright 's offensive views .
But I still hear people saying , " If he could associate with the man for twenty years , he must have heard some of this , and it 's bound to have rubbed off . "
So let 's look at Wright 's comments and see what they mean , and then at Obama 's reaction and see what that means , and then I 'll give you the final , absolutely true answer about how much difference it should make in deciding how to vote .
And then , just for good measure , I 'll take on a comparison between Hillary 's and Michelle Obama 's senior theses , and , because my goal is to be profoundly useful to the world , I will tell you what is significant in these papers and what is not .
Reverend Wright
Reverend Wright made some outrageous comments , but keep some things in mind :
1 . He is of a generation of black Americans who have every right to be angry and unforgiving .
Just because white America would like to be forgiven does not mean African - Americans are obliged to do so .
2 . He was speaking in a black church to a black congregation , not acting as spokesman for a presidential campaign .
Let 's dispense with the " G-- d--- America " line first .
He 's a preacher .
He can use the word " damn " and it is n't swearing .
He can invoke the curse of heaven when he feels it 's appropriate .
I do n't like that he said it or why he said it , but when a preacher damns something , it 's different from other people saying the same words .
I was bothered by the " Jesus was a black man " line .
Jesus most assuredly was not a black man , he was of the people living in Palestine in the first generation of Roman occupation .
They 're not black now and they were n't black then .
But then I remembered all the pictures of Jesus I grew up with -- the light brown hair , gently waving down to his shoulders , the white white skin -- and I realize that for centuries , white Christians have reimagined Jesus as a German or Belgian .
Why should n't blacks have the same privilege ?
The point where I thought Rev. Wright went too far was the insane charge that white people -- the U.S. government in particular -- created the HIV virus in order to kill black people .
This is a blood slander , charging a deliberate campaign of genocide -- and not only does Wright have no evidence , it is not even possible to synthesize any virus at all , let alone one of such complexity , given present technology .
But with this vile charge , Wright reveals the game he 's really playing .
The overall message of his preaching is this :
Black people , nothing that is going wrong in your lives is your fault , and there 's nothing you can do about it except get mad at white people .
No , he reassures them , Africans are n't dying of AIDS because of their own irresponsible sexual behavior , it 's a white conspiracy .
Therefore black people do n't have to change in any way -- it 's all someone else 's fault .
A responsible message would be the Bill Cosby message :
No matter whose fault it is , nobody 's going to fix things unless we fix them ourselves .
So if we keep engaging in self - destructive social patterns , that 's our foolish choice .
Instead , Wright 's anger is really just another way of flattering his congregation .
Making them feel complacent .
For which Wright gets paid .
It 's just like famous 19th - century New York minister Henry Ward Beecher ( whose sex scandal was the model for The Scarlet Letter ) .
He 's the one who invented the phony idea that there was a gate in the wall of Jerusalem called " the Needle 's Eye , " which was so low that camels had to kneel to get through it .
He did this because his congregation was very rich , and Jesus said that it was as hard for a rich man to get into heaven as for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle .
How could Beecher make his congregation feel like good Christians without giving up their obscene fortunes ?
By explaining that all Jesus meant was that rich people had to kneel ( conveniently , at his church ) and they'd get into heaven with their money .
But there never was such a gate in Jerusalem .
And a kneeling camel can't get through any gate , since camels can't , or at least wo n't , move forward on their knees .
What Jesus plainly meant was it 's impossible for rich people to get into heaven , and Beecher could n't deliver that message and keep his job .
Wright , like Beecher , finds it safer to tell his congregation lies than to tell them to get on the stick and change their lives and their culture .
So my disdain for Wright 's preaching is strong .
However , I 'm not in his church so it 's none of my business .
There are plenty of other black preachers telling their congregants the same lies and giving them the same excuses -- but there are plenty of white preachers telling lies to their congregations , too .
That 's just how it is in denominations where the people who do n't like the preaching can change churches or fire the preacher .
Obama and Wright
The real issue is : Should we be suspicious of Obama because of Wright 's teachings ?
Obama has made it plain that he rejects
Wright 's racially divisive teachings .
But he is tied to Reverend Wright by bonds of friendship that transcend doctrines .
They are friends .
Reverent Wright and Obama worked together trying to make life better for poor blacks in Chicago .
Wright was part of Obama 's spiritual awakening and of his search for an identity as a black man .
Obama hardly knew his father .
Wright took on some of that role in his life .
It 's not as if Wright has been accused of a crime other than saying things that make white people mad .
I 'm a white person .
It makes me mad .
So what ?
Wright 's not running for president ; if he were , I would n't vote for him .
Here is my question to those who think Obama should have broken off his friendship with Wright over Wright 's offensive statements :
Do you want as President the kind of person who would deny and abandon his closest friends in order to win that political office ?
Think about your family .
Has your father or your mother or a grandparent or a sibling ever said something you thought was appalling and embarrassing ?
Do any of them hold opinions that you disagree with ?
If your answer to any of those questions was yes , did you respond by breaking off all contact with them and denying your connection with them ?
Sure , Obama called for Don Imus to be fired over his " nappy " remark -- he did n't know Imus ; Imus was not his friend .
It 's easy to call for the destruction of a stranger .
But a friend who is as close as family ?
If you repudiate someone like that just because he said something embarrassing , you are n't much of a friend , are you ?
I think Obama 's behavior has been impeccably correct and completely honorable .
Obama wants to be President of all the people of America , white and black .
But he 's not going to suck up to angry white people by repudiating one of his closest friends .
Good for him .
Is n't it actually quite refreshing to have a candidate behave that honorably ?
But if you insist on requiring that he completely separate himself from someone who has said offensive things , then what about a candidate who remains closely connected to someone who has committed crimes and done things that offend just as many Americans ?
I speak of Hillary , who persists in her connection to an admitted perjurer who defiled the oval office with antics that would embarrass a randy college student ( at last after he got sober and / or grew up ) .
Yet people actually honor Hillary for standing by her husband -- and , by the way , joining him in lying about his opponents and never apologizing for her own false charges .
What 's sauce for the gander is sauce for the goose -- if you think Obama should separate from Wright , then you should be calling for Hillary to divorce Bill before she becomes President .
After all , we would n't want to re-contaminate the White House with such indecency , would we ?
And this time Bill would have way more free time .
( Though less access to the oval office . )
It 's all nonsense .
I hope a candidate does not have to abandon his friends to become president .
All he has to do is assure us that he does not share his friend 's offensive opinions -- which Obama has done -- and demonstrate that he has never acted upon those ideas -- which Obama has also done .
That issue is closed as far as I 'm concerned .
If I hear anymore nonsense about this from any of you , I will reach an ugly conclusion about your real motive .
No , I wo n't assume you 're a racist , I 'll assume something almost as icky :
That you 're a Hillary supporter .
Michelle vs. Hillary : The Senior Thesis Smackdown
All during the time Hillary was First Lady ( not President , despite her claim of experience ) , Wellesley College kept her senior thesis under lock and key .
They invented a rule that anyone could access any senior thesis except one by a sitting President or First Lady .
Princeton University was prepared to extend the same favor to Michelle Obama when people asked for her senior thesis -- without even waiting for her to become First Lady .
But when reporters asked the Obama campaign about this , they did what Hillary should have done sixteen years ago :
They simply provided the press with a copy of her thesis .
Since the press is not uniformly in support of Hillary , some reporters began clamoring for Hillary 's senior thesis , after all these years .
And guess what ?
She 's no longer First Lady .
So Wellesley allows you to see her thesis .
You have to go to their archives .
You can't photocopy the whole thing .
But you can read it and copy bits of it .
So now I have read the conclusion of Michelle Obama 's and of Hillary Clinton 's senior thesis , and I can tell you that the results are significant and important for this election .
Not because of the content of their theses , however .
These were seniors in college !
They have a right to learn a few things afterward , to change their minds .
Or do you think you should be judged your whole life by what you thought and said in college ?
Let me point out my own sorry example .
The election of 1968 .
Nixon vs. Humphrey -- but with George Wallace spoiling things by mounting the most important third - party challenge in my lifetime ( I was born in 1951 ) .
Fall of 1968 , I had just turned seventeen .
Definitely not a senior .
I was a white kid raised in communities where I never saw black people , and while I had been aware of George Wallace as a segregationist governor of Alabama , I was ignorant of what that really meant in people 's lives .
Segregation was over , I figured -- the Civil Rights and Voting Rights acts had determined that -- and now Wallace himself was declaring that he was no longer in favor of segregation , implying that he'd just been doing what the people of Alabama elected him to do .
So in my youth and ignorance , all I saw was a populist candidate running a third - party challenge .
I completely bought into the " not a dime 's worth of difference " slogan and yes , on my college campus I took part in the Wallace campaign , manning the American Independent Party table by the student union building for a few hours one afternoon and attending a couple of meetings .
But the non-student adults working with his campaign creeped me out .
It made me uneasy that people like that were Wallace 's supporters .
By the time of the election I had drifted away .
Within a couple of years I had learned a little more and was deeply embarrassed at my naivete and stupid enthusiasm .
I changed my mind completely .
Now I have a deep aversion to bigotry - centered populist demagogues -- one thinks , for instance , of the leaders of the anti-amnesty movement .
( I 'm thinking of Pat Buchanan and , to my disgust , my fellow - Mormon Mitt Romney . )
But if you look at what I was doing in college , there 's no denying it , I was a Wallace supporter in September and October of 1968 .
Does that youthful stupidity mean that I cannot ever get credit for growing up and changing my mind ?
I hope not .
That 's why , to me , the opinions Michelle and Hillary had as college seniors are n't even interesting .
Michelle Not Racially Divisive
But let 's lay one canard to rest right now .
The only way you could read Michelle Obama 's paper and think she was being even the tiniest bit racially divisive is if you want that to be the opinion people get about her .
In short , only Hillary supporters could find anything wrong with this paper .
Michelle 's major was African - American Studies .
Her paper was a study of the degree to which black Princeton graduates identified with the black community .
That 's not racial divisiveness , that 's the scholarly field she was in !
She sent out questionnaires and got back enough responses to yield interesting , if inconclusive , results .
In the questionnaire she used questions that revealed her ideas , at the beginning of the study , of what marked one 's degree of identification with black culture .
Using those markers , she reached the conclusion that during their years at Princeton , black students tended to identify more closely than ever with the black community , but a few years after leaving school and taking part in the white - dominated mainstream culture , their degree of identification was much less .
This is about how blacks in that time and in that place saw themselves vis-a - vis the real racial divisions in our country .
But her study was not divisive , it was observational .
Hillary 's paper , on the other hand , was about radical community organizer Saul D. Alinsky , whom she got a chance to meet and interview .
Writing in the late 1960s , Hillary was just feeling out her newfound radicalness and so she was sympathetic to Alinsky 's causes , though not worshipful of him .
The funny thing is that not being allowed to see this paper made anyone who knew the topic wonder what she wrote that was so awful .
When you actually read it , you really do n't see anything more than youthful hero - worship combined with a terminal longing to be cool .
It 's About How They Think
So the actual subject matter of both papers is really quite innocuous , in my opinion .
But that does n't mean they 're irrelevant .
On the contrary , they are both very informative .
I do n't care what these two women believed in college .
But the methodology and the manner of writing tell us a great deal about how they analyze and process information -- how they think .
What they think can change , but the way their brains work is almost certainly locked in stone by that age .
In short , we can tell from these papers how smart they are , how open - minded , how incisive , how analytical .
I 'm not talking about trivialities like spelling .
They were educated at different times and were supervised by different professors .
Both wrote these papers before spell - checkers and neither paper was written on a computer .
Hillary 's spelling is better ; Michelle Obama has faux pas like " occurances " instead of " occurrences . "
But this is no surprise at all , given the deemphasis on spelling in the years between their papers .
Hillary is of my generation :
We were taught to spell .
And maybe one had a better proofreader than the other .
I 'm talking about ability to think , and Michelle Obama 's paper reveals her to be keenly analytical .
What I love is that in the process of her study , she realized the shortcomings of her methodology and the inadequacy of her initial assumptions .
She writes quite clearly that the markers of commitment to the black community that she started out with -- liking black music , eating black food , etc. -- might not have been appropriate , and if she had it to do over again , she 'd use different standards .
Not only that , but she ended with suggestions for further studies that should be conducted to get clearer , more useful results .
She also speculated intelligently on why she got the results she did , and on what it really means about black students at Princeton .
On point after point , her analysis was incisive ; yet she also introduced most of the major doubts that her study could arouse .
In short , she had a true scientific attitude , with ego almost entirely removed from the process .
From this thesis , I see the youthful Michelle Obama as smart , honest , open - minded , humble , and determined to find out the truth regardless of consequences .
Then I read Hillary 's conclusion , and I was stunned .
It 's not just that her opinions are all over the map , usually without any kind of evidentiary justification .
It 's that she can't seem to write a paragraph that makes any kind of point .
It 's a chaotic mess .
What does she think of Alinsky ?
One moment she seems to think that his enterprise was valuable and important ; the next , that he was untrustworthy and unreliable and not a clear thinker .
What does she think of anything ?
She seems to be looking down on everybody .
And then it all comes clear .
There 's only one consistent theme that is expressed throughout Hillary 's paper .
It 's all about how smart she is , how superior to everybody and every group she mentions .
She can mock this and that because she stands on a higher plane than they do .
Instead of being an earnest seeker after truth , like Michelle , Hillary writes as if she knew " the truth " and if the reader is smart , the reader will know it too .
But in the pages that I read , Hillary shows no competence whatsoever at rational analysis , at self - questioning ; she writes pretentiously , but very , very badly .
If you are n't very analytical yourself , you can come away from her paper thinking what she wants you to think :
Wow , was n't Hillary Rodham , like , smart and cool ?
But if you hold her to any kind of rigorous standard of scholarship and thought , her paper is an embarrassment .
It 's not that she 's dumb , it 's that she 's glib and assumes that whatever she happens to believe is the smart thing .
If I got a paper like Michelle Obama 's from a college student today , I 'd be impressed .
She 'd get an A -- after she corrected the spelling errors .
But I 'd hand Hillary 's back to her and say , " Now go do some research and analysis and figure out what you think before you start writing your real thesis .
This one is a waste of everyone 's time . "
Michelle Obama is not running for President .
But she is running for the office -- First Lady -- that Hillary claims is the very best qualification for being President eight years later .
I can tell you right now that if Barack listens to his wife the way that Bill claims to have listened to Hillary , President Obama will have a far smarter pillow - talk adviser than President Clinton ever had .
And that , my friends , does matter .
Bill Clinton married pretentious ambition .
Barack Obama married the smartest woman he knew .
Slam dunk for Obama .
Meaningless dribbling for Hillary .
SALT LAKE CITY — Last August , the nail was poised over SCO 's coffin when Judge Dale Kimball ruled that Novell never relinquished the copyrights to UNIX , but nobody really knew when it would be driven home .
The decision meant that SCO could be on the hook for as much as $ 20 million in unpaid royalties .
Not long afterwards , SCO filed for bankruptcy , but that Chapter 11 filing was only able to delay the inevitable trial to determine how much Novell was owed .
That long - awaited trial began this week , and Ars was on hand to report .
Last year , the court ruled that Novell owned the copyrights to original AT&T UNIX source code and derivatives , including SVRX ( System V , Release X ) , and threw out the case .
Now , the countersuit brought by Novell is being heard , and should be finished up this week .
Novell has repeatedly said it has no interest in suing Linux users over UNIX copyrights , which would be against its interests now that Novell has ties to the open - source community through openSUSE and SUSE Enterprise Linux Server and Desktop distributions .
I entered the courtroom yesterday at 8:30 AM , a few minutes after the proceedings were scheduled to begin .
SCO senior vice president Chris Sontag was already on the stand , being questioned by Novell .
When asked , " Is there any UnixWare code in Linux ? " the answer was , " There very well could be , [ ...]
I 've never done that analysis , never seen that analysis . "
Sontag also testified that there was no difference between the Microsoft and Sun licenses for UnixWare , saying , " They were equal . "
After Sontag was dismissed , Novell called SCO CEO Darl McBride to the stand .
He was briefly questioned on his experience working for Caldera , which later became SCO .
When he joined the company ( then Caldera ) in 2002 , it was in bad financial shape , losing $ 24 million in the previous quarter .
To combat the downward spiral the company was in , McBride testified that he had gone around to various executives in the company and asked them what they thought could improve the situation .
One of the execs told him that Caldera owned code in Linux from UNIX SVRX , UnixWare , and SCO OpenServer .
SCO CEO Darl McBride takes the stand
McBride said that SCO holds the rights to UNIX and that " many Linux contributors were originally UNIX developers . "
Specifically , he said , " We have evidence System V is in Linux , " — directly contradicting what Sontag had previously testified .
Due to the witness exclusion rule invoked by both parties , McBride was not present during Sontag 's testimony and was n't aware of what had been said .
McBride 's claims also directly contradict internal SCO memos from 2002 , which reveal that the company 's own extensive source code audits had uncovered no UNIX code in Linux .
McBride attempted to reinforce his argument with analogy .
" When you go to the bookstore and look in the UNIX section , there 's books on ' How to Program UNIX ' but when you go to the Linux section and look for ' How to Program Linux ' you 're not gonna find it , because it does n't exist . "
Then came the real humdinger , and my jaw dropped when I heard the following come out of his mouth : " Linux is a copy of UNIX , there is no difference [ between them ] . "
Novell grilled McBride for the better part of 10 minutes about " filling a form 10 - K or 10 - Q with the SEC that contained a false statement . "
Novell 's counsel reiterated that two separate 10 - Q forms filed by SCO did not include Sun or Microsoft revenue generated by UnixWare licenses .
McBride adamantly denied any wrong doing , saying that the licenses were for the trunk of SCO intellectual property consisting of multiple brands , not the UnixWare product branch .
This was the most hostile point of the day , with the council asking him the same question in several different ways .
After two hours on the stand , McBride stepped down .
Greg Jones , VP of Technology at Novell , was called as a witness .
Jones was asked if SCO ever told Novell that it would sue Linux users .
He said , " No , never that specific . "
When asked if SCO notified Novell under the Asset Purchase Agreement Amendment 2 that it would enter into a license with Microsoft , he said , " No . "
Jones testified that SVRX code is in Solaris and that he had discovered several cases of this .
At that point , Novell entered into evidence at least 21 examples of OpenSolaris code that had been taken from the SVRX code base ( one such example can be found on the OpenSolaris web site ) and re-licensed under Sun 's open - source CDDL license .
He further testified that the agreement between SCO and Sun was " extraordinary " in allowing a move from a proprietary license to an open - source license , and if Novell had been asked , it would have prevented SCO from entering into that agreement .
He said the same thing regarding the Microsoft agreement with SCO , as well as the agreement between SCO and Computer Associates .
After Greg Jones stepped down from the stand , Novell rested , and SCO called John Maciaszek , who worked for AT&T starting in 1966 and moved on to be product manager for Unix System Laboratories ( USL ) .
He worked for Novell in a similar role when Novell acquired USL and now works for SCO part - time and is semi-retired .
He was asked to detail some of the differences between SVRX v4.2MP ( the first multi- processor version ) , and Unixware 2 .
He went on to say that UnixWare 1 is based solely on System 5 4.2 uni-processor code .
Maciaszek said that when he worked for AT&T , the company always granted a right to use all prior versions of UNIX at no cost when licensing the current version .
UnixWare included source code for OEMs to provide customized identical branded versions or to port to another architecture .
" We use the one line of code rule .
If you took one line of code from UnixWare and used it in a derivative work , that work would become subject to a UnixWare license , " Maciaszek said .
After that beautiful quotation which highlights everything wrong with the way copyright law works in today 's world , Maciaszek stepped down .
The court recessed for a short while , then reconvened for the summary judgement hearing .
SCO played with fire and got burned .
During the hearing , it became clear what SCO is trying to accomplish by attempting to degrade the value of prior versions of SVRX .
Novell is suing it for unjust enrichment , and SCO is trying to limit the damages Novell can collect as much as humanly possible .
SCO argues that it was not authorized to execute license agreements and that interested third parties such as Sun and Microsoft should get their money back , but it says that Novell is not entitled to hold the money in the interim .
If you purchased a license from SCO that was unauthorized , the argument is that you 'll need sue them to get it back .
Since SCO is currently in bankruptcy proceedings , that could be difficult .
When SCO sent threatening letters out to Fortune 1000 companies in May of 2003 , it probably did n't expect this to be the result .

The presidential campaign of Hillary Rodham Clinton thought that by getting tough and going negative against her chief rival for the Democratic nomination , that the former first lady could stop Barack Obama 's seemingly unstoppable juggernaut and convince the party 's " superdelegates " that she represents the party 's best hope of defeating GOP nominee - elect John McCain in November .
But it is n't turning out that way .
Clinton 's attack strategy has instead blown up in her face , making Obama stronger in the eyes of Democrats nationwide and prompting more of the party 's heavyweights -- including another member of former President Bill Clinton 's administration -- to lean more toward the Illinois senator .
Clinton 's attacks certainly have n't hurt Obama in the fundraising department .
On the contrary , Obama raised more money than both Clinton and McCainin March , according to campaign finance reports filed Sunday .
To make matters worse for Clinton , another former member of her husband 's White House cabinet endorsed Obama on Friday .
Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich wrote in a blog post that " although Hillary Clinton has offered solid and sensible policy proposals , Obama 's strike me as even more so .
" Reich also said Obama 's plans for reforming Social Security and health care have a better chance of succeeding , and his approach to the nation 's housing crisis and financial market failures " are sounder than " the New York senator's .
Reich is a former Rhodes scholar and a Yale Law School graduate who is a longtime friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton .
He ran for governor in Massachusetts in 2002 and now is a professor at the University of California at Berkeley .
Reich becomes the third former Clinton administration official to back Obama , following New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson , a former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations ; and former Denver Mayor Federico Pena , who served as Transportation and later Energy Secretary under Bill Clinton .
Pena became a co-chair of Obama 's campaign last September .
Two other Democratic elder statesmen , former Senators Sam Nunn of Georgia and David Boren of Oklahoma , also said they were supporting the Illinois senator .
Nunn and Boren said they have accepted Obama 's invitation to serve as advisers to his national security foreign policy team .
Nunn served as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee from 1987 to 1995 , while Boren was the longest - serving chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence .
Both fall into the conservative end of the Democratic party 's ideological spectrum and both gave Bill Clinton trouble during his presidency , trying to tug him to the right on issues while most congressional Democrats were leaning to the left .
Most memorably , Nunn forced President Clinton to compromise on the still - simmering issue over whether gay men and lesbians could serve in the U.S. military without keeping their sexual identity a secret .
That compromise , known as " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell , " remains in force .
In a statement issued by the Obama campaign , Nunn said : " We need a president who has the temperament of a leader -- a sharp , incisive , strategic mind , a rare capacity for self criticism , and a willingness to hear contrary points of view .
Based on my conversations with Senator Obama , reading his book and his speeches and seeing the kind of campaign he has run , I believe that he is our best choice to lead our nation .
" Boren said : " Our most urgent task is to end the divisions in our country , to stop the political bickering , and to unite our talents and efforts .
Americans of all persuasions are pleading with our political leaders to bring us together .
I believe Senator Obama is sincerely committed to that effort .
He has made a non-partisan approach to all issues a top priority .
" Meanwhile , more Democratic superdelegates -- who will hold the balance of power in determing who ultimately wins the party 's nomination -- announced their support for Obama .
Reggie Whitten , an attorney and superdelegate from Oklahoma , endorsed Obama last Thursday .
He said he " could have waited a while ' ' to endorse the Illinois senator , yet it was n't " fair ' ' for Clinton to focus on " that one comment out of context .
'' Whitten said he decided to back Obama because " The American people are tired of the negativity , I think they 're tired of fighting among the party and I think its time for the party to unite .
I hope that my coming out [ for Obama ] will be one tiny little thing that will push in that direction .
'' Nancy Larson , a Democratic National Committee member from rural Minnesota , said Clinton 's " bothersome ' ' response contributed to her endorsement of Obama a week ago Sunday .
On Saturday , the Obama campaign said that Steve Achelpohl , the Nebraska state Democratic Party chairman , was backing Obama .
Achelpohl told the Lincoln Journal Star that people could rally behind Obama 's " positive campaign . '' The seven superdelegates who endorsed Obama this week also include three members of Congress and one city council member from the District of Columbia .
Several superdelegates criticized Clinton in interviews with Bloomberg News for what they called parsing Obama 's words instead of focusing on policy differences with McCain .
Representative David Price of North Carolina , who endorsed Obama last Wednesday , said that while his announcement was not timed to Clinton 's attacks , " it 's disappointing to see this kind of campaign approach .
The real issues should be who is addressing economic difficulties , '' Price said .
Clinton spokesman Mo Elleithee denied any movement to Obama as a result of the negative campaigning .
" We have n't seen any of that .
If anything , this debate and ongoing campaign has been energizing the party , '' Elleithee said .
And for the first time in the campaign , Obama took off the gloves and went on the offensive against Clinton , branding the former first lady a game - player who uses " slash and burn " tactics and will say whatever people want to hear -- his sharpest - ever jab at her character in the final weekend before Tuesday 's pivotal Pennsylvania primary .
Apparently fed up with weeks of incessant attacks by Clinton against his qualifications to be president , Obama bluntly questioned her truthfulness , playing on poll findings indicating growing public unease with her veracity after the New York senator was forced to acknowledge during last Wednesday 's debate with Obama that she did n't tell the truth about her 1996 visit to Bosnia .
In Wynnewood , Pennsylvania , several thousand Obama supporters lined the tracks Saturday for the first stop on a day - long whistle - stop tour evocative of President Harry S. Truman 's in 1948 aboard a royal blue train car that pulled out of Philadelphia in late morning .
" I may not be perfect , but I will always tell you what I think and I will always tell you where I stand , " he told the crowd .
Then , like Truman , Obama gave his rival hell -- although with none of the salty , expletive - laced language that was a trademark of the nation 's 33rd president .
" She 's taken different positions at different times on issues as fundamental as trade , or even the war , to suit the politics of the moment , " he said .
" And when she gets caught at it , the notion is , well , you know what , that 's just politics .
That 's how it works in Washington .
You can say one thing here and say another thing there .
" The former first lady had said on the campaign trail that she came under sniper fire after arriving at the American Air Force base in Tuzla , Bosnia .
But video footage posted on YouTube.com and later broadcast on the " CBS Evening News " clearly showed that no such sniper fire took place .
The Clinton campaign has been in damage - control mode since -- to no avail , according to the latest polls .
Clinton 's negative poll ratings -- already the highest of the three remaining major candidates for the White House -- have increased sharply , partly as a result of the Bosnia debacle , with new polls suggesting that she would lose to McCain in the November general election if she became the Democratic nominee .
By comparison , Obama is locked in a statistical dead heat with McCain as independents -- without whom neither party can win in November -- are divided almost evenly between the Arizona Republican and the Illinois Democrat .
In a dramatic reversal of fortune , an Associated Press - Yahoo !
News poll found that a clear majority of Democratic voters now say Obama has a better chance of defeating McCain in November than Clinton .
While Obama and Clinton are both sustaining dents and dings from their lengthy presidential fight , the former first lady is clearly suffering more .
Democratic voters no longer see her as the party 's strongest contender for the White House .
Voters of all types have gotten a better sense of Obama , who was an obscure Illinois legislator just four years ago .
As more people moved from the " I do n't know him " category in the AP - Yahoo !
News poll , more rated Obama as inexperienced , unethical and dishonest .
And 15 percent erroneously think he 's a Muslim , thanks in part to disinformation widely spread on the Internet .
But Obama 's positive ratings have climbed as well , while Clinton — widely known since the early 1990s — has been less able to change people 's views of her .
And when those views have shifted , it has hurt her more than helped .
The New York senator 's ratings for being honest , likable , ethical and refreshing have fallen since January , and Obama scores higher than she does in all those categories .
In late January , before Obama scored 11 straight primary and caucus victories , 56 percent of Democrats saw Clinton as the stronger nominee , compared to 33 percent for Obama .
Now , Obama leads on that question , 56 to 43 percent .
Still , the poll , conducted by Knowledge Networks , contains some worrisome signs for the first - term senator .
Those rating him as " not at all honest , " for example , jumped from 18 percent last fall to 27 percent in April .
It came as he was put on the defensive over incendiary comments by his former pastor , the Reverend Jeremiah Wright .
But many who hold such views are Republicans or conservative independents , who would be unlikely to vote in a Democratic primary or support a Democrat in the fall anyway .
In January , 30 percent of Republicans rated Obama very unfavorably .
That grew to 43 percent in April .
Among conservative independents , 12 percent had a very unfavorable view of Obama in January .
That has nearly doubled to 23 percent .
Obama would be the first African American to win the White House if elected , and the survey detected some evidence of racial discomfort in voters ' minds .
It found that about eight percent of whites overall would be uncomfortable voting for a black person for president .
That figure soars to about 13 percent of white Republicans , but very few , if any , white Democrats feel the same way .
In November , about 5 percent of white Democrats indicated discomfort at voting for a black person for president , a figure that has remained unchanged since then .
The most encouraging sign for Obama is that many Democrats who previously saw Clinton as their party 's best hope now give him that role .
About one - third of them still prefer Clinton , but they have lost confidence in her electability .
Obama continued his torrid fundraising pace , netting $ 41 million in March .
The Illinois senator is armed with a $ 42 million war chest to launch another TV ad blitz in Pennsylvania against Clinton .
Overall , Obama had $ 51 million in the bank at the end of March , with nearly $ 9 million of that available only for the general electionBy comparison , Clinton raised only $ 20 million in the same period and had only $ 8 milion on hand for the Pennsylvania primary .
McCain 's campaign reported raising $ 15.2 million in March and had $ 11.6 million in the bank .
The Arizona senator 's March figures were his best fundraising performance of the campaign .
Nonetheless , Obama has out - fundraised both ClintonMcCain combined .
McCain in March refunded donors about $ 3 million in contributions , most of it money he had received for the general election .
The refunds set the stage for McCain to accept about $ 84 million in public funds for the fall campaign .
Candidates who accept public financing cannot raise money from donors for the general election campaign .
With the Keystone State the last major big - state primary before the Democratic Convention , Clinton must win by a greater than 60 percent vote margin to have any hope of stopping Obama 's march to the nomination .
But with polls showing Clinton with , at best , only a nine - point lead -- and some polls showing the two combatants locked a statistical dead heat -- her argument to the party 's supedelegates that she'd be the most electable nominee -- an argument already undermined by her Bosnia debacle -- could end up going down the drain , no matter what happens in Pennsylvania .
While fans are anxiously awaiting new information about a new Grand Theft Auto Game , there are rumors about a potential spin - off being made for Grand Theft Auto V .
Fans of the series should be familiar with such spin - offs from the previous games , such as Vice City , and it would be quite a pleasant surprise from Rockstar Games , albeit a rather unsurprising one .
Alongside the GTA 6 rumors , we also hear things related to potential upcoming consoles , like PlayStation 5 and Xbox Two .
Despite these rumors , we have no evidence to suggest that the game is being developed , a release date , or any connection with speculated new consoles .
As mentioned , Rockstar Games are known for making various expansions on GTA titles before moving on to other games .
They often quite released more than just one expansion before changing the game completely , and , despite the DLC policy that they ’ve adopted for GTA 5 , it will be interesting to see if they will make an expansion for the game and how it will relate with the DLCs that they ’ve previously released , as well as the multiplayer component .
We will mostly be interested in knowing if they will release an independent story that is unrelated to the main GTA 5 story and multiplayer , or if it will take the shape of a DLC / Expansion hybrid that will have both story and multiplayer elements .
As far as the Grand Theft Auto 6 setting is concerned , it will be interesting to see where exactly the action will take place .
There has been the idea of setting the game in Tokyo , but due to the issues they have with their road system the idea had to be scrapped .
Besides Japan , there have also been rumors that it will be set in the British capital of London .
If this turns out to be true , it would mark the first time the game has had its setting outside of North America .
It was an odd Website name .
It appeared in my statistics as one hit at first .
I started investigating when the hits became ten .

By By Michael Billy May 1 , 2008 in Crime The Department of Public Health in Los Angelas has recently banned the selling of bacon - wrapped hot dogs .
Ah , the sweet , salty , taste of health regulation .
No Title More Take , for instance , the production of deep - fried Oreos and L.A. must be a very peaceful place with no violent crimes -- like rape , murder , and robbery -- for the police to be focusing on the illegal selling of bacon .
They must have taken care of that high murder rate and gang violence .
So what is the justification for this newly prompted War on Bacon where cops raid privately owned street carts and throw them into the garbage ?
“ Bacon is a potentially hazardous food , ” says Terrence Powell of the LA County Health Department .
Potentially hazardous ?
Every food has its hazards .
Even some salads have cherry tomatoes that could possibly be choked on .
When asked how many people were getting sick from bacon , Powell responded , " Thats kind of a nebulous number . "
Translation :
There are no statistics on this , but we think bacon is bad for you .
Vendors can continue to sell the bacon - wrapped dogs , however , as long as they purchase a new street cart at the cost of $ 26,000 .
That is a huge investment for a small street vending business .
But , alas , if they do not purchase the cart then they are not allowed to sell bacon , which is a huge item in the street vending business .
One such vendor has said that when she informs the customers that she cannot sell bacon most will immediately leave and go to one of the stands that are permitted to sell the illicit substance .
So what recourse is there for the small - time vendors that cannot afford the new equipment ?
It looks like they will be forced to continue the black market bacon trade until they too are caught in the tangled web of the War on Bacon .
This is not the first time in human history that we have produced horrendously unhealthy artery - clogging food .
Take , for instance , the production of deep - fried Oreos and deep - fried Coke .
This is , however , amongst the first times that the selling of such a product has been banned .
L.A. must be a very peaceful place with no violent crimes -- like rape , murder , and robbery -- for the police to be focusing on the illegal selling of bacon .
They must have taken care of that high murder rate and gang violence .

Glenn notes how well the media is doing its job :
In the past two weeks , the following events transpired .
A Department of Justice memo , authored by John Yoo , was released which authorized torture and presidential lawbreaking .
It was revealed that the Bush administration declared the Fourth Amendment of the Bill of Rights to be inapplicable to " domestic military operations " within the U.S. The U.S. Attorney General appears to have fabricated a key event leading to the 9/11 attacks and made patently false statements about surveillance laws and related lawsuits .
Barack Obama went bowling in Pennsylvania and had a low score .
Here are the number of times , according to NEXIS , that various topics have been mentioned in the media over the past thirty days : " Yoo and torture " - 102 " Mukasey and 9/11 " -- 73 " Yoo and Fourth Amendment " -- 16 " Obama and bowling " -- 1,043 " Obama and Wright " --
More than 3,000 ( too many to be counted ) " Obama and patriotism " - 1,607 " Clinton and Lewinsky " -- 1,079
The sad thing is that the mainstream press really does believe that things like Obama 's poor bowling skills and the Clinton 's tax returns are more important stories than , say , the trillion dollar war that continues to rage on with no end in sight or a collapsing economy .
Like Glenn says , people care about the petty stuff because the media loves to tell themselves that they do .
You knew it could n't last much longer .
VetVoice :
In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee yesterday , Army Vice Chief of Staff General Richard Cody sternly rebuked all those who 've been blowing sunshine and spreading baseless happy talk for five years with regard to the war in Iraq .
And he was blunt -- blunter than I 've ever heard him before -- about the crisis facing the Army .
He even went so far as to hint at the " D - word " in his prepared remarks :
Today 's Army is out of balance .
The current demand for our forces in Iraq and Afghanistan exceeds the sustainable supply and limits our ability to provide ready forces for other contingencies . . .
Current operational requirements for forces and insufficient time between deployments require a focus on counterinsurgency training and equipping to the detriment of preparedness for the full range of military missions .
Given the current theater demand for Army forces , we are unable to provide a sustainable tempo of deployments for our Soldiers and Families .
Soldiers , Families , support systems , and equipment are stretched and stressed by the demands of lengthy and repeated deployments , with insufficient recovery time .
Equipment used repeatedly in harsh environments is wearing out more rapidly than programmed .
Army support systems , designed for the pre-9/11 peacetime Army , are straining under the accumulation of stress from six years at war .
Overall , our readiness is being consumed as fast as we build it .
And then he added the kicker :

“ 100 Questions … ”
By Ben Cohen
( Cross posted in the Huffington Post )
Nobody seems to have noticed that Hillary Clinton has broken international law by threatening Iran with ' obliteration . '
" I want the Iranians to know that if I 'm the president , we will attack Iran , " Clinton said in an interview with ABC .
" In the next 10 years , during which they might foolishly consider launching an attack on Israel , we would be able to totally obliterate them . "

Why are alarm bells not ringing ?
In chapter I , article II of the United Nations Charter , it states :
All Members shall refrain in their international relations
from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or
political independence of any state , or in any other manner
inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations .
The U.N Charter was signed in San Francisco in 1945 by the United
States along with 50 other countries .
Each country is bound by its
articles , and the treaty prevails over all other treaties ( including
' special ' relationships with other nations ) .
In other words , regardless
of any hypothetical attack on Israel , the United States is legally
bound not to threaten Iran or any other country .
This is also enshrined in the constitution .
Article IV Clause II states :

This Constitution , and the laws of the United States which
shall be made in pursuance thereof ; and all treaties made , or which
shall be made , under the authority of the United States , shall be the
supreme law of the land ; and the judges in every state shall be bound
thereby , anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the
contrary notwithstanding .
It is incredible that public debate regarding Hillary Clinton's
threat to annihilate Iran centers around campaign strategy rather than
international law .
I have been scouring the mainstream media to find
anything criticizing Clinton 's remarks for their illegality , but can
find nothing other than comments like ' Clinton 's tough talk on Iran '
( taken from ABC News )
While most Democrats have kept quiet , Obama rightly denounced
Clinton 's remarks saying , " It 's not the language we need right now , and
I think it 's language reflective of George Bush . "
Obama is right of course ( although he had his own moment with Pakistan ) , but still falling a few thousand miles short of calling it what it is .
" That is not a word gaffe , " writes Robert Scheer .
" It is an assertion of the right of our nation to commit genocide on an unprecedented scale . "
Attacking Obama while pulling the entire Democratic Party down with
her is one thing , but threatening to commit nuclear holocaust on
another country is another matter all together .
These outrageous
remarks should not only be denounced , but punished appropriately by her
party .
If an Iranian public figure had stated the intention to launch a
nuclear war on America , the United States would demand international
condemnation or possibly launch another preemptive war .
Such reckless comments should not be tolerated by the Democratic
Party , and if it took itself seriously , Clinton would no longer be a
part of it .
Luckily for her , they do n't .
The results of an extensive exploration with shadows , the One Day Poem Pavilion demonstrates the poetic , transitory , site - sensitive and time - based nature of light and shadow .
Using a complex array of perforations , the pavilions surface allows light to pass through creating shifting patterns , which during specific times of the year transform into the legible text of a poem .
The specific arrangements of the perforations reveal different shadow - poems according to the solar calendar : a theme of new - life during the summer solstice , a reflection on the passing of time at the period of the winter solstice .
The time - based nature of the poemand the visitors time - based encounters with it allow viewers to have different experiences either seeing a stanza of the poem or getting the whole poem .
All of these possible experiences are equally valuable and have meanings unique to the individual .
This technique has the potential for producing particular effects and meanings within an architectural environment .
Without the use of a source of power other than the sun , this project uses light and shadow to push the boundaries of communication and experiential delight .
Short of an act by the Legislature , the directive ordered by Mr. Paterson is the one of the strongest statements a state can make in favor of gay unions .
“ Basically we ’ve done everything we can do on marriage legislatively at this point , ” said Sean Patrick Maloney , a senior adviser to Mr. Paterson .
“ But there are tools in our tool kit on the executive side , and this is one . ”
The directive cited a Feb. 1 ruling by a State Appellate Court in Rochester that Patricia Martinez , who works at Monroe Community College and who married her partner in Canada , could not be denied health benefits by the college because of New York ’s longstanding policy of recognizing marriages performed elsewhere , even if they are not explicitly allowed under New York law .
The appeals court said that New York must recognize marriages performed in other states that allow the practice and in countries that permit it , like Canada and Spain .
Monroe County filed an appeal with the state ’s highest court , the Court of Appeals , but it was rejected on technical grounds .
The county has not decided whether to file another appeal , a county spokesman said on Wednesday .
The Court of Appeals has previously ruled that the state ’s Constitution did not compel the recognition of same - sex marriages and that it was up to the Legislature to decide whether do so .
Groups that oppose gay marriage said the governor was essentially trying to circumvent the Legislature .
“ It ’s a perfect example of a governor overstepping his authority and sidestepping the democratic process , ” said Brian Raum , senior legal counsel for the Alliance Defense Fund , a national organization opposed to same - sex marriage .
“ It ’s an issue of public policy that should be decided by the voters . ”
Gay rights advocates , however , applauded Mr. Paterson , saying the broad directive would make it clear that gay couples wed in other states were entitled to all of the benefits of marriage in New York and relieve them of the burden of challenging or suing individual agencies .
To keep in line with their austere “ safe and fun ” policy , Nintendo has banned the name Hitler from Mario Kart Wii ’s online services .

About the author
( NewsTarget ) Merck , the maker of the very controversial Gardasil vaccine , has a pharmaceutical plant located in West Point , Pennsylvania , that discards pollutants from this facility into the Upper Gwynedd Township Publicly Owned Treatment Works ( UGT POTW ) , according to a press release by the U.S. Department of Justice .
The treated wastewater is released into the Wissahickon Creek , a tributary of the Schuylkill River .
A federal court complaint was filed alleging that Merck violated the Clean Water Act with various discharges that caused numerous pass through and interference violations at the UGT POTW .
On June 13 , 2006 , Merck released potassium thiocyanate ( KSCN ) into the water that reacted with the chlorination at UGT POTW which resulted in extensive fish kills in the Wissahickon Creek on June 14th and 15th .
The Philadelphia Water Department had to shut down its Schuylkill River drinking water intake for several days , and a health advisory was issued stating that all recreational uses on the Wissahickon Creek were prohibited from June 14th  July 10th .
Then , on August 8th and 9th , Merck released a batch of spent substrate used in vaccine production which caused large - scale foam discharge into the creek .
Later , on the 16th , Merck released a massive amount of cleaning agents that when treated at UGT POTW caused another major foam discharge .
Merck has agreed to settle the violations of federal and state water pollution regulations .
Merck will pay $ 10 million to institute a system that will prevent future hazardous discharges from their plant .
They will also spend approximately $ 9 million for environmental projects and will pay $ 1,575,000 in penalties and civil damages for past violations .
" Merck 's actions led to an extensive fish - kill and caused the Philadelphia Water Department to temporarily shut down its drinking water operations , " stated Acting Assistant Attorney General Tenpas .
" This settlement ensures that Merck will take steps to prevent future illegal discharges including installing an early warning system to protect drinking water .
" There have been many stories in the news lately concerning the problems with municipal water systems .
" Perhaps more than anything else , this settlement says to every company that discharges dangerous chemicals as part of its operations that it is accountable to the environment and the community , " said U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania , Pat Meehan .
" Because when you get right down to it , no one should have to wonder , when they walk into the kitchen for a glass of water , if what they are about to drink is going to make them or their children sick .

Top 10 Renewable Tech Gadgets
May 5th , 2008 by Michelle Bennett
There are a lot of cool gadgets out there , but there ’s a fine line between what ’s cool and what ’s useful .
This is a green list of gadgets that are useful , but boast the extra-cool factor of using renewable energy .
No batteries required !
10 . The Ship has Landed
The lightship is a solar - powered LED mounted on suction cups .
Result : a portable , hands - free , solar light .
It ’s even weather proof and weighs a slim 8 oz .
For under $ 15 , this is the best 8 hours of clean light I can think of , and I might just get one for my car / camping trips / travels .
9 . High - tech pool toy ?
If you simply must have hot water anywhere , at any time , try a portable solar water heater .
Could it double as a heated water bed ?
A pool toy ?
Bring some towels if you decide to try .
This gadget is designed to bring cheap , easy hot water to people and places without access to indoor plumbing or electricity .
It rolls up small enough to fit in a backpack , and it ’s supposed to be affordable enough for people or communities in developing nations .
8 . The Fridge without Power
A little ingenuity paired with the laws of thermodynamics have made Mohammed Bah Abba a famous man .
His invention is simple : place a pot into a slightly larger one .
Pad the space between them with wet sand , and cover with a damp cloth .
As the water evaporates , it will draw heat out of the containers and cool whatever ’s inside .
The system has already proved itself in northern Nigeria , a hot and arid region .
Food lasts for days or weeks longer compared to the only alternative : room temperature .
Here in the land of plastic coolers , I can think of a few common uses : Camping trips could be easier without the weight of heavy packs of ice and the danger of freezing more fragile foods .
Egg - cicle anyone ?
Even if you do n’t intend to leave the comforts of modern civilization , consider these for cooling food or drinks at your next BBQ , or even for a DIY kid ’s science project .
7. Speaking of BBQ …
We ’re putting heat in the kitchen with solar cookers .
The benefit here is that some designs are lightweight with easy - to get materials , like foil and pizza boxes .
They also offer a neat alternative for your next BBQ ( and yes , they can get hot enough to cook meat ) if , for example , you live in an area with frequent fire - bans .
Since there are no flames involved , it ’s much safer and there ’s definitely something fascinating about watching the sun roast your food .
6. Crank your Gadgets :
How about a MP3 player that you can crank ?
You ’ll never run out of juice if you can charge your gadget by hand .
Trevor Baylis , the inventor of the hand - crank radio , brings you an MP3 with plenty of whistles and bells .
If a wind - up MP3 is n’t your cup of tea , how about a kinetic cell phone or phone charger ?
You might hesitate to buy anything that requires physical exertion on your part , but what happens when there ’s no socket in which to stick your regular charger ?
Be the cool kid who can charge himself .
Also , consider emergency applications .
The MP3 comes with a flashlight , and the cell phone charger could keep you connected when you most need to call for help .
5. Personal Wind Turbine
We ’re not talking about the huge wind - farm fodder ; we ’re talking about something you can strap to your house .
Now I admit , gadgets tend to be smaller and more … gadgety .
After much deliberation , I figured omitting wind power would be like forgetting Unix in a “ Top - 5 ” for PC operating systems .
Plus , they look really cool .
For a mere $ 500 you could own this turbine , which is designed for charging batteries ( the batteries would power a cabin or house ) .
The Japanese turbine ( shown above ) has n’t quite hit the American market yet , but it ’d be my wind - power - of - choice .
Airplane propellers are so last - year .
4. Sunlit Gadgets
Solar powered lighting aside , what about self - sufficient gadgets ?
Nowadays there ’s a wide variety to choose from .
There ’s Msi ’s solar ’ powered MP3 player , which you can also plug in when the sun wo n’t shine .
How about a Bluetooth headset ?
You too could strut with all the style of a pocket - protector , smug in the knowledge that yours works indoors and out .
Other self - sufficient gadgets include a mosquito repeller , tire gage , and all - in - one survival kit .
However , some of the extreme deals associated with these makes me wonder if they ’re worth the low price …
3. The Nerdies Lights Around
Let ’s play with fiber optics .
You could have natural sunlight ( sans UV and infrared ) for your home or office , and it could come from fiber optic cables ( pictured above ) .
Among the gadget you do n’t get to see ( assuming it ’s wired through your walls ) , it ’s got to be the coolest .
You even get a futuristic collector dish on your roof .
2. Lightcap 200
This is a solar - powered cap for your water bottle .
So why power your Nalgene ?
It turns your translucent water bottle into a solar - powered lantern .
Every backpacker knows that every ounce counts , so now you can combine two heavy but necessary items into one .
There is also the cool factor : pick you color with your favorite shade of kool - aid .
1. Solar Battery Recharger … even your laptop
It was bound to be on the list .
There are a range of solar - powered rechargers .
Some come with battery packs ( for when the sun do n’t shine ) or bells and whistles .
Voltaic Systems and Burton ’s Solar Roll claim the prize of recharging a standard laptop .
As you might expect , prices range from $ 20 to “ owch ” .
But if you carry a purse , tote your gadget horde , backpack , geocache , or travel through regions with less - than - reliable electricity , any one of these could be invaluable .
Plus , they all come with a magnificent cool factor .

Festo , the same company that brought us the Air Ray robot last year , has developed yet another graceful robot inspired by a creature of the sea .
In fact , they have developed two versions , both based on the common jellyfish : the AquaJelly and the AirJelly .
According to Festo , the AquaJelly is " an artificial autonomous jellyfish with an electric drive and an intelligent , adaptive mechanical system . "
Apparently the idea is to have several of the robots autonomously working together using a communication system composed of Zigbee short - range radio on the surface and LEDs when underwater .
More info and videos after the break .
As for the AirJelly , this remote controlled device can glide through the air using a helium - filled ballonet , a central electric drive and an intelligent , adaptive mechanical system .
Apparently , this design offers " fascinating possibilities for " lighter - than - air " aviation . "
I 'm not sure about all of that , but I can at see how the technology behind the AquaJelly could have some practical application on complex underwater projects .
Still , practical or not , these robots are pretty damn interesting to watch in action , as the videos below illustrate .
Check out the press release for full details .
Bionic Learning Network
Inspired by nature
Nature never ceases to amaze us with its aesthetic beauty .
It is no surprise therefore that nature 's fascinating creatures also served as inspiration for the new projects of Festo's Bionic Learning Network .
The structure and kinematics of AquaJelly and AirJelly are based on their biological model , the jellyfish .
The test beds utilize cutting - edge technologies .
AquaJelly , for example , is a man-made autonomous jelly fish with an electric drive and an intelligent , adaptive mechanical system .
Festo's
YoYo product illustrates that fully automatic control is possible with the aid of mechatronics - it also forms a bridge to the company 's core competency , automation with air .
AquaJelly
AquaJelly is an artificial autonomous jellyfish with an electric drive and an intelligent , adaptive mechanical system .
AquaJelly consists of a translucent hemisphere and eight tentacles used for propulsion .
At the centre of the AquaJelly is a watertight , laser - sintered pressure vessel .
This comprises a central , electric drive , two lithium - ion - polymer batteries , the charge control device and the servo motors for the swashplate .
The structure of each tentacle uses the Fin Ray Effect® - a construction design derived from the functional anatomy of a fish fin .
It moves with the aid of a peristaltic propulsion system , or wave - like contractions , based on the reaction thrust principle used by its biological precursor .
The motion of the AquaJelly in three - dimensional environments is controlled by shifting its weight .
Two servo motors integrated into the central pressure vessel actuate a swashplate .
This swashplate controls a four - arm pendulum which can be steered in the four spatial directions .
When a pendulum moves in a certain direction , the centre of gravity of the jellyfish changes in this direction .
AquaJelly is capable of independently controlling its own energy supply , by means of communication between the AquaJelly and a charging station .
Whenever the AquaJelly comes to a charger located above the water basin , it is sucked towards it and provided with electricity .
For communication on the water surface , the AquaJelly can use the energy - conserving short - range radio standard ZigBee , which enables it to exchange status details with the charger and signal to other AquaJellies on the surface that the charger is occupied .
The main communication medium under water , however , is light .
The AquaJelly has eleven infrared light - emitting diodes with which it can communicate over distances of up to approx .
80 cm .
The pulsed infrared signals are sent from inside an almost spherical structure around the AquaJelly .
On receiving a position signal from an approaching jellyfish , for example , the AquaJelly can start its evasion manoeuvre in plenty of time .
In addition to environment sensors , the AquaJelly also has internal sensors which monitor its energy level , as well as a pressure sensor which allows it to gauge its depth in the basin to within a few millimetres .
Each jellyfish decides autonomously which action to carry out on the basis of its current condition .
This central electric drive , combined with an adaptive mechanical system and intelligent autonomous electronics , opens up possible new applications for self - controlling systems .
If a large number of AquaJellies were equipped with communicative abilities , these could act like a shoal with the behaviour pattern of a more highly developed system .
If one applies this principle to automation , then numerous autonomous or semi-autonomous intelligent systems might be able to work together .
In this way , large problems could be solved by small systems working together in harmony .
AirJelly
Air is the element of the AirJelly .
Rather than swimming through water like the AquaJelly , it glides through the air with the aid of its central electric drive and an intelligent , adaptive mechanical system .
The remote - controlled AirJelly is kept in the air by its helium - filled ballonet .
The AirJelly 's only energy source are two lithium - ion - polymer batteries , to which the central electric drive is attached .
This transmits its power to a bevel gear and then to eight spur gears , which drive the eight tentacles of the jellyfish via their respective cranks .
The structure of each tentacle is based on the Fin Ray Effect® .
Using a peristaltic movement to drive a balloon was previously unknown in the history of aviation .
The AirJelly is the first indoor flying object to use such a peristaltic propulsion system .
The jellyfish glides gently through the air thanks to this new drive concept based on the reaction thrust principle .
The AirJelly steers through three - dimensional environments by shifting its weight .
Its two servo motors are located at the " North pole " of the jellyfish and controlled proportionally .
If the pendulum moves in one direction , the AirJelly 's centre of gravity shifts in this direction - the AirJelly is thus able to swim in any spatial direction .
The propulsive force of the drive can be varied by moving the Fin Ray® tentacles more quickly or slowly .
Festo demonstrates with this exhibit that a central electric drive - combined with an intelligent mechanical system - can offer fascinating possibilities for " lighter - than - air " aviation .
Festo aims to delight its customers with innovative , fascinating and intelligent solutions in both automation and didactics .
It therefore offers a wide range of electric , pneumatic and hybrid drive systems , together with the respective sensors and control possibilities .
The issue of sexism in vegan circles is “ extremely polarizing , ” said Bob Torres , an author of “ Vegan Freak , ” a guide to living a vegan lifestyle , which generally means avoiding the use of animals for food , clothing or other purposes .
Mr. Torres , like many vegans , disavows the “ essential idea at the heart of some animal rights activism that any means justifies the ends , ” he said .
Certain activists , he added , care only about “ animal suffering and ignore the suffering of humans , ” a category into which he would put women who are exploited .
According to a 2006 Harris poll commissioned by the Vegetarian Resource Group , which publishes The Vegetarian Journal , only about 2.3 percent of the adult population of the United States is vegetarian .
At most , half of those are practicing vegans .
But the vegan philosophy has achieved a prominence greater than those small numbers would indicate .
There are many celebrity acolytes , including Natalie Portman , who recently introduced a line of nonleather shoes .
The best - selling diet book “ Skinny Bitch ” and a follow - up cookbook , “ Skinny Bitch in the Kitch , ” promote veganism .
Both have been accused of sexist undertones .
People adopt a diet free of animal products for a variety of reasons .
They may believe it is healthier or more environmentally friendly .
They may support animal rights .
In addition , veganism is often part of a larger progressive agenda , which makes many particularly sensitive to sexism charges .
Carol J. Adams , the author of “ The Sexual Politics of Meat , ” a bible of the vegan community , said that women ’s rights and the rights of animals have often been aligned .
She traces the relationship to the 1890s .
“ A lot of feminist suffragists also became vegetarian , ” said Ms. Adams , who gave up meat in 1974 while living in a feminist community in Cambridge , Mass .
She noted that Susan B . Anthony attended a dinner at which the toast was for “ Total Abstinence , Women ’s Rights and Vegetarianism . ”
( An unrepentant omnivore , Ms. Anthony had a predilection for porterhouse steak . )
Ms. Adams added that feminists were early adopters of vegetarianism .
“ Back in the ’70s , lots of women were saying , ‘ I do n’t want to be a piece of meat .
I ’m not going to eat a piece of meat , ’ ” she said .
Vegans who use sexuality to promote the cause say it is a good way to convert carnivores  in particular , men .
Sky Valencia , the founder of the Vegan Vixens , said her group targets “ the people who buy Playboy and Maxim and watch talk shows like Jerry Springer .
Those are the people we want to educate because they do n’t know anything about the environment or animal rights issues or health . ”

For years , it ’s been commonplace for Washington policy observers to shrug over the power of the pro-Israel lobby group , the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) .
On questions of Congressional legislation and appropriations involving U.S. defense sales to the Middle East , the Israeli - Palestinian dispute , and policy towards Iran and Syria , AIPAC ’s influence is an acknowledged fact of life on the Hill , similar to death and taxes , second in power as a Washington lobby group only to the National Rifle Association .
But though its power in Congress is broad and bipartisan , and with some 100,000 members it ostensibly represents an American Jewish community that skews overwhelmingly Democratic , some in Washington ’s policy community have as long been concerned by what they see as a sharp rightward tilt in AIPAC over the years , in particular as some of its funders and leadership have aligned themselves with hawkish policy positions on issues involving national security , the Arab Israeli conflict , and how to deal with Iran .
So began the motivation for the creation of J Street and JStreetPAC , a new nonprofit lobby group and affiliated political action committee being launched today in Washington , whose leadership describes the new organizations as “ pro Israel , pro peace . ”
And unlike most other smaller Washington Mid-East oriented policy shops that primarily issue position papers and opeds , J Street was designed to be distinctly political .
“ It ’s the first time that there has been a political arm for those of us who are pro Israel but pro peace , and who believe that reaching a negotiated settlement in the Middle East is absolutely essential for the security of both Israel and the United States , ” Jeremy Ben - Ami , the executive director of J Street and JStreetPAC told me .
“ That is the reason for this effort .
We believe the majority of American Jews and many other Americans friendly and supportive to Israel really do recognize that a policy both here and there that would be geared towards really pushing for a two state solution is in Israel ’s and the U.S. ’s best interests . ”
“ What has happened in the political world is that the people both elected [ to Congress ] and candidates and the folks around them have come to believe that the only way to speak to the Jewish community is to take the most right - wing position , ” Ben - Ami said .
“ There is no political benefit to be at the center . ”
“ We would like to create a political mechanism , a political benefit to being at the center , ” Ben -Ami continued .
“ Perhaps there should be a dialogue between the U.S. and Syria .
Perhaps the U.S. should pursue an alternative route to Iran .
Let ’s get serious about a two - state solution , and stop the settlements and stop the occupation and get a two state solution .
That is currently not being said . ”
Among J Street ’s leadership : Ben -Ami , a former senior domestic policy advisor to President Bill Clinton and former policy advisor to Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean ; Alan Solomont , a former finance director to the Democratic National Committee ; Hannah Rosenthal , former Executive Director to the Jewish Council on Public Affairs ; Victor Kovner , former New York City Corporation Counsel ; and Samuel Lewis , former U.S. ambassador to Israel under Presidents Carter and Reagan .
The new group has an advisory counsel of 100 American members and has gathered letters of support from twenty some former Israeli security and diplomatic officials , including the former Israeli Defense Forces chief of staff Maj.
Gen. Amnon Lipkin- Shahak , the former Israeli Air Force commander Maj. Gen. Amos Lapidot , former Israeli foreign minister Shlomo Ben Ami , two former director generals of the Israeli foreign ministry David Kimche and Alon Liel , former Knesset speaker Avram Burg , and Dalia Rabin , daughter of former Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and a former member of the Israeli Knesset and deputy defense minister .
“ It ’s time for members of Congress in particular and the administration to hear much more loudly from those of us in the American Jewish community that the only way to protect Israel ’s security and for that matter American security interests as well is to support relentlessly a negotiated settlement to the Israeli Palestinian conflict , ” Solomont , a member of J Street ’s advisory counsel , and a former chairman of the Combined Jewish Philanthropies in Boston , said Tuesday .
“ Unfortunately other voices are often heard more loudly and I think that distracts members of Congress and the administration from pursuing what I think everyone recognizes as the solution to this conflict . ”
One of J Street ’s Israeli supporters in Washington , former Israeli peace negotiator Daniel Levy , says Israeli leaders need encouragement from Washington to make concessions that could contribute to the peace process .
“ I think there comes a point when , if the Israeli leadership actually wants to see this thing resolved , it ’s clearly easier to say yes to the president of the United States , rather than to the [ Palestinian Liberation Organization ] , ” Levy says .
“ You need to have the president of the United States to help carry you there . ”
For now , Ben - Ami tells me he is working out of his basement , the organization has no headquarters and does n’t plan for one , and plans to operate heavily in the online world .
“ We ’re following the MoveOn model , of being virtual , and heavily online , ” he says .
“ Part of our goal and plan in the coming year is to develop an online presence in the way that Obama and Dean and MoveOn have done … and to tap into that and have a large base of small donors . ”
MoveOn financier George Soros , an initial backer of the concept for the group , pulled out of it , Ben Ami explains , because he thought his presence might ultimately be unhelpful , given his reputation as a bankroller for liberal groups .
J Street has raised half of the $ 1.5 million it hopes to collect from donors over 2008 .
That still makes it a tiny David in the shadow of AIPAC ’s Goliath , which reportedly has an endowment of $ 100 million , and 18 offices around the country , including a new Washington headquarters funded , sources say , by Las Vegas Casino mogul and conservative philanthropist Sheldon Adelson .
Online fundraising innovations aside , some veteran Middle East hands expressed skepticism that the new organization can do much to transform the domestic political forces that guide Washington ’s approach to the Israeli - Palestinian dispute– including strong right wing American Christian evangelical opposition to any U.S. pressure on Israel to stop expanding settlements .
J Street “ has a very steep hill to climb because peacemaking has acquired a bad reputation over the years in the Jewish community , ” former U.S. ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk told the Washington Post .
“ And there is a widespread fear that U.S. intervention on behalf of peace will lead to pressure on Israel . ”
But even just with its launch , J Street has perhaps managed to prod some of those same weary Middle East hands and Washington policy observers to talk about such thorny issues with a bit less ideological constraint — a small feat in and of itself .
By Dave Lindorff
In a couple days , Americans will be deluged with effusive , praise - filled stories in what passes for news organizations , print and electronic , in the US , quoting Gen.
David Petraeus on the glories of his and President Bush ’s brilliant so - called " surge " strategy in Iraq .
There will be little critical comment on his report , which will claim that the surge is working but that Iraqi ’s “ need to do more ” to take advantage of the surge in stability to create a stable government in Baghdad .
He will claim , and the media will help him here , that the collapse of President Nouri al - Maliki ’s “ defining moment ” attack on the Mahdi Army of Moqtada al - Sadr in Basra , with 1000 of his crack troops and two leading officers defecting to the other side , and Maliki himself having to be rescued by American troops , was a minor event .
He will claim that the rise in violence in Baghdad and elsewhere in Iraq back to pre-surge levels is of no significance — a statistical aberration .
And President Bush will ask for another $ 102 billion from Congress to continue funding his catastrophic war in Iraq .
Just to keep our sanity and clarity , it would be good to listen to another general , Lt. General ( ret. ) William E. Odom , who on April 2 testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
Gen .
Odom told the committee that the last time he had testified about Iraq was in January of 2007 .
He had been asked about the “ surge ” .
He said , “ Today you are asking if it has worked .
Last year I rejected the claim that it was a new strategy .
Rather , I said , it is a new tactic used to achieve the same old strategic aim , political stability .
And I foresaw no serious prospects for success .
I see no reason to change my judgment now .
The surge is prolonging instability , not creating the conditions for unity as the president claims . ”
Gen .
Odom said , “ Violence has been temporarily reduced but today there is credible evidence that the political situation is far more fragmented .
And currently we see violence surge in Baghdad and Basra .
In fact , it has also remained sporadic and significant in several other parts of Iraq over the past year , notwithstanding the notable drop in Baghdad and Anbar Province .
More disturbing , Prime Minister Maliki has initiated military action and then dragged in US forces to help his own troops destroy his Shiite competitors .
This is a political setback , not a political solution .
Such is the result of the surge tactic . "
Odom went on to say , “ No less disturbing has been the steady violence in the Mosul area , and the tensions in Kirkuk between Kurds , Arabs , and Turkomen .
A showdown over control of the oil fields there surely awaits us .
And the idea that some kind of a federal solution can cut this Gordian knot strikes me as a wild fantasy , wholly out of touch with Kurdish realities . ”
As for the Bush claim that Sunni Muslims in western Iraq and Fallujah were now siding with the US ( the government never mentions that they are being handsomely paid to do so ) , Odom said ,
“ Their break with al Qaeda should give us little comfort .
The Sunnis welcomed anyone who would help them kill Americans , including al Qaeda .
The concern we hear the president and his aides express about a residual base left for al Qaeda if we withdraw is utter nonsense .
The Sunnis will soon destroy al Qaeda if we leave Iraq .
The Kurds do not allow them in their region , and the Shiites , like the Iranians , detest al Qaeda .
To understand why , one need only take note of the al Qaeda public diplomacy campaign over the past year or so on internet blogs .
They implore the United States to bomb and invade Iran and destroy this apostate Shiite regime . ”
Odom said America was buying Sunni backing in just one region for $ 250,000 a day , and he warned , “ we do n’t own these people , we rent them . ”
Then Odom let fly a real bomb .
“ As an aside , ” he told the committee , in a statement that you wo n’t read in your daily paper or hear on the TV news , “ it gives me pause to learn that our vice president and some members of the Senate are aligned with al Qaeda on spreading the war to Iran . ”
Saying the Bush administration ’s argument that it could build a stable democratic government by working with local strongmen in Iraq , he challenged the senators to “ Ask them to name a single historical case where power has been aggregated successfully from local strong men to a central government except through bloody violence leading to a single winner , most often a dictator . “
The general ’s conclusion : “ We face a deteriorating political situation with an over - extended army .
When the administration 's witnesses appear before you , you should make them clarify how long the army and marines can sustain this band - aid strategy . ”
Odom instead called for immediate withdrawal , “ rapidly but in good order . ”
He said , “ Only that step can break the paralysis now gripping US strategy in the region .
The next step is to choose a new aim , regional stability , not a meaningless victory in Iraq . ”
He said if Bush and Cheney would simply stop threatening “ regime change ” by force as a policy , and in specific if it stopped threatening Iran , it would lead Iran to reduce its support of the Taliban in Afghanistan , and to change its policy toward Iraq , too .
The US “ needs to make Iran feel more secure , ” he said .

Niche wikis are pretty rampant in this day and age , but in terms of their having large or even long - term effects on anything larger than themselves , it 's pretty difficult to pawn much value from them , unless you 're a rabid member .
As Mark mentioned the other day , niche wikis are somewhat caught in a web 2.0 twilight zone where they provide a lot of value to some , but are difficult to monetize or incentivize in terms of user activity and generated content .
WetPaint is one of the larger wiki networks out there , and has managed to present itself as a tool for marketing purposes , whether it 's the necessity of finding a community for target marketing , or for conducting a bit of marketing research .
So when I got a note in my inbox telling of a WetPaint wiki that had enough effect as to help revive the Jericho television series , I was n't entirely surprised .
You 'll see similar results occurring through rallies held on Facebook groups , demanding change from a larger entity that may otherwise not be swayed .
What I 'm particularly interested in , after seeing the impact WetPaint 's Jericho wiki had on CBS , however , is the potential for market research that may not be taken advantage of , especially when it comes to wikis .
Should there be a more systematic way in which wikis and other interest groups are utilized by larger brands ?
Could this in fact present some sort of incentivization of user interaction , if dealing with a brand , with a wiki network acting as a conduit ?
It 's particularly relevant with this Jericho example , because of the turmoil going on within the television industry , and broadcasters ' need to turn to online sectors in order to distribute and monitor the activity that 's occurring in the space .
As we 've seen with Nielsen , content owners are quite anxious to discover how consumers interact with television clips in the home , both on the TV as well as the PC .
It 's all part of the larger effort to better monetize content .
For the larger brands , that means finding better ways to make more money than ever , without increasing their own costs .
Could such WetPaint wikis lend themselves towards this front ?
I think so .
There are groups and mini - wikis that manifest within larger groups that are dedicated to larger media sectors , such as television and film content .
These networks are being snatched up by the likes of Comcast , as an effort to collect data from users and disseminate information across its user base .
Aside from the ad network potential that these sites hold for Comcast 's benefit , they will also provide necessary tools for garnering decent research , which content owners are anxious to get their hands on right now .
Alcatel - Lucent has joined Nokia , and there is a new vision for the future .

Is Hillary Gonna Go Independent and Launch a New Party ?
It Sure Looks Like It
by Davey D
So for a while I been saying Hillary was gonna pull a gangsta move at the convention in Denver and declare that she is going to run for President as an independent .
Its not as far fetched as you might think .
Hillary has been over the top divisive to the point that she is damn near saying ;
‘ If I ca n’t be the nominee nobody can .
I ’m gonna fuck up this Democratic Party so much nobody can use it …
That ’s how she has been acting with all the racial disharmony bit .
There was a lot of early chatter before the first primaries that went along these lines - The game plan was for Hillary to be the nominee and Barack Obama to be back up .
His role was to be a second rockstar / superstar type figure in the newly energized Democratic Party that was set to take back the White House in 2008 .
He was to bide his time and get groomed and be a spark plug for young voters , moderates and maybe African Americans .
Keep in mind , the Clintons pretty much had all of us Black folks sewn up .
They had locked down most of the Congressional Black Caucus who were publicly pledging their support and acting as surrogates .
They had gathered up damn near every key Black elected official from here in Cali to New York .
We ’re talking from Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums to Harlem Congressman Charles Rangel - all were riding hard for Hillary .
Adding to that , was the Clintons had sewn up most of the non-conservative Latino vote .
The only thing Hillary Clinton had to work on was swooping up women voters who interestingly enough were divided about her candidacy weeks and months before the first primaries .
Now somewhere along the way something changed .
Call it a miscalculation .
Call it a double - cross .
Call it a change of heart but the bottomline is Obama who was behind by double digits defied the pundits and started winning .
Initially his success came with the help of enthusiastic young voters and college educated white voters .
His momentum caused the Clintons to panic at which point they tried to ‘ control all their Negroes ’ and keep everyone in check , it backfired .
The Clintons showed their true colors which manifested in their overt disrespect for Black folks .
Can anyone say South Carolina ?
It was like almost overnight , Black folks who were still questioning Obama ’s intentions and even his Blackness , started rolling with him when Bill Clinton , the supposed first Black President got real nasty and dissed Martin Luther King just days before his birthday .
Hillary Clinton , during that South Carolina stint added to the disrespect when brought out billionaire and former BET CEO Bob Johnson who she proudly claimed as a long time friend and advisor .
That was a bad move considering the anger Johnson has sparked in Black folks nationwide because of his staunch refusal to stop showing degrading images of Black folks on his old network ( BET is now owned by Viacom .
) Bringing Johnson out to rep Hillary and endear her to Black people would be like me bringing OJ Simpson to a NOW convention in hopes that he would endear me to women .
It was n’t happening .
Johnson showed his lack of worth by playing the role of Hillary ’s subserviant lap dog as he promptly went on the attack and tried to clown Senator Obama by eluding to his past drug use which Obama had already admitted to in his memoirs .
His action drew swift rebuke and was perhaps the final straw in a week full of racial swipes and insults by the Clintons .
Since South Carolina , the race between Obama and Clinton has been more than spirited but on many levels personal with the Clinton ’s finally realizing that the guy who was supposed to be backup quarterback was actually gonna take this thing .
So now we fast forward with two or three weeks left in the primary and we see Hillary running harder than ever even tho there ’s no way she possibly win in terms of pledge delegates .
Thus far her strategy has been to keep bringing up ‘ fuzzy logic ’ and even fuzzier math which includes her continuously saying that she won the popular vote by counting the votes from Florida and Michigan in spite of the fact that both states were in violation of Democratic Party rules and thus did not and should not count .
In the case of Michigan , Obama name was n’t even on the ballot but that has not made no difference to the Clintons who seem to hope that by repeating a lie often enough people will start to hear it as truth .
By now we are all aware of the divisive race card the Clintons have been playing .
They have been anything but subtle .
Hillary has all but said she is in the race to rep for white people which is in sharp contrast to Obama who routinely gets criticized for not pushing a ‘ Black agenda ’ while seemingly always bending over to appease whites .
Obama has made the cornerstone of his campaign to be a transcender of race and bring all people together .
Such has not been the case with Hillary .
One would think that Obama who has been winning impressively by bringing together folks of all ethnicities only attracts one type of person , where in fact its Hillary who increasingly appears to be a one horse show .
She appeals to working class whites .
So what ’s really going on ?
Why is Hillary still running everyone is wondering ?.
First , we know Hillary is not just running for herself .
She has an entire team which includes her husband that she got to be accountable to and they ’re not about to give up on their plans to be living at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave come January 2009 .
Hence Hillary who is the face of that team is out there running like there ’s no tomorrow .
There ’s been all sorts of speculation .
Some are saying Hillary is vigorously running in all 50 states for the sake of history .
It would be akin to running out a ground ball or remain standing after a heavyweight prize fight .
others are saying that she ’s running to increase her influence and have much more say so as to what direction the Democratic Party takes and the strategy it employs come the fall contest .
Others say she ’s doing it to assure being included on the ticket as vice president or to ideally position herself for another run in 2012 .
My prediction as I mentioned earlier was Hillary Clinton was gearing up to try and run as an independent but I could n’t fill in all the gaps to complete the entire scenario .
This afternoon ( Tuesday May 20 ) on former Air America talk show host Randi Rhodes did on her new show .
She talked about Clinton ’s close ties to Senator Joe Liberman who was basically run out of the Democratic Party during the 2006 election because he was always riding hard for the Republicans and a stauch supporter of the Iraq War .
The Dems thought they could bounce him out and replace him with someone more liberal - Ned Lamont who was against the war .
Unfortunately the plan backfired .
Liberman lost the Democratic primary but came around to kick everyone in the butt by winning the general election when he ran as an independent .
So you know dude is salty .
Rhodes surmised that Hillary and Liberman who was the 2004 democratic Vice President nominee , had to have discussed the possibility of her making an independent run .
Rhodes went on to give some insight as to what the Clintons may likely be feeling after having super delegates and party leaders who owe a lot of their success and positions to the them , turn their backs and break ranks to support Obama .
She said in short , they may be more than miffed .
With Rhodes assessment in mind , you can now understand how a possible indy run would make sense .
People forget that Bill Clinton was one of the chief architects of the winning strategy of running to the political middle and taking a more conservative stance on social issues which was employed by the DLC ( Democratic Leadership Council ) which he chaired in the early 90s .
The DLC strategy is what led to the re-hauling of welfare , media consolidation which led to the Clear Channeling of commercial radio and the infamous crime bill which resulted in our prison population exploding to over 2 million .
The DLC ’s willingness to forsake the progressive wing of the party and placate so called Reagan Democrats has been touted as the best political strategy to come along in decades .
Its angered a lot of folks on the left who have found themselves either taken for granted or key issues along the lines of race and class , marginalized .
For a long time media outlets like Black Agenda Report with writers Glen Ford and Bruce Dixon have been putting Obama ’s feet to the fire .
Initially it was because of his ties to the DLC and later because of him following their strategy which means in the end Black folks will see their many of their key issues put to the back burner while white working class Reagan Democrats are appeased .
The way its shaping up is that there appears to be resentment that Obama might possibly be successful at that game and hence we are seeing the Clintons guard the white working class vote with the viciousness of a pitbull .
Any talk of racial reconciliation has all but been spat upon not so much by the Republicans but by the Clintons themselves along with key surrogates like Geraldine Ferraro who has already made disparaging racial comments about Obama has recently suggested that if he gets the nomination she will not support him .
The tactics used to lure the Reagan Democratics are the same racial fear based tactics used during the Clinton hey day .
It ’s interesting to note that the Clintons now refer to this demographic as ‘ hard working Americans ’ as if no one else in this country works hard .
It ’s as if single Black & Brown mothers are n’t putting in work or Black and Brown fathers are n’t going through economic challenges after seeing their factory jobs disappear overseas ?.
During the Clinton hey day those hard working Americans were depicted as ‘ angry white males ‘ who were supposedly royally getting screwed by the system .
Am I the only one who recalls the day when Reagan Democrats were crying that they were victimized by social programs like affirmative action , system abusing Black welfare queens and inner city crimes from the likes of Willie Horton ?
Today we have one too many talk show pundits who are now floating out the idea that Hillary Clinton ’s alignment and unwavering support of white working class voters is the start of a new movement and needs to be celebrated .
In recent weeks Hillary Clinton has been praised for reaching out and uplifting white working class voters with words like ‘ forgotten people ‘ and ‘ marginalized communities ‘ to describe them .
This time around their biggest fear is the afrocentric teachings of Reverend Jeremiah Wright and comments about them being ‘ bitter ’ from out of touch college educated types .
Hillary is being depicted as their champ .
The praise of her starting a movement is eerily similar to what was being touted about Obama early on when he was winning white audiences .
But unlike Clinton the white people Obama has been attracting have been described as more educated ( meaning they went to college ) and therefore they are part of the elite .
Are the Clintons creating a scenario where they can they can take this new movement and start their own thing ?
It may not work be fully successful in 2008 , but an independent Clinton run in 2008 sets the stage for 2012 .
I ’m imagining a scenario where a somber Hillary Clinton from the floor of the Democratic convention announces that she is duty bound to ‘ working class voters who are getting screwed and that she wants to be their champ and ensure that that they are truly represented .
Hence she is gonna run as an independent .
Heck she and her crew may even spark off what they think will be a viable 3rd party that adheres to the values and platforms of the DLC .
This new party will leave behind progressives , Black folks and young voters while offsetting that with moderate Dems , and Republicans and their new voting population that they will eventually take for granted - Latinos ..( Peep the interview I did with Immortal technique and listen to how he laid the role Latinos voters will come to play in future elections ) ..
This is how things seem to be shaping up .
What do you think ?
Some months ago , we had mentioned that Bank of America was keen to avoid taking on Countrywide ’s liabilities ( who would n’t be ? ) .
The possibility that the giant bank might not provide a guarantee for Countrywide ’s debt came to the fore again .
Without BofA backing , the Countrywide paper is a pretty dodgy proposition .
From Bloomberg :
Bank of America Corp. , the second - biggest U.S. bank , said it may not guarantee $ 38.1 billion of Countrywide Financial Corp .
’s debt after taking over the mortgage lender , fueling speculation that Countrywide ’s bondholders face renewed risk of default .
“ There is no assurance that any such debt would be redeemed , assumed or guaranteed , ” the Charlotte , North Carolina - based bank said in an April 30 regulatory filing , adding that no decision has been reached ….
Countrywide ’s $ 1 billion of 6.25 percent notes maturing in 2016 traded at 90.25 cents on the dollar yesterday with a yield of about 7.9 percent , according to Bloomberg data .
The debt traded as low as 46 cents in January , with a yield of 20 percent , just before Bank of America announced the purchase .
“ I ’d be quite concerned if I was a bondholder if the intent of Bank of America is as it reads in the filing , ” said Gary Austin , founder of PDR Advisors LLC , an investment management firm in Charlotte .
His firm , which manages about $ 600 million , does n’t hold Countrywide debt …
“ This confirms how tenuous this transaction is , ” said Christopher Whalen , managing director at Institutional Risk Analytics , a banking research firm , from Torrance , California … .
The wording in the bank ’s filing is new , Victoria Wagner , a credit analyst at Standard & Poor ’s Corp. , said in an interview yesterday .
“ If they let the debt fail , it would have implications for their other obligations , ” she said .
“ They are still going to wholly own Countrywide . ” .
With food prices soaring , it takes some gall to force Americans to pay billions of dollars to millionaire agribusinesses .
Yet that ’s what the latest farm bill would do .
Since the last farm bill was enacted in 2002 , the five crops that receive the lion ’s share of farm subsidies have also enjoyed massive price increases : cotton ( 105 percent price increase ) , soybeans ( 164 percent ) , corn ( 169 percent ) , wheat ( 256 percent ) and rice ( 281 percent ) .
For consumers , these price increases have caused financial pain domestically and near - riots abroad .
For farmers , it ’s a sunnier story : Total net farm income has leaped 56 percent in just two years , and helped bring the average farm household ’s income to a record $ 89,434 , and its net worth to $ 838,875 .
During this crop - price boom , continuing to subsidize farmers makes as much sense as paying Apple to make another generation of iPods .
Yet instead of cutting , Congress ’ answer is to harvest even more farm subsidies .
The latest version would increase payment rates for more than a dozen crops and increase conservation subsidies .
Although the same farmers already receive massive annual subsidies , plus taxpayer - funded crop insurance , Congress would also layer a new permanent disaster aid program .
Expect Congress to declare an emergency any week that it rains – or does n’t rain .
Commercial help
Farm subsidies have long been America ’s largest corporate welfare program .
Rather than help small , struggling family farmers , the majority of subsidies go to commercial farmers , who report an average income of $ 200,000 and a net worth of nearly $ 2 million .
President Bush called on Congress to end farm subsidies for families earning more than $ 200,000 annually .
Instead , Congress decided that married couples with less than $ 1.5 million in annual net farm income should be barred from one farm subsidy program – but still allowed to collect from all the rest .
This is what passes for reform .
And for the vast majority of farmers and agribusiness that remain eligible for farm subsidies , bigger checks await .
Agribusinesses have long exploited loopholes to evade the $ 150,000 annual limit on marketing loan subsidies , including dividing themselves into dozens of separate legal entities and collecting subsidies for each one .
Yet rather than better enforce this payment limit , the farm bill simply repeals it altogether .
No longer would agribusinesses even need to hire attorneys and find loopholes in order to amass millions in taxpayer subsidies .
Overall , the farm bill is officially listed as adding $ 10 billion in new spending over the decade .
But that ignores the blatant gimmicks – such as shifting costs just outside the 10 - year window , and unrealistically assuming all increases will suddenly be repealed in four years – that could add more than $ 10 billion to the cost .
Congressional Democrats who loudly denounced budget deficits are now prepared to bypass anti-deficit rules for this bloated bill .
Thus , farm subsidies will continue costing taxpayers at least $ 25 billion annually .
And for what purpose ?
Subsidies do n’t solve farmer poverty because they go to profitable agribusinesses .
They do n’t preserve family farms because agribusinesses use their subsidies to buy them out .
They are no longer designed to stabilize crop prices .
Nor do they promote cheap food , as ethanol policies are raising prices steeply .
These programs lack any coherent rationale .
Instead , they cost billions in taxes and higher supermarket prices .
They harm the environment by encouraging over - planting .
By undermining America ’s trade negotiations , subsidies raise consumer prices and restrict U.S. exports .
Cotton subsidies undercut impoverished African farmers desperately trying to make a living .
They contribute to obesity and rising health care costs by subsidizing corn and soy ( from which sugars and fats are derived ) rather than healthier fruits and vegetables .
Favored industry
Farm subsidies do n’t produce food , but they do produce votes .
Despite its economic incoherence , the farm agreement is overwhelmingly popular in a Congress that has mastered the art of distributing tax dollars to favored industries .
Although Bush has pledged to veto the farm bill , Congress has stubbornly pledged to override the veto .
Is it any wonder why Washington is so unpopular these days ?
All Michael Buday wanted to do was take the last name of his wife , Diana Bijon , when they married in the US .
But it took two years , a lawsuit alleging sex discrimination and a change in California law before he picked up his new drivers licence in the name of Michael Bijon on Monday .
" It was personal .
I feel much closer to ( Diana 's ) father than I do mine .
She asked me to take her name and I thought it would be very simple .
I never imagined the state would make it so difficult , " Michael Bijon , 31 , told reporters .
This is the first of a multipart series on the state of the economy and how we got here .
There is no glory on Wall Street .
There is only greed .
There are no good guys or bad guys .
There are only winners and losers .
In fact , there are only guys like Steve Schwarzman and Pete Peterson .
In 1984 , Schwarzman and Peterson got crushed like a couple of grapes under the very chubby feet of a guy named Lew Glucksman .
( Everything about Lew was chubby , not just his feet . )
This happened at a place called Lehman Brothers , at that time a venerable Wall Street partnership .
It was a classic power struggle , but no biggie in the whole scheme of things .
Schwarzman and Peterson bounced back quickly .
In 1985 , they started a new firm with a shared secretary and $ 400,000 .
Their new company was called the Blackstone Group , and it is the stuff of legend to say that fortune smiled on them .
Schwarzman and Peterson are now two of the richest men in the world .
Since 1985 , they 've done over $ 400 billion in deals .
They are arguably the leading global alternative - asset managers in the world .
What 's more , they invented an entirely new financial world while they did it .
Problem is , we have to live in it .
Problem Swallowing
Problem is , there are lots of problems on Wall Street .
For starters , we 've seen the consolidation of power and the concentration of both capital and revenue in fewer and fewer hands .
The few institutions left on Wall Street — and there about 10 — are now like superstores or warehouses .
And the story of how they came to dominate Wall Street is very much like the story of how Costco or Sam's Club came to push mom and pop retailers off the map .
I would know .
I started my career at Alex Brown & Sons , the oldest investment bank in the country , established in 1800 .
A guy named A. B. " Buzzy " Krongard hired me .
( Buzzy later turned out to be the No. 3 guy in the CIA . )
Alas , in the decade of the 1990s , the proud people at Alex Brown got swallowed up by Bankers Trust , which in turn got swallowed up by Deutsche Bank .
I also worked for Colonial Management Associates , which got swallowed up by Columbia Management Group , which got swallowed up by FleetBoston , which got swallowed up by Bank of America .
I worked on the floor of the NYSE for Spear , Leeds & Kellogg , which was swallowed up by Goldman Sachs .
I worked for Dean Witter , which got swallowed up by Morgan Stanley .
None of the firms I worked for were small companies , what we on Wall Street quaintly call " boutiques . "
I worked for big companies .
Yet they 've all been swallowed .
All of them .
Now , the 10 or so institutions that dominate Wall Street are monopolies .
We 've also seen the reinvention of these very same companies on Wall Street .
There is now no difference between a commercial bank and an investment bank , no difference between a lender and an adviser .
There is now only the monolithic Merrill Lynch or the monolithic Citigroup .
Capital is concentrated in these few firms .
Naturally , so are revenues .
But risk , too , is concentrated .
This is a big problem .
Because if every deal has got to be bigger and bigger to earn fatter and fatter rewards , then these few institutions must assume greater and greater risk .
And risk management is what making money is all about .
Prime Junk Chumps
The Glass - Steagall Act , enacted during the Great Depression to prevent another stock market crash by separating commercial banking from investment banking , was repealed in 1999 .
In today 's lineup of traders , deal makers , underwriters , lenders , advisers , market makers , portfolio managers , brokers and others , it is impossible to point to the chief suspect in the defrauding of America that is now being commonly called the " subprime crisis . "
The traditional institutions of commercial banks and investment banks have given way to a new set called hedge funds , private equity funds , and other alternative asset managers .
Emphasis on " alternative . "
Schwarzman and Peterson saw the trend ; this was their genius .
But there is little to no regulation of alternative - asset managers .
Which brings us to the next problem :
There is little to no regulation of the alternative assets that these alternative - asset managers dream up and manage .
A lot of this stuff is debt — debt that is diced , spliced , altered , reheated , topped off with nuts , whipped cream and a cherry and then packaged and repackaged to the American investor .
This debt is sold not directly to the little guy , the retail investor — you and me — but to the institutional investor who is presumably acting on our behalf through pension funds , insurance companies , mutual funds , endowments and others .
In the parlance of Wall Street , this debt is " securitized . "
Call this debt by any name , but do n't call it secure .
The popular names for this debt are collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMOs ) and collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) , first widely heard last summer when the subprime market was blowing up .
These CMOs and CDOs are spread across the spectrum of risk .
Some are senior debt .
Some are subordinated debt .
Some are OK .
The rest are junk .
Junk as in subprime junk .
Guess who owns that debt now ?
You do .
Through your pension plans , insurance policies , mutual funds , university and hospital endowments — you do , we do , I do .
And ever since the Federal Reserve Bank bailed out Bear Stearns , you now also own this debt as an American taxpayer .
Yeah , chump , you .
The losses —er , liabilities — were shifted to you .
There 's more .
The Fed now lends money — our taxpayer money — to all of Wall Street .
The Fed lends not just to its member banks , like before the subprime mess , but it now also lends to all those reckless broker dealers out there , firms like Bear Stearns .
The Fed lends your money to them through something that is called the " discount window . "
And , man , is that money discounted !
The Fed is giving it away .
As of this writing , borrowing from the discount window hit something like $ 36.2 billion a day .
A day .
Impossible Things
In Alice in Wonderland , the Queen says , " I believe in as many as six impossible things before breakfast . "
Within the last decade , a thousand impossible things are dreamed up before dawn .
Not only is there the packaging of new forms of debt , but the minting of new forms of money .
Literally , new forms of money : they 're called swaps and derivatives .
Swaps and derivatives trade like stocks and bonds , but most of them are n't registered securities like stocks or bonds .
But swaps and derivatives are n't exactly Monopoly money , either .
What are they ?
Ridiculously complex and esoteric .
For the last decade , risk managers on Wall Street pulled their hair out , lost sleep and finally gave up trying to quantify the risk inherent in them .
Yeah , they 've given up .
When it came to swaps and derivatives , even auditors could n't find their ass with both hands .
And yet trillions of dollars in swaps and derivatives trade every single day in markets that did n't even exist a decade ago .
For the most part , the biggest volume of swaps and derivatives do n't even trade in a physical marketplace like the exchanges in New York or Chicago .
The transactions are opaque because they are largely undertaken by private parties in electronic markets , most of them offshore .
Swaps and derivatives trade in a virtual market , a shadow market .
A market that in the United States alone is estimated to be a $ 45.5 trillion market .
Here 's the perspective :
The size of the worldwide bond market is estimated at $ 45 trillion .
The size of the worldwide stock market is estimated at $ 51 trillion .
And the size of the worldwide swaps and derivatives market is estimated at $ 480 trillion in nominal or " face " value .
That 's 30 times the size of the entire U.S. economy and 12 times the size of the entire world economy .
Brokers & Barbarians
How is this possible ?
Advanced technologies make this market possible .
Welcome to money 's alternative universe .
Alternative trading systems .
Electronic communications networks .
Central banks .
Private banks .
Brass plate banks .
Russian Mafia banks in Cyprus .
The Vatican 's bank in the Cayman Islands .
The Bush and bin Laden families holding hands and tip - toeing through the tulips in financial cyberspace .
Digital barrels of oil in virtual supertankers in the Persian Gulf .
Digital ounces of gold in virtual vaults in Switzerland .
Digital bushels of corn in virtual silos in Iowa .
Eurex .
Euronext .
The World Federation of Exchanges .
A transnational community of anonymous traders who have never met and never will .
Merrill Lynch trading swaps and derivatives with Iran .
Mullahs on the mainframe .
Citigroup trading swaps and derivatives with Venezuela .
Chavez on the craps table .
UBS trading swaps and derivatives with almost anyone out there in the ethers — Christ , the anti-Christ — it does n't matter to UBS .
What matters is that traders keep liquidity coming out the yin -yang .
We 've seen the emergence of a new master race on Wall Street who work hand in hand with the traders .
They created this market of swaps and derivatives , and help traders manipulate this market through their own brand of highly sophisticated pump - and - dump schemes and do their damned best to keep this market secret and off the books .
These are the prime brokers .
Not in keeping with their other brethren on Wall Street , either short - term traders or long - term bankers , prime brokers are the new barbarians at the gate .
They augment the activities of the hedge - fund guys and private - equity guys — and then take the game to a whole other level .
Believe me when I say their interests are not aligned with your interests .
At press time , oil nears a record $ 117 a barrel .
The dollar continues to fall .
Our credit woes continue to worsen .
The United States is deep in debt and still digging .
We 're all paying for the nation 's debt addiction through both direct and indirect taxes .
Our leaders , such as they are , are tracking the storm of inflation and the threat of the most serious recession since the Great Depression .
Still think this does n't have anything to do with you ?
Steve Schwarzman and Pete Peterson are betting on it .
Next :
Where has that Black Swan been hiding ?
John Sakowicz is a Sonoma County investor who was a cofounder of a multibillion - dollar offshore hedge fund , Battle Mountain Research Group .
He was assisted in research by Arianna Carisella .
Google Health opened up to the public today after several months of private beta testing .
The long - anticipated health records project now allows Google users to manage their doctor records , prescriptions , and test results , as well as find out information about drug interactions and search for new doctors .
All you need is a Gmail account and a healthy dose of trust to get started with Google Health , although some are still skeptical about the terms of service .
Signing into the service is extremely simple .
If you already have an account with Google ( already required in order to use Gmail , Google Docs , Google Calendar , and the like ) , then you have already skipped a major step .
This is also one of Google Health 's possible downfalls , however , as it is now exceedingly easy for a hacker to discover someone 's universal Google login ( which , by the way , has no minimum requirement for secure passwords ) and not just access their e-mail but their health records too .
Still , logging in and using the site is easy — " Google easy , " one might say .
Using easy - to - find links on the landing page or in the left - hand column , users can add their own personal information ( such as date of birth , height , and weight ) , list out their existing medications and allergies , and , most importantly , import their medical records .
This feature is limited to a small list of healthcare providers and drugstores that offer online records already .
For those of us whose doctors still maintain records the old fashioned way , importing records wo n't be quite so simple .
If you do have records as part of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , Cleveland Clinic , Longs Drug Stores , and Walgreens Pharmacy ( among others ) , importing your data is exceedingly simple .
For me , I had old prescription records stored at Walgreens , which I was able to bring into Google Health after logging into my Walgreens account and authorizing Google to use the information for as long as I deem appropriate .
Google makes what you are doing exceedingly clear before you do it and allows you to set your own expiration date for when you need to authorize the import of information again .
Once your information is imported , you can access it from you have an Internet connection .
You can also share your info with certain parties , like your spouse or your doctor , at your own discretion .
Google emphasizes that your data is entirely , 100 percent yours and you can do with it as you please — any individual who gains access to your data has to have explicit permission to do so by you ( apart from the enterprising hacker mentioned above ) .
Protecting your privacy
That brings us to Google Health 's privacy policy .
A number of sites have expressed ( legitimate , in our opinion ) skepticism over the terms of use presented to users during signup .
For example , one part of the TOS reads , " When you provide your information through Google Health , you give Google a license to use and distribute it in connection with Google Health and other Google services . "
That sounds scary at first , but upon reviewing the privacy policy document , Google makes it extremely clear how it will and will not use your data .
Google claims that it absolutely will not share your identified or de-identified information without explicit consent , except in situations requiring the company to do so by law .
If Google becomes involved in a merger or acquisition , the company will provide notice to all users before any personal information is transferred , and will only share aggregated , nonpersonal information with third parties .
For example , Google might say that 20 percent of Google Health users have imported data from Walgreens.com , or that 5 percent of users with seasonal allergies clicked ads for Claritin .
Of course , there are still a number of other concerns about Google Health , and online health record projects in general .
As we wrote last October when Microsoft launched HealthVault , patients are historically poor at remembering everything said to them by doctors , while others may not be in the mood to enter everything that exists on their records .
Considering that there are only a handful of providers that allow you to import your records directly , anything that is user - entered is only as trustworthy as those surveys they make you fill out when you go to a new physician .
The information provided may be incomplete or just flat out wrong .
As long as patients have the ability to add data to their records , Google Health and HealthVault are likely to face skepticism from the healthcare system ( unsurprising , given the state of electronic health records ) .
Still , physicians could merely restrict themselves to only depending upon the records imported directly from other healthcare providers ( which can not be modified by the user without going to that healthcare provider first ) , which would allow them easy and trustworthy access to a patient 's medical history .
Google VP Search Products and User Experience Marissa Mayer wrote on the Google Blog today that the company is looking forward to hearing feedback from early adopters about their experiences , concerns , and usage .
Perhaps if the medical community feels strongly enough about Google Health 's potential , the company might make changes that will further ensure the privacy and reliability of patients ' information .
The tool contains " terabytes " of data from observatories Twirling galaxies , exotic nebulae and exploding stars are now just a mouse click away for amateur astronomers .
Microsoft has launched WorldWide Telescope , a free tool that stitches together images from some of the best ground - and space - based telescopes .
Collections include pictures from the Hubble and Spitzer telescopes , as well as the Chandra X - Ray Observatory .
The web - based tool also allows users to pan and zoom around the planets , and trace their locations in the night sky .
" Users can see the X - ray view of the sky , zoom into bright radiation clouds , and then cross - fade into the visible light view and discover the cloud remnants of a supernova explosion from a thousand years ago , " explained Roy Gould , a researcher at the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics .
" [ It 's ] a beautiful platform for explaining and getting people excited about astronomy , and I think the professional astronomers will come to use it as well , " said Roy Williams of the California Institute of Technology Detailed view
To use the new system , users need to download WorldWide Telescope from the web .
It only runs on Windows operating systems .
Users can explore the Moon and selected planets in more detail
The web portal gives star - gazers access to " terabytes " of data .
It allows them to explore planets , moons and other celestial objects and track their precise position in the sky from any location on Earth , " at any time in the past or future " .
Data from sources including the US space agency Nasa allows users to switch between views at different wavelengths and through different telescopes .
Nasa contributed imagery from its Mars Rovers , the Hubble Space Telescope , the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory .
Around 30 images from Chandra are available through the program including X - ray data and multi-wavelength composite photographs .
Other data sets include the ongoing Sloan Digital Sky Survey , also known as the Cosmic Genome Project , which aims to capture detailed optical images of more than a quarter of the night sky .
WorldWide Telescope , launched as a beta , or test version , also features tours of the Universe by leading astronomers , as well as the ability for a user to record their own .
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
2GHz or faster processor 2GB of RAM 1 - 10 GB of free disk space Graphics card with 128 MB RAM or 256 VRAM Windows XP Service Pack 2 or Windows Vista Net connection Macs must run Windows OS A tour called Dust and Us by Alyssa Goodman , professor of astronomy at Harvard , walks through the dark regions in galaxies where stars and planets form .
" I see the WorldWide Telescope as having an important educational mission , " said Robert Kirshner , professor of astronomy at Harvard University .
" [ It ] gives somebody a kind of freedom to follow their imagination . "
Bill Gates , Microsoft 's chairman , described it as a " powerful tool for education " and said he hoped it would " inspire young people to explore astronomy and science " .
Stellar options Microsoft 's new application is not the only tool that allows astronomers to explore the night sky from their computers .
Stellarium is an open source alternative to Microsoft 's offering Last year , Microsoft rival Google launched Sky , an add - on to Google Earth which allows astronomers to glide through images of more than one million stars and 200 million galaxies .
Optional layers allow users to explore images from the Hubble Space Telescope as well as animations of lunar cycles .
Other applications have been available for longer .
For example , Stellarium is a free open source tool that gives people a chance to access more than 210 million stars , in addition to planets and moons .
Used in many planetariums the project was launched in 2001 by Fabien Chereau , formerly a research engineer at the Paris Astronomical Observatory who now works at the ESO ( European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere ) .
Like WorldWide
Telescope the software allows users to record and play their own tours of the Universe .

What are these ?
It ’s official : Green car madness has taken over .
After seeing more electric and hybrid vehicle startups than we could keep track of , we finally decided to start keeping count .
We ’ve compiled a list , below , of 27 ( update : the list has reached 30 ; thanks for the comments ) startups , listed according to their release date , with additional information on fuel type , range , top speed and price .
Most have n’t yet taken venture funding , but where applicable , we ’ve listed financial backing .
While we ’ve got some overall favorites ( Miles , Tesla , Think ) and a few favorite oddballs ( Aptera , Commuter Cars , Eliica ) , we ’ve for the most part withheld judgement .
Still , if you have any of your own predictions about which companies will succeed or — far more likely — fail , we ’d encourage you to make them known in the comments .
A note on our method :
While most manufacturers are planning more than one model , we chose the one that seemed either most commercially viable or closest to release , depending on our own ( discretionary ) formula .
We did n’t included well - known consumer models like the Toyota Prius or Chevy Volt , or startups like AC Propulsion that only do battery conversions for consumer vehicles .
We also rounded the price to the nearest thousand .
All details are taken from the companies , so we have n’t independently confirmed things like range and top speed details .
In case we missed any , mention them below and we ’ll add them to the list .

Speak your piece .
One day after President Bush likened presumptive Democratic nominee Barack Obama to those who appeased Adolph Hitler , the ghost of the president 's grandfather , Prescott Bush - in an SS uniform , muttering German and gesticulating angrily - has been hovering high above the White House since dawn .
An anonymous Bush administration staffer said the White House initially believed MoveOn.org , which many administration officials have compared to Hamas , had orchestrated the specter of Bush 's grandfather .
( Prescott Bush , a true American hero , helped fund Hitler 's war machine and , as the BBC revealed last year , co-conspired to overthrow President Roosevelt to create a Nazi- style government in America . )
But MoveOn.org spokesman Adam Green denied his organization 's involvement , saying , " Dude , if we could do that , we would 've done it a long , long time ago .
We would 've saved a lot of money . "
Prescott 's ghost has attracted crowds of onlookers who might otherwise have taken the usual long - distance gaze at the White House before moving on to the Capitol 's heavily trafficked monuments .
One dumbstruck eyewitness , Stanley Huffle , a history professor at American University , said , ' It 's as if history and karma have merged . "
Around noon , the National Guard attempted to shoot down Prescott 's ghost or at least disperse him to a less visible area .
But the bullets merely sailed through his shadowy form , only seeming to further inflame his rhetoric .
A passing German tourist quoted him as saying , " Our failure to please the fuhrer has led directly to this point in history , where a schwartze might be president , homosexuals can marry in California , and bagels are more commonplace than f*** ing Wonder Bread ! "
Following yesterday 's heated Hardball confrontation between host Chris Matthews and right - wing radio personality Kevin James , James returned to discuss Prescott 's ghost with Matthews .
" You see , Chris , like I said yesterday , Obama is an appeaser , " began James .
" Fine .
Whatever , " replied Matthews .
" Just tell me whose ghost is floating above the White House right now . "
" Look , Chris , an appeaser appeases those who make use of appeasement , which leaves us vulnerable to another 9/11 - style attack . "
Matthews repeated , " I 've asked you a simple question .
Who is hovering sixty feet above our White House , sir ? "
" But that 's not the point , Chris .
Appeasement --" " Listen , you mutant , just answer the question .
You do n't know .
Do you ?
Do you ? "
" Of course I do , Chris .
It 's the , the ... ghost of appeasement 's past or something . "
" Wow .
Wow .
You really just lucked into that , did n't you ?
Just stepped right in it . "
" If luck means appeasement , then yes . "
" You 're an idiot .
Thanks for coming on . "
" Thank you , Chris . "
During an impromptu White House press conference , press secretary Dana Perino told reporters , " First , let me start by saying that though some candidates think the afterworld revolves around them , the appearance of Prescott 's ghost over the White House has nothing to do with President Bush 's speech in the Knesset yesterday . "
Veteran White House reporter Helen Thomas replied , " Sure .
Pay no attention to the man behind the cloud . "

Transport for London has provided a handy tool for those who would like to use false numberplates to fool any of the various networks of automatic numberplate recognition ( ANPR ) cameras now deployed across much of the UK .
Using the capital 's online congestion charge payment system , anyone can swiftly check what make and colour of vehicle is recorded in the UK 's national DVLA database for any given registration number .
No payment or identification is necessary .
This would obviously be a boon to those intending to false - flag a vehicle , as it would be possible to keep trying different registrations until one came across a record of the correct vehicle make and colour .
Say you have a black Porsche 911 GT2 .
Keep trying registrations here until you get one of those .
( Starting with the right year will speed things up .
So will the use of an automated bot .
Just to be safe , prospective villains should also route via an anonymous proxy server , or hook up via someone else 's Wi-Fi or an internet cafe or something . )
Then buy or make plates or overlays showing the number which gave the hit , and put them on your 530 - horsepower pocket rocket .
Now you can happily drive in and out of London without paying your soon - to - be £ 25 congestion charge ; barrel past speed cameras as fast as you like ; drive in bus lanes ; park illegally ; fill up at petrol stations and drive off without paying .
The fine demands and summonses will all be sent to someone else .
If you get randomly numberplate - scanned by human traffic cops , or eyeballed by a CCTV operator , you should be OK as their system will indicate that you 're in the right type of car for the plates .
Obviously , you do n't need to use TfL .
You could simply wander or drive around until you saw a car of the correct type , and copy its plates .
But the online method is potentially a lot quicker and less troublesome , which is a factor .
You really want to change your false plates fairly often , as the authorities will soon become aware that someone other than the registered user is using them .
That 's where the automated bot is a particularly handy idea .
Alternatively , of course , you might not be wanting to carry out a string of motoring offences .
You might simply want to move about without creating a log of your travels in the various ANPR systems .
Either method of harvesting plates would do for this purpose , TfL or manual .
If the cops , spooks , or other minions of the state ever ran a search using your ordinary , legit plates , they would never find out about your ghost journeys .
The TfL online payment system would come in handy there , too , as you could pay the congestion charges resulting from any London trips .
Then even the real owner of your false plates would be none the wiser .
( Do n't use your own credit card , though , eh. )
As of going to press , TfL had n't yet commented on this aspect of the Congestion Charging system .
But they promised to get back to us ASAP - we 'll keep you posted . ®
Bootnote
Thanks to Reg reader Eric for the headsup - though we really should have thought of it ourselves .
Cheers also to the readers who point out that you can do the same with some insurance company and motor - trade websites .
The federal New Democrats will introduce a private member 's bill on Wednesday that would entrench the principle of " net neutrality " and enact rules to keep the internet free from interference by service providers , an NDP MP told a rally Tuesday in Ottawa .
Parliament
Hill was beset by about 300 people impassioned by an issue not usually associated with protest marches : internet access .
" Save the internet , " read one angry placard .
" Say no to Big Brother watching you , " said another .
The New Democratic Party 's Charlie Angus told the cheering crowd that the private member 's bill would protect Canadian consumers from having their internet speeds " throttled " by service providers .
" You are citizens of a digital realm and you have rights , " he said .
The protesters , some of whom boarded buses in the early morning hours to get to the rally , are supporters of net neutrality , a movement urging the government to enact rules that prevent large internet service providers ( ISPs ) from interfering with the free flow of information over the internet .
" Our net not for sale , " they chanted , as well as , " Whose net ?
Our net . "
At issue in the net neutrality debate are the actions of big ISPs that have been slowing down the internet speeds of customers who use certain types of applications , such as peer - to - peer software used for file sharing .
Bell Canada Inc. and Rogers Communications Inc. , Canada 's two largest ISPs , as well as a few others , have for some time been engaging in a practice known as " traffic shaping " or " throttling , " where speeds of certain types of internet applications are slowed at certain times of the day .
The main targets have been peer - to - peer applications such as BitTorrent , which have emerged as efficient ways of transferring large files like videos .
The ISPs say they are throttling such applications because a small percentage of customers are creating network congestion through constant use , which is slowing down connection speeds for the majority .
Angus took a swipe at the Liberals , who have been largely silent on the issue of net neutrality .
Industry critic Scott Brison met with Bell , Rogers and other independent ISPs weeks ago , but has still not formed a position .
" This is not a partisan issue , but we 're hearing radio silence , " Angus told CBCNews.ca .
" Where are the Liberals ? "
Mauril Bélanger , Liberal MP for Ottawa - Vanier , also addressed the crowd and agreed that control of the internet must be kept out of the hands of vested interests .
He said the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission ( CRTC ) already has the power to do this with the Telecommunications
Act and refused to support the NDP 's bill .
" I will not say yes blindly , " he told the crowd .
" I ca n't give you a blank cheque . "
Protesters at the rally said the ISPs have not only failed to prove their claims regarding the need for throttling , they also have no right to pick and choose which internet applications run faster than others .
" When did Bell deign to say what 's good and what 's bad ? " said Gatsby Wong , 32 , a computer technician who got on a bus in Toronto at 4 a .m. in order to get to the rally .
" Who gave them that right ? "
Protesters also said the practices are anticompetitive , since internet - based phone or video sales services run up against the ISPs ' own existing business lines .
" They say they have a congestion problem , but where 's the proof ? " said Mark Farr , 49 , a renovations worker who made the trip from Welland , Ont. , to attend the rally .
" They say I 'm the problem , but they 're the problem . "
Spokespeople for Bell and Rogers did not return requests for comment .
Rally leaders urged Minister of Industry Jim Prentice and the CRTC to enact rules enshrining the rights of internet users .
Net neutrality is n't just an issue for technical geeks , they said , it is vital for maintaining freedom of speech and for keeping the innovation that has resulted in the birth and growth of such revolutionary companies as Google , Amazon and eBay .
" We need to protect the internet from being hijacked by vested interests , " said Phillipa Lawson , director of the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic ( CIPPIC ) , at the University of Ottawa . "
If market forces could solve this problem we would n't be here today . "
Rocky Gaudrault , the rally 's main organizer and chief executive officer of TekSavvy Solutions Inc. , told protesters that net neutrality is comprised of three basic principles : competition , innovation and consumer rights .
" I 'm sorry , but none of those are for sale . "
Smaller ISPs such as TekSavvy , as well as more than 50 others represented at the rally by the Canadian Association of Internet Providers ( CAIP ) , are taking particular exception with Bell 's traffic - shaping practices .
Because it has a taxpayer - funded monopoly over phone - cable infrastructure in much of Canada , Bell — as well as other phone companies — is mandated by the CRTC to rent portions of its network to CAIP members so they can provide services to their own customers .
Bell in March expanded its own traffic - shaping practice to CAIP members , which prompted a complaint and a request for an emergency cease - and - desist order from the group .
The move also sparked TekSavvy to organize Tuesday 's rally .
The CRTC earlier this month rejected the order request but launched a public inquiry into the traffic - shaping policies of Bell and others , with a plan to make a ruling by the fall .
Speakers at the rally welcomed the CRTC 's move , but also urged Prentice to take action .
" Its time to demonstrate some leadership and do the right thing , " said James Clancy , president of the National Union of Public and General Employees ( NUPGE ) .
Canada is behind the United States in dealing with net neutrality issues .
In February , the U.S. regulator held a public probe into the traffic - shaping practices of Comcast Corp. , the country 's largest ISP .
The hearing prompted Comcast to promise it would abandon traffic shaping in favour of a non-discriminatory network management system by the end of the year .
Representative Ed Markey , a Democrat , also introduced a net neutrality bill to the U.S. House of Representatives in February .
" If Comcast can manage its traffic in a neutral way , why ca n't Bell , Rogers and Shaw ? " Lawson said .
Last month , Angus called on Prentice to follow the 2006 recommendations of the Telecommunications Policy Review Panel , that included enacting legislation to stop large internet service providers from prioritizing certain types of internet traffic .
Earlier this month Prentice told the House of Commons that he was against creating rules to safeguard the internet .
The minister was in Ottawa on Tuesday but did not attend the rally , according to spokesperson Deirdra McCracken .
She did not reply to requests for comment .
Where There 's Smoke , There 's a Lawyer New York City woman faces lawsuit from neighbors in her apartment building .
April 4 , 2008  --
Do you smoke ?
Well , you better be careful where .
I do n't smoke , and I do n't like the smell , but what some people are doing to smokers makes me say give me a break .
For the last 12 years , Galila Huff has owned Caffé la Fenicé , a restaurant serving Italian food on the Upper West Side of New York City .
Smoking there is forbidden .
New York state bans it in all restaurants and bars .
Huff 's apartment is a few blocks away at The Ansonia , an ornate turn - of - the - century building that both Babe Ruth and Arturo Toscanini once called home .
Huff lives there alone except for her Chihuahua , and her cigarettes .
For 40 years , she 's smoked a pack or two a day .
But then in October , she got a letter from her neighbors .
It said , " Dear Resident , immediately cease smoking in your apartment , unless and until you take adequate steps to properly ventilate your smoke out of your apartment such that none enters the common hallway . "
Huff could n't believe it .
First she can't smoke in her own restaurant , now she can't smoke in her own apartment ?
" I mean the cigarettes smell , yeah .
But I 'm not puffing into their faces , " she said .
The complainants -- Jonathan and Jenny Selbin -- would n't agree to a television interview , but they did file a lawsuit against Huff , saying she is " willfully , intentionally , recklessly and / or negligently endangering the health of plaintiffs and their 4 - year - old son . …
As evidenced by her refusal to address the grave danger posed to the health of a small child , despite repeated requests and warnings , defendant 's conduct is actuated by evil and / or reprehensible motives . "
Huff 's dog did n't escape mention in the lawsuit either .
The lawsuit continued , " Such motives are also evidenced by the fact that after plaintiffs complained about the smoke , defendant encouraged her dog to urinate on plaintiffs ' property and in front of their doorway . "
When asked whether it 's true that her dog urinated on her neighbor 's property , Huff said , " I never saw that , but maybe .
I do n't know . "
The dog had no comment .
Legal System 'a Tool for Bullying '?
Huff took steps to insulate her apartment .
The apartment building did construction work , sealed off air ducts and made sure no smoke could get from her apartment to the Selbins ' , but now the neighbors were complaining about smoke in the hallway .
And who are these neighbors ?
Surprise !
They 're lawyers .
Jonathan Selbin is a partner in the big law firm Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein .
He made sure his special skills were clear to Huff in a letter : " We are both lawyers , and both litigators , for whom the usual barriers to litigation are minimal . "
That 's very true .
Reading that drove me to write an Op - Ed for the Wall Street Journal ( CLICK HERE to read ) .
" Without any question , the legal system has become a tool for bullying in this country , " said Philip Howard , chair of the legal reform group Common Good .
" And if you 're a lawyer , and you do n't have to go out and spend money for another lawyer , you can use it as a hammer . "
" People think of lawsuits as kind of a neutral process … have your day in court , " Howard said .
" Being in a lawsuit is a traumatic event , and if someone sues you , for almost anything … it 's just like a bludgeon .
It changes your life .
You ca n't sleep at night . "
He 's right .
Remember the Chungs , the dry cleaners in suburban Washington , D.C. , who were sued because they reportedly lost one pair of pants ?
When the Chungs found the pants days later and presented them to their customer , he refused to accept them and claimed they were not the pants he had given them , despite the matching tag , and promptly filed a lawsuit .
Not for their value , about $ 800 , but for $ 67 million .
The man who filed that suit was -- surprise again -- a lawyer .
He was a local judge , in fact , named Roy Pearson .
Pearson took his complaint to trial .
He did drop the damage amount from $ 67 million though -- to $ 54 million .
The case was finally dismissed , but because of the dispute , the Chungs had to close one of their two stores .
' This Is An Abuse '
Likewise , Huff says the Selbins ' lawsuit has taken a toll on her .
" Almost for one year , I 'm not sleeping and I 'm having stomachache . "
The " 20/20 " team did n't smell any smoke in the common space outside Huff 's door .
And , the Ansonia is n't your typical apartment building .
The hallways are huge , 10 feet across and 100 feet long .
You could drive a car through there .
Any smoke that comes out of an apartment would dissipate .
And the door of the lawyers who are suing is at least 50 feet from Huff 's main entrance .
Still , smoke can leak out from many places , so Huff worked to reduce the smell .
She says she 's tried to quit smoking , but failed .
She got four air purifiers … big ones .
" I was trying to do everything to change what I could change or what I could add : the machine , the windows , to seal the apartment .
I did everything that I could have done . …
This is an abuse . "
And it 's not as if she intruded on the Selbins ' space .
Huff has lived in her apartment for 15 years .
The Selbins moved next door five years ago .
" I was first here and when they come to buy the apartment … they did n't smell it ? "
When we asked the Selbins about that , Jonathan Selbin wrote us , " I have lived in the building since 1999 .
My wife and I looked at what is now my apartment on several occasions , and on those occasions there was no strong smell of smoke in the hallways .
I do not know why that was -- perhaps she was away during those visits .
Or perhaps it was because I visited during the day , and the smoke is usually worst first thing in the morning and again in the evening , in other words , times she is home . "
One other point .
Their building is on Broadway in New York City .
There are lots of chimneys , and exhaust fumes from cars , trucks , and buses .
How pristine does the air have to be ?
We 're breathing all kinds of things around here .
This week Jonathan Selbin wrote ABC News and asked , " Have you asked Ms. Huff how she would react if we put dog poison in the shared hallway ? "
So we asked her .
" How can you say something like this ? "
Huff said .
Selbin also wrote ABC News , " We also do not want to try to tell Ms. Huff to stop smoking ( in her home or anywhere else ) , nor is it our business what she does in the privacy of her home .
It is only because her smoke comes into our common , shared hallway that it has become our business . "
You do n't want Jonathan Selbin getting into your business .
He 's a class action lawyer .
He sues companies for millions .
His law firm
Web site brags that a magazine named him a " Super Lawyer . "
It 's not good to fight with a " super lawyer . "
This week , he sent Huff a settlement agreement with a new list of demands that she must meet if she hopes to get out from under his lawsuit .
It includes one that says she will not seek any further publicity .
" I do n't want to harm anyone .
I 'm trying not to smoke , " Huff said .
" But you know , I can not do more than that .
This is my demon , I 'm a smoker .
What can I do ?
I 'm smoking for 40 years . "
What can she do ?
Does she have to move ?
On Thursday night she agreed to his demands .
Give me a break .
UPDATE : Jonathan Selbin posted the following response to the report on the message board :
" I have read these comments with interest .
Based upon the one - sided hit piece John Stossel chose to run on me without presenting the full factual background , I can understand why so many people have had such a strongly negative reaction .
Stossel had -- a week before the piece ran -- our statement about the situation which provided the full story , but chose to simply ignore it .
I do not expect I will change many minds here , but I did [ think ] you might want the full story , and might want to question why Stossel chose to present only one side .
To view the statement we provided to him in its entirety , you can go to : http://blog.simplejustice.us/2008/04/06/stossels-folly--selbin-responds.aspx
The only change from what is set forth there is that the settlement we agreed to with our neighbor ( which Stossel characterized as our " latest set of demands , " when it was in fact an agreement negotiated with her lawyer , not some list of our demands ) requires her to use the donated air purifiers and a smokeless ashtray .
Period .
Do n't believe everything you read ( or see on TV ) . "
ABC News asked people on the street -- smokers and non-smokers -- what they thought of the lawsuit .
We told them that a woman who smokes in her own apartment is being sued by her neighbors because they say they can smell the smoke in the hallway , and asked them for their reactions .
Follow up questions included :
How would you react if someone sued you for smoking in your own apartment ?
Where can you smoke nowadays ?
The neighbors that sued are lawyers themselves .
What do you think about that ?

ABC News Producer Frank Mastropolo contributed to this report .
The electronic voting machines that will be used to pick a new US president this year can be hacked .
So say security experts , speaking at the RSA Conference in San Francisco .
As the November election approaches , the question before officials is not how to fix known bugs in their e-voting systems , but rather , how best to check them for fraud , said David Wagner , an associate professor with the University of California , Berkeley 's computer science department .
Wagner was part of the team that audited California 's voting systems during the state 's review of electronic voting , and the problems his team found affect counties across the U.S .
" The three systems we looked at are three of the most widely used around the nation , " he said during an e-voting panel discussion at the show .
" They 're going to be using them in the 2008 elections ; they 're still going to have the same vulnerabilities we found . "
With images of Florida 's laborious 2000 presidential recount in their minds , county officials have spent billions over the past eight years on electronic voting systems .
These systems are supposed to take the guesswork out of vote - counting .
The problem is that they are insecure , and now states are being forced to make do with buggy equipment , panel members agreed .
" We have spent billions of dollars on equipment , " Wagner said .
" We do n't have another several billion dollars . "
The California audit examined systems from Diebold Elections Systems , Hart InterCivic and Sequoia Voting Systems , ultimately permitting their use in 2008 , but only under certain conditions .
In testing , Wagner and his team found that they could introduce a computer virus to any of the three systems , which would then spread throughout the county and ultimately skew the vote count .
This year most California voters will use paper ballots , which give officials a way to audit their machine - counted tallies for irregularities , but not all states have that option .
About a quarter of the votes cast in the upcoming election will be on electronic voting equipment with no paper trail , Wagner said .
And even the states that keep paper records are not necessarily checking their results .
Only about a third of all states have records that are regularly audited .
That 's too bad , he said , because the ability to check whether your voting system has been hacked is of paramount importance .
" Security is not the most important thing , " he said .
" What 's more important for elections is auditability . "
SHANGHAI — Thin plastic bags are used for everything in China and the Chinese use up to three billion of them a day -- an environmentally costly habit picked up by shopkeepers and consumers in the late 1980s for convenience over traditional cloth bags .
Fruit mongers weigh produce in them , tailors stuff shirts into them , even street food vendors plunk their piping hot wares directly into see - through plastic bags that do nothing to protect one 's hands from being burned or coated in hot grease .
They even have a special name for the plastic bags found blowing , hanging and floating everywhere from trees to rivers : bai se wu ran , or " white pollution , " for the bags ' most common color .
Yet , the Chinese government is set to ban the manufacture and force shopkeepers to charge for the distribution of bags thinner than 0.025 millimeters thick as of June 1 — and no one seems prepared .
" I do n't know what we 'll do , " Zhang Gui Lin , a tailor at Shanghai 's famous fabric market , tells me through a translator .
" I guess our shopping complex will figure it out and tell us what to buy to use as bags . "
His wife adds : " Maybe it will be like this , " tugging a thicker mesh orange plastic bag she is using to carry some shoes .
Such thicker bags may prove one replacement for the ubiquitous thinner versions .
The clothes makers are not alone .
" I do n't know actually , " says a vendor of Chinese tamales , known as zong zi , who declined to give her name .
" I 'm sure the government will come up with a solution .
Maybe people will just eat it [ the zong zi directly . ] "
The Chinese government is banning production and distribution of the thinnest plastic bags in a bid to curb the white pollution that is taking over the countryside .
The bags are also banned from all forms of public transportation and " scenic locations . "
The move may save as much as 37 million barrels of oil currently used to produce the plastic totes , according to China Trade News .
Already , the nation 's largest producer of such thin plastic bags , Huaqiang , has shut down its operations .
The effort comes amid growing environmental awareness among the Chinese people and mimics similar efforts in countries like Bangladesh and Ireland as well as the city of San Francisco , though efforts to replicate that ban in other U.S. municipalities have foundered in the face of opposition from plastic manufacturers .
More than one million reusable cloth bags have already been sold on various Chinese merchandising Web sites , according to Taobao.com , and local environmental groups , such as Shanghai Roots & Shoots , are promoting and giving away cloth bags in schools .
" Too many plastic bags is a great waste of natural resources , " retired Communist Party cadre Liu Zhidong says through a translator .
" When burnt , they produce poisoning smoke , and if buried underneath the ground they need more than 300 years to be degraded . "
But it remains to be seen how strong enforcement will be .
Specific penalties have not been set but will include fines .
Other environmental efforts — such as a similar ban on disposable wooden chopsticks ( a waster of trees ) and so - called " green GDP , " or gross domestic product , an effort to account for environmental costs when calculating overall economic development — fell by the wayside because they proved too difficult to implement and created significant opposition at the local level .
It also remains to be seen whether some of the possible replacements — thicker or biodegradable plastic bags — will be any better .
" This is a very good measure to protect the environment .
However , whether it can last long is still very doubting , " chemistry graduate student Oliver says .
" And another problem is [ that ] the so - called biodegradable plastic bags , it seems , cannot be totally degraded .
Whether or not they are really good for environment protection in the long run remains unknown . "
Yet , the ban enjoys enthusiastic support from many residents here , particularly students , who may not even recall the more traditional practice of cloth bags or baskets .
" I will just carry the things by my hands , " one young man told me on the campus of Shanghai International Studies University .
" I will never use the plastic bags supplied in supermarkets and I 'll ask my friends not to use them , too . "
McCain 's resurgence marks a turning point for the GOP — but this is by no means a turn for the better .
His ascendance marks the final defeat of the old GOP — a GOP that once favored limited government ; limits on executive powers ; a ( mostly ) non-interventionist foreign policy based on national interest ; a strong role for local and state governments ; personal and civil liberties ; low taxes ; a free - market economy ; and opposition to the welfare - warfare state .
The new GOP , now gathered around neocon hawk John McCain , no longer represents any of these once - foundational principles .
Instead , the Beltway neoconservatives have usurped the party , effectively marginalizing the last remaining elements of traditional conservatism .
( Now for some of Ryan ’s notoriously accurate predictions . )
If up against Clinton , McCain , having convinced the public that only his foreign policy is in America ’s best interest , will win by a comfortable margin ( even though the foreign policies of the two candidates differ only in style ) .
If , however , Obama wins the Democratic nomination , he will secure enough of the anti-war vote to defeat McCain .
But should McCain win , war with Iran would begin almost immediately , and the conflict could easily spread throughout the region .
We would also see an increase of American interference in Pakistan ( possibly leading to war ) , accompanied by the erosion of our civil and personal liberties at home .
Under a McCain presidency , there might even be some new and surprising military interventions elsewhere in the globe ( say , in parts of Africa ) .
The result of all this : more death and destruction , new alliances against the U.S. , increased global instability , and the beginning of the collapse of the American economy , due to imperial overstretch .
McCain is , to quote Justin Raimondo from his article in The American Conservative , " a militant suffering from acute narcissism , " who believes that it is America 's manifest destiny to spread its goodness — at any cost — to all corners of the globe .

Clinton pleads for time
Clinton campaign manager Maggie Williams put out a memo in which she casts the cause of keeping the campaign alive as an issue in and of itself , a kind of voting rights issue .
She lists the states yet to vote :
Together , this adds up to nearly 43 million Americans .
Are their voices any less important than those of the citizens who have already voted ?
Hillary Clinton respects those voters and their right to participate in this historic contest .
Their votes , along with all the others , will determine when this contest is at an end .
It ’s the American way – everybody counts in this country .
The last time that we were told we ’d better cut the process short or the sky would fall was when the Supreme Court stopped the Florida recount in 2000 .
But Chicken Little was wrong .
What was true then is true now : there is nothing to fear – and everything to gain – from hearing from all of the voters .
I tend to agree with Steve Benen on this :
This is only a subject a candidate talks about if she 's forced to , and it's a second - order argument , one that has nothing to do with why she should win .
In Giant 's Stadium terms , it 's just an argument for staying for the fourth quarter , rather than heading to your car to beat the traffic .
Full memo after the jump .

Millions of Votes Still To Be Cast
2008 is shaping up to be a great year for democracy .
The ride to the nomination has been competitive – I believe exactly as our founders hoped it would be .
In the Democratic Party , fifty states , the District of Columbia , Puerto Rico , Democrats Abroad and 3 territories vote to determine who will be our party ’s nominee .
As of today , the citizens of 42 states , the District of Columbia , Democrats Abroad and 2 territories have had an opportunity to vote – and they have exercised that right in overwhelming numbers .
But the citizens in Pennsylvania , Guam , North Carolina , Indiana , West Virginia , Oregon , Kentucky , Puerto Rico , Montana and South Dakota have not yet had the opportunity to exercise that fundamental right .
Together , this adds up to nearly 43 million Americans .
Are their voices any less important than those of the citizens who have already voted ?
Hillary Clinton respects those voters and their right to participate in this historic contest .
Their votes , along with all the others , will determine when this contest is at an end .
It ’s the American way – everybody counts in this country .
The last time that we were told we ’d better cut the process short or the sky would fall was when the Supreme Court stopped the Florida recount in 2000 .
But Chicken Little was wrong .
What was true then is true now : there is nothing to fear – and everything to gain – from hearing from all of the voters .
The simple fact is that this election is too close to call .
After 46 primaries and caucuses , by virtually every measure , Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are neck and neck – separated by roughly 130 of the more than 3,100 delegates committed thus far and less than 1 % of the 27 million - plus votes cast , including Florida and Michigan .
Less than 1 % !
With hundreds of delegates still uncommitted , neither candidate has reached the number of delegates required to secure the nomination .
And either candidate can reach the required number in the coming weeks and months .
This is indisputable .
No amount of editorials , articles , blog posts , calculations , formulas or projections or friendly , but heated political conversations can change the basic fact that either candidate can win .
We have all been there before when the pundits have proclaimed that Hillary had no hope of winning .
Hillary Clinton has been counted out of this race three times before – and each time , with their votes , the American people asked her to stay in the race .
Elections are important because they allow voters to decide how they want the big issues confronting them addressed .
Millions of voters are awaiting their turn to answer the questions :
Who is the best candidate to address the economic , health care , environmental and security issues confronting our country ?
Who is the best candidate to go toe to toe with John McCain ?
Which of the candidates is best positioned to win the 270 electoral votes needed to become the next president ?
This campaign will wait to hear from all of the voters .

REBOOT : THE GUARDIAN CODE
ReBoot : The Guardian Code follows the journey of four teenagers , Austin , Parker , Tamra , and Trey .
On their first day at Alan Turning High , these unsuspecting teens discover they ’ve been preselected to become the Next - Generation Guardians of Cyberspace with a mission to save the world – by defending it in cyberspace .
With the help of VERA , an artificial intelligence bio-constructed as a teenage girl , ReBoot : TGC ’s heroes digitize into cyberspace where they use their code - based powers to combat viruses unleashed by a merciless hacker .
Known only as the ‘ Sourcerer ’ , this devious hacker seeks to rule the world by controlling cyberspace , and it ’s up to the Guardians to stop him .
AFTER years in the automotive wilderness , largely exiled to the smoky borders of truck stops , diesel is coming home .
Americans may not recognize its freshly scrubbed face .
A 19th - century invention by Rudolf Diesel , the diesel engine has always been known for outstanding fuel efficiency , with better mileage ( by 25 percent to 40 percent ) than gasoline .
But the kerosenelike fuel and the engines that burn it were dirty , noisy , dawdling and even deadly , linked to increased risk of cancer and respiratory disease .
That has all changed , in part because of cleaner - burning fuel  its 2006 rollout had been mandated in 2000 by the Clinton administration  that has 97 percent less of the sulfur responsible for diesel engines ’ sooty particulates .
The low - sulfur fuel , hailed by the Environmental Protection Agency as a historic advance , has opened the door to sophisticated emissions controls that let diesel engines meet the strict pollution standards of California .
Those rules , the world ’s most stringent by far , require 2009 - model diesels to be as green as gasoline or even hybrid models .
The issues party leaders are grappling with , they said , include how to avoid the perception of a back - room deal that thwarts the will of millions of voters who have cast ballots in primaries and caucuses .
That perception could cripple the eventual Democratic nominee ’s chances of winning the presidency in November , they said .
A number of senior Democrats , including Speaker Nancy Pelosi and three candidates who have dropped out of the 2008 race , former Senator John Edwards and Senators Christopher J. Dodd and Joseph R. Biden Jr. , have spoken with Mr. Gore in recent days .
None have endorsed a candidate , although Ms. Pelosi made comments on Friday that were widely seen as supportive of Mr. Obama when it came to the process the party should use to make its choice of candidate .
“ It would be a problem for the party if the verdict would be something different than the public has decided , ” Ms. Pelosi said in an interview with Bloomberg Television .
Ms. Pelosi said she intended to remain neutral , though some of her closest friends and allies in the House are publicly supporting Mr. Obama .
She said the nomination should not be decided by delegates from Florida and Michigan allocated on the basis of voting in primaries there last month , as the Clinton campaign has proposed .
Mrs. Clinton got more votes in both places , although neither candidate actively campaigned there and Mr. Obama was not even on the ballot in Michigan .
The party had penalized those states for holding their primaries earlier than the party wanted by stripping them of their delegates to the convention .
“ We ca n’t ignore the rules which everyone else played by , ” Ms. Pelosi said .
Few figures are being more closely watched by Democratic insiders than Mr. Gore , the Nobel Peace Prize winner who associates say has been lobbied hard for an endorsement by allies of Mrs. Clinton and of Mr. Obama .
Seven out of 10 Iraqis want foreign forces to leave : poll
LONDON ( AFP ) -
More than two - thirds of Iraqis believe US - led coalition forces should leave , according to a poll conducted for British television ahead of the fifth anniversary of the Iraq invasion .
The ORB / Channel 4
News survey suggested that 70 percent thought multinational forces should withdraw .
Yet some 40 percent of the 4,000 people surveyed said they wanted the United States to play a bigger role in rebuilding Iraq and 36 percent wanted more British involvement .
Overall , the wide - ranging poll painted a mixed picture of Iraqi attitudes , contrasting their bleak daily existence with a surprisingly positive attitude about the future .
It threw up stark statistics on the human cost of war , which began on March 20 , 2003 , its effect on infrastructure and daily life , plus the bloody sectarian violence that erupted in the aftermath of the invasion .
A quarter of those surveyed said they had lost a family member to murder .
In Baghdad , that figure rose to nearly half ( 45 percent ) .
Some 81 percent had suffered power cuts and 43 percent had experienced drinking water shortages .
In the last month , more than a quarter ( 28 percent ) had been short of food .
Opinions varied on progress towards democracy .
Less than a quarter ( 23 percent ) thought military action would prove to have been in Iraq 's long - term interests but 55 percent were optimistic about the future -- although 48 percent of the minority Sunni were not .
Some 45 percent said they were satisfied with the pace of change , compared with 40 percent who were not ; and just over two - thirds ( 68 percent ) predicted Iraq would " one day be peaceful and normal . "
Four out of five people said their own area was already trouble - free .
ORB and its local partner IIACSS interviewed 4,000 Iraqis in person between February 24 and March 5 .
MOFFETT FIELD , California – A swaggering Texas investor with a famous name wants Big Pharma to pick up the tab for the International Space Station when NASA eases off .
Thomas Pickens III thinks the pharmaceutical industry and the space station need each other .
Drug discovery is an arduous and extremely expensive project .
But in space , molecules do miraculous things .
Disease - causing proteins crystallize so well – growing larger and clearer – that finding a drug to stop the protein 's damaging activities could happen months , if not years , faster .
Scientists have known for decades that some science works better in space – but it has n't been easy to get experiments up there .
Now , with NASA planning to reduce its $ 2.6 billion annual investment beginning in 2015 , the agency is throwing the space station open for private enterprise .
And the Texas financial scion and multimillionaire is ready to transform space science with an injection of capitalism .
" If people knew what I already know , the International Space Station would be considered one of the most valuable resources our world possesses , " Pickens said at the ISS National Laboratory Workshop last week .
" There are things you can only do in microgravity that will eventually lead to products that could save millions of lives . "
Pickens is chairman of the board of Spacehab , a company that provides equipment and services for scientists who want to send experiments into space .
He has an obvious vested interest in getting scientists , and the entities that fund them ..
But all the bias in the world does n't matter , if there are experiments worth doing in space .
Scientists have sent all kinds of things into space with unique results .
One 2000 experiment found that 1,600 kidney - cell genes were expressed differently in space than on the ground .
Another found colon - cancer cells showed unique metabolic changes in microgravity .
But with so many possible avenues of discovery , it has been difficult for scientists to make much progress , given how limited time in space has been .
Still , one area of research has had results that can lead scientists down a clear path of drug discovery : protein crystals .
" Up in space , the crystals grow bigger and better , " said Tim Osslund , who specializes in protein formulation at Amgen .
" The end result is higher resolution . "
And that resolution is a very valuable thing .
Osslund sent some of the company 's proteins to the Mir space station in 1998 .
His crystals grew 32 times larger in space than in an earth - grown control environment .
Larger , better crystals allow scientists to see a protein at the atomic level .
That kind of detail can significantly accelerate drug discovery .
Pickens , who also manages a $ 100 million nanotechnology fund , believes that getting paid to grow these proteins in space will be the killer app for keeping the $ 130 billion International Space Station alive .
Increased traffic to the ISS could drive down the cost of space flight and open up the station to all kinds of commercial applications , which would come in handy as NASA 's financial support wanes .
Pickens ' father made a fortune in oil , became a corporate raider , and now runs a hedge fund .
He 's worth $ 2.5 billion .
No wonder his son looked to the heavens to make his fortune .
Spacehab recruited the younger Pickens earlier this year to turn the company around .
The 20 - year - old penny stock firm has a market cap of about $ 5 million .
You 'd never imagine his company 's modest finances watching Pickens interact with scientists at the ISS workshop .
Pickens is a tall , charismatic Texan .
He talks as if every period is a walk - off homerun .
The scientists seemed wary of him , which is perhaps appropriate .
After all , he is prone to saying , " I am Wall Street . "
But they are transfixed when he talks about bringing big money into outer space .
They 're listening , because Pickens and other businessmen are the new variables in the space equation .
The science has been there ; the salesmanship has been missing .
Given the opportunity , biotech and pharmaceutical companies would likely be eager to buy crystals like the ones Osslund grew .
Here 's why : Treating disease often boils down to two proteins .
One is generating the disease and the other blocks the first protein from working .
If you know the shape of the disease protein – let 's say it 's a wine bottle shape – it's much easier to stick a cork into its mouth .
The higher the resolution of your picture , the faster you can find the cork .
And with some proteins , without the highest resolution , it 's simply too difficult to find a cork .
Without a protein structure , scientists resort to blasting the protein with millions of molecules , hoping that one of them will stick .
Pharmaceutical companies call the process screening , and it takes a long time and it costs a lot of money , even though there have been many improvements in the process .
A new drug costs $ 800 million to get to market and takes 10 years to develop .
But the payoff is huge .
A report found the top - selling blockbuster drug Lipitor raked in $ 12.2 billion for Pfizer in 2006 .
Space - grown crystals wo n't just speed drug discovery :
They could also help companies find more precise drugs that cause fewer side effects .
" Conceptually , better crystals grown in space could improve our hit rates , " said Dr. Kam Zhang , director of structural biology at Plexxikon , a biotech firm that 's solved over 3,000 protein structures and created novel drugs .
Two are in clinical trials , including one potential cancer treatment ( .pdf ) .
Today , of course , everything space - related is still too expensive , especially getting there .
NASA is working on reducing the cost with its Commerical Orbital Transportation Services program , which funded Elon Musk 's SpaceX .
But one thing is sure :
The space station needs private money , and lots of it .
As Allan Marty , a former NASA consultant , told a mostly agency crowd at the ISS workshop last week , " It 's not a given that the Space Station will be sustainable , unless we find a way to attract private capital over the next eight years . "
Sitting with Pickens in what used to be an officer 's lounge , the conversation ranges from space to energy and his theory that fusion will eventually replace oil ( he used to build power plants ) .
Big pharma supporting space ?
Fusion ?
You can take Pickens out of Texas , but you can't take the Texas out of Pickens .
It 's easy to be skeptical when it comes to ideas that are science - fiction big .
But what if he can transform a sleepy company into a bleeding - edge biotech and space - logistics hybrid ?
" One day , I think you ’ll see the space station completely occupied by commercial entrepreneurs , " said Dr. Larry Delucas , a former astronaut and director of the Center for Macromolecular Crystallography at University of Alabama - Birmingham who sits on the scientific advisory board of Spacehab .
Pickens could make millions , save lives and commercialize space .
That would make dad proud .
Use a utility knife to cut along the top and bottom edge of the card to expose the speaker .
Cut the speaker wire at the base of the circuit board first and then gently remove the speaker from the card .
If you do n't cut the speaker wire first you could end up ripping the wire from the base of the speaker and then you 'd really need a soldering iron .
The speaker is fixed to the card with a small circular piece of double sided tape , so it should n't be too difficult to remove .
Avoid the urge here to use your utility knife to " cut away " the speaker - you could accidentally cut right into the speaker itself .
Finally , strip about a quarter inch of insulation from the wires .

In case you 're wondering , the Hallmark card is powered by a CR2032 3V Lithium Battery .
This is the key ingredient for making an LED Throwie and is the power house for a bunch of other Instructables .
The battery is n't necessary for this Instructable , but holding on to it could prove to be handy down the road . ;-)

I still remember our first dishwasher back in the late 70 ’s – it was an electricity and water sucking noisy monstrosity taking up a good chunk of the kitchen – and it did n’t even really do a very good job .
Much has changed in dishwashers in recent years – they use less water , less juice ; are lighter , whisper quiet and far less obtrusive .. and they actually clean the dishes .
We recently purchased a new dishwasher after a lengthy interlude between machines .
Needless to say , the family were keen on getting another dishwasher after 2 years without one .
I managed to avoid the chore by washing dishes by hand badly .
Did I do it on purpose ?
I ’ll never tell :) .
I ’ve been really impressed with the model that was chosen by the family .
It has a 3.5 Star energy rating ( 266 kWh per year ) and a 4 Star water rating ( 13.6 Litres per wash – about 3.6 gallons ) .
It takes care of the dishes for a day for a family of four in a single cycle .
We ’d likely use more water than that when hand washing .
It was a little difficult to figure out if there ’s any electricity or gas saving when it comes to heating the water and general operation , but to heat water and then store it takes quite a bit of energy if you have a standard hot water system .
Even a tankless water system is the same sort of principle as what a dishwasher uses anyway – our model does n’t use hot water from our system ; it does the heating itself , so I suspect it would be highly efficient .
The topic has intrigued me , so I went hunting around for studies .
According to a 2004 study from the University of Bonn in Germany ( Household Technology department ) :
“ If you can afford an automatic dishwasher , use one – preferably a new one .
A full , energy efficient dishwasher cleans best and has the lowest environmental impact of any method ” .
The Bonn research determined that an automatic dishwasher only uses 50 % of the energy and a small fraction of the water , along with less soap .
However , on pondering all this a few “ gotchas ” came to mind that also need to be considered :
– A minor gotcha – dishwashing machine detergent tends to be more harsh on the environment and earth friendly options are fewer in some places – we ’re still looking around for a suitable product readily available – they seem to be more easily obtained in the USA from companies such as Ecover , Seventh Generation , Earth Friendly and Trader Joe’s .
– It would take a lot of energy and resources to make a dishwasher – steel , plastic , packaging , freight etc ; whereas the tools for hand washing are simple and ready made – your hands :) .
– The Bonn study project partners were dishwasher manufacturers .
That does n’t mean to say it was overly biased , but it ’s always something to consider when reading studies – the level of partner involvement and what their vested interest was .
So , I ’m still in two minds about the long term environmental impact of our purchase .
If the dishwasher lasts for many years , perhaps it was a “ greener ” choice for the task when the water and energy savings are taken into consideration .
Here ’s hoping it does because it was certainly a lot more expensive than my family washing by hand :) .
I guess another way to look at it was if the time you save in washing dishes you put towards environment oriented activities , or it meant that it gave you the extra time so that you could minimize the environmental footprint in other areas of your life ; that might provide some ( shakey ) justification :) .
One thing I do certainly advise – do n’t cut corners when selecting a dishwasher ; spend the cash on a good one – shop around and read reviews from consumer organizations and take special note of energy star and water ratings – you ’ll certainly notice the difference in quality , energy and water consumption in most cases by spending a bit extra .
A cheap dishwasher may also wind up in landfill a lot quicker – and that ’s certainly not good for your wallet ; or the environment .
Last week , the Digital Music News Research Group released its quarterly P2P report .
The for - pay report covers the fourth quarter of 2007 , but a publicly available excerpt breaks down the data for the period between September 2006 and September 2007 .
The data consists of snapshots of P2P application and protocol use collected from over 1.66 million Windows PCs .
Gnutella is still the top P2P network , but BitTorrent has been steadily rising .
LimeWire still rules the P2P world .
It is by far the most popular single P2P application , appearing on 36.4 percent of the machines surveyed as of last September .
LimeWire also accounts for the overwhelming majority of Gnutella use among the top 13 of the 152 applications found on PCs .
Gnutella was the protocol of choice for 40.5 percent of the PCs at the end of the period covered by the survey .
We reported last week that BitTorrent use jumped nearly 25 percent on average between November 2007 and March 2008 , and the data in the Digital Music News Research Group shows some significant growth for BitTorrent in the previous period .
In September 2006 , 23.6 percent of the top 13 P2P apps used BitTorrent .
A year later , that number grew over 19 percent , to 28.2 percent .
Data source : Digital Music News Research Group
There also appears to be some consolidation in the P2P market .
In September 2006 , the top 13 applications accounted for 72.8 percent of the market .
A year later , that number had grown to nearly 80 percent .
After LimeWire , the most popular P2P application is µ Torrent , followed by BitTorrent , Ares , and Azureus .
µ Torrent 's popularity soared during the survey period , with its market share growing from 3.0 percent in September 2006 to 11.3 percent a year later .
Data source : Digital Music News Research Group
Two new applications showed up in the survey beginning in January 2007 .
P4P codeveloper Pando , whose technology will be used by NBC for content distribution , had its software first show up in the survey in May ; it captured 0.9 percent of the P2P software market in September 2007 .
Similarly , Gnutella client Frostwire started with 0.4 percent of the market in January 2007 and grew to 1.2 percent by September .
Although BitTorrent is growing at a faster pace than Gnutella , LimeWire may continue to be the most popular application due to its recent addition of support for BitTorrent transfers .
LimeWire faces a troubled future , however , due to an ongoing legal battle with the RIAA .
The RIAA sued the P2P provider in August 2006 , and LimeWire 's countersuit alleging conspiracy on the part of the record labels was dismissed this past December .
Vilified by Big Content and some ISPs , BitTorrent clearly has the momentum right now .
" All of the P2P growth we 've seen over the past several months is in the torrent community , " metrics firm BigChampagne CEO Eric Garland told Ars earlier this month .
P2P traffic has been increasingly shifting away from music towards TV and movies , and BitTorrent is much better suited to moving around the multiple - episode packs to TV shows that BigChampagne has seen growing in popularity .
Feature films are also popular — Garland told Ars that the top 100 movies on BitTorrent saw swarms of 3.9 million users in November 2007 , compared with 9.8 million in March 2008 .

On a brisk day last fall in Prineville , Ore. , Raymond and Deanna Donaca faced the unthinkable :
They were losing their home to foreclosure and had days to move out .
For more than two decades , the couple had lived in their three - level house , where the elms outside blazed with yellow shades of fall and their four golden retrievers slept in the yard .
The town had always been home , with a lazy river and rolling hills dotted by gnarled juniper trees .
HOUSING PAIN ESCALATES : Foreclosures skyrocket 65 % in April
Yet just before lunch on Oct. 23 , the Donacas closed all their home 's doors except the one to the garage and left their 1981 Cadillac Eldorado running .
Toxic fumes filled the home .
When sheriff 's deputies arrived at about 1 p.m. , they found the body of Raymond , 71 , on the second floor along with three dead dogs .
The body of Deanna , 69 , was in an upstairs bedroom , close to another dead retriever .
" It is believed that the Donacas committed suicide after attempts to save their home following a foreclosure notice left them believing they had few options , " the Crook County Sheriff 's Office said in a report .
Their suicides were a tragic extreme , but the Donacas ' case symbolizes how the housing crisis is wrenching the emotional lives of legions of homeowners .
The escalating pace of foreclosures and rising fears among some homeowners about keeping up with their mortgages are creating a range of emotional problems , mental - health specialists say .
Those include anxiety disorders , depression and addictive behaviors such as alcoholism and gambling .
And , in a few cases , suicide .
Crisis hotlines are reporting a surge in calls from frantic homeowners .
The American Psychological Association ( APA ) and other mental - health groups are publishing tips on how to handle the emotional stress triggered by the real estate meltdown .
Psychologists say they 're seeing more drinking , domestic violence and marital problems linked to mortgage concerns — as well as children trying to cope with extreme anxiety when their families are forced to move .
" They 're depressed , anxious .
It 's affected marriages , relationships , " says Richard Chaifetz , CEO of ComPsych , a Chicago - based employee - assistance firm that is counseling homeowners over mortgage fears .
" People tend to catastrophize , and that leads to depression .
Suicide rates go up .
We see an increase in drinking , outbursts at work , violence toward kids .
Before , their houses were like ATMs , " as they rose in value .
" Now , they feel trapped like a rat in a corner . "
Foreclosure filings surged 65 % in April compared with the same month last year , according to a report Wednesday by RealtyTrac .
One in every 519 households received a foreclosure filing last month , and the number of homes with foreclosure activity in April was the highest monthly total since RealtyTrac began issuing the report in January 2005 .
Don Donaca , Raymond 's brother , says it 's hard to understand the suicide , but he thinks the pending foreclosure led to their deaths .
" He got so deep in debt he could n't figure out what else to do , " says Don , 74 , a retired sawmill worker in Prineville .
" I guess a guy would have to walk a few miles in his shoes to understand . "
Financial concerns at the top
Many other homeowners are at risk of less - severe , but still significant , psychological distress :
One in seven homeowners worry that they wo n't be able to make their mortgage payments on time over the next six months , according to an April Associated Press - AOL Money & Finance poll , and more than one - quarter fear their home will decline in value during the next two years .
ComPsych says financial concerns are now the top issue the firm 's counselors are hearing in calls from clients .
Calls about financial worries have surged 20 % over last year ; those related to mortgage problems have doubled .
" It 's escalated to the No. 1 issue because of the housing crisis , " Chaifetz says .
Half of Americans identify housing costs , such as rent or mortgage payments , as significant sources of stress , particularly on the East and West coasts , a 2007 survey by the APA says .
Sixty - one percent in the West , and 55 % in the East ( compared with 47 % in the Midwest and 43 % in the South ) reported housing costs as a very or somewhat significant source of stress .
" The problem affects the whole spectrum , not just people losing their homes , " says LeslieBeth Wish , a psychologist and social worker in Sarasota , Fla .
" The stress exacerbates what is already there .
It brings to the surface problems that were often already there , like marital problems .
There is so much blaming people for the situations they 're in , and that adds to it . "
One of Wish 's patients was semiretired when she bought a home in 2005 in southwest Florida as an investment that she hoped to " flip , " turning a profit .
The woman now owes more than the house is worth and can't sell it .
Wish says her client has developed anxiety , dwelling on her financial situation from the time she wakes up to the time she goes to sleep .
Other clients ,
Wish says , are reporting physical symptoms such as headaches and stomach pains stemming from anxiety over their mortgage situation .
ComPsych 's counselors are hearing similar stories of the mental - health toll caused by the housing slump .
At the request of USA TODAY , ComPsych 's spokeswoman Jennifer Hudson queried counselors to come up with examples of the types of employees they 're helping .
One couple were going through a divorce , and the wife told ComPsych counselors that financial stress was the final trigger .
They had maxed out their credit cards and were living off credit in hopes that they could keep their house .
Another woman called because she suspected her husband was gambling again , apparently hoping to win big so they could repair their financial mess .
She was afraid they were going to have to move in with her parents , ComPsych says .
For Gary Sweredoski of Myrtle Beach , S.C. , the threat of losing his home to foreclosure has taken both a physical and an emotional toll .
In 2007 , Sweredoski , who had no health insurance , underwent triple bypass surgery and wound up with more than $ 300,000 in medical bills .
Then Sweredoski , 60 , a real estate broker , saw his business suffer as the housing market crashed .
Today , he and his wife , Irene , struggle to make the mortgage payment on the dream home they built in Myrtle Beach and are trying to stave off foreclosure .
Like many other homeowners struggling with the financial consequences of the housing slump , Gary says the emotional pain can be severe .
Standing on his deck overlooking a lake where ducks swim and bobbing pontoon boats drift by , he says such circumstances " shatter your pride and become very humiliating , even though the circumstances are not of our making .
" The situation keeps you up at night , preventing you from getting the rest you need .
A lot of the depression that I feel , I do in private , " he says .
" It angers you .
It frustrates you .
It has a large bearing on your emotional state .
When the thought of losing a home looms , you lose more than a building .
You lose what you worked for so many years , all of the equity that you have accumulated over the years .
It 's humbling .
It affects us deeply . "
Rising depression , suicide rates
Historically , research shows , rates of depression and suicide tend to climb during times of economic tumult .
In an article published in 2005 by Cambridge University Press , researchers compared suicide data in Australia from January 1968 through August 2002 with economic problems such as unemployment and mortgage interest rates .
The study found that economic trends are closely associated with suicide risk , with men showing a heightened risk of suicide in the face of economic adversity .
" For some people , suicide is the rational option when they see no future , " says Ken Siegel , a psychologist in Beverly Hills .
" One 's house is very much a projection of one 's self .
To have a home taken away is tantamount to having part of yourself taken away .
There is embarrassment .
For many , it 's overwhelmingly unconquerable . "
In the most severe cases , as with the Donacas , authorities have linked suicides with the financial stress of foreclosures .
On Oct. 25 , 2007 , James Hahn , 39 , a chemist in north Houston , was facing foreclosure and had to vacate his home .
When deputies arrived with eviction papers , Hahn engaged them and a SWAT team in a standoff that lasted more than 10 hours .
It ended in the early morning when Hahn shot himself inside his home , according to a Houston Police Department report .
" Suicides are very much tied to the economy , " says Kathleen Hall , founder and CEO of The Stress Institute in Atlanta .
" It 's a public - health issue . "
In many cases , psychiatrists say , financial stresses , such as those caused by the mortgage crisis , tend to bring pre-existing mental - health issues to the surface .
Studies also show a strong connection between financial distress and emotional stress , including anxiety , depression , insomnia and migraines .
" Often , there is a dilemma of not being able to afford private mental - health treatment in the midst of a financial crisis , " says Joseph Weiner , a psychiatrist and chief of consultation psychiatry at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset , N.Y .
" Children will likely feel the parents ' tension around financial stress .
This could cause feelings of helplessness and anxiety in the child .
Sometimes , young children blame themselves for their parents ' stressful situation . "
Jennifer Paschal , 36 , of Woodstock , Ga. , has tried to ease the effect of the foreclosure of her home on her children , Bailey , 12 , and Trent , 9 .
But she says they 've been deeply pained .
After 13 years of marriage , Paschal is going through a divorce .
The divorce and medical bills led the family to lose its home to foreclosure in April .
Paschal could n't afford the $ 1,300 monthly mortgage payment on her $ 45,000 annual salary as a day care center director .
The home is a six - bedroom house on an acre of land , with a trampoline in the backyard , blooming pink azaleas and rose bushes , and a muddy creek where Trent and Bailey would catch frogs and play with their two dogs , a retriever and a Labrador .
Before they left , Paschal took the children to their rooms and told them to fill a box with whatever they wanted to take with them .
They moved in July to a two - bedroom , $ 900 - a - month apartment .
The " for sale " sign on the house they lost to foreclosure went up this month .
When she saw a picture of it , Paschal says , she cried .
The children are suffering , too .
Trent worries about money .
Recently , at the grocery store , he told his mother not to buy milk because it cost $ 4 .
He begs his mother to get a house again , saying that he 's old enough now to cut the grass .
" It 's hard , " Paschal says .
" I think they see things very differently now .
My son asked me how much money I have , and I told him not to worry about it .
We had to give away our Lab and our bird dog ( because it seemed unfair to keep them in such a small apartment ) .
That killed my son .
That tore him apart , big time . "
In the new apartment , Paschal does n't sleep well .
After she goes to bed , she hears
Trent scurry out of his bed to make sure all the doors are locked .
Then Trent comes to her room and quietly tells his mother she can sleep now because everything is safe .

In early May , the Economic Policy Institute released a paper that argued the United States had entered a new recession , and compared the expansion that had just ended to previous ones .
EPI found that the latest expansion ranked either at or near the bottom on a range of measures , especially those most relevant to working families like job creation and compensation growth .
Last week , the National Bureau of Economic Research , the arbiter of recession dating , confirmed EPI ’s judgment on the recession ’s timing .
In light of that official recognition , EPI is re-releasing its comparison paper , which has also been updated to reflect government data revisions in many of the key series cited in the report .
December 9 , 2008
Evidence is mounting that the U.S. economy is in a recession .
If this is the case , a complete business cycle from 2001 through the end of 2007 ( or perhaps the start of 2008 ) is now on the books , and the economic performance of the current decade can be held up in comparison to that of past business cycles .
By almost all measures , the most recent expansion was the worst since WWII .
A variety of recent economic data now show a pattern consistent with the start of a recession .
Since 1951 , three consecutive months of job declines have always been signals of a recession ; the U.S. employment rate declined for the first three months of 2008 .
Furthermore , the unemployment rate rose from 4.4 % in March 2007 to 5.1 % in March 2008 .
Economic output also began decelerating in the fourth quarter of 2007 to a 0.6 % annual rate , an anemic pace that continued into the first quarter of 2008 .
Several of the internal indicators in the recent gross domestic product report — including consumption of goods and business investment — saw outright declines .
Other monthly indicators — including industrial production and payroll employment — peaked in either the fourth quarter of last year or the first quarter of this year .
Real income ( less transfers ) has been flat since last September .
While it will be many months before an “ official ” recession is declared , evidence shows that the economic expansion that began in 2001 has almost surely ended .
1
Furthermore , if these trends continue , the start of a new recession will likely be dated either at the end of the last quarter of 2007 , or at some point during the first quarter of 2008.2
Finally , financial market turmoil , housing price declines , and higher energy costs are all likely to place continued downward pressure on the macro economy , thus leading to a longer period of diminished economic activity .
Safely assuming that the expansion ended near the start of 2008 , we can compare this cycle ’s performance to those of the past .
The bottom line of such a comparison is that the economic performance from 2001 to 2007 was anemic by most measures , especially in regards to the labor market .
For the vast majority of American households — that is , those who depend on earnings derived from the labor market for the bulk of their income — the economy has been seriously mismanaged .
How strong was the expansion ?
Administration officials , including President Bush himself , have suggested that the “ fundamentals are strong ” even as the nation was clearly drifting toward recession :
“ The fundamentals are strong , we ’re just in a rough patch , as witnessed by the employment figures today . ”
— President Bush , February 1 , 2008
http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/02/20080201-7.html
“ The U.S. economy is structurally strong , but we are experiencing a period of economic challenge . ”
— President Bush , March 14 , 2008
http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/economy/
This paper retrospectively assesses these claims of “ strong fundamentals ” by examining U.S. economic performance over the full run of the latest business cycle that began in March 2001 and comparing this recent performance with past cycles .
Key findings include :
Of the 10 expansions since 1949 , as measured from the end of the recession ( trough ) to the end of the expansion ( peak ) , the expansion from 2001 through last year ranks last in average growth of GDP , investment , employment growth , and employee compensation .
GDP growth in the latest expansion was a full 40 % slower than the post - World War II average ( 2.7 % versus 4.8 % in previous expansions ) .
Despite tax changes that were promoted as incentives to increase investment , average growth in total investment over the latest expansion was less than half of the post - WWII average , and ranked last in this group .
Compared to the start of the last recession ( the peak that occurred in the first quarter of 2001 ) , the percent of the population employed declined by 1.5 percentage points by the end of 2007 .
The only previous drop in this measure relative to a previous business cycle peak came during the mini-expansion of the early 1980s , and the drop in the latest expansion was five times as large .
If this employment - to - population ratio had remained constant , there would have been roughly 3.2 million more jobs , or an additional 39,000 jobs created each month in the U.S. economy over the course of the most recent expansion .
Corporate profits were the only area of strength in the latest full cycle , ranking 2nd strongest among the last the prior 10 cycles .
Assessing macroeconomic performance
Assessments of economic performance can vary substantially depending on the start and end dates chosen for comparison .
For example , an assessment of GDP growth that starts in the middle of a recession and ends in the middle of a boom would look artificially good compared to a longer - term average over equivalent points within a cycle .
A fairer assessment compares the economy ’s performance over equivalent phases of the business cycle .
This paper does so by comparing the latest business cycle with former ones , both over the course of a complete recession - expansion cycle ( a “ peak - to - peak ” measure ) and over the course of the expansion alone ( a “ trough - to - peak ” basis ) .
By nearly all measures , the expansion from 2001 to 2007 ranks as one of the worst on record .
Table 1 provides the relevant rankings for all of the comparisons in this paper .
Full data on growth rates for all of these indicators are available in Appendix Tables A1 - A4.3
Measuring booms : Trough - to - peak
The first column of Table 1 ranks various indicators for each economic expansion since the end of World War II .
This column measures from the beginning to the end of each expansion ( trough - to - peak ) as identified by the National Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER ) ) since the end of World War II.4
Of the 10 trough - to - peak expansions since WWII , the 2000s rank last in growth of GDP , investment , labor compensation , and the employment - to - population ratio .
The 2000s expansion is next - to - last in consumption , and in improving unemp
loyment rates .
Profits in the 2000s did a bit better , coming in fourth overall .
It is frequently ( and generally correctly ) argued that economic policy makers cannot be held solely responsible for an economy entering recession .
Many other factors beyond economic policy are important , and some cyclical variation is inevitable .
Measuring from trough - to - peak could thus be considered a relatively generous way to evaluate economic policy , as it removes the effect of the recession from their grade .
It is explained below how this method of comparison may actually harm the relative rankings of the 2000s , and its ranking over different phases of the business cycle is provided .
Measuring the full business cycle : Peak - to - peak
Column 2 of Table 1 uses an alternative metric : evaluating the economy over the course of a full business cycle , including a recession as well as the subsequent recovery .
This is a “ peak - to - peak ” comparison .
While at first glance this comparison may seem ungenerous to current policy makers , it is actually quite loaded against a poor finding for the latest expansion .
Deeper recessions tend to result in stronger expansions as the economy bounces back .
The 2001 recession was quite mild in most terms , so this bounceback effect was weak .
The rankings for all 10 full business cycles since WWII show that the 2000s rank eighth in GDP , ninth in business investment , consumption spending , employment growth , and labor compensation , and last in the ratio of the population employed .
The 2000s are middling ( fifth ) in improving unemployment rates and second - best overall in profits growth .
Peak - to - peak comparisons of comparably long cycles
Column 3 compares the 2000s to other peak - to - peak cycles that lasted at least as long as this most recent cycle ( 27 quarters ) .
Peak - to - peak comparisons of business cycles of different lengths can potentially be misleading since the shorter cycles had less time to recover from recessions of varying length .
By this measure , the 2000s look particularly bad , ranking last in growth of GDP , personal consumption , business investment , labor compensation , employment - to - population ratio , and the reduction of unemployment .
That is , in every single category except growth in corporate profits , the 2000s ranked last when compared to other business cycles that lasted at least as long .
Peak - to - peak comparisons of decades
The last column in the table reports results gained from consolidating short cycles in the 1950s , 1970s , and 1980s , and using peak - to - peak comparisons to show the broad sweep of economic growth throughout each of the last six decades .
By this comparison , the most recent cycle ranks last in growth of GDP , personal consumption , business investment , labor compensation , and the employment - to - population ratio .
Only corporate profits compared favorably , where the 2000s come in second overall .
Assessing job - growth and family incomes
As the recession began in the start of 2008 , the unemployment rate was 5.1 % , relatively low by historical standards .
However , this low average rate masks the serious labor market weakness of the 2000s expansion .
Policy makers in 2001 inherited an economy that had sustained low unemployment ( below 5 % ) for almost four years .
This inheritance was driven overwhelmingly by a new recognition that unemployment rates at these levels were , contrary to previous wisdom , consistent with stable rates of inflation .
This new recognition led the Federal Reserve to allow these low rates to persist without raising interest rates .
5
Because the level of the unemployment rate is largely an expansion ’s inheritance , the more relevant measure for comparing labor market performance across time is changes in the unemployment rate .
On this measure , the 2000s unemployment performance is less than mediocre .
Perhaps the single most visible indicator of the economy ’s performance for most American families is the simple availability of jobs .
As noted before , the most recent cycle is a poor performer when compared to past cycles , both in regards to the slow payroll employment growth ( 0.6 % ) and also in the large drop in the employment - to - population ratio ( - 1.5 percentage points ) .
If the employment - to - population ratio had just remained constant over the cycle ( which would still be a stark underperformance relative to the past ) , the economy would have an additional 3.2 million jobs today , or an additional 39,000 jobs created per month during the 2000s.6
This weak job market is most likely the driver of another trend : the historically poor performance of median family income over the course of the 2000s .
Figure A below shows that median family income — income earned by families in the middle of the income distribution , with half of all families poorer and half richer — took seven years to surpass its previous peak and tied for the longest such lag since World War II.7
Temporary influences : Housing and taxes
The anemic performance of the U.S. economy in the 2000s is even more striking when one considers that the economy was boosted greatly ( in the short - run ) by two unsustainable influences : the meteoric rise in housing prices and the over $ 1 trillion in deficit spending resulting from tax cuts passed by the Bush administration and the Congress .
First , the historic home price increases led to record levels of residential investment spending , and the ability of households to withdrawal equity from their homes to support current spending essentially gave disposable incomes a 5 % boost over the run of this business cycle relative to those in the past .
8
However , the recession resulting from the housing market decline will be more severe and protracted as residential construction continues to fall and consumer spending is slowed due to the decline in home equity withdrawals .
Secondly , the Bush administration and the Congress enacted two major tax changes ( in 2001 and 2003 ) that added over $ 1 trillion in federal deficit spending to the U.S. economy .
In the short - run , deficit spending can boost economic growth ; however , it is unlikely to have a significant impact on longer - run growth .
The resulting budget deficit puts further economic growth at risk as it constrains the nation ’s ability to address other pressing problems : the Bush tax changes have meant that future policy makers have less leeway to address unmet social needs through public spending and have less room to use deficit spending to fight recessions .
Again , these future costs come at the expense of a tax policy that that has not yielded much in the way of past or present benefits .
As noted above , whatever the impact has been of the Bush tax and economic policies , they have not led to superior macroeconomic performance .
In fact , the economic performance of the last expansion has been one of the worst on record by most measures .
Conclusion
By most widely - accepted and honest measures , the most recent economic expansion should receive a failing grade .
Measures of total output , investment , consumption , employment , wage and income growth , all rank at or near the bottom when compared with past business cycles .
Worse , these anemic results have been accompanied by rising inequality as well , meaning that the bulk of the ( historically weak ) gains have accrued to a small sliver of the population .
This makes the fruits of the current recovery even smaller for the typical working family .
For most American families , this has been a fundamentally weak U.S. economy for some time , and it seems poised to get much worse .
Now is the time for a new direction
in economic policy .
Endnotes
1 . The National Bureau of Economic Research is commonly seen as the final word on determining business - cycle turning points .
Final determination of the start and end of recessions typically does not happen until there is substantial economic data to indicate a prolonged downturn , which can be many months after the economy has entered a recession .
2. Further evidence on the slowdown and the possible timing of a recession can be found at http://www.recessionwatch.org.
3 . Because most of the data analyzed comes out quarterly , this is the frequency used in this paper .
For data that comes out monthly ( employment , unemployment , and employment - to - population ratios ) , quarterly averages are calculated .
4 . The NBER identifies both monthly and quarterly peaks and troughs .
This paper uses quarterly data , measuring from the quarterly peaks and troughs .
5 . There is also some evidence that the long - run rate of unemployment declined in the 1990s and 2000s as greater shares of the workforce entered their 40s and 50s — ages where people generally have higher rates of employment and less career instability .
6 . The calculation for this simply multiplies 1.5 % by the civilian non-institutional population at the end of 2007 .
While it could be true that some of the drop - off in the employment - to - population ratio is due to the aging of the population and withdrawal from the labor force of retirees , the measure tracked in this paper is actually the EPOP of the 25 - 54 - year - old population , which , in the latest recovery , fell by exactly as much as the overall rate ( 1.5 % ) .
7 . Note that family income peak often occurs slightly before macroeconomic peak .

American Accused of Spying for Israel Prosecutors say N.J. man passed U.S. military secrets to Israel from 1979 - 85 .
April 22 , 2008  --
A former civilian employee of a military arsenal in New Jersey has been indicted by the federal government for allegedly conspiring to pass U.S. military secrets to the Israeli government more than 20 years ago , and authorities say they have linked his case to that of convicted spy Jonathan Pollard .
According to court documents , Ben -Ami Kadish allegedly spied for Israel from 1979 - 1985 and provided an official from the Israeli consulate in New York with U.S. national defense information , including restricted nuclear weapons data , classified jet fighter weapons system data and key information on the Patriot missile system .
According to the complaint , Kadish 's Israeli handler was the same man who dealt with Pollard .
Pollard and his wife pleaded guilty in 1986 to charges of passing classified information to Israel and China .
According to the FBI , Pollard had provided Israel with about 800 classified documents and more than 1,000 cables while he was working as an analyst at the Navy 's Anti-Terrorist Alert Center .
Outside of the Pollard case , U.S. intelligence officials say they had long believed that another mole existed in the U.S. government and was providing the Israelis with information .
Joseph diGenova , who served as the U.S. attorney in Washington , D.C. at the time of the Pollard case told ABC News Tuesday , " We suspected they were running others ... there may have been more . "
But after Pollard was exposed , his handler left the United States and Kadish went underground .
Pollard is serving a life sentence at a federal prison in North Carolina .
The handler , according to officials briefed on the case , is Yosef Yagur , who served as the Scientific Attaché at the Israeli consulate in New York .
Although it does not name Yagur , the complaint in Kadish 's case notes that co-conspirator 1 " was employed by the Government of Israel as the counsel for Science Affairs at the Israeli Consulate . "
Kadish allegedly kept in contact with his Israeli handler until last month , when the handler , who is only identified as " Co-conspirator 1 " in court documents , allegedly instructed Kadish to lie to U.S. investigators in the case .
The Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey released a statement confirming that Kadish , whom an Army official described as an elderly widower in failing health , worked at the facility " more than 18 years ago . "
" At the time of his retirement in January 1990 , Mr. Kadish was a supervisory engineer in the installation 's Fuze Division , " the statement said , adding that Kadish " was first employed at this installation in October 1963 . "
" We have been cooperating fully with federal investigators and will continue to do so , " Picatinny spokesman Peter Rowland said in the statement .
On its Web site , the Picatinny Arsenal bills itself as the " Home of American Firepower " and a " one - of - a - kind facility that provides virtually all of the lethal mechanisms used in Army weapon systems and those of the other military services . "
Spy cases involving U.S. allies , such as Israel , have at times caused some tension between the countries involved .
Israelis have protested Pollard 's life sentence for the spy charges , but law enforcement officials note that the U.S. laws on disclosing national security information do not differentiate which country , friend or foe received the information .
Israel formally acknowledged that Pollard served as its agent in 1998 .

House passes contempt citations for Bush aides Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday February 14 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Republican walk - out to protest vote Democrats passed contempt of Congress citations against two Bush administration figures Thursday after the charges had spent months in limbo .
On a vote of 223 - to - 32 House Democrats succeeded in passing the contempt charges against White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten and former counsel Harriet Miers , after Republicans walked out in protest .
House Republicans staged a walk - out Thursday afternoon to protest the contempt vote and the failure by the chamber 's majority members to bow to President Bush 's demands on a controversial spying law .
( Video below )
" We will not stand here and watch this floor be abused for pure political grandstanding at the expense of our national security .
...
Let 's just get up and leave , " Republican Leader John Boehner advised his colleagues as they dramatically left the floor Thursday afternoon .
The walkout followed a series of GOP disruptions Thursday , including a vote scheduled in the middle of a memorial service for Rep.
Tom Lantos , who passed away this week .
Majority Leader Steny
Hoyer took the floor to rebut Boehner 's actions , chastising the Republicans for voting en mass against a measure to give the House more time to work on updating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
And he took aim at President Bush for trying to stoke national security fears to force quick action from the House .
" Every one of us wants to keep America and Americans safe , " he said , eliciting applause from Democrats remaining in the chamber .
" Not one of us wants to subject America or Americans to danger .
The president 's assertion is wrong . "
Hoyer noted that the House has only had since Tuesday night to consider the final surveillance law passed by the Senate , and he accused the president of creating a false sense of urgency to provoke quick action and preclude the full legislative process .
" It is somewhat ironic that on the one hand they say we ought to be doing something , and on the other hand they walk out to preclude us from doing our business , " Hoyer said after the GOP walkout .
As much satisfaction as Bush administration critics will get out of the contempt citations , which were approved by the Judiciary Committee last July , finally getting the endorsement of the full House , it is unlikely that they would lead to prosecution any time soon .
Attorney General Michael Mukasey recently told Congress he would not prosecute the contempt charges because Bolten and Miers were following Bush 's order that they not appear .
Speaking before he had led his GOP colleagues from the floor , Boehner accused the Democrats of playing political games by considering contempt citations before passing a long - term FISA update .
A House bill to update FISA passed in October , but it did not include a provision to give legal immunity to telecommunications companies .
Bush has said he would veto anything without telecom immunity .
The Senate took him seriously enough to include the " amnesty " provisions in its bill , which passed Tuesday .
The contempt citations against Bolten and Miers resulted from their failing to respond to congressional subpoenas for information on the 2006 - 2007 firings of federal prosecutors .
" This is not a confrontation we have sought , and is one we are still hoping to avoid , " Rep. John Conyers , who chairs the House Judiciary Committee , said earlier Thursday .
" However , I believe on the merits our case is quite strong .
Unlike other disputes involving executive privilege , the President has never personally asserted privilege , the Committee has never been given a privilege log , and there is no indication the President was ever personally involved in the termination decisions . "
The action , which Democrats have been threatening for six months , was the latest wrinkle in a more than yearlong probe .
The citations charge Miers with failing to testify and accuse both her and Bolten of refusing Congress ' demands for documents in the investigation .
Thursday 's vote was the first time in 25 years that a full chamber of Congress has voted on a contempt of Congress citation .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - World stocks nosedived and demand for safe - haven bonds and currencies soared on Monday as fears gripped investors that a deteriorating U.S. economy would drag others down with it .
The losses on the blue - chip stock indexes of Germany , Britain and France alone amounted to more than $ 350 billion , or roughly the size of the combined economies of New Zealand , Hungary and Singapore .
MSCI ’s main world stock index , a benchmark gauge of stock markets globally , sank 3.3 percent , falling below its 2007 bottom to lows last seen in December 2006 and taking it down more than 12 percent so far this year .
Its emerging market equities counterpart lost more than 5.5 percent .
Meanwhile , the spread between emerging market bond yields and U.S. Treasury yields , a key gauge of risk appetite , was just off its widest in two years .
“ Weak global economic data , poor corporate data , increasing fears about the possibility of a recession ... have left investors drowning in a sea of red , ” said Henk Potts , equity strategist at Barclays Stockbrokers .
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 closed down 5.8 percent , taking its 2008 year - to - date losses to more than 15 percent .
U.S. stock markets were closed on Monday for a holiday , but U.S. stock index futures were down sharply suggesting investors were not putting much hope on Wall Street leading a rebound when it returns to business .
Elsewhere , Toronto ’s stock market was down around 4.5 percent and Japan ’s benchmark Nikkei average earlier lost 3.86 percent to close at a two - year low .
“ Risk aversion is widespread as the market thinks ( the economic downturn ) is not just a U.S. centric story , ” said Paul Robson , currency strategist at RBS Global Banking .
BEAR MARKET ?
Investors were carrying through from last week ’s concern that a fiscal stimulus proposed by President George W. Bush would not be enough to stop the U.S. economy from falling into recession and that the downturn will spread .
Stock markets have been in full retreat this year over the economic fears .
The broad U.S. S&P index had its biggest weekly fall since July 2002 last week .
Many indexes are now more than 20 percent below their recent cycle peaks , a traditional sign that what is occurring is not just a correction but the start of a bear market .

“ It ’s becoming more and more difficult as the market is now in panic , ” said Hugues Rialan of fund manager Robeco .
Such falls on equity markets sometimes signal to large investors that it is time to buy .
But leading investment bank Morgan Stanley said on Monday that was not the case now , at least as far as Europe was concerned .
“ We are not compelled to buy yet despite bearish sentiment , ” its European equity strategy team said in a note .
“ We continue to prefer cash over equities . ”

Should You Make the Fiber Optic Switch ?
We Weigh the Pros and Cons
Is your internet fast ?
If it ’s not , you ’ve probably wondered what you can do to make it faster .
In today ’s society , faster is better , so you ’ve probably seen tons of ads trying to convince you that every company has the fastest internet .
In your search to find a faster , better internet connection , have you considered making the fiber optic switch ?
If you have n’t , it ’s time you did .
What is fiber optic internet and is it worth it ?
Keep reading to find out .
In this article , we ’ll cover what fiber optic internet is , as well as its associated pros and cons .
What is Fiber Optic Internet ?
Fiber optic internet sends data through cables containing light - conducting fibers .
This data includes emails , sounds , videos , and more .
The fibers are very thin , but they pack an amazing punch when it comes to workload .
The Pros of Using Fiber Optic Internet
There are many pros to using fiber optic internet .
Let ’s look at a few of them .
It ’s Reliable
Fiber optic internet does n’t run into the same issues experienced by internet that requires copper wires .
When copper wires are used , you may experience electromagnetic interference .
Copper wiring can also create sparks , making it dangerous in some situations , such as in industrial settings that have increased fire risks .
Companies needing internet in this type of situation can rely on fiber optic cables without needing to worry about hazards .
It ’s Weather Resistant
Fiber optics can stand up to bad weather conditions .
This makes it ideal for locations that typically have issues with other internet types due to weather - related problems .
Moisture , extreme temperatures , and more can lead to cable damage .
Not with fiber optics , though .
It ’s Fast
You may think your DSL or cable internet is fast .
And it might be .
But it ’s not as fast as fiber .
Fiber internet is ridiculously fast , much faster than other types of internet .
This may be one of the best benefits of fiber optics .
With faster internet , you can enjoy games , movies , phone calls , and just about everything you already do .
Would you like lag - free internet ?
We thought so .
For speed reasons alone , it ’s worth your time to research fiber internet .
It ’s Future Proof
Fiber internet is n’t just the internet of now ; it ’s also the internet of the future .
You can get yourself hooked up and not worry that something faster will show up just around the corner .
How is fiber future proof ?
It can withstand substantially faster speeds than it holds even now , so it probably is n’t going anywhere .
It Can Be Bundled
Fiber internet can be bundled with other services , just like other internet types .
That means you can get the same incredible speed for TV that you get with your fiber internet .
It ’s Efficient
Since fiber optic internet uses light to transmit data , you do n’t have to worry about overheating .
You do have this issue when using metal and other copper wires .
If cables overheat , they ca n’t work anymore , but you wo n’t have to worry about that with fiber .
The Cons of Fiber Internet
Just like with most other things , there are some cons to using fiber internet .
Here ’s a look at the downside of fiber .
It ’s Hard to Find
Alright , fiber may not actually be hard to find , but it ’s definitely not as available as cable or DSL internet .
Only a quarter of the United States has access to fiber , which puts a major damper on its awesomeness .
That leaves consumers in a lurch if they want to reap the benefits of having fiber internet .
Their choices ?
Basically , they ’d have to wait around for fiber to arrive in their area , or they ’d have to move .
Since most people probably are n’t willing to move just for the sake of faster internet , and only so many homes can fit in a single area , that means a lot of people are missing out .
It Requires New Infrastructure
Since fiber internet does n’t run on the same infrastructure as DSL or cable internet , it requires different equipment .
So even if fiber comes to your area , you ’ll have to outfit your home with the right stuff so it will work .
It Might Take a While
While more companies are adopting fiber internet , it may be a while before it reaches your city .
Since new infrastructure is required , adopting and offering fiber internet is pricey for companies .
It May Be Unneeded
While it ’s easy to think that faster means better , that is n’t always true .
True , nobody wants slow internet .
But fiber offers such outrageous speeds that a lot of that capability will probably be wasted .
For ultra gamers and people streaming in 4 K , those speeds may be appreciated .
Otherwise , you may find that your experience does n’t feel all that different than what you had with a different type of internet .
Consider the speeds you usually have and how they meet your needs .
If fiber speeds are hugely different but you do n’t need a ton more speed , you could save yourself the money and spend it on something else .
Is the Fiber Optic Switch Right for You ?
You Decide
Fiber internet offers some incredible perks–amazing speed being among the top benefits .
It does have its downsides , though .
You ca n’t take advantage of fiber internet if it is n’t offered in your area .
If it ’s available in your area , you should definitely consider making the fiber optic switch .
Once you get it , you wo n’t know how you lived without it .
In order to fully enjoy the benefits of fiber internet , you ’ve got to keep your electronic devices running smoothly .

The MACS investigators , and other researchers , defend the slow pace of research as a function of numbers .
The first generation of AIDS patients , in the mid-1980s , had no effective treatments for a decade , and died in overwhelming numbers , leaving few survivors to study .
Those survivors , like Mr. Holloway , gaunt from chemotherapy and radiation and mostly housebound , lurch from crisis to crisis .
Mr. Holloway says his adjustment strategy is simple : “ Deal with it . ”
Still he notes , ruefully , that his father has no medical complaints other than arthritis , failing eyesight and slight hearing loss .
“ I look at how gracefully he ’s aged , and I wish I understood what was happening to my body , ” Mr. Holloway said during a recent home visit from his case manager at the Howard Brown Health Center here , a gay , lesbian and transgender organization .
The case manager , Lisa Katona , could soothe but not inform him .
“ Nobody ’s sure what causes what , ” Ms. Katona told Mr. Holloway .
“ You folks are the first to go through this and we ’re learning as we go . ”
Mr. Holloway is uncomplaining even in the face of pneumonia and a 40 - pound weight loss , both associated with his cancer treatment .
Has the cost been too high ?
He says it has not , “ considering the alternatives . ”
Halfway across the country , Jeff , 56 - year - old New Yorker who was found to have AIDS in 1987 , said he asks himself that question often .
Jeff , who asked that he not be fully identified , has had one hip replacement because of a condition called avascular necrosis , the death of cells from inadequate blood supply , and needs another to avoid a wheelchair .
Many experts think that avascular necrosis is caused by the steroids many early AIDS sufferers took for pneumonia .

WASHINGTON - Sen .
John McCain secured millions in federal funds for a land acquisition program that provided a windfall for an Arizona developer whose executives were major campaign donors , public records show .
McCain , who has made fighting special - interest projects a centerpiece of his presidential campaign , inserted $ 14.3 million in a 2003 defense bill to buy land around Luke Air Force Base in a provision sought by SunCor Development , the largest of about 50 landowners near the base .
SunCor representatives , upset with a state law that restricted development around Luke , met with McCain 's staff to lobby for funding , according to John Ogden , SunCor 's president at the time .
The Air Force later paid SunCor $ 3 million for 122 acres near the base .
It was the highest single land transaction of the private lots purchased by the government - three times the county 's assessed value and twice the military 's estimated value .
SunCor also donated another 122 acres .
Alan Bunnell , a spokesman for SunCor 's parent company , Pinnacle West Capital , said the donation was meant to minimize the company 's tax bill and enhance the value of adjacent property it owns .
McCain has long - standing ties to SunCor and Pinnacle West :
McCain 's campaigns have received $ 224,000 since 1998 from donors connected to Pinnacle West , including $ 104,100 for his current presidential run , according to a USA Today analysis of campaign - finance data compiled by the non-partisan CQ MoneyLine .
Donors include employees of Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries , employees ' spouses and the company 's lobbyists and political committees .
Pinnacle West's Chief Executive Officer Bill Post , vice president and lobbyist Robert Aiken and former president Jack Davis , who retired in March , are fundraisers for McCain 's current presidential campaign .
SunCor President Steve Betts , who joined the company weeks after the military land deal , is a former campaign lawyer for McCain and has raised more than $ 100,000 for his current campaign .
McCain campaign spokesman Brian Rogers said the senator 's ties to SunCor had nothing to do with his support for the project .
The Air Force had a legitimate need for the land and asked for money to buy it in a March 2002 budget planning document , Rogers said in an e-mail .
Rogers said McCain , who took credit for the funding in a floor speech in 2003 , wanted to prevent the Pentagon from closing Luke .
The military had cited encroaching development in deciding to close another Phoenix - area installation , Williams Air Force Base , in 1993 .
" Sen. McCain 's interest in this matter was only to support the formal requirements of the Air Force in a way that furthered the interests of the taxpayer , " he said .
Bunnell said the company 's ties to McCain were not a factor in the land deal .
" This was done without any political intentions or anything other than to preserve Luke Air Force Base , " Bunnell said .
Craig Holman , a lobbyist for the government watchdog group Public Citizen , said McCain appeared to be helping campaign donors .
" Any time the executives of a corporation work hard at raising funds for any candidate , they almost always want something in return , " Holman said .
" When it comes to SunCor they were asking for a specific earmark .
And McCain delivered . "
Executives from SunCor , which owned more than 3 square miles ' worth of land near Luke Air Force Base , had complained for years about state and municipal restrictions on development there .
The issue came to a head in 2001 , when the state Legislature expanded the area where development was restricted but rejected a $ 15 million plan to compensate landowners , Ogden said .
Ogden said SunCor developed the idea for the Air Force to buy land around the base and lobbied McCain and other members of Arizona 's congressional delegation to put the money in the Pentagon 's budget .
Rogers and Ogden said SunCor representatives met with McCain 's staff , but not the senator himself , to discuss the proposal .
" Sen. McCain was probably the last one to come on board , " said Ogden , who retired from SunCor in 2005 .
" He 's not big on anything that would help only one state , but I think he certainly saw the need to do something to help Luke . "
Republican Rep. Bob Stump , whose district included Luke , got $ 13 million approved for the plan in 2002 , when he was chairman of the House Armed Services Committee during his last year in Congress .
McCain secured an additional $ 14.3 million for the Luke land program the next year .
Rogers refused to say whether McCain knew that SunCor owned land likely to be purchased .
Once it got the money , the Air Force bought land surrounding a munitions storage area to create a buffer zone .
First , the military bought 143 acres from hospital operator Sun Health Properties for $ 950,000 , or $ 6,646 an acre , in July 2004 .
Five months later , the military paid SunCor far more for fewer adjacent acres : $ 3 million for a 122 - acre parcel , or $ 25,000 an acre .
The company then donated an adjacent 122 acres to the Air Force .
Bunnell said SunCor structured the transaction that way to maximize its proceeds and to help preserve the value of nearby property it owns , since the sale price would be used by appraisers to value comparable properties .
Records show three SunCor - owned parcels next to the base are assessed at $ 24,000 to $ 43,500 per acre .
Donating property provides a company with a tax deduction based on the fair market value of the land , said David Cameron , associate director of the tax program at Northwestern University 's law school .
A company 's profit in a land sale to the government , on the other hand , can be taxable , he said .
Bunnell said the company 's appraisal of the land put its value at about $ 25,000 per acre .
That is precisely the per-acre rate the Air Force paid SunCor .
If the donated land is included , the Air Force paid " well below market value " - half of the company 's appraised cost - for the entire 244 acres , he added .
The Army Corps of Engineers , which acted as the Air Force 's real estate agent in the deal , had appraisals of the land supporting the $ 3 million price based on the 244 - acre package , spokeswoman Jennie Ayala said in an e-mail .
That would be about $ 12,500 an acre , or half the value cited by Pinnacle West .
Ayala said she could not disclose details of the military 's appraisals because they were " privileged information . "
The Maricopa County Assessor 's Office calculated the 2005 value of the 244 acres at $ 1.9 million , or about $ 7,900 per acre , spokesman Paul Petersen said in an e-mail .
Petersen said in a telephone interview that the county tries to accurately reflect market value , but often comes up with assessments that are lower than actual sales prices .
County records say the former Sun Health property was assessed in 2005 at $ 290,000 , or $ 2,029 per acre , less than a third of the per-acre price the Air Force paid .
The Air Force has made offers to buy or purchase development rights for other parcels of SunCor land near Luke , Bunnell said , but no agreements have been reached .
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
A man claiming to be the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq mocked the death toll of American troops and urged his fighters to launch an offensive against U.S. forces in the next few weeks .
Abu Hamza al - Muhajir , also known as Abu Ayyub al - Masri , is the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq .
The speaker was identified as Abu Hamza al - Muhajir , also known as Abu Ayyub al - Masri , on several Islamist Web sites that posted the recording .
" The reason I give this speech is that the enemy declared -- even though it might be lying -- that its death toll in Iraq has reached 4,000 , " he said .
" So we call upon our heroes ... to ask every group within a month from the time it hears this , to offer the head of an American as a gift to the deceitful [ President ] Bush , " he continued .
As of Saturday , 4,036 U.S. troops had died in the Iraq war .
The speaker also called for attacks on members of Iraqi awakening councils , a movement of predominantly Sunnis who have joined forces with the U.S. and Iraqi governments in battling Islamic jihadists loyal to al Qaeda in Iraq .
Also Saturday , radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr threatened to " declare a war " unless U.S. and Iraqi forces stop their assaults on his followers .
" I 'm giving the last warning and words to the Iraqi government , " al - Sadr said in a statement on a loyalist 's Web site .
" They should take the road of peace and drop the violence that they use with their people .
Otherwise , they will be like the destructive [ Saddam Hussein ] government . "
The cleric also assailed the United States , saying , " From the other side , the occupier made us targets for his planes , tanks , mortars and his deceptive policy by demanding me not to stand against the Iraqi government , which -- if it were n't for us -- it would not exist .
" It is like the occupier would ignore the fact that his army is standing against the government , to prevent it from being an independent government with full sovereignty . "
The warning was a reminder of al - Sadr 's bloody rebellions in 2004 against U.S. forces in Najaf and Baghdad .
Al - Sadr recently renewed for six months the cease - fire he imposed in August on his Mehdi Army militia , a move that the U.S. military has credited with helping reduce violence across Iraq .
But an uprising like the one al - Sadr threatened Saturday would ultimately fuel inter-Shiite fighting through Sadr City and other Shiite communities .
Intense fighting between Iraqi security forces and al - Sadr 's Mehdi Army continued Saturday in the southern city of Nasiriya and in Sadr City , the cleric 's Baghdad stronghold .
Twelve people were killed in overnight fighting Friday into Saturday between Iraqi security forces and the Mehdi Army in Sadr City , an Interior Ministry official said .
Six dozen people were wounded .
In Nasiriya , sporadic clashes spilled into Saturday , leaving four police officers and 16 militia members dead , the ministry official confirmed .
The clashes prompted authorities to impose a curfew in the city Saturday .
In another southern city , Diwanyia , which witnessed deadly fighting between Iraqi forces and the Mehdi Army last month , officials discovered 14 decapitated bodies .
An interior ministry official said the bodies appear to be a few days old .
Meanwhile , Iraqi troops began a new phase of the security operation launched March 25 by Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki , dubbed Charge of the Knights .
The operation aims to clear militants from their strongholds in the southern Iraqi city of Basra , a spokesman for the British army said .
The operation began early Saturday in the Hayania district , with British artillery and U.S. aircraft hitting open ground as a show of force , Maj .
Tom Holloway said .
Iraqi troops , working with U.S. and British military teams , were in control of Hayania by the afternoon , said Maj.
Gen. Abdul Karim Khalaf , a spokesman for the Iraqi Interior Ministry .
The troops did not face much resistance but encountered explosives planted on the roads as they entered , Khalaf said .
They were able to defuse them and were searching house to house for wanted " criminals " and illegal weapons .
" As with the earlier phases ... this continues to be an Iraqi-led , - planned and - executed mission , " Holloway said .
" Coalition troops are ready to provide support to Iraqi Security Forces as requested and required . "
Al - Sadr 's warning - Saturday came after he agreed to al - Maliki 's order to vacate and turn over his headquarters in Basra to Iraqi Security Forces .
On Friday , they surrounded the office and gave workers until the end of Saturday to leave what they said was government property .
Al - Sadr 's comments also wrap up a week of violence illustrating the ever - sharpening divide among Iraq 's majority Shiites : those who back al - Sadr and those who support al - Maliki and the Supreme Islamic Council of Iraq .
The council is the main Shiite group in al - Maliki's U.S. - supported government .

TORONTO ( Reuters ) - Canada has banned all smoking in federal prisons because a partial ban was largely ignored , the government said on Tuesday .

As a result of the ban , which took effect in all maximum - security prisons on Monday , inmates will be barred from smoking anywhere inside or outside prison property , including private visiting rooms and yards .
“ Since the partial ban was not working in order to ensure a safe , healthy , smoke - free environment , we decided to move towards the total ban , ” said Lynn Brunette , a spokeswoman for the Correctional Service of Canada ( CSC ) .
The remaining medium - and minimum - security institutions will see the ban in place by the beginning of June .
Lyle Stewart , a spokesman for the Union of Canadian Correctional Officers , said contingency plans are in place to deal with any backlash from angry inmates , but said there have been no major incidents so far .
“ What we would be worried about is if there ’s any organized attempt to lead a riot or revolt of some sort .
That ’s what the biggest danger is , ” Stewart said .
He added that the full effect of the ban probably wo n’t be felt until hidden stockpiles of cigarettes are depleted .
The ban applies to all guards and staff as well as prisoners .
Last year , Canada ’s federal prison system handled almost 20,000 inmates , three - quarters of whom are smokers .
Inmates and staff have been given educational materials and smoking - cessation aids to help them quit .
However , prisoners ’ rights advocates say the total ban goes too far .
“ It ’s an unreasonable invasion of their rights and privileges -- the very , very minimal that remain , ” said Davies Bagambiire , a human rights lawyer based in Toronto .
Others argue the wider ban will only increase the value of cigarettes as “ currency ” .
“ Tobacco is already a highly valued commodity inside a federal prison , ” said Craig Jones , executive director of the John Howard Society of Canada in Kingston , Ontario .
“ You use it to buy and trade favors .
So CSC is taking what is already a highly valued commodity and making it extremely valuable .
And that sets up the ... potential for abuse between those who have access to tobacco , which is guards and staff , and those who don’t , ” Jones said .
Do the Crazy Bulk supplements really work , or should you avoid them like the plague ?
That ’s what I ’m going to answer in this post ..
For the past few years I ’ve been meaning to get in shape and build some muscle , but I could never get my act together .
I wanted a muscular physique I could be proud of and did n’t make me shudder at the thought of someone seeing me with my top off .
I did n’t want to get huge or compete on stage I just wanted to look and feel good and be more attractive to women , I guess .
So , I started working out at the local gym and was n’t really getting anywhere .
I was unfocused and felt like I was just spinning my wheels .
Then I decided to get serious and bought myself some whey protein , a good pre workout and the BodyBeast program for guidance .
Things started out good and I could feel myself getting fitter , but I was n’t seeing the results in the mirror .
It felt like something was missing .
So , I started Googling ways to build muscle and learned about these things called legal steroid supplements by a company called Crazy Bulk .
They ’re designed to mimic the effects of real anabolic steroids but without the side effects .
My first thought was , “ Ok these have got to be a scam right ? ”
But I kept seeing all these positive reviews about them and they had a 4.4 rating on the independent review site feefo.com with over 2,045 reviews .
To be honest I still was n’t sure , but I thought , what the heck let ’s give it a try .
So , I bought their bulking stack and within a few days it was like some kind of anabolic switch was triggered inside of me and I began feeling all these amazing changes .
Fox uses ' mailbag ' to attack Obama

Fox News Sunday 's Chris Wallace seems to echo the sentiments of his station 's CEO in his reading of a viewer 's letter about presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) .
The letter reads :
Obama will sit down with anyone , including Iran 's Ahmadinejad , who calls for the death of the Great Satan America , but [ Fox News Sunday ] , that 's where he draws the line .
Can we seriously believe he can confront America 's adversaries when he wo n't even sit down with you ?
" The candidates that can't face Fox , ca n't face al - Qaeda , " Fox News CEO Roger Ailes said , to applause , at a June 2007 awards show he co-hosted with News Corporation head Rupert Murdoch .
Think Progress opined shortly afterwards that presidential candidates were n't afraid of appearing on Fox News , but rather , they sought not to " legitimize this constant source of partisan misinformation by allowing
Fox to claim that it is a real news source that can independently manage a presidential debate . "
In 2007 , a Democratic debate partially sponsored by Fox was canceled because the candidates refused to appear on the often hostile network .
However , in the past six months , both Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton have gone on Fox to promote their campaigns , without much controversy .

Such is the relentlessness of Tony Blair 's public immersion into matters of faith these days that Alastair Campbell 's " we do n't do God " assertion in Downing Street has now been fully exposed for what it was : a skilful piece of diversionary spin .
Yesterday , the former prime minister was in New York , launching the Tony Blair Faith Foundation at the headquarters of Time Warner , having told Time magazine that promoting inter - faith dialogue and co-operation was " how I want to spend the rest of my life " .
For Mr Blair , rhetorically and professionally , religion is the new politics .
Introduced by Bill Clinton to a more sympathetic audience than he might receive in the UK , he said : " Religious faith will be of the same significance to the 21st century as political ideology was to the 20th century .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" In an era of globalisation , there is nothing more important than getting people of different faiths and cultures to understand each other better and live in peace and mutual respect ; and to give faith itself its proper place in the future . "
Despite his former press officer 's now - cliched intervention , Mr Blair 's interest in God was always bubbling beneath the surface .
Though he had left Number 10 , Mr Campbell may have winced when , asked in 2006 about the decision to invade Iraq three years earlier , Mr Blair told Michael Parkinson : " In the end , there is a judgement that ... if you believe in God , it 's made by God as well . "
But by then , Mr Blair was already planning the role that religion would play in his future life .
In his Time interview , as well as taking a swipe at an overly secular Europe , Mr Blair admitted he had thought about the foundation for a " long time " .
In fact , while in office , he held behind - the - scenes meetings with a number of religious leaders and diplomats , discussing the practical implications of his new cause .
He persuaded Ruth Turner , his loyal Downing Street aide who was caught up in the " cash for peerages " affair , to head the foundation .
In March this year , in a sign of the continued pull of the man who has just been voted more influential than Gordon Brown in a poll of 1,000 business leaders , he poached his successor 's appointments secretary , William Chapman , to be the foundation 's policy director , as revealed by The Independent .
In April , in the crowning moment of his much - trailed conversion to Roman Catholicism , Mr Blair spoke at Westminster Cathedral , the British home of his new denomination .
When he is not negotiating in Jerusalem in his role as international Middle East envoy , Mr Blair seldom delivers a speech that is not laced with religious references .
This week , he was lauded at the Class Day for graduates of Yale , where he has expanded his prolific portfolio by taking on a part - time role teaching about " faith and globalisation " .
Preaching his philosophy on life , he said : " Judge someone by how they treat those below them not those above them . "
That Mr Blair , 55 , " does God " is no longer in doubt , if it ever was .
Whether he can translate that faith into practical solutions to solve some of the world 's most challenging problems remains to be seen .
Speaking against extremism at a recent private meeting in a London mosque , Mr Blair was questioned by young Muslims who said his credibility is compromised after his role in Iraq and the " war on terror " .
One who knows him said : " He means well but the project needs more substance . "
But as he pushes for progress on the Millennium Development Goals aimed at tackling extreme poverty , and floats the idea of followers of the three monotheistic faiths providing bed nets to eliminate malaria , Mr Blair is unlikely , at least , to be racked by self - doubt .
A team of McGill University scientists has discovered important differences between the brains of suicide victims and so - called normal brains .
Although the genetic sequence was identical in the suicide and non-suicide brains , there were differences in their epigenetic marking – a chemical coating influenced by environmental factors .
All of the 13 suicide victims in the study had experienced abuse as children .
“ It ’s possible the changes in epigenetic markers were caused by the exposure to childhood abuse , although in humans it ’s difficult to establish causality between early childhood and epigenetic markers , in the way we have established this in animal subjects , ” said Moshe Szyf , a professor in McGill ’s Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics .
“ The big remaining questions are whether scientists could detect similar changes in blood DNA – which could lead to diagnostic tests – and whether we could design interventions to erase these differences in epigenetic markings ” .
In the first study of its kind , Szyf , a professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics ; Gustavo Turecki , Department of Psychiatry who practices at the Douglas Hospital ; Michael Meaney , a professor in the Departments of Psychiatry and Neurology and Neurosurgery , who is also at the Douglas Hospital ; and McGill postdoctoral research fellow Patrick McGowan have built on their world - renowned epigenetics work to uncover differences in the DNA in the brains of a group of male suicide victims from Quebec .
The all - McGill study is set to be published in the May 6 , 2008 edition of the online journal Public Library of Science ( PLoS ONE ) .
Epigenetics is the study of changes in the function of genes that do n’t involve changes in the sequences of DNA .
The DNA is inherited from our parents ; it remains fixed throughout life and is identical in every part of the body .
During gestation , however , the genes in our DNA are marked by a chemical coating called DNA methylation .
These marks are somewhat sensitive to one ’s environment , especially early in life .
The epigenetic marks punctuate the DNA and program it to express the right genes at the appropriate time and place .
The researchers examined a set of genes that code for rRNA , a basic component of the machinery that creates protein in cells .
Protein synthesis is critical for learning , memory and the building of new connections in the brain ; it can affect decision - making and other behaviour .
The scientists found that rRNA can be regulated epigenetically .
In previous studies in laboratory rats , the group proved that simple maternal behaviour during early childhood has a profound effect on genes and behaviour in ways that are sustained throughout life .
However , these effects on gene expression and stress responses can also be reversed in adult life through treatments known to affect the genomic marking known as DNA methylation .
The brain samples in the latest study came from the Quebec Suicide Brain Bank , administered by Dr. Turecki of the Douglas Mental Health University Institute .
With the support of the Bureau du Coroner du Québec ( Office of the Chief Medical Examiner ) , the McGill Group for Suicide Studies ( MGSS ) founded the Quebec Suicide Brain Bank ( QSBB ) at the Douglas Mental Health University Institute , to promote studies on the phenomenon of suicide .
Research carried out on brain tissue can help develop intervention and prevention programs to help people suffering mental distress and who are at risk of committing suicide .
The research was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research .
It was while watching " What the Bleep Do We Know ? " that the Five Minute Peace Plan came to me .
I participated in the August , 1987 , Harmonic Convergence that called peace minded folk to come together where ever they were to pray for peace , meditate for peace , work for peace , talk for peace , cooperate for peace , play for peace .
This was one day many years ago and there have been many other calls for peace .
Groups have requested that individuals set aside a specific time one specific day a month or week or when ever .
I have participated in all of them that I have come across .
Being in a one - day - at - a - time life style , it made sense that I should add peace to my daily schedule and perhaps others would join me as well .
Once the idea was formed the words quickly found their way on to the paper .
For several weeks now I have been emailing this idea to all kinds of individuals , groups , and businesses .
Please share this peace plan with any one you wish .
I visualize that for every 5 minute segment there are lots of people being peace .
As we say here in Iowa , " It ca n't hurt ! "
FIVE MINUTE PEACE PLAN
It 's easy to be caught up in today 's world problems .
We are constantly reminded of terrorism , abuse , and greed .
And , we do n't have to look far to see their results .
Have you ever felt powerless over what 's happening around you ?
It 's easy to feel like that .
What can one person do when so many others are acting crazy and insane ?
How can one person possibly do anything that could affect a change anywhere ?
It 's hopeless for one person to do anything that might make a difference .
Or , is it ?
In the summer of 1993 , a group of individuals was brought to Washington , D.C. to see if they could lower the city 's crime rate .
They were not given guns or weapons of any kind .
They were not sent out on the streets to face the insanity .
They did not get on the telephone or television and yet what they did do was so affective that it measurably reduced Washington , D.C. 's crime rate by 25 % .
The D.C. police chief had stated before the group began their effort that it would take two feet of snow in July to lower the crime rate 25 % .

Oil set another record high today , climbing to within a whisker of $ 120 a barrel as traders fretted about the closure of the Grangemouth refinery in Scotland and disruptions to crude output in Nigeria .
It even shrugged off a rally in the dollar , in which oil is priced .
The slide in the dollar in recent years has been key to the rising value of crude as producers demand greater compensation for the falling greenback .
The price of a barrel of US light crude rose by $ 1.50 a barrel to as high as $ 119.93 during London trading , but later dipped slightly as dealers took profits .
London Brent crude was up 71 cents to $ 117.05 .
The president of oil producers ' cartel Opec , Chakib Khelil , blamed dollar weakness for the high prices and said he could not rule out a rise to $ 200 a barrel .
" Without geopolitical problems and the fall in the dollar , the prices of oil would not be at this level , " he was also quoted as saying in Algerian newspaper El Moudjahid .
Oil prices are up almost a quarter since the start of the year and have risen sixfold in the past six years .
Some analysts predict further rises , spelling more pain for motorists but making alternative forms of energy relatively cheaper .
Rising oil prices have been a key factor pushing up inflation rates in many countries .
Petrol pump prices have repeatedly set records and look like breaking through £ 5 a gallon across Britain , a level already reached in many parts of the country .
Website petrolprices.com said the average price of fuel rose for a 15th consecutive day today to a record 109.8 p a litre for petrol — £ 5.15 a gallon — and 119.8 p a litre for diesel .
Prices are up 10 % this year .
Petrolprices.com founder Brendan McLoughlin predicts pump prices could reach £ 1.50 a litre by the late summer .
Today , crude prices were buoyed by news that ExxonMobil had shut all of its Nigerian oil production of about 800,000 barrels per day since last week due to a strike and attacks by rebels .
Crude has been underpinned for years by ongoing supply problems around the world , with the global economy enjoying its best growth period for three decades and pushing up demand , especially from countries such as China and India .
Experts question whether there is enough oil in the ground or whether global output may be at a peak and about to decline , but Opec refuses to pump more , blaming western " speculators " for price rises .
Markets were on tenterhooks as to whether the US central bank , the Federal Reserve , would cut interest rates on Wednesday — following a mid-March reduction from 3 % to 2.25 % — to bolster the flagging US economy .
If it does , that is expected to further undermine the dollar and lift oil prices again .
" The Federal Reserve will have a chance to bolster the dollar if it decides to hold the line on further rate increases , " said Edward Meir , analyst at MF Global .
" Both developments could induce a correction in energy prices later in the week , but for now the trend appears higher still . "
You do n’t call a black man a “ boy ” when you ’re from the south , unless you ’re intending to harken back to the racist language of slavery , and then segregation , when all black men were called “ boy ” as a prejudiced pejorative .
Even worse , the GOP Senate leader Mitch McConnell was there when it happened .
Here ’s what Rep. Geoff Davis ( that ’s really his name , talk about irony ) R-KY had to say about Obama :
“ I ’m going to tell you something : That boy ’s finger does not need to be on the button , ” Davis said .
Again , in southern speak , everyone knows what “ boy ” means when it ’s said about a black man .
UPDATE : Davis apologized .
That ’s nice , but why has n’t Mitch McConnell said anything ?
He was right there when it happened .

Nansen said : ` Everyday life is the path . '
Joshu asked : ` Can it be studied ?'
Nansen said : ` If you try to study , you will be far away from it . '
Joshu asked : ` If I do not study , how can I know it is the path ? '
Nansen said :
` The path does not belong to the perception world , neither does it belong to the nonperception world .
Cognition is a delusion and noncognition is senseless .
If you want to reach the true path beyond doubt , place yourself in the same freedom as sky .
You name it neither good nor not - good . '
At these words Joshu was enlightened .
Hawking says it is time " to boldly go where no man has gone before "
Professor Stephen Hawking has called for a new era of space conquest akin to Christopher Columbus ' discovery of the new world .
In a speech honouring Nasa 's 50th anniversary , the 66 - year - old astrophysicist said the situation we face " is like Europe before 1492 " .
" People might well have argued it was a waste of money to send Columbus on a wild goose chase , " he mused .
" Yet the discovery of the new world made profound difference to the old . "
And then he quipped : " Just think , we would not have a Big Mac or KFC ( Kentucky Fried Chicken ) .
" Spreading out into space will have an even greater effect , " he told an audience assembled at George Washington University , Washington DC .
" It will completely change the future of the human race and maybe determine whether we have any future at all . "
Earth focus Professor Hawking envisions a long - term space exploration project that would include building an experimental base on the Moon within 30 years .
He said scientists must devise a new propulsion system to take us on a planetary hunt outside our Solar System in 200 - 500 years .
If intelligent life is out there , " where are the alien quiz shows " " If the human race is to continue for another million years , we will have to boldly go where no one has gone before , " argued the theoretician , who is known for his works in cosmology and quantum gravity .
" It will not solve any of our immediate problems on planet Earth , but it will give us a new perspective on them and ...
Hopefully , it will unite us to face a common challenge . "
The Oxford - born scientist suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) , a degenerative motor neurone disorder , which has left him almost completely paralysed .
However , a year ago , he was able to get out of his wheelchair and float about in a special plane that simulates the weightless conditions of space .
Rocket ride
He hopes to repeat the experience in space , above the atmosphere , aboard the maiden , suborbital flight of British billionaire Richard Branson 's Virgin Galactic rocket plane .
The vehicle is expected to start commercial flights before the decade 's end .
During his speech in Washington , the Cambridge University professor told his audience that he had been thinking a lot about the cosmic question , " Are we alone ? "
The answer , he concludes , is probably not .
But if there is life elsewhere in the Universe , he asked , why has humanity not stumbled onto some alien broadcasts in space , maybe something like " alien quiz shows ? "
One possible reason is that there is no life elsewhere .
Or maybe there is intelligent life , but when it gets smart enough to send signals into space , it also is smart enough to make destructive nuclear weapons , he said .
But Professor
Hawking prefers a third option : " Primitive life is very common and intelligent life is fairly rare , " he said , before quickly adding : " Some would say it has yet to occur on Earth . "

What are these ?
Stephanie Kwisnek , a spokeswoman for the F.D.A. , said that she did not know the percentage inspected .
But she said the F.D.A. tested 40 samples of the 114,320 net tons of salmon imported from Chile in 2007 .
None of them tested positive for malachite green , oxolinic acid , flumequine , Ivermectin , fluoroquinolones or drug residues , she said .
The F.D.A. is planning an inspection trip to assess Chile ’s overall controls on its farmed salmon , she added .
Mr. Petersen , the managing director of Marine Harvest in Chile , said the company planned to return to the Lakes region in a few years , once the area had become free of contamination .
In the longer term , he said , Marine Harvest will leave Chile ’s fresh - water lakes and produce more older salmon in closed systems where it can maintain “ biological control . ”
Meanwhile , neighboring fishermen who have been affected by the fish - farming industry can only hope for better days .
Mr. Guttierrez , 33 , said that just six years ago he and his fishing partner would haul in 1,100 pounds of robalo on a typical day .
On a recent day he pointed to that morning ’s catch of only 88 pounds in a cooler in the bed of a pickup truck .
He lamented the changes he had observed in the fish : they are rosier than before , and their skin is flabbier .
He said he suspected that the wild fish were eating the same food pellets that the salmon were being fed , which he said were falling to the sea floor .
“ If the water continues to be contaminated , we will simply have to go to another area to find our fish , ” he said .
“ But it is getting harder and harder . ”
Two Israeli fighter aircraft threatened to shoot down a private jet transporting Tony Blair after coming under the misapprehension that the aircraft was staging a potential terrorist attack .
Blair , who has served for 11 months as the Middle East " quartet " envoy , was en route to Israel from a World Economic Forum ( WEF ) meeting at Sharm el Sheikh , in Egypt , on Wednesday morning when the warplanes were scrambled to intercept the jet , according to a report in the Times .
It is understood air traffic controllers noticed what they thought was a suspicious aircraft heading into Israeli airspace from the Sinai peninsula and tried to make contact .
Receiving no response , Israel sent out two fighters which flew above the civilian aircraft to indicate to the pilot he was being considered a suspect target .
It was only after the warplanes were positioned in attack mode that the aircraft 's crew made contact , informing air traffic control that Blair was on the flight .
According to the report in the Times , the former prime minister was unaware of the situation .
" They were unaware of it while they were on the plane , " Ruti Winterstein , a spokeswoman for Mr Blair 's office in Israel , told the paper .
" They did n't hear about it until afterwards , from the media . "
Blair was travelling with other delegates from the WEF , who were among 2,000 people heading for the Palestinian city of Bethlehem to attend a major conference on private investment which was hoping to attract up to £ 1bn for the Palestinian economy .
The Israeli newspaper Maariv reported that initial investigations suggested the communication breakdown was the result of a technical malfunction .
New systems have apparently been set up in the past few months to identify suspicious aircraft and Israeli forces have been on heightened alert for threats after Hamas knocked down a wall on the Egyptian border five months ago .
Attribute to The Libertarian Enterprise
In an official press release dated April 25 , 2008 , two " spokesmen " for the national Libertarian Party which in this case means hired hands , un-elected by anybody surrealistically called for " increased coordination and communication between federal and state law enforcement agencies " in the matter of child pornography .
The document heavily quoted Robert Mueller , current head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
" Libertarians Call for Increased Communication to Combat Child Pornography "
The two culprits in question are Executive Director Shane Cory , and somebody named Andrew Davis , grandiosely titled " National Media Coordinator " .
Both should be out looking for new jobs and other employers to misrepresent and disgrace .
But more on that subject later .
Rumor has it that this was a ploy part of an internal power struggle to damage at least one of the current candidates for the LP presidential nomination .
( Another potential candidate has already sacrificed my possible endorsement by congratulating these two cretins on their press release . )
I believe the idea was that anyone who opposed the issuance of this press release could be denounced as favoring child pornography an idiot 's strategy to influence other idiots .
I have some doubts : this sort of half - witted public relations maneuver has occurred more than once in the party 's shabby internal history , and is perfectly capable of standing on its own , as yet another example of the suit - and - tie clique whose unspoken motto has always been " respectability above everything , especially including principle " looking to suck up to whatever they perceive as the Establishment .
I doubt they 're smart enough to hatch this as a power play .
But let 's get a couple of things straight .
It is undeniably true that any decent human being despises child pornography and all those who produce and distribute it .
After all , it is the job of grownups ( in a Darwinian sense , it is their only job ) to nurture children and protect them from harm , rather than exploit them .
As the father of a daughter for the past 18 years , it 's been my job .
It is a very different thing to hand that job off to a collection of statist bullies who have been assembled without Constitutional authorization their very existence as an organization is a blatant and egregious violation of the law , as well as the Zero Aggression Principle and whose many crimes include the wholesale slaughter of eighty - odd individuals in their home and church near Waco , Texas , in 1993 , including around two dozen innocent , helpless little kids .
This is the way that the FBI " protects " children .
They are unfit even to utter the word " children " , let alone to make any pretense of helping them .
LP founder David Nolan is nobody 's radical something that has been a point of contention between him and me on occasion over the years  but he is a man of unswerving principle , nearly always right in its proper application .
He 's been quoted on sites denouncing the Cory / Davis press release and the kind of thinking it represents .
I first ran across Dave 's statement here , posted by Stephan Kinsella on the splendid The Lew Rockwell Blog as " LP Abandons Libertarianism , Constitution " :
You will also want to see " But What About the Children ? " by Lew himself :
For those who claim to be libertarian to call for greater activity on the part of the FBI in any context except its abolition is not only utterly disgusting to every libertarian of good conscience , it 's exactly like Jews calling on the Gestapo to take care of Jewish children .
There is this consideration , as well : as far back as the 70s , some individuals notably the creators of the BBC science fiction series Blake 's Seven understood perfectly how a totalitarian regime 's false accusation of crimes against children might be used against political dissidents .
It is exactly this filthy tactic that Cory and Davis are encouraging .
And you can see why , for the past 25 years or so , since it was first called into question by creatures like these , I 've maintained that the first priority of any real libertarian is to ensure everybody knows and thoroughly understands that anyone who refuses to take the Zero Aggression Principle seriously , as the central , indispensable tenet of the movementor in the case of the LP , to take the oath of zero aggression should not be regarded as a libertarian at all , but just another thug reserving a right he mistakenly imagines he has to initiate force against his fellow human beings whenever he finds it convenient .
I do n't know enough these days about the internal politics of the national LP to say whether these specimens have anything to do with the vermin who raped the party platform last time around ( in the 70s , the platform called for the abolition of the FBI ) , but they are of exactly the same ilk , not " moderate " libertarians , not " gradualist " libertarians , not even " neo " libertarians , but anti libertarians , whose effect whether they intended it that way or not is the single most destructive force against individual liberty that I know of .
If this was indeed meant to embarrass all those pesky radicals out of the party , then it 's bound to misfire .
The trouble is , by " radical " this collaborationist trash means anyone standing on principle , rather than navigating by perceived political expedience ( which , as I 've demonstrated on numerous occasions , usually proves incorrect in a practical , as well as ethical sense ) .
" Radicals " have been fighting this particular fight ( some of them for half their lives or more ) for better than three decades .
They are hardened to an extent their opponents can't conceive .
If anybody 's going to get embarrassed out of the party , it 's going to be these Vichy Quisling concentration camp trustees .
If they really want to play it this way accusing anyone they dislike of favoring child pornography then let them stand accused in public of ethically signing off on Waco , Ruby Ridge , the FLDS raid , and every other evil , murderous thing the state has ever done to children .
On the other hand , if this sort of ugly struggle is to be avoided , what needs to be done and immediately is for the LP board of directors to hand Cory and Davis their walking papers , and then to publicly retract and apologize for their original anti-libertarian statement .
If the board fails with regard to principle in this affair , they , too , should be replaced , at the upcoming national convention in Denver .
To that end , T HE L IBERTARIAN E NTERPRISE is asking you to join us in rectifying this sorry situation .
We will shortly have an online petition up .
Check back for it , look it over , and add your name to those demanding what 's right .

Reaction to the DEC Spam of 1978 Reaction to the DEC Spam of 1978 Possibly the first spam ever was a message from a DEC marketing rep to every Arpanet address on the west coast , or at least the attempt at that .
If you came first to this page you may first want to check out the history of spam or my reflections on the 25th -- now 30th -- anniversary which contains some notes from my interview with Thuerk , the sender .
Below is the spam itself .
After it you will find a sampling of some of the reaction it generated -- not unlike the reaction to spam today .
Look for the celebrity spam - defender !
( Of course that was decades ago . )
Einar Stefferud , who was one of the recipients of the spam , provides this note of explanation :
It was sent from SNDMSG which had limited space for To and CC and Subject fields .
The poor soul that typed in the announcement , also ( in those days ) had to type in all the addresses , and this person was not trained in the use of SNDMSG .
So , she / he started typing addresses into the Subject which overflowed into the TO header , which overflowed into the CC header , and then into the Body , and then the actual message was finally typed in ;- )...
So , lots of intended recipients did not receive it , including me as I was then STEF@SRI - KA .
Obviously here was no such thing as quality control in play .
Thus it is some kind of classic example of early screw ups ...
But the reaction was the same as today 's reaction to SPAM ... \ Stef
The sender is identified as Gary Thuerk , an aggressive DEC marketer who thought Arpanet users would find it cool that DEC had integrated Arpanet protocol support directly into the new DEC - 20 and TOPS - 20 OS .
I spoke with him to get his reflections on the event .
DEC was mostly an east coast company , and he had lots of contacts on the east coast to push the new Dec - 20 to customers there .
But with less presence on the west coast , he wanted to hold some open houses and reach all the people there .
In those days , there was a printed directory of all people on the Arpanet .
Gary spoke to his technical associate , and arranged to have all the addresses in the directory on the west coast typed in , and then added some customer contacts in other locations , including people at ARPA headquarters who did not , according to Thuerk , complain .
The engineer , Carl Gartley , was an early employee at DEC who had been called in to help with promoting the new Decsystem - 20 .
They worked on the message for a few days , going through a few rewrites .
Finally , on May 3 , Gartley logged on to Gary 's account to send the mail .
As you see below , the mail program would only accept 320 addresses .
The rest overflowed into the body of the message .
When they found some recipients had not gotten it , they re-sent the message to the rest of the recipients .
According to Thuerk , they were unaware of the " address file " function in the mail program that would have enabled a mailing list .
Thuerk thought , and maintains to this day that he did n't think he was doing anything wrong -- even though he gets a moderate amount of spam on his current E-mail account .
He felt the Dec - 20 was really relevant news to the Arpanet community , the first major system with Arpanet software built into it .
Indeed , some of those who commented on the message felt it was definitely more of interest than other small mass mailings they had seen , with baby announcements and personal trivia .
Nonetheless , he knew there would be some negative reaction .
He primed his boss to be ready for complaint , though he did n't anticipate how strong it would be .
The Defense Communications Agency ( DCA ) which ran the Arpanet , called Thuerk 's boss , a former Air Force officer to register a strong complaint .
Amusingly , SpamAssassin scores this as spam .
Partly for being in all upper case , but also because the headers of 1978 are now considered invalid .
One user from the University of Utah complained the spam had shut down his computer system .
Thuerk says only 3 copies were sent to that system , so it was simply an unlucky coincidence that his mailbox disks were very near full when the message arrived .
In those days of 56 kb links , the thousands of copies of this message were not an insignificant load , however .
Some who did n't get the message felt left out , oddly enough , since it became such a topic of conversation .
Thuerk continues his career selling systems today , but his spam career was very short lived .
In many ways , the negative reaction to that spam probably made sure the problem did not arise again for many years .
Here is the message .

I was not going to comment ( and add to the traffic ) on the issue of the DEC message that was sent out , but after having several conversations with people about and around on this issue I think I will add what hopefully will be useful insight to the problem .
NOTE : The comments are my own .
They do not represent any official message from DCA or the NIC .
There are two kinds of message that have been frowned upon on the network .
These are advertising of particular products and advertising for or by job applicants .
I would like to point out that there are good reasons ( other than taking up valuable resources and the fact that some recipients object ) for not permitting these kinds of messages .
There are many companies in the U.S. and abroad that would like to have access to the Arpanet .
Naturally all of them cannot have this access .
Consequently if the ones that do have access can advertise their products to a very select market and the others cannot , this is really an unfair advantage .
Likewise , if job applicants can be selected amongst some of the best trained around , or if the applicants themselves can advertise to a very select group of prospective employers , this is an unfair advantage to other prospective employees or employers who are not on the net .
I have heard some rumblings about ' control ' and ' censorship ' of the net by the powers - that - be , but I feel in these two particular areas they are leaning over backwards to be fair to the big guys and the small guys alike .
In addition , the official message sent out asked us ( ' us ' being network users ) to address the issue ourselves .
I personally think this is reasonable and think we should lend our support or otherwise be saddled with controls that will be a nuisance to everyone involved .

I agree with Jake about suppressing advertising for many of the same reasons as I disagreed with suppressing subjective messages about QUASAR .
The ARPAnet is not , as Jake pointed out , a public resource ; it is available to pretty much a select group of people ( high school kids regardless ! ) .
We are all engaged in activities relating to , or in support of , official US Government business .
ARPAnet mail therefore is more of an " interoffice memo " sort of thing than a trade journal , not intended for public distribution although not " top secret " either .
Even MsgGroup is in this class ; however inappropriate QUASAR is to MsgGroup 's intent ( and it was inappropriate ) I feel that any censorship can only lead to worse things later on .
I am sure that DCA realizes this also ; otherwise the ARPAnet would have been curbed long ago .
Whether or not QUASAR is a fake is a valid topic to be discussed among the computer science community via the ARPAnet ; although it is inappropriate for MsgGroup .
If there is sufficient interest , another group should be created whose purpose and interests embrace this issue .
I do n't see any place for advertising on the ARPAnet , however ; certainly not the bulk advertising of that DEC message .
From the address list , it seems clear to me that the people it was sent to were the Californians listed in the last ARPAnet directory .
This was a clear and flagrant abuse of the directory !
I am not sure as to how far this should be carried though .
I would not mind hearing from DEC about their new products via ARPAnet mail , but I would expect considerably more technical content and considerably less of a sales pitch .
Where is the line to be drawn between this sort of thing ( if it is to be allowed at all ) and advertising ?
Another point Jake mentioned which concerns me is that of employment hunting ( by employee or employer ) .
Is that to be taken to mean that a person cannot establish contacts at another ARPAnet site and poke around about a possible position there ?
Is this really unfair to non-ARPAnet people ?
Allow me to point out that at times a job is created in order to have a particular person on the staff , and if that person is unavailable , the job wo n't exist .
This all seems worthy of examination by the MsgGroup community , as it involves how electronic mail is to be used .
Something else ; I would greatly appreciate it if all comments about this make a distinction between ARPAnet mail and mail on another ( possibly commercial ) network .
Saying that electronic junk mail is a no - no on the ARPAnet does n't answer the question .
I shudder to think about it , but I can envision junk mail being sent to people who implement Dialnet , and no way it could be prevented or stopped .
I guess the ultimate solution is the command in your mail reading subsystem which deletes an unwanted message .

List ; 154 : Redistributed - By : STEFFERUD ( connected to MSGGROUP ) Redistributed - Date : 8 MAY 1978 1 ) I did n't receive the DEC message , but I can't imagine I would have been bothered if I have .
I get tons of uninteresting mail , and system announcements about babies born , etc .
At least a demo MIGHT have been interesting .
2 ) The amount of harm done by any of the cited " unfair " things the net has been used for is clearly very small .
And if they have found any people any jobs , clearly they have done good .
If I had a job to offer , I would offer it to my friends first .
Is this " evil " ?
Must I advertise in a paper in every city in the US with population over 50,000 and then go to all of them to interview , all in the name of fairness ?
Some people , I am afraid , would think so .
Such a great insistence on fairness would destort everyone 's lives and do much more harm than good .
So I state unashamedly that I am in favor of seeing jobs offered via whatever .
3 ) It has just been suggested that we impose someone 's standards on us because otherwise he MIGHT do so .
Well , if you feel that those standards are right and necessary , go right ahead and support them .
But if you disagree with them , as I do , why hand your opponents the victory on a silver platter ?
By the suggested reasoning , we should always follow the political views that we do n't believe in , and especially those of terrorists , in anticipation of their attempts to impose them on us .
If those who think that the job offers are bad are going to try to prevent them , then those of us who think they are unrepugnant should uphold our views .
Besides , I doubt that anyone can successfully force a site from outside to impose censorship , if the people there do n't fundamentally agree with the desirability of it .
4 ) Would a dating service for people on the net be " frowned upon " by DCA ?
I hope not .
But even if it is , do n't let that stop you from notifying me via net mail if you start one .

Google argues that the plummeting click - through rates on its ads are a good thing – but advertisers are n't buying it .
A major change Google made in early March to its AdWords algorithm is resulting in a double whammy for some advertisers :
The rates they 're paying for ads have rocketed while conversion rates for those ads have dropped .
Disgruntled advertisers have dubbed the move the " Google slap . "
" If it were just a rate increase , I would have tolerated it .
But my ad rates have doubled and I 've got no business , " says one longtime AdWords advertiser , " Sam , " who does n't want his real name published for competitive reasons .
He says he runs a very specialized niche service , and does n't want his competitors to know about his current business crisis .
Google has argued that the recent drop in paid clicks on its advertisements is intentional .
The logic is this :
If Google serves fewer but more relevant ads for any given search query , it can potentially increase click - through rates and ultimately raise ad rates .
That should be beneficial for advertisers , who may get fewer but better quality leads from their ads .
The affected advertisers say it is n't working according to plan .
" Sam " says he got about 100,000 impressions on ads served for two keywords in February ( which resulted in $ 250,000 in revenue ) , and in March that number dropped to 20,000 impressions and essentially zero revenue .
To compensate for lost sales , he says he started buying advertising from Yahoo and Microsoft .
It 's not clear exactly how Google altered its algorithm , but many online marketers believe the company adjusted advertisers ' quality scores , based on the content of the landing pages on their websites .
" I 've put a lot of thought into this , and this has been one of the trickiest [ changes ] to understand , " says Amit Mehta , an internet marketing blogger .
" Google is really opposed to these thin affiliate marketing sites that people put up just to run advertising on .
They want to promote real websites or people with real businesses , and they 've gotten really good at sniffing out advertisers who are just there to make a quick buck . "
Mehta says he 's heard from at least one affiliate marketer who was spending $ 600,000 a month on a couple of ad campaigns that were killed by the recent algorithm change .
" [ Google ] is probably tracking factors like , how often the advertiser updates their site .
Are they adding fresh content ?
Are they doing all the things a legitimate business would do ? " Mehta says .
For his part , Sam insists he's not an affiliate marketer and denies that he was hit because he violated Google 's terms of service .
While any sort of change is bound to affect advertisers differently , Jeremy Chatfield , an analyst at Merjis and a web marketing and search - engine optimization consultant , says he 's heard from other advertisers who have seen similar trends .
" I am seeing large - scale advertisers whose general cost per clicks is trending up ... and they 're seeing impressions go down , " Chatfield says .
Have changes at Google had a major impact on your business since early March ?
Let us know in the comments , or drop us a line .

“ Our Nation Is Moving Toward Two Societies , One Black , One White — Separate and Unequal ” : Excerpts from the Kerner Report
President Lyndon Johnson formed an 11 - member National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders in July 1967 to explain the riots that plagued cities each summer since 1964 and to provide recommendations for the future .
The Commission ’s 1968 report , informally known as the Kerner Report , concluded that the nation was “ moving toward two societies , one black , one white — separate and unequal . ”
Unless conditions were remedied , the Commission warned , the country faced a “ system of ’ apartheid ’ ” in its major cities .
The Kerner report delivered an indictment of “ white society ” for isolating and neglecting African Americans and urged legislation to promote racial integration and to enrich slums — primarily through the creation of jobs , job training programs , and decent housing .
President Johnson , however , rejected the recommendations .
In April 1968 , one month after the release of the Kerner report , rioting broke out in more than 100 cities following the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King , Jr . In the following excerpts from the Kerner Report summary , the Commission analyzed patterns in the riots and offered explanations for the disturbances .
In 1998 , 30 years after the issuance of the Report , former Senator and Commission member Fred R. Harris co-authored a study that found the racial divide had grown in the ensuing years with inner-city unemployment at crisis levels .
Opposing voices argued that the Commission ’s prediction of separate societies had failed to materialize due to a marked increase in the number of African Americans living in suburbs .
SUMMARY OF REPORT
INTRODUCTION
The summer of 1967 again brought racial disorders to American cities , and with them shock , fear and bewilderment to the nation .
The worst came during a two - week period in July , first in Newark and then in Detroit .
Each set off a chain reaction in neighboring communities .
On July 28 , 1967 , the President of the United States established this Commission and directed us to answer three basic questions :
What happened ?
Why did it happen ?
What can be done to prevent it from happening again ?
To respond to these questions , we have undertaken a broad range of studies and investigations .
We have visited the riot cities ; we have heard many witnesses ; we have sought the counsel of experts across the country .
This is our basic conclusion :
Our nation is moving toward two societies , one black , one white — separate and unequal .
Reaction to last summer ’s disorders has quickened the movement and deepened the division .
Discrimination and segregation have long permeated much of American life ; they now threaten the future of every American .
This deepening racial division is not inevitable .
The movement apart can be reversed .
Choice is still possible .
Our principal task is to define that choice and to press for a national resolution .
To pursue our present course will involve the continuing polarization of the American community and , ultimately , the destruction of basic democratic values .
The alternative is not blind repression or capitulation to lawlessness .
It is the realization of common opportunities for all within a single society .
This alternative will require a commitment to national action — compassionate , massive and sustained , backed by the resources of the most powerful and the richest nation on this earth .
From every American it will require new attitudes , new understanding , and , above all , new will .
The vital needs of the nation must be met ; hard choices must be made , and , if necessary , new taxes enacted .
Violence cannot build a better society .
Disruption and disorder nourish repression , not justice .
They strike at the freedom of every citizen .
The community cannot — it will not — tolerate coercion and mob rule .
Violence and destruction must be ended — in the streets of the ghetto1 and in the lives of people .
Segregation and poverty have created in the racial ghetto a destructive environment totally unknown to most white Americans .
What white Americans have never fully understood — but what the Negro can never forget — is that white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto .
White institutions created it , white institutions maintain , and white society condones it .
It is time now to turn with all the purpose at our command to the major unfinished business of this nation .
It is time to adopt strategies for action that will produce quick and visible progress .
It is time to make good the promises of American democracy to all citizens — urban and rural , white and black , Spanish - surname , American Indian , and every minority group .
Our recommendations embrace three basic principles :
To mount programs on a scale equal to the dimension of the problems ;
To aim these programs for high impact in the immediate future in order to close the gap between promise and performance ;
To undertake new initiatives and experiments that can change the system of failure and frustration that now dominates the ghetto and weakens our society .
These programs will require unprecedented levels of funding and performance , but they neither probe deeper nor demand more than the problems which called them forth .
There can be no higher priority for national action and no higher claim on the nation ’s conscience .

PART I—WHAT HAPPENED ?
Chapter 1 — Profiles of Disorder
The report contains profiles of a selection of the disorders that took place during the summer of 1967 .
These profiles are designed to indicate how the disorders happened , who participated in them , and how local officials , police forces , and the National Guard responded .
Illustrative excerpts follow :
NEWARK
. . .
On Saturday , July 15 , [ Director of Police Dominick ]
Spina received a report of snipers in a housing project .
When he arrived he saw approximately 100 National Guardsmen and police officers crouching behind vehicles , hiding in corners and lying on the ground around the edge of the courtyard .
Since everything appeared quiet and it was broad daylight , Spina walked directly down the middle of the street .
Nothing happened .
As he came to the last building of the complex , he heard a shot .
All around him the troopers jumped , believing themselves to be under sniper fire .
A moment later a young Guardsman ran from behind a building .
The Director of Police went over and asked him if he had fired the shot .
The soldier said yes , he had fired to scare a man away from a window ; that his orders were to keep everyone away from windows .
Spina said he told the soldier : “ Do you know what you just did ?
You have now created a state of hysteria .
Every Guardsman up and down this street and every state policeman and every city policeman that is present thinks that somebody just fired a shot and that it is probably a sniper . ”
A short time later more “ gunshots ” were heard .
Investigating , Spina came upon a Puerto Rican sitting on a wall .
In reply to a question as to whether he knew “ where the firing is coming from ? ” the man said :
“ That ’s no firing .
That ’s fireworks .
If you look up to the fourth floor , you will see the people who are throwing down these cherry bombs . ”
By this time four truckloads of National Guardsmen had arrived and troopers and policemen were again crouched everywhere looking for a sniper .
The Director of Police remained at the scene for three hours , and the only shot fired was the one by the Guardsmen .
Nevertheless , at six o’clock that evening two columns of National Guardsmen and state troopers were directing mass fire at the Hayes Housing Project in response to what they believed were snipers .
. . .
DETROIT
. . .
A spirit of carefree nihilism was taking hold .
To riot and destroy appeared more and more to become ends in themselves .
Late Sunday afternoon it appeared to one observer that the young people were “ dancing amidst the flames . ”
A Negro plainclothes officer was standing at an intersection when a man threw a Molotov cocktail into a business establishment at the corner .
In the heat of the afternoon , fanned by the 20 to 25 m.p.h. winds of both Sunday and Monday , the fire reached the home next door within minutes .
As residents uselessly sprayed the flames with garden hoses , the fire jumped from roof to roof of adjacent two - and three - story buildings .
Within the hour the entire block was in flames .
The ninth house in the burning row belonged to the arsonist who had thrown the Molotov cocktail .
. . .
* * *
. . .
Employed as a private guard , 55 - year - old Julius L. Dorsey , a Negro , was standing in front of a market when accosted by two Negro men and a woman .
They demanded he permit them to loot the market .
He ignored their demands .
They began to berate him .
He asked a neighbor to call the police .
As the argument grew more heated , Dorsey fired three shots from his pistol into the air .
The police radio reported : “ Looters , they have rifles . ”
A patrol car driven by a police officer and carrying three National Guardsmen arrived .
As the looters fled , the law enforcement personnel opened fire .
When the firing ceased , one person lay dead .
He was Julius L. Dorsey . . .
* * *
. . .
As the riot alternatively waxed and waned , one area of the ghetto remained insulated .
On the northeast side the residents of some 150 square blocks inhabited by 21,000 persons had , in 1966 , banded together in the Positive Neighborhood Action Committee ( PNAC ) .
With professional help from the Institute of Urban Dynamics , they had organized block clubs and made plans for the improvement of the neighborhood .
. . .
When the riot broke out , the residents , through the block clubs , were able to organize quickly .
Youngsters , agreeing to stay in the neighborhood , participated in detouring traffic .
While many persons reportedly sympathized with the idea of a rebellion against the “ system , ” only two small fires were set — one in an empty building .
* * *
. . .
According to Lt. Gen. Throckmorton and Col . Bolling , the city , at this time , was saturated with fear .
The National Guardsmen were afraid , the residents were afraid , and the police were afraid .
Numerous persons , the majority of them Negroes , were being injured by gunshots of undetermined origin .
The general and his staff felt that the major task of the troops was to reduce the fear and restore an air of normalcy .
In order to accomplish this , every effort was made to establish contact and rapport between the troops and the residents .
The soldiers — 20 percent of whom were Negro — began helping to clean up the streets , collect garbage , and trace persons who had disappeared in the confusion .
Residents in the neighborhoods responded with soup and sandwiches for the troops .
In areas where the National Guard tried to establish rapport with the citizens , there was a smaller response .
NEW BRUNSWICK
. . .
A short time later , elements of the crowd — an older and rougher one than the night before — appeared in front of the police station .
The participants wanted to see the mayor .
Mayor [ Patricia ]
Sheehan went out onto the steps of the station .
Using a bullhorn , she talked to the people and asked that she be given an opportunity to correct conditions .
The crowd was boisterous .
Some persons challenged the mayor .
But , finally , the opinion , “ She ’s new !
Give her a chance ! ” prevailed .
A demand was issued by people in the crowd that all persons arrested the previous night be released .
Told that this already had been done , the people were suspicious .
They asked to be allowed to inspect the jail cells .
It was agreed to permit representatives of the people to look in the cells to satisfy themselves that everyone had been released .
The crowd dispersed .
The New Brunswick riot had failed to materialize .
Chapter 2 — Patterns of Disorder
The “ typical ” riot did not take place .
The disorders of 1967 were unusual , irregular , complex and unpredictable social processes .
Like most human events , they did not unfold in an orderly sequence .
However , an analysis of our survey information leads to some conclusions about the riot process .
In general :
The civil disorders of 1967 involved Negroes acting against local symbols of white American society , authority and property in Negro neighborhoods — rather than against white persons .
Of 164 disorders reported during the first nine months of 1967 , eight ( 5 percent ) were major in terms of violence and damage ; 33 ( 20 percent ) were serious but not major ; 123 ( 75 percent ) were minor and undoubtedly would not have received national attention as “ riots ” had the nation not been sensitized by the more serous outbreaks .
In the 75 disorders studied by a Senate subcommittee , 83 deaths were reported .
Eighty - two percent of the deaths and more than half the injuries occurred in Newark and Detroit .
About 10 percent of the dead and 38 percent of the injured were public employees , primarily law officers and firemen .
The overwhelming majority of the persons killed or injured in all the disorders were Negro civilians .
Initial damage estimates were greatly exaggerated .
In Detroit , newspaper damage estimates at first ranged from $ 200 million to $ 500 million ; the highest recent estimate is $ 45 million .
In Newark , early estimates ranged from $ 15 to $ 25 million .
A month later damage was estimated at $ 10.2 million , over 80 percent in inventory losses .
In the 24 disorders in 23 cities which we surveyed :
The final incident before the outbreak of disorder , and the initial violence itself , generally took place in the evening or at night at a place in which it was normal for many people to be on the streets .
Violence usually occurred almost immediately following the occurrence of the final precipitating incident , and then escalated rapidly .
With but few exceptions , violence subsided during the day , and flared rapidly again at night .
The night - day cycles continued through the early period of the major disorders .
Disorder generally began with rock and bottle throwing and window breaking .
Once store windows were broken , looting usually followed .
Disorder did not erupt as a result of a single “ triggering ” or “ precipitating ” incident .
Instead , it was generated out of an increasingly disturbed social atmosphere , in which typically a series of tension - heightening incidents over a period of weeks or months became linked in the minds of many in the Negro community with a reservoir of underlying grievances .
At some point in the mounting tension , a further incident — in itself often routine or trivial — became the breaking point and the tension spilled over into violence .
“ Prior ” incidents , which increased tensions and ultimately led to violence , were police actions in almost half the cases ; police actions were “ final ” incidents before the outbreak of violence in 12 of the 24 surveyed disorders .
No particular control tactic was successful in every situation .
The varied effectiveness of control techniques emphasizes the need for advance training , planning , adequate intelligence systems , and knowledge of the ghetto community .
Negotiations between Negroes — including your militants as well as older Negro leaders — and white officials concerning “ terms of peace ” occurred during virtually all the disorders surveyed .
In many cases , these negotiations involved discussion of underlying grievances as well as the handling of the disorder by control authorities .
The typical rioter was a teenager or young adult , a lifelong resident of the city in which he rioted , a high school dropout ; he was , nevertheless , somewhat better educated than his nonrioting Negro neighbor , and was usually underemployed or employed in a menial job .
He was proud of his race , extremely hostile to both whites and middle - class Negroes and , although informed about politics , highly distrustful of the political system .
A Detroit survey revealed that approximately 11 percent of the total residents of two riot areas admitted participation in the rioting , 20 to 25 percent identified themselves as “ bystanders , ” over 16 percent identified themselves as “ counter - rioters ” who urged rioters to “ cool it , ” and the remaining 48 to 53 percent said they were at home or elsewhere and did not participate .
In a survey of Negro males between the ages of 15 and 35 residing in the disturbance area in Newark , about 45 percent identified themselves as rioters , and about 55 percent as “ noninvolved . ”
Most rioters were young Negro males .
Nearly 53 percent of arrestees were between 15 and 24 years of age ; nearly 81 percent between 15 and 35 .
In Detroit and Newark about 74 percent of the rioters were brought up in the North .
In contrast , of the noninvolved , 36 percent in Detroit and 52 percent in Newark were brought up in the North .
What the rioters appeared to be seeking was fuller participation in the social order and the material benefits enjoyed by the majority of American citizens .
Rather than rejecting the American system , they were anxious to obtain a place for themselves in it .
Numerous Negro counter - rioters walked the streets urging rioters to “ cool it . ”
The typical counter - rioter was better educated and had higher income than either the rioter or the noninvolved .
The proportion of Negroes in local government was substantially smaller than the Negro proportion of population .
Only three of the 20 cities studied had more than one Negro legislator ; none had ever had a Negro mayor or city manager .
In only four cities did Negroes hold other important policy - making positions or serve as heads of municipal departments .
Although almost all cities had some sort of formal grievance mechanism for handling citizen complaints , this typically was regarded by Negroes as ineffective and was generally ignored .
Although specific grievances varied from city to city , at least 12 deeply held grievances can be identified and ranked into three levels of relative intensity :
First Level of Intensity
1. Police practices
2. Unemployment and underemployment
3. Inadequate housing
Second Level of Intensity
4. Inadequate education
5 . Poor recreation facilities and programs
6. Ineffectiveness of the political structure and grievance mechanisms .
Third Level of Intensity
7. Disrespectful white attitudes
8. Discriminatory administration of justice
9 . Inadequacy of federal programs
10 . Inadequacy of municipal services
11 . Discriminatory consumer and credit practices
12 . Inadequate welfare programs
The results of a three - city survey of various federal programs — manpower , education , housing , welfare and community action — indicate that , despite substantial expenditures , the number of persons assisted constituted only a fraction of those in need .
The background of disorder is often as complex and difficult to analyze as the disorder itself .
But we find that certain general conclusions can be drawn :
Social and economic conditions in the riot cities constituted a clear pattern of severe disadvantage for Negroes compared with whites , whether the Negroes lived in the area where the riot took place or outside it .
Negroes had completed fewer years of education and fewer had attended high school .
Negroes were twice as likely to be unemployed and three times as likely to be in unskilled and service jobs .
Negroes averaged 70 percent of the income earned by whites and were more than twice as likely to be living in poverty .
Although housing cost Negroes relatively more , they had worse housing — three times as likely to be overcrowded and substandard .
When compared to white suburbs , the relative disadvantage is even more pronounced .
A study of the aftermath of disorder leads to disturbing conclusions .
We find that , despite the institution of some post - riot programs :
Little basic change in the conditions underlying the outbreak of disorder has taken place .
Actions to ameliorate Negro grievances have been limited and sporadic ; with but few exceptions , they have not significantly reduced tensions .
In several cities , the principal official response has been to train and equip the police with more sophisticated weapons .
In several cities , increasing polarization is evident , with continuing breakdown of inter-racial communication , and growth of white segregationist or black separatist groups .
. . .
PART II — WHY DID IT HAPPEN ?
Chapter 4 — The Basic Causes
In addressing the question “ Why did it happen ? ” we shift our focus from the local to the national scene , from the particular events of the summer of 1967 to the factors within the society at large that created a mood of violence among many urban Negroes .
These factors are complex and interacting ; they vary significantly in their effect from city to city and from year to year ; and the consequences of one disorder , generating new grievances and new demands , become the causes of the next .
Thus was created the “ thicket of tension , conflicting evidence and extreme opinions ” cited by the President .
Despite these complexities , certain fundamental matters are clear .
Of these , the most fundamental is the racial attitude and behavior of white Americans toward black Americans .
Race prejudice has shaped our history decisively ; it now threatens to affect our future .
White racism is essentially responsible for the explosive mixture which has been accumulating in our cities since the end of World War II .
Among the ingredients of this mixture are :
Pervasive discrimination and segregation in employment , education and housing , which have resulted in the continuing exclusion of great numbers of Negroes from the benefits of economic progress .
Black in -migration and white exodus , which have produced the massive and growing concentrations of impoverished Negroes in our major cities , creating a growing crisis of deteriorating facilities and services and unmet human needs .
The black ghettos where segregation and poverty converge on the young to destroy opportunity and enforce failure .
Crime , drug addiction , dependency on welfare , and bitterness and resentment against society in general and white society in particular are the result .
At the same time , most whites and some Negroes outside the ghetto have prospered to a degree unparalleled in the history of civilization .
Through television and other media , this affluence has been flaunted before the eyes of the Negro poor and the jobless ghetto youth .
Yet these facts alone cannot be said to have caused the disorders .
Recently , other powerful ingredients have begun to catalyze the mixture :
Frustrated hopes are the residue of the unfulfilled expectations aroused by the great judicial and legislative victories of the Civil Rights Movement and the dramatic struggle for equal rights in the South .
A climate that tends toward approval and encouragement of violence as a form of protest has been created by white terrorism directed against nonviolent protest ; by the open defiance of law and federal authority by state and local officials resisting desegregation ; and by some protest groups engaging in civil disobedience who turn their backs on nonviolence , go beyond the constitutionally protected rights of petition and free assembly , and resort to violence to attempt to compel alteration of laws and policies with which they disagree .
The frustrations of powerlessness have led some Negroes to the conviction that there is no effective alternative to violence as a means of achieving redress of grievances , and of “ moving the system . ”
These frustrations are reflected in alienation and hostility toward the institutions of law and government and the white society which controls them , and in the reach toward racial consciousness and solidarity reflected in the slogan “ Black Power . ”
A new mood has sprung up among Negroes , particularly among the young , in which self - esteem and enhanced racial pride are replacing apathy and submission to “ the system . ”
The police are not merely a “ spark ” factor .
To some Negroes police have come to symbolize white power , white racism and white repression .
And the fact is that many police do reflect and express these white attitudes .
The atmosphere of hostility and cynicism is reinforced by a widespread belief among Negroes in the existence of police brutality and in a “ double standard ” of justice and protection — one for Negroes and one for whites .
To this point , we have attempted to identify the prime components of the “ explosive mixture . ”
In the chapters that follow we seek to analyze them in the perspective of history .
Their meaning , however , is clear :
In the summer of 1967 , we have seen in our cities a chain reaction of racial violence .
If we are heedless , none of us shall escape the consequences .

The term “ ghetto ” as used in this report refers to an area within a city characterized by poverty and acute social disorganization , and inhabited by members of a racial or ethnic group under conditions of involuntary segregation .

PYAPON , Myanmar 
The roads of the ravaged Irrawaddy Delta are lined these days with people hoping to be fed .
After lifetimes living off the land , poor farmers have abandoned their ruined rice paddies , setting up makeshift bamboo shelters , waiting for carloads of Burmese civilians who have taken it on themselves to feed those who lost everything to Cyclone Nargis .
Few of those who wait say they have received anything from the government , other than threats .
“ They said if we do n’t break our huts and disappear , they will shoot us , ” one man in the village of Thee Kone said over the weekend before a police jeep approached .
“ But as you can see , it ’s raining now .
We are pleading to the police to give us one more day and we will be gone far , far from the road , as they wish . ”
A red sign on a stake along one road read : “ Do n’t throw food on the roads .
It ruins the people ’s good habits . ”

Once considered a barren plain dotted with hydrothermal vents , the seafloor 's rocky regions appear to be teeming with microbial life , say scientists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ( WHOI ) in Woods Hole , Mass. , University of Southern California ( USC ) in Los Angeles , and other institutions .
On the deep ocean floor , microbial life is feeding on fresh volcanic rock and flourishing with greater abundance than even the most optimistic scientists thought possible .
Scientists have found bacteria growing on oceanic crust in concentrations that are thousands - to ten - thousand times ( three to four orders of magnitude ) greater than what is found in the overlying waters .
Researchers from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ( WHOI ) , the University of Southern California ( USC ) , and four other institutions collected and examined rock and water samples from the East Pacific Rise , the Nankai Trough , the Mid-Atlantic Ridge , the Sargasso Sea , and the seafloor near Hawaii .
They used various molecular and genetic analysis tools ( such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction and clone libraries ) to quantify the abundance , richness , and diversity of communities of bacteria living on young ocean crust .
Bacteria form large undersea mats in some areas of the ocean 's deepest realms .
Credit : Ridge2000 / National Science Foundation
What they found was a community of microbes — growing without light and eating rocks — that is as fertile and prodigious as what can be found in terrestrial farm soil .
Such seafloor microbes have been detected before , but this is the first time that they have been quantified .
“ We were truly shocked to find microbial life thriving at the levels we observed , ” said Cara Santelli , a recent graduate of the MIT / WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography and now a postdoctoral scholar at Harvard University .
Santelli conducted the research with geochemists Katrina Edwards and Wolfgang Bach while all three were in Woods Hole .
Edwards is now at USC , while Bach has moved to the University of Bremen .
“ Theoretical research by Edwards and Bach had suggested that life could exist in such a dark , cold , and rocky environment , ” said Santelli , lead author on the Nature paper .
“ The objective of our project was to provide tangible evidence .
Not only was the biomass in seafloor lava greater than in the overlying seawater , but the bacterial diversity was significantly greater than we could have imagined . ”
Biologist Katrina Edwards discusses her research on seafloor bacteria on ocean - bottom rocks .
The findings open up new questions about the evolution of Earth and of seafloor life .
With evidence that the oceanic crust supports more bacteria than overlying water , the scientists hypothesized that reactions with the rocks themselves might offer fuel for life .
“ We are just beginning to scratch the surface , ” Santelli said .
“ What role does this microbial community play in global ocean chemistry ?
What sort of metabolism is needed to live in and dominate this environment ?
And what exactly are these microbes doing down there ? ”
This discovery lends support to the idea that bacteria survive on energy from Earth 's crust , a process that could add to our knowledge about the deep - sea carbon cycle and the evolution of life .
Many scientists believe that shallow water , not deep water , is better suited for cradling the planet 's first life forms .
Up until now , dark , carbon - poor ocean depths appeared to offer little energy , and rich environments like hydrothermal vents were thought to be relatively sparse .
But the newfound abundance of seafloor microbes makes it possible that early life thrived -- and perhaps began -- on the seafloor .
The research by Santelli and Edwards , et al , was funded by the National Science Foundation ’s Ridge 2000 program , the NASA Astrobiology Institute , and Western Washington University .

I was so excited to see the electricity bill in the mailbox the other day .
I promptly reached for it as if someone would sneak up from behind and snatch it away from me .
You might be thinking it must either be the heat in Singapore that was getting into me or that I was going crazy ; who in the world would be excited to get an electricity bill in the mailbox .
On the contrary , it was neither the heat nor that I was going crazy .
I was conducting an experiment and this was the second months of the experiment .
Even before I could get into the elevator , I was already anxiously opening up the bill .
On the first look , everything seem normal .
However , when I turned the bill over to look at the other side , I was all excited again .
A scanned copy of part of the electricity bill said it all .
Referring to the bar graphs below , I had saved another 25 Kilowatts or approximately 27.5 pounds of coal ( amount of coal needed to generate 25 Kilowatts of electricity ) from February to April .
According to
Wikipedia
Now for the grand result for the two months the experiment was ran , I had saved a total of 63 Kilowatts of electricity in the two months or up to 21 % of electricity .
You may be saying , " What is the big deal ?
It is only 63 Kilowatts . "
A baby step to a healthier planet .
According to the Department of Statistic of Singapore , there were a total of 923,300 resident households in Singapore in 2000 .
Imagine if every household can save the same amount of electricity ( and even better if they can save more ) every month , we can save up to 23 million Kilowatts of electricity every month ( hope I gotten the Math correct ) .
That would not look like a small deal anymore right ? , the USA consumes about 1.053 billion tonnes of coal each year , using 90 % of it for generation of electricity .
The world in total produced 6.19 billion tonnes of coal in 2006 .
Now for the grand result for the two months the experiment was ran , I had saved a total of 63 Kilowatts of electricity in the two months or up to 21 % of electricity .
You may be saying , " What is the big deal ?
It is only 63 Kilowatts . "
A baby step to a healthier planet .
According to the Department of Statistic of Singapore , there were a total of 923,300 resident households in Singapore in 2000 .
Imagine if every household can save the same amount of electricity ( and even better if they can save more ) every month , we can save up to ( hope I gotten the Math correct ) .
That would not look like a small deal anymore right ?
Lets take a look at how can we achieve that baby step toward a healthier planet .
It takes less than 5 minutes to do it - that is to turn off any unused appliances at the socket and not just to put it in a standby mode .
Yes , saving electricity can be that simple and straightforward .
The first time I read an article about this , I was very doubtful and thus I decided to experiment it in my home .
I was amazed of the result too .
Putting unused appliances to standby mode still uses lots of energy .
We can save this energy by turning off televisions and other items when they 're not in use .
That includes your computer 's monitor as well .
Screen savers only stop the screen from getting burned in images .
Energy saving mode cuts power usage but nowhere near as much as the on / off switch does .
Some of you may be saying , " It 'll be so inconvenient to turn off the switch ; keeping any unused appliances in the standby mode mean I can switch it on immediately using the remote .
I do n't have to move ' half way across planet home ' to turn the switch on .
I had the same thinking initially too .
However , it was not a challenge for me to change .
By moving around the house to turn the switch on , I become more active and I treat it as an exercise .
And the ultimate motivation comes from doing my bit for planet Earth , as well as saving my electricity bill up to 20 % every month .
Just that one baby step , it can create a big different .
Lets us all do our bit for our planet Earth .
Wishing you goodness in all areas of your life .

In a paper published in Geophysical Journal International , Dr Graeme Eagles from the Earth Sciences Department at Royal Holloway , University of London , reveals how one of the largest continents ever to exist met its demise .
Gondwana was a ‘ supercontinent ’ that existed between 500 and 180 million years ago .
For the past four decades , geologists have debated how Gondwana eventually broke up , developing a multitude of scenarios which can be loosely grouped into two schools of thought – one theory claiming the continent separated into many small plates , and a second theory claiming it broke into just a few large pieces .
Dr Eagles , working with Dr Matthais König from the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven , Germany , has devised a new computer model showing that the supercontinent cracked into two pieces , too heavy to hold itself together .
Gondwana comprised of most of the landmasses in today ’s Southern Hemisphere , including Antarctica , South America , Africa , Madagascar , Australia - New Guinea , and New Zealand , as well as Arabia and the Indian subcontinent of the Northern Hemisphere .
Between around 250 and 180 million years ago , it formed part of the single supercontinent ‘ Pangea ’ .
Evidence suggests that Gondwana began to break up at around 183 million years ago .
Analysing magnetic and gravity anomaly data from some of Gondwana ’s first cracking points – fracture zones in the Mozambique Basin and the Riiser - Larsen Sea off Antarctica – Dr Eagles and Dr König reconstructed the paths that each part of Gondwana took as it broke apart .
The computer model reveals that the supercontinent divided into just two large , eastern and western plates .
Approximately 30 million years later , these two plates started to split to form the familiar continents of today ’s Southern Hemisphere .
‘ You could say that the process is ongoing as Africa is currently splitting in two along the East African Rift , ’ says Dr Eagles .
‘ The previously held view of Gondwana initially breaking up into many different pieces was unnecessarily complicated .
It gave fuel to the theory that a plume of hot mantle , about 2,000 to 3,000 kilometres wide , began the splitting process .
A straight forward split takes the spotlight off plumes as active agents in the supercontinent ’s breakup , because the small number of plates involved resembles the pattern of plate tectonics in the rest of Earth ’s history during which plumes have played bit parts . ’
According to Dr Eagles and Dr König ’s study , because supercontinents like Gondwana are gravitationally unstable to begin with , and have very thick crusts in comparison to oceans , they eventually start to collapse under their own weight .
Says Dr Eagles ,
‘ These findings are a starting point from which more accurate and careful research can be made on the supercontinent .
The new model challenges the positions of India and Sri Lanka in Gondwana which have been widely used for the past 40 years , assigning them very different positions in the supercontinent .
These differences have major consequences for our understanding of Earth . ’
Picture of the world 's smallest diamond ring , measuring 300 nanometers ( billionths of a meter ) thick and 5 microns ( millionths of a meter ) across .
The ring was made by carving out a circular structure in an artifically made diamond .
Scientists have created the world 's smallest diamond ring .
At only 5 microns ( or millionths of a meter ) in diameter and 300 nanometers ( or billionths of a meter ) in thickness , this rock wo n't get any ' oohs ' or ' ahhs ' from admiring friends .
But it can help scientists who are developing quantum information processing :
The ring is a component in a device for producing and detecting single photons , or particles of light .
Set in different states , photons can carry information .
In ordinary digital computers , information is stored in bits , which can have a value of either " 1 " or " 0 " ( just as a light switch can only be " on " or " off " ) .
The order of 1's and 0's indicates a certain piece of information .
But these photons , called qubits , can hold a value of 1 and 0 at the same time , which could expand the possibilities for information storage .
The new development , announced at the March meeting of the American Physical Society in New Orleans , was made by scientists at the University of Melbourne in Australia .
Yes , you read it right .
The Drug Enforcement Agency can teach you several aspects about marketing which can increase your sales overnight .
No , I am not on crack as I write this .
Recently , one lazy Sunday afternoon , I was lying on the couch watching the D.E.A. reality TV show .
As the D.E.A. officers do their stakeouts and drug busts . . . to my amazement I witnessed first hand several critical marketing strategies being applied once the drug busts were made .
These same critical marketing strategies are the sames ones at least 99.77 % of you are either too darn lazy to apply at all or apply correctly and you are leaving money on the table .
As the drug busts were made and the criminal arrested , a stressful and life threatening time for all concerned . . . the head D.E.A .
Officer went from gun toting police officer to direct response marketer with ease .
Knowing they are running against the clock , he started to apply an irresistible offer to the stressed out , shaking female criminal . . . who had been caught with enough ‘ crack ’ to get 25 years in jail .
She was so nervous , it would n’t have surprised me if she wet and soiled her pants .
As in all drug busts , the D.E.A. want their supplier , someone higher up in the drug world , a bigger bust .
He offered to the criminal , to wipe her slate clean as long as she hands over the D.E.A. her supplier and then does a take - away sell on her , giving her just minutes to make a decision in her frazzled state of mind .
She can say ‘ no ’and get 25 years in prison or ‘ set up ’ her supplier and walk away free , no doubt under witness protection .
On this occasion , she said yes .
This answer , puts even more pressure on her and the D.E.A. as they need to get her to set up and get to the sting with the next supplier before word gets out on the streets . . . ‘ she ’ has been busted otherwise it turns into a blood bath with deadly results .
Within minutes of saying yes , the detained criminal must gain her composure enough to set up her ‘ sting ’ by calling her supplier .
Any changer in her normal behavior will tip him off and she faces 25 years in the slammer .
The sting was done , the next crack dealer arrested and then the D.E.A. officers again go into Direct Marketing mode to arrest someone bigger again in the drug chain .
I saw this work 3 out of 4 times and the execution was brilliant .
Okay . . . you say , what the heck does this have to do with you ?
One answer .
Everything !
Yes , if you are not applying an offer based on emotion , a correct profile of your ideal customer and when you do not apply it correctly , with the right amount of take - away selling ( or your close ) . . . you are losing sales – period .
These types of marketing strategies have been in use for centuries , worked then , work now and will still apply when both you and I are pushing up daisies .
Too many times when I review and critique sales copy for websites or off - line sales letter , these major areas are more lame than a one legged duck swimming in a crocodile infested creek . . . are clearly not thought out and almost an after thought .
When I am hired to create persuasive writing for clients , in 95 % of cases , they do not even know who they are truly trying to offer their products and services to .
Sure they ASSUME and we all know what it means , making an ass out of you and me .
Over the last week I have been doing FREE 20 minute , one on one mentoring sessions with my clients who were smart enough to take me up on the limited offer .
There were 100 available back then .
When you are serious about your success , claim one of the remaining FREE 20 minute sessions with me .

PS .
Too many people think their niche is too bloody special for these proven strategies to work and it ’s plain B.S.
When it works very well for the D.E.A. on a bunch of crack heads – then it ’s good enough for you to .
PPS .
Over the next 2 weeks I plant to do 100 FREE 20 minute mentoring and coaching sessions .
These will be done in the order I receive them .

Palm oil is one of the biofuel crops stirring controversy
The UN's new top adviser on food has urged a freeze on biofuel investment , saying the blind pursuit of the policy is " irresponsible " .
Olivier de Schutter also wants curbs on investors whose speculation is , he says , driving food prices higher .
UN officials liken the rise in food prices to a silent tsunami , threatening 100 million of the world 's poorest .
The use of food crops for alternative sources of energy like ethanol is one factor behind the price hike .
Mr de Schutter did not go quite as far as his predecessor in the job , Jean Ziegler , the BBC's Laura Trevelyan reports from New York .
Mr Ziegler had condemned biofuels as a " crime against humanity " and called for an immediate ban on their use .
' Predictable ' crisis
But the new special rapporteur on the right to food did insist the American and European goals for biofuel production were unrealistic .
I am calling for a freeze on all investment in this sector
Olivier de Schutter
UN special rapporteur on the right to food
" The ambitious goals for biofuel production set by the United States and the European Union are irresponsible , " he said in an interview for France 's Le Monde newspaper .
" I am calling for a freeze on all investment in this sector . "
The biofuel rush was , he argued , a " scandal that only serves the interests of a tiny lobby " .
Calling for a special session of the UN Human Rights Council to discuss the food crisis , Mr de Schutter also said he wanted to find ways to limit the impact of speculative investments in food commodities like wheat , which had further driven up prices .
And the rapporteur , a Belgian professor of international law , said it was " unforgivable " that the international community had failed to anticipate the riots sparked last month by soaring food prices .
" Nothing was done to prevent speculation in raw materials , though it was predictable investors would turn to these markets following the stock market slowdown , " the UN official said .
" We are paying for 20 years of mistakes . "
Many of today ’s cell phones can be used as bugs , invading your privacy .
The reasons for this can range from snooping and practical jokes to industrial and political espionage .
This is usually accomplished in one of two ways :
Phones can be set to ‘ silent ring ’ and ‘ auto answer ’ , and hidden in some specific location .
Later , the perpetrator simply calls the hidden phone , which turns into an instant transmitter .
Phones ’ embedded programming can be altered to turn them into receivers – effectively turning your own phone into a bug so that someone else can listen in on your conversations .
This is theoretical today – I do not believe this has ever actually been done .
But as cell phones become “ smarter ” ( more like tiny Windows systems than phones ) , sooner or later the writers of malicious code may figure out a way to produce a cell phone “ virus ” that will turn a phone into an illicit transmitter in order to eavesdrop on people .
This video , while somewhat humorous , makes a good point .

This is yet another example of technology with unintended consequences that is subject to abuse .
More here .
General Motors says it 's nailed the lithium - ion battery technology at the heart of the Chevrolet Volt and is consistently achieving a range of 40 miles in road tests , thereby clearing a big hurdle to getting the car built by 2010 .
Company Vice Chairman Bob Lutz says GM is road - testing the gas-electric hybrid drivetrain at its Milford Proving Grounds and " it is reliably meeting its objectives . "
That 's a key milestone because sorting out the batteries has long been considered the biggest obstacle to meeting GM 's aggressive time line for producing the car .
Maximum Bob is so confident with the status of the battery development that he told Auto Observer , " I can almost say the battery is the least of our problems . "
So it 's clear sailing from here , right ?
Not quite .
Lutz says the next challenge is smoothly integrating the battery drivetrain and the gasoline engine .
Unlike a conventional hybrid like the Toyota Prius , which uses a gasoline engine to drive the wheels , the Volt will be driven entirely by electricity .
The engine will drive a generator that will charge the batteries .
According to Auto Observer , GM 's engineers are answering such questions as : " When does the engine cut in ?
How long does it stay on ?
How will it deal with extreme cold , when the engine will have to warm up the battery ?
Lutz says answering these questions requires " reams and reams of software " and is key to reaching GM 's goal of building an electric vehicle with a range of 640 miles .
With the batteries performing as expected and the drivetrain being sorted out in a test vehicle – a 2003 Chevrolet Malibu – Lutz says General Motors is increasingly confident it'll have the Volt in showrooms by the end of 2010 .
" November 2010 looks good , " he says .

Three of them :
In Seattle , a fifty - six - year old man died last Thursday after being refused a liver transplant because he had followed his doctor ’s recommendation to use marijuana to ease the symptoms of hepatitis C. From the Associated Press story :
His death came a week after a doctor told him a University of Washington Medical Center committee had again denied him a spot on the liver transplant list .
The team had previously told him it would not consider placing him on the list until he completed a 60 - day drug - treatment class …
The Virginia - based United Network for Organ Sharing , which oversees the nation ’s transplant system , leaves it to individual hospitals to develop criteria for transplant candidates .
At some , people who use “ illicit substances ” — including medical marijuana , even in the dozen states that allow it — are automatically rejected .
At others , patients are given a chance to reapply if they stay clean for six months .
The cruelty and stupidity of this beggars belief .
This patient did not need “ drug treatment . ”
He was already undergoing drug treatment .
Nor did he need to get “ clean . ”
He was already clean .
It ’s the drug war that ’s dirty .

Until about a week ago , Marie Day Walsh was a hyper - respectable fifty - three - year - old housewife living in suburban comfort in Del Mar , California , near San Diego , with her husband of twenty - three years .
They have two grown daughters and another still in high school .
Then came a knock on the door .
She was arrested and carted off to jail .
The back story :
In 1975 , when she was a nineteen - year - old hippie in Saginaw , Michigan , and her name was Susan LeFevre , she got arrested for peripheral involvement in a heroin deal .
While awaiting trial , she took college courses .
Hoping for mercy , she pleaded guilty .
The judge , full of righteous wrath , sentenced her to ten to twenty years in prison .
After a year or so , she walked away from a prison work site , escaping as she had offended : nonviolently .
She had never been in trouble before and has never been in trouble since .
Now she will probably be extradited to Michigan and imprisoned until she is in her sixties .
Take a look at her and see if you think she is a menace to society .
Two years ago , a large - scale study by Dr. Donald Tashkin , of U.C.L.A. , a pulmonologist whose previous studies of marijuana had been used by drug - enforcement authorities to support their view that pot is dangerous , unexpectedly concluded that there is no connection between marijuana smoking and lung cancer , even among heavy pot smokers , which he defined as people who had smoked more than twenty - two thousand joints , i.e. , a joint a day for sixty years .
The study , which was funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse , further suggested that pot might actually have some preventive effect .
The story did n’t get a lot of publicity , though the Washington Post did run a story on page A3 .
It will not surprise you to learn that it has had no effect on the nation ’s drug “ policies . ”
Dr. Tashkin reiterated his findings last month before an audience of doctors and nurses .
According to Fred Gardner ’s detailed report ,
Tashkin and his colleagues at U.C.L.A. conducted a major study in which they measured the lung function of various cohorts for eight years and found that tobacco - only smokers had an accelerated rate of decline , but marijuana smokers — even if they smoked tobacco as well — experienced the same rate of decline as non-smokers .
“ The more tobacco smoked , the greater the rate of decline , ” said Tashkin .
“ In contrast , no matter how much marijuana was smoked , the rate of decline was similar to normal . ”
Tashkin concluded that his and other studies “ do not support the concept that regular smoking of marijuana leads to COPD [ Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ] . ”
On the other hand , imprisonment , disqualification for organ transplants , and the activities of the federal drug harassment industry remain hazardous to your health .
There ’s the Hollywood sign everyone knows -- white letters 50 feet high , recognized the world over as the landmark of Tinseltown .
And then there ’s the other Hollywood sign , the hidden one , whose red neon letters were once as familiar as the larger sign just across the canyon .
FOR THE RECORD :
Hidden Sign : The L.A. Then & Now column in the Feb. 17 California section said Gen. Harrison Gray Otis was The Times ’ first publisher .
Nathan Cole Jr. and Thomas Gardiner were the first publishers of the paper , in 1881 .
Also , the column identified Jesse Lasky as a movie director .
He was a producer . —
The sign that read “ Outpost ” in neon letters 30 feet high was , like the original “ Hollywoodland ” sign , raised up to publicize a new housing development , Hillside Homes of Happiness .
It went up on the hilly terrain above Hollywood Boulevard ’s Grauman ’s Chinese Theatre in the late 1920s , designed to outshine the “ Hollywoodland ” competition .
But by the beginning of World War II , it had vanished from sight and memory -- until the winter of 2002 .
That ’s when Outpost Estates residents and Runyon Canyon hikers Bob Eicholz and Steve Scott discovered the twisted wreckage of the rust - scarred steel letters and girders , covered by overgrown brush , and recognized it for what it was .
It was like archaeology come to life .
“ We walked past the pile of steel every weekend , and all of a sudden a light bulb went off in my head , ” Eicholz said in a recent interview .
“ I had heard of the Outpost sign , which according to folklore was one of the biggest neon signs in the world , and finally put two and two together , feeling like we had uncovered a secret . ”
Some residents tried to find out whether the sign could qualify as a city historical - cultural monument but learned it was n’t eligible because it was no longer standing .
So it lies where Eicholz and Scott found it .
Outpost Estates is a pristine hillside community of roughly 450 homes .
There were buildings on the land as far back as 1853 , when Don Tomas Urquidez built Hollywood ’s first adobe
“ His house was smack dab in the middle of a sycamore grove near what is now Outpost Drive and Hillside Avenue , ” Scott said .
Urquidez ’s three - room adobe and the land , a former Indian burial ground , was the original birthplace of Hollywood as a performers ’ town , where , more than 130 years ago , locals annually staged Los Pastores , or The Shepherds , a Mexican Nativity play .
One of the now long - gone sycamore trees played a role in history here , too -- from its branches , at least 13 alleged horse thieves and bandits were hanged in acts of rough justice , according to Times archives .
Like many Spanish and Mexican landowners here , Urquidez failed to record his property title , and the land passed through a succession of owners .
In the late 19th century , Gen. Harrison Gray Otis , a veteran of the Civil and Spanish - American wars and the first publisher of the Los Angeles Times , bought the otherwise undeveloped property and referred to the adobe as his retreat -- the Outpost .
The Times building he called his Fortress , his staff the Phalanx , and his Wilshire Boulevard home the Bivouac .
He soon built a more modern vacation home and clubhouse near the adobe as a retreat for his military friends and nature lovers .
Los Angeles Arbor Day festivals and picnics for newsboys were held on the site .
Otis often boasted that the adobe was where the Treaty of Cahuenga was signed between Lt. Col.
John C. Fremont and Gen. Andres Pico in 1847 , ending hostilities in California between Mexico and the United States , and leading the way to California statehood .
But in 1917 , a few weeks before Otis died , The Times printed a correction to many earlier stories that had made that claim , saying the statement was not “ strictly accurate historically . ”
The Articles of Capitulation , which led to the cease - fire known as the Campo de Cahuenga Treaty , were signed in a farmhouse adobe at the foot of Cahuenga Pass , near what is now Universal City .
A replica of the old adobe is now a city historical - cultural monument and a California historical landmark .
The Roaring 1920s were in full swing when Hollywood director Jesse Lasky bought as much as a dozen acres of Otis ’ property for $ 157,000 -- land and both houses .
But he never did anything with it .
Flipping the property in 1924 , he sold it to Hollywood real estate mogul Charles E. Toberman , a nephew of former Los Angeles mayor James Toberman , who envisioned “ one of the most exclusive and beautiful parks in the world , ” according to The Times .
Toberman kept the Outpost nickname on the land bordered by Mulholland Drive to the north , Franklin Canyon to the south , Runyon Canyon to the west and Cahuenga Boulevard to the east .
He tore down the adobe and Otis’ retreat .
Neon was still a novelty when he put up the “ Outpost ” sign about 1927 to attract buyers to the lots .
They were small to two - acre estates and sold from $ 3,500 to $ 50,000 ; Toberman allowed only grand Spanish - style homes with tile roofs , a protection from raging brush fires .
Despite the 1929 stock market crash that ushered in the Great Depression , clients continued to build 5,000 - to 10,000 - square - foot homes with courtyards and fountains , terraced gardens , elaborate tile work and beamed ceilings .
By 1931 , actress Dolores Del Rio had built a house on the northwest corner of Hillside Avenue and Outpost Drive and had chopped down the hanging tree .
In 1935 , Toberman shifted styles but not neighborhoods .
He built an all - steel “ termite free ” house on a two - acre wooded estate on Outpost Drive .
Actor Bela Lugosi , of the archetypal film “ Dracula , ” bought the home in 1936 , five years after his vampire movie .
With the outbreak of World War II , the neon sign became a problem at a time when lights were routinely extinguished and windows covered for fear of attracting enemy bombers .
The sign was dismantled , left where it had stood and remained forgotten for decades .
The sign was history when future TV game host Bob Barker and his wife , Dorothy Jo , arrived in Los Angeles .
“ That was in 1950 , ” Barker said in a recent interview .
“ We stopped our car near Western and Los Feliz , looking out over the smog , ” he said , “ and my wife asked , ‘ Barker , what have you gotten me into ? ’ ”
“ She learned to cope , ” Barker said .
Then , two decades later and a few miles away , the Barkers bought a 40 - year - old Spanish Colonial Revival house , built on the site of that original adobe on the southwest corner of Hillside and Outpost .
“ My wife loved this house , and when she was terminally ill she said she hoped it would n’t become an apartment house . ”
In 1999 , Barker , who still lives in the house , got the site declared a city historical - cultural monument because it had once held Hollywood ’s first adobe .
“ It ’s on the regular tour bus schedule , ” Barker said , “ and I wave at the tourists all the time . ”

Struggling painters must suffer for their art , slumming it in filthy digs and eating whatever 's in the fridge , even if it 's not food .
But Ani K licks those lightweights – he paints with his tongue and regularly , if not surprisingly , deals with nausea , cramp and headaches .
' First , I tried with my nose but not­iced others were already doing it .
I thought of giving my tongue a try and succeeded , ' the 30 - year - old said .
' A few newspapers reported it .
I got a good response .
Then I made it a regular practice . '
Ani devised his technique last year , after seeing another artist paint using his foot .
When he first started , he got severe head and body aches every time he tried to use his tongue .
He was sick because of the pungent fumes but has grown immune to the effects , he claimed .
So far , the drawing teacher has finished 20 watercolours including – rather appropriately – a 2.4 m ( 8 ft ) wide rendering of Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper , featuring Jesus and his disciples .
It took him five months to finish .
He now plans to show 150 works in a gallery he is building in his home in Kerala , India .
He hopes to be ready in six months because , now his body is used to the unorthodox method , he can complete one canvas in about four days .
Already , Ani has works featuring Mahatma Gandhi and Osama bin Laden .
He added : ' I 'm always looking for something different . '
The artist is not the only one who uses unusual body parts for art .
Di Peel swapped her brushes for breasts to create abstract works , while fellow Australian Tim Patch earned the nickname ' Pricasso ' after pion­eering the use of his penis to paint .
He can only paint for a short time , though .
And Stan Murmur paints with his bottom – but lost his job as an art teacher when he gave a TV interview demonstrating his technique .
The bears are getting smarter and smarter .

JOHN MCCAIN likes to style himself as a successor to a Republican president from a century ago : Teddy Roosevelt .
Like Mr Roosevelt , Mr McCain presents himself as a tough type not afraid to wield American power abroad .
He is also ready to use the presidency at home as a “ bully pulpit ” — a term coined by Mr Roosevelt — even against big business when needed .
Roosevelt built the Wildlife Refuge system and created huge national parks and forests ;
Mr McCain fancies himself green and wants to cap greenhouse - gas emissions .
But whereas Roosevelt is widely considered to have been one of the great presidents , many modern conservative types are troubled by Mr McCain .
The anti-government wing of the party that was launched to its forefront by Barry Goldwater in 1964 , championed by Ronald Reagan , and then dispirited by eight years of George Bush is worried by Mr McCain .
Could some of these voters defect to the Libertarian Party this year ?
The question is less fanciful than usual .
The Libertarians , now deciding who should be their presidential nominee , are usually a sideshow .
Their last candidate , Michael Badnarik , took a third of a percentage point in 2004 .
The hopefuls this year include one who wants to move the United Nations headquarters to Somalia , one known mostly for a book about the spirituality of John Denver , a country singer , and a near - obsessive marijuana - legalisation advocate .
But this year the Libertarian nomination may be a bigger prize .
Ron Paul ran a lower - case libertarian campaign for the Republican nomination , generating surprising levels of enthusiasm , votes and money .
Paulites continue showing up and voting for him in primaries , despite the fact that Mr McCain has locked up the nomination .
The word “ libertarian ” has , in the wake of that run , gained more currency and respectability .
And now Bob Barr , a prominent former Republican Congressman , is campaigning for the nomination .
Mr Barr , a former anti-drug warrior and leader of the impeachment against Bill Clinton , has converted to a rightish branch of Libertarianism .
His biggest worry is the expansion of federal powers since September 11th , 2001 .
He wants to abolish the Justice Department .
He would defer to states on gay marriage and drug legalisation .
Could this be bad news for Mr McCain ?
Mr Barr may not get the nomination — many Libertarians may prefer someone with more years in the party — but if he does , Mr McCain should be wary .
Even worse would be if Mr Paul endorsed Mr Barr ( Mr Paul himself sought the Libertarian nomination in the past ) .
As in previous elections , 2008 will be decided by close votes in a few swing states .
Orthodox Republicans are dispirited by Mr McCain 's heterodoxies on immigration , global warming , taxes and other issues .
They are reluctantly coalescing around him , on the basis that he is more appealing than Barack Obama .
But just enough demoralised Republicans might pull the lever for Mr Barr in states with an ornery , independent streak to give Mr McCain some heartburn .
Mr Barr explicitly says that he is not running as a spoiler and would take votes from Mr Obama ( from those worried , for example , about civil liberties ) .
But the general wisdom is that he would take far more from Mr McCain .
Some are already calling him Mr McCain 's Ralph Nader , the man who took enough votes from Al Gore to let Mr Bush become president in 2000 .
Even if Mr Barr is not nominated , the fact that people are even speculating about a libertarian spoiler is a reflection of the challenges faced by Mr McCain .
He has a vaunted personal story and a likeable personality , but he is hemmed in ideologically .
On his signature issue , Iraq , he is a hostage to fortune .
At home the more he shows his independence from Republican orthodoxy , the more traditional Republicans might stay away from the polling booth .
The more he courts the Republican base , the more he risks being associated with Mr Bush .
The last thing he needs is an irksome Libertarian stealing his small - government credibility too .
WASHINGTON --
Finance ministers gathered this weekend to grapple with the global financial crisis also struggled with a problem that has plagued the world periodically since before the time of the Pharaohs : food shortages .
Surging commodity prices have pushed up global food prices 83 % in the past three years , according to the World Bank -- putting huge stress on some of the world 's poorest nations .
Even as the ministers met , Haiti's Prime Minister Jacques Edouard Alexis was resigning after a week in which that tiny country 's ...
NEW ORLEANS , Louisiana ( CNN ) --
Ten fraternity members at Tulane University face criminal charges in an alleged hazing incident in which pledges were repeatedly burned with hot water , cayenne pepper and vinegar , police said .
Tulane University has suspended the Pi Kappa Alpha chapter , a spokesman says .
Two pledges were treated at a hospital for severe burns resulting from the April 25 incident at the Pi Kappa Alpha house , authorities said .
Seven students made their first appearance in court Wednesday and were released on their own recognizance , said Dalton Saywoir Jr. , spokesman for the Orleans Parish District Attorney 's office .
It was unclear whether the three remaining students had been arrested or surrendered to police .
The arrested students range in age from 20 to 22 .
All 10 students face charges of aggravated second - degree battery , New Orleans and Tulane police said in a statement .
New Orleans attorney Frank D'Amico Jr. , who represents one of the two pledges severely burned , said it happened at a " Hell Night " ritual involving the 10 - member pledge class .
" What they were doing was burning the young men , " he said .
Fraternity brothers were said to have used boiling water containing pepper spray and a " crab boil " seasoning mixture containing cayenne pepper .
The water was poured on the pledges ' backs , he said .
" The ones who screamed first did n't get burned as badly , " he said .
But as the evening wore on and the water grew hotter and hotter , the ones who had not screamed were severely burned .
D'Amico said his client , who was attending Tulane on scholarship , suffered second - and third - degree burns to his back , chest , buttocks and genitals .
He is " bandaged up , " D'Amico said , and must have twice - daily burn treatments .
The young man is unable to travel or take his exams and is attempting to negotiate with Tulane on postponing them , he said .
Do n't Miss WDSU : Attorney :
At least 10 pledges burned in hazing
WDSU : Attorney :
At least 10 pledges burned in hazing WWL : Hazing with hot crab boil alleged
The young man is " obviously extremely traumatized , " D'Amico said .
Tulane University has suspended the Pi Kappa Alpha chapter and will investigate the incident in accordance with its anti-hazing policy , school spokesman Michael Strecker said in a statement .
" The university has zero tolerance for any type of hazing or other incident which can potentially endanger the well - being of any student , " the statement said .
" Any fraternity member found to be in violation of the Student Code of Conduct will be held accountable . "
Tulane is also cooperating with police , Strecker said .
" Such actions are nothing short of reprehensible , and are completely contrary to the mission , vision and purpose of our fraternity , if true , " the fraternity said in a statement issued from its headquarters in Memphis , Tennessee .
" These types of actions represent a betrayal of our core values and the trust that the men who were hurt by these events placed in their fellow students . "
But it said , " these injuries appear to be the result of a few unauthorized , misguided individuals and not the entire chapter . "
The arrested students did not comment as they were led into a police vehicle while handcuffed , according to video footage from CNN affiliate WWL .
Pi Kappa Alpha headquarters did not immediately return a call seeking comment .
D'Amico said he is pleased that Tulane and law enforcement have taken swift action on the matter .
His client 's parents sent their son to Tulane thinking he would be safe , he added , " and they boil [ the pledges ] alive . "

Theist claim :
Freethinking response :
Deep investigation into the gospels casts doubt about their reliability and authenticity as evidence for Jesus .
Here is the problem , we have no idea who wrote the gospels , but we can learn about their character by examining the text .
The gospels were written by Greek - speaking , educated , rhetorically - trained writers who were skilled in Greek composition ( but never call themselves disciples ) , not by uneducated , illiterate , lower - class , Aramaic - speaking , disciple peasants who never went to school or possessed knowledge of literature .
How did the story reach these authors ?
Not by the disciples , but from someone who heard the story , who heard about the story .
They were telling stories to convert people ; they improved and changed the story sometimes .
By the time the story reached these authors , the story had already been set in motion through oral traditions for several decades , which casts serious doubt on the validity of their claims .
The common belief today is the gospels provide sufficient evidence for Jesus , since they are supposed to be written by eye - witnesses throughout his journeys .
The problem with this is that none of the gospel writers met Jesus .
They were written many decades after Jesus supposedly died : the earliest gospel ( Mark ) was probably written forty to forty - five years after Jesus died .
None of the gospel 's authors claim to be eye - witnesses and each gospel is written in the third - person .
We have no idea who wrote the gospels or where they were written ; we do not know who got to read them prior to the 2nd century or investigated their claims in any useful way , but it is clear none of them met Jesus .
To further support that the gospel writers were not eye - witnesses is the large discrepancies amongst them .
Many of the gospels cannot agree what Jesus did or said , with Mark in particular knowing little to nothing about them .
That is what we do not know , but here is what we do know , many parts of the gospels were added after their first version , such as the end of Mark 16 , and the story of Jesus saying " let he without sin cast the first stone . "
There is a whole list of pieces that were later added in , and many of the books in the NT written by forgers [ 1 ] ( all this done by early Christians ) .
Since the gospels have been deliberately meddled with , mistranslated many times , and changed over the decades of oral traditions , there is no sound basis for trusting them as reliable historical documents .
Mark , the earliest gospel , displays a lack of understanding of the geography of the area , indicating he was not a local .
There is also evidence that his intention was to write as a fiction [ 2 ] .
The authors Matthew and Luke got most of their info from Mark , often copying Mark verbatim .
The gospels themselves are admittedly propagandist : “ And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of the disciples , which are not written in this book : but these are written that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God ; and that believing ye might have through his name . ” ( John 20:30 - 31 ) This hardly sounds like the work of objective historical reporting .

WASHINGTON —
The comment was outrageous , but it was not the least bit surprising .
A psychologist responsible for assessing returning war veterans for post - traumatic stress disorder — a psychological ailment that could entitle them to monthly disability payments — told staff members not to diagnose the illness because to do so would increase the government ’s costs .
“ Given that we are having more and more compensation - seeking veterans , I ’d like to suggest that you refrain from giving a diagnosis of PTSD straight out , ” the psychologist at a Department of Veterans Affairs center in Texas wrote in an e-mail .
She suggested diagnosing a less severe disorder that would not carry the greater long - term disability costs .
The correspondence was made public by VoteVets.org and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , two groups that have dogged the Bush administration about our latest national disgrace : the shoddy care and bureaucratic callousness shown toward the warriors who are returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with life - altering wounds of the body and spirit .
Of course , the morally indefensible missive was repudiated by higher - ups in the Department of Veterans Affairs as soon as it was revealed last week .
And , of course , the persistent congressional outcry over the treatment of veterans — not to mention the onrushing election season — makes it more likely than not that some temporary alleviation of the pain and suffering vets endure in a system that is supposed to be serving them will be addressed .
Somehow , some day , that is .
That bit of politically induced relief for vets , should it come , does not change the underlying sentiment of the message .
Because at bottom , it is a demoralizing reminder of the way the U.S. health care system works for just about everyone .
Certainly , the government agency in charge of caring for veterans is not supposed to behave this way , under the law or any standard of conscience .
In truth , the mind - set mirrors the unconscionable standard of the health insurance industry ’s thinking that the rest of us must endure — and from which neither leading candidate for president promises much relief .
The industry ’s term for paying a claim is “ medical loss . ”
This is a disturbingly blunt but perfectly accurate reflection of reality :
To make a profit , an insurer must take in more money than it pays out in claims .
Denying payment on claims , or strictly limiting payments even for the most obvious or debilitating medical conditions , is how the industry stays financially viable .
“ I was told repeatedly that I was not denying care , I was simply denying payment , ” Linda Peeno , a doctor and former managed - care medical claims officer testified before Congress in 1996 .
A video clip of her testimony was included in Michael Moore ’s 2007 documentary “ Sicko , ” the story of how the American health insurance system really works — or rather , does n’t — for most people .
The slip - up at the veterans ’ health agency comes at a propitious time , because neither of the two men who could become president next year would do anything to change the type of thinking it revealed .
Democrat Barack Obama relies on the current , if uneasy — and increasingly unworkable — partnership between the insurance industry and employers to expand coverage .
But Obama would not make universal coverage mandatory , and so insurers would still be able to cherry - pick among those it really wants to insure ( the healthiest , and therefore the cheapest ) and those it does n’t ( the sickest and most expensive ) .
Republican John McCain ’s answer is far worse .
He would effectively break the link between employers and the insurance industry and give individuals a tax credit with which to buy a policy on their own — a purchase they would make at the mercy of insurers .
If you liked President Bush ’s plan to privatize Social Security and move toward a do - it - yourself retirement system , you ’ll love McCain ’s do - it - yourself answer to the insurance crisis .
But , of course , no one can really do it himself because the whole idea of private insurance is to spread risk broadly .
That ’s why employers are able to purchase policies more cheaply than can individuals :
The expensive employee whose child has cancer is offset by the cheaper employee who is as fit as a marathon runner .
The psychology of the cost - conscious official at the Texas veterans medical facility is the psychology that controls the health care system for all of us .
If we are outraged at the hint that it might be applied to wounded servicemen and - women , we should also be angry that it is applied every day to the rest of us .

Frank Booth ’s Favourite
Pabst Blue Ribbon
February 10 , 2005
A few years ago on RateBeer if you put an invalid search into the search box the response was - “ Sorry , that beer ca n’t be found .
But let us take you to Frank Booth ’s Favorite .... ” and you would be taken to Pabst Blue Ribbon .
I found that quite amusing , even though I had n’t picked up on the Pabst Blue Ribbon reference when I originally watched the film , Blue Velvet .
A little research into the beer and I discovered that Pabst ’s beer originally had a blue ribbon around its neck .
This created a highly charged connection between the beer and the female character , Dorothy Valens , who also wore a blue ribbon around her neck .
Frank Booth greedily draining the woman in the same way he would a bottle of beer .
My interest in PBR was now aroused .
It was clear from the film that in addition to the metaphor of dominance and consumption , that Lynch intended there to be a blue collar worker association with the beer .
But a very dirty , grubby , unhealthy , xenophobic association .
When the Jeffrey Beaumont character reveals that he drinks the foreign Heineken , Frank Booth explodes : “ Heineken ?
Fuck that shit !
Pabst Blue Ribbon ! ”
The blind and very violent allegiance to this traditional American working class beer is quite scary , and does conjure up images of the most rabid red-neck living in the heartland of America surrounded with guns and the stars and stripes , terrified of the possibility of anything new and different entering his neighbourhood - homosexuals , liberals , or foreigners ; and especially a homosexual , liberal foreigner drinking a foreign beer .
On the other hand that other very popular and long lived icon of American beers , Budweiser , is seen as quite clean and wholesome .
The Sandy Williams character reveals that her upright and honest policeman dad drinks Bud , and Beaumont responds : “ King of beers . ”
So Bud is boring and decent , while PBR is wild and very bad .
Part of the irony behind Booth ’s loyal and chauvinist attitude to his beloved American beer is it was originally produced by immigrants ( Frederick Pabst came from Bavaria , and the Best family came from Germany ) .
America itself is an immigrant country , yet while Booth rejects any contemporary immigration he clings desperately to the product of immigrants from the previous century .
So , 150 years of production gives the beer some stability , and history is what makes PBR special .
PBR has substance .
It ’s been around the block and is still here .
And that long history is partly responsible for PBR ’s current growth in popularity .
PBR is retro-chic .
It ’s a laid back beer that is n’t pushed by advertising .
It ’s cool , it ’s homey , it ’s there , just as it has always been .
And when the Pabst brewery closed down , rumours of the beer being withdrawn roused thousands of young drinkers to pick up a can of PBR in preference to any other beer .
PBR is characteristically American .
It is mostly only sold in North America .
In troubled times people cling to such stability as they can find .
The long history starts when the original brewery was founded in 1844 by that immigrant German brewer Jacob Best .
He started on Chestnut Street Hill in Milwaukee with a capacity of 18 barrels .
Later in 1863 Frederick Pabst , a steamship captain , bought a share in Best and Company , by which time the brewery was already selling a lager which in 1875 they would bottle under the name Best Select .
Best Select was a popular beer which the by now named Phillip Best Brewing Company entered in competitions , gaining several awards - sometimes winning against its rival Budweiser .
In 1882 the company starting selling the beer with a blue ribbon tied around the neck to signify it was an award winning beer ( 11 years before it ’s supposed first appearance at the Chicago World ’s Fair ) .
In 1888 the name of the brewery was changed to Pabst Brewing Company , and by 1898 the name of the beer was changed to Blue Ribbon .
Such was the success of the beer that Pabst was ordering millions of yards of blue ribbon .
One factory in 1902 worked around the clock for nearly a year to complete a contract for 10 million yards of ribbon .
Growth continued up to Prohibition when all alcohol production stopped .
When the beer returned ( without the blue ribbon ) in 1933 it quickly became a national brand brewed in several locations across the country , and by 1935 was one of the first beers to become available in cans .
During the second World War all cans of PBR were painted a military green and were exclusively made for the troops .
And , during the 1950 ’s , further strengthening the beer ’s association with working class men and violence , Pabst sponsored the boxing on CBS .
In 1958 , with an annual production of 3.9 million barrels , PBR had now sold a total of 100 million barrels since first being brewed , an event commemorated by adding the red stripe to the logo .
Annual sales figures climbed each year - helped by Pabst cutting the price of the beer to bring it even closer to the hearts of the working man - until it reached a record high of 18 million barrels in 1977 .
Impressive though this is , Bud had achieved the same output nearly ten years earlier , and would never again see PBR as a competitor .
Pabst now entered a period of poor management and decline .
After several messy years spent fighting take - overs , Pabst gave in to the notorious brewery destroyer Paul Kalmanovitz in 1985 , and sold out for $ 63 million .
Advertising stopped .
Quality dropped .
Drinkers turned elsewhere .
At the time of Kalmanovitz ’ death in 1988 it seemed like he had sucked Pabst dry and that the brewery would have to close , but when Lutz Issleib took over he was determined to keep PBR alive .
And he did , though production was fairly static .
Economics eventually forced closure of the brewery in 2001 , though the transfer of production to the Miller brewery is a continuation of sorts because the Miller company was founded in the Plank - Road Brewery which had been established by some members of the Best family just after the original Best brewery was founded .
And now this ailing grand old beer is cool ( or deck , as Robert Lanham puts it in The Hipster Handbook ) .
This beer is a symbol of the gritty American working man with all his pride and fear ; John McClane of Die Hard , revelling in his low - tech masculinity , struggling with his sexuality in a post - modern world , would drink PBR .
This symbol and survivor from the past is today drunk by Portland scumbag punks , hip skateboaders and indie bands .
PBR is the outlaw brand , drunk by those on the fringes of society .
PBR is the coolest beer in America right now .
Offer me any other pale lager right now and my response will be : “ Fuck that shit !
Pabst Blue Ribbon ! ”
Cult beers do n’t come more ballsy than PBR .

Temptation was too great for the bear
Now it has a criminal record after a court found it guilty of theft and criminal damage .
But there was an empty dock in the court in the city of Bitola and no handcuffed bear , which was convicted in its absence .
The case was brought by the exasperated beekeeper after a year of trying vainly to protect his beehives .
For a while , he kept the animal away by buying a generator , lighting up the area , and playing thumping Serbian turbo - folk music .
But when the generator ran out of power and the music fell silent , the bear was back and the honey was gone once more .
" It attacked the beehives again , " said beekeeper Zoran Kiseloski .
Because the animal had no owner and belonged to a protected species , the court ordered the state to pay for the damage to the hives - around $ 3,500 ( £ 1,750 ; 2,238 euros ) .
The bear , meanwhile , remains at large - somewhere in Macedonia .
California will adopt the most aggressive approach in the nation to a controversial crime - fighting technique that uses DNA to try to identify elusive criminals through their relatives , state Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown announced Friday .
Employing what is known as familial or “ partial match ” searching , the policy is aimed at identifying a suspect through DNA collected at a crime scene by looking for potential relatives in the state ’s genetic database of about a million felons .
Once a relative is identified , police can use that person as a lead to trace the suspect .
The new plan makes California a leader in such searches , which several states permit but do not vigorously pursue .
Colorado has recently begun to examine its database for relatives of unknown criminals as part of a research project .
Brown said the new approach was justified by violent crime plaguing the state .
He emphasized that it would be used only when all other leads had been exhausted .

“ We have 2,000 murders a year in California -- that is 10,000 since the Iraq war started -- and that is a lot of killing , ” Brown said .
“ When you see it and see the victims and have to go to funerals , it is pretty serious stuff . ”
But Tania Simoncelli , science advisor to the American Civil Liberties Union , called Brown ’s decision a disappointment and said the organization is exploring its legality .
The group has not decided whether to challenge the policy in court .
“ The fact that my brother committed a crime does n’t mean I should have to give up my privacy , ” she said .
At a recent FBI conference on familial searching , Jeffrey Rosen , a constitutional law professor at George Washington University , warned : “ I can guarantee if familial searching proceeds , it will create a political firestorm . ”

The policy , which takes effect immediately , is designed to work like this :
The state ’s crime lab will tell police about DNA profiles that come up during routine searches of California ’s offender database and closely resemble , but do not match , the DNA left at a crime scene .
( Previously , the state refused to tell police about these partial matches . )
The lab will then perform calculations and tests to determine the likelihood of a biological relationship between the person found in the database and the unknown offender believed to have left DNA at the crime scene .
When such partial matches do not surface or fail to produce a lead , a more customized familial search can be done in which computer software scans the database proactively for possible relatives .
The software measures the chance of two people being related based on the rarity of the markers they share .
California appears to be the first state in the nation to use this second technique as a matter of policy .
Drafted with the heavy involvement of lawyers , the new policy requires a series of meetings with police and prosecutors to ensure that the relative ’s name is vital to the investigation and that all other leads have been exhausted .

Once a relative has been identified , police can interview him or construct a family tree based on existing records .
If a suspect is identified , police can obtain a warrant for his DNA , or even gather it surreptiously from an abandoned drink or cigarette butt .
The suspect ’s DNA sample would then be compared to the crime scene sample and possibly used as evidence .
“ The people of California will know that we are using the database to try to solve as many crimes as we can , unlike virtually every other state in the country , ” said retired Alameda County Dist .
Atty .
Rockne P. Harmon , who consulted with the state on the policy .
Civil libertarians oppose using DNA databases to search for relatives of unknown offenders , saying it puts family members under “ genetic surveillance ” for crimes they did not commit .
For now , all the people in the state ’s database are convicted offenders , but the state plans to expand the database next year to include arrestees , heightening concerns over privacy .
Critics say familial searching could expose sensitive and secret genetic relationships .
A son , for example , could learn that his father was not his biological parent .
DNA databases also reflect the racial and ethnic biases of the justice system , exposing minority communities to more surveillance than others , critics maintain .

FBI officials in charge of the national database network have also expressed concerns , making them unlikely allies of civil libertarians on familial searching .
They urge a cautious approach , worrying that the courts will balk at this type of sleuthing .
No law specifically authorizes it , and some legal scholars consider it unconstitutional because they say it amounts to an unreasonable search .
Brown called such objections hypothetical .
The policy forbids the release of the names of relatives until genetic tests and analysis convince the state that the person is indeed a relative .
“ It is still not going to be a fail - safe system , and we are going to make mistakes , ” said Simoncelli , the ACLU science advisor .
“ We are opening the door to using the database in such a fundamentally different way than the purpose for which it was established . ”
No one knows how well the state ’s plan will work .
Harmon said he was absolutely convinced that it would provide at least some new leads for police .

Lance Gima , the state ’s top forensic scientist , agreed .
But he conceded that the search for relatives would be a longshot because many unrelated people share genetic markers .
He said he hoped the state ’s decision would spur technology to improve the accuracy of such searches .
Britain has done familial searching for years , using more sophisticated software .
With a 10 % to 14 % rate of identifying perpetrators , Britain ’s searches have had limited but dramatic results , cracking some sensational crimes .
A serial rapist whose DNA was not in Britain ’s national database was caught because he was genetically similar to his sister , whose DNA was taken after a drunk - driving arrest .
The so - called shoe rapist had a fetish for stiletto heels .
When police captured him , they discovered scores of high heels he had stolen from his victims .
Police in the U.S. have used genetic relationships to help catch criminals in a different way , and on a much smaller scale .

After Kansas police zeroed in on the serial killer who dubbed himself BTK -- initials for bind , torture , kill -- they obtained a court order for the pap smear of his daughter .
Without her knowledge , police performed a DNA analysis of the specimen , obtained from a medical laboratory .
The genetic similarities indicated they had the right man , Dennis Radar .

If thenearest star system , Alpha Centauri , does harbor rocky planets similar to Earthas new findings suggest , there exist a host of ways to get us there , in theory .
Sending aperson to Alpha Centauri within a human lifetime would n't be easy .
AlphaCentauri is 4.37 light - years away ?
more than 25.6 trillion miles , or more than 276,000 times the distance from the Earth to the sun .
" Interstellartravel is extremely hard , " said science fiction author and NASA physicist GeoffreyLandis .
But thelure has never been stronger .
Scientists last week said the Alpha Centaurisystem has the ingredients for an Earth - likeplanet , and they think they can spot it .
Conventionalrockets are nowhere near efficient enough .
At a maximum speed of about 17,600 mph ( about 28,300 kph ) , it would take the spaceshuttle , for example , about 165,000 years toreach Alpha Centauri .
In any case , " the problem with conventional rocketsis that if you 're carrying fuel , you need fuel just to carry all the fuel youbring with you , and it just gets exponentially worse , " Landis said .
But antimatterengines might work .
These drives rely on the extraordinary amount of energyreleased when antimatterand matter annihilate each other .
The problem , however , is creating enough andstoring any antimatter for the trip .
" Allof the current methods of manufacturing antimatter require enormous particleaccelerators and produce antimatter in very small quantities , " Landissaid .
" And to store antimatter , if you need a ton of magnets for one gramof antimatter , the entire idea of a lightweight way to store immense amounts ofenergy is no longer lightweight . "
Althoughone could in principle freeze anti-hydrogen and thus bypass the need formagnets , " if even the tiniest amount ever leaked out and touched the wallssurrounding it , you 'd produce a lot of heat , which in turn would heat up thefrozen anti-hydrogen , and the whole thing catastrophically goes away , " Landis said .
Antimattercould nevertheless perhaps find use in interstellar spaceships as a way to helptrigger nuclear reactions .
" That 's something that has n't been ruled outyet , and a little antimatter could help go a long way , " Landis said .
Suck itup
Instead ofrockets that carry all their fuel with them , spaceships might scoop it up alongthe way .
One design proposed by physicist Robert Bussard ( who died last year ) would employ giant electromagnetic fields to suck in hydrogen to fuel a nuclearrocket .
Unfortunately , this " ramscoop " or Bussard ramjet , probably could not work .
" Theinterstellar medium is not as dense as Bob Bussard thought it would be , " Landis said .
" And so far all attempts to design some kind of scoop had theunfortunate effect of producing more drag than you get back thrust , workingkind of like parachutes . "
Moreover , " we do n't really have any notion of how to use the pure hydrogen we findin interstellar space as fusion fuel , " Landis added .
All of the proposalsfor fusion in the lab use deuterium - tritium ( two isotopes of hydrogen ) ordeuterium with helium - 3 ( an isotope of helium ) ?
" we do n't have anysuggestions for pure hydrogen in a fusion reaction , " he said .
" It wasa clever idea , but the devil 's in the details . "
Sailaway
Light sailsmight be another way to go ?
giant , thin , lightweight reflective sails that rely on the slight push provided bylight beams .
" The point is to not carry the energy you need for propulsionwith you , but to get it transmitted to you , " explained Jordin Kare , aSeattle - based technical consultant on advanced space systems .
Instead ofrelying just on the enormous amount of light given off by the sun , light sailsto Alpha Centauri could also ride laser beamsthat earthlings would fire carefully at those ships to give an extra boost , especially when sails were too far away to catch much light from our sun .
The ideawith a laser sail is that the sky is the limit in regards to speed .
You justkeep accelerating , albeit gradually .
The problemwith interstellar travel with laser sails is that a lot of light needs to beused for a long time to get fast enough to get to Alpha Centauri within a humanlifetime .
This means very powerful and extraordinarily large lasers are needed inorder to focus on sails that get farther and farther away , Kare explained .
An ideasimilar to light sails that Landis helped come up with involved firing aparticle beam at a spaceship that would ride that energy .
" The problemwith laser beams is that they disperse over distance , so we thought aboutparticle beams , " Landis explained .
The beam would have to have a neutralelectrical charge so as not to disperse itself over time .
" It would be afeasible idea , " he said .
Bombsaway !
Anotheridea for space travel would involve riding explosions through space .
Such " pulsed propulsion " would hurl bombs behind a ship , which is shieldedwith a giant plate .
The explosions would push against the plate , propelling theship .
ProjectOrion suggested using nuclear bombs , while other proposals have sinceproposed smaller explosives .
" Nuclearpulsed propulsion works best for really big systems .
If you want to send acolony of 1,000 people to space , an Orion - type ship is definitely the way to doit , " Kare said .
" If you want to send a one - ton probe , I would say alaser system is the way to go . "
A varianton both the laser sail and pulsed propulsion idea that Kare came up with wasthe " sailbeam . "
Essentially , a laser would propel lots of miniature sails likebullets at a distant ship .
The impact of these sails would propel thespacecraft .
" Theidea is to get a craft up to about a tenth of the speed of light thatway , " Kare said .
" It could get you to Alpha Centauri in 60 to 70 years . "
So far noone has created technology that is widely agreed upon as capable of caring foror preserving humans across the lifetimes it might take to get to AlphaCentauri .
It might easily take more than one lifetime to reach the star system ?
one antimatter engine design would take 200 years tosend humans there .
If that proves so , mission designers might have to take sexand family into account so offspring of the original crew would be aroundat the end of the trip , unless someone successfully invents a technique forplacing people in suspendedanimation .
Then again , warpdrives and similar far - out ideas might one day zip us faster than light toAlpha Centauri and beyond .
" We do n't know all the physics there is to knowyet , and something we do n't know yet might give us tremendouscapabilities , " Landis said .
Click to viewClick to viewHere 's what Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer revealed about Windows 7 at All Things Digital a few minutes ago .
The biggest " feature " is the touch and multi - touch integration , which takes many of its roots from Microsoft 's Surface Table , and will be available as an interface options for other apps .
Here 's some more stuff they pulled out , which we captured in photos here .

• There will be a OSX - like dock , though how OS X - like is yet to be seen .
• Multi -touch gestures in photogalleries like two - finger zoom , flicking , and panning .
Think of the photo app on the Microsoft Surface table .
• Multi -touch paint program where you can draw with 10 fingers ( again , think of what you 've already seen in Surface )
• Multi -touch piano app
• In - depth mapping application that pulls from Microsoft 's Live Maps and Microsoft Virtual Earth
Looks like a LOT of the multi - touch features were culled from the Surface team , and the non -touch features look fairly similar to what 's already in Vista ( based on the video above ) .
Those apps are demo apps only , and will be revised / rewritten / reworked before the final version of Windows 7 is available .
All this will be yours in about 18 months .

WASHINGTON ( AP )  Nearly 40,000 military personnel have been given diagnoses of post - traumatic stress disorder since 2003 , Pentagon records show .
Officials say they believe that many other cases exist and have been encouraging service members to obtain help , even if they go to private therapists and do not report it to the military .
The 40,000 cases are those tracked by the military .
Officials have also estimated that half the military personnel with mental problems do not receive treatment because they are embarrassed or fear that it might hurt their careers .
A report on diagnosed cases released on Tuesday by the Army surgeon general , Lt. Gen. Eric B. Schoomaker , showed that the hardest - hit services last year were the Marines and Army , the two forces bearing the brunt of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Home is a real - time online 3D , networked community available on the PS Network .
It allows PS3 users to interact , communicate , join online games , shop , share private content and even build and show off their own personal spaces to others in real time .
Home will be available as a free download from the PS Store and will launch directly from XMB ( XrossMediaBar ) on PS3 .
With an avatar uniquely customized according to each user 's preference , users can explore the 3D community that is Home -- a sleek , modern environment featuring spacious common areas ; custom spaces dedicated to specific games ; and personal apartments .
Each user is assigned an apartment in Home where they can invite others to join them as they show off their own style in an area they can personalize themselves with furniture , art and other items -- even a different view from their windows .
They can also show their personal video , pictures and other digital media content found on their PS3 hard drives in their apartments .
Very rich interactive communication with others is achieved through built in text , audio and video chat , along with sophisticated emotional animations for each character .
Attendees were drawn from 10,000 PS3 users who have been test - driving Home as ‘ closed beta ’ users .
Given exclusive VIP entry to the Space , they were greeted by an impressive , large - scale area dressed with various elements from real - world PlayStation Day , including the iconic hexagonal branding and artwork from each of the day ’s PlayStation zones .
Users were able to explore the Space , experiencing highlights of the day such as a photo gallery of games developers and a jumbo screen of the day ’s speeches with an introduction from Kazuo " Kaz " Hirai , President and Group Chief Executive Officer of Sony Computer Entertainment .
Users were also able to enjoy a video stream of all the action from the real - world PlayStation Day experience .
The online Media & Events Space can be re-dressed and re-branded just like a real - life venue .
Following the test event ’s success , Home will now start scheduling more elaborate and exciting productions for the Space , which will be available for use by both first and third parties .
“ As well as looking great , the Media and Events Space is flexible and user - friendly - it ’s a real focal point for our virtual community .
This was a very exciting first event and we ’ve already received plenty of great feedback , ” says Home producer Martijn Van Der Meulen .
Sharing continues in the " Hall of Fame , " where users can display new 3D trophies that will be unlocked through in - game milestones for the games they own as well viewing the trophies of other users across the PS Network and for other games they 've yet to purchase .
The PlayStation Home Open Beta service that will become available in Fall 2008 will be built around providing new and fun community gaming experiences .
Details of the Closed Beta testing features , registration for the test and the opening of the service will be announced as they become available .

Multiple American ISPs are sharing customer data with outside firms that deal in so - called behavioral ad targeting , and according to one of these firms , the Silicon Valley - based NebuAd , roughly 10 per cent of all US web surfers are affected .
These ad companies , which also include the Sonora , California - based Front Porch , wo n't say which ISPs have adopted their services .
But two internet service providers , the Georgia - based Knology and the Sprint - spin - off Embarq , admit to using such platforms on a test basis , and according to multiple users who 've posted their stories to Broadband Reports , NebuAd is tracking data on WOW ! , an ISP serving the Chicago area .
Using deep - packet inspection hardware - similar to technologies used by anti-virus vendors - NebuAd tracks the search and browsing activity of net surfers .
But it says this data is never matched to personally identifiable information .
" With a one - way hash , we turn your IP address and other data into an anonymous profile , and we use that to see if you qualify for innocuous categories , " NebuAd CEO Bob Dykes told us .
" We can track someone looking for a luxury car , not just a car - someone searching not just for travel but travel to the south of France or Las Vegas . "
NebuAd then uses this information as a means of targeting ads .
And naturally , the ISPs take a cut of its profits .
Dykes - once chief financial officer at Symantec - also says that ISP customers are clearly notified before NebuAd begins tracking their behavior .
" We require our ISPs to give notice to the user directly , and we also allow for an opt - out .
Our contract [ with ISPs ] has a paragraph that says we require direct notification ...
It says that ' Advertising that you may see may be based on your online activity , and you can opt - out . ' "
He is adamant that a paragraph posted to an ISP 's website or buried in its terms of service does not qualify as direct notification .
But Knology - which is testing NebuAd in " multiple cities " - notifies customers with no more than a paragraph posted to its website .
" We are engaged in a trial with NebuAd , " said Tony Palmermo , Knology 's vice present of marketing .
" We go through all the technical processes needed to support the [ US ] Privacy Act - to uphold the spirit and the letter of it .
There is an opt - out , and it's on our web site . "
When asked if the ISP should do more to ensure customers are aware of the practice , Palermo said " We 're still in that test mode .
Long term , we do n't know how that will play out . "
NebuAd declined to comment on Knology .
" I 'm not going to talk about any particular ISPs or acknowledge who we work with , " Dykes said .
" But I will say that if we hear about an ISP that is n't following the contract , then we will look into what actions we can take to enforce the contract . "
Ten per cent of all US net surfers
As reported by The Washington Post , NebuAd is tracking data from roughly 10 per cent of all US net surfers - though the company has already signed contracts that would broaden this scope .
" We cover about 10 per cent today , " Dykes told us .
" But our contract could reach more than that . "
Front Porch offers ISPs a service similar to NebuAd's , but it reaches little more than 100,000 US net surfers .
Other operations that appear to be working on similar services include Adzilla and Project Rialto , a " stealth company " created by Alcatel - Lucent , but these firms did not respond to our interview requests .
Yes , Front Porch and NebuAd are also doing something similar to Phorm - the behavioral advertising firm with controversial ties to three British ISPs : BT , Virgin Media , and Carphone Warehouse .
And like Phorm , they 're quick to play down the controversy .
Continuing our review of Marilyn McCord Adams ' Christ and Horrors .
Again , in this series I 'm picking and choosing aspects of Adams ' work that are of particular interest for this blog .
I 'm leaving tons on the the table , much of which would be of interest to theologians .
So , please get Christ and Horrors and read the book for yourself .
This series is mainly intended to pique your curiosity .
In my first post we noted that Adams links horrors to our existential ability to create meaning out of our experiences .
Horrors defeat this ability .
That is , when exposed to ruinous abuse , disease , or pain we simply cannot find " the point . "
We can not make " sense " of the horrific situation .
The horror overwhelms our capacity to weave the experience into a coherent and positive narrative .
In my last post I outlined Adams ' three stages of horror defeat .
Recall , in Stage 1
God joins us in the midst of horror allowing for the possibility of meaning creation .
However , if we are volitionally ruined this possibility is never actualized .
Thus , in Stage 2 God works internally and externally to build our meaning - making capacities .
Finally , in Stage 3 horrors are brought to an end .
As we examine this framework it has probably dawned on you that , although Stage 1 horror defeat has already occurred , Stages 2 and 3 are yet to be for most persons .
That is , many people die in the grip of horror and fail to make horrors personally meaningful .
This may be due to volitional ruin , but it can also be due to the fact that the horror involves a person 's death .
In short , Stage 2 horror defeat will not occur for every person prior to their mortal death .
Thus , if horror defeat is on the agenda of God His efforts to defeat horror for every person implies universal salvation .
As Adams ' claims ( p. 51 ) : " I insist , God will be good - to each created person by weaving up any horror - participation into an unending relationship of beatific intimacy with God .
In my judgment , grim realism is not inappropriately derogatory of human dignity , but rather serves to magnify the miracle of God 's making good on God 's cosmic project by benefiting each and every human being .
( And , yes , my focus on horrors does drive me to a doctrine of universal salvation ! ) . "
The " grim realism " is Adams ' claim about volitional ruin noted in my last post :
We must be realistic , grimly realistic , that human agency cannot overcome horrors by imbuing them with meaning .
And if this is the case it necessarily implies that God must extend his salvific work post - mortem to bring horror defeat to every created person .
Stage 2 and Stage 3 horror defeat , for Adams , implies the union of subjective and objective horror defeat .
That is , in Stage 3 horrors are objectively defeated :
And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying , " Now the dwelling of God is with men , and he will live with them .
They will be his people , and God himself will be with them and be their God .
He will wipe every tear from their eyes .
There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain , for the old order of things has passed away . "
He who was seated on the throne said , " I am making everything new ! "
But for horrors to be completely defeated a subjective component must also be realized .
That is , it is not good enough for horrors to be objectively defeated in the Eschaton .
Horrors must be defeated subjectively , within the experience of each horror participant and victim .
And it is this defeat of subjective horrors that demands God 's post - mortem intervention .
Again , I think this is a critical insight from Adams .
Too often in theodicy discussions only Stage 1 ( Divine participation ) and Stage 3 ( objective horror defeat in the Eschaton ) get discussed .
And , to be frank , that just is n't good enough .
Stage 2 defeat ( the subjective defeat of horror for every horror victim ) must be a part of the package .
God owes it to those very particular individuals .
And it is this particular debt that cannot , for many persons , be realized in this life .
This is not to say that many believers are not already experiencing Stage 2 horror defeat right here and right now .
I see it every week in my church .
People are undergoing horrific things in my church .
Death of children , trauma , abuse , addictions , disease .
And weekly we hear testimonies of God 's faithfulness .
These saints , via the grace of God , can find meaning in the horror .
And many , although never wishing to go through the same experience again , would not trade in their horror for the union it created between them and God .
These are amazing testimonies .
Evidence that God is making good on his Stage 1 horror defeat as evidenced in the Incarnation .
God is , truly , with us .
But , grimly we must remember , these testimonies are unique and rare .
Most die struggling toward Stage 2 horror defeat .
God might be glimpsed and sought for in those hospital rooms , therapy offices , or killing fields , but people are ruined by their experiences of horror .
For them the work of God must continue after death so that horror defeat is brought to all .
As Adams says ( p. 207 ) : " Nevertheless , for an omniscient , omnipotent , and perfectly good God , a future just society is n't good enough .
What about the countless individuals sacrificed on the slaughter - bench of history ?
An omniscient and omnipotent God Who loved human beings would make it up to them , would guarantee that there was enough positive meaning in it to defeat their horror - participation and make their lives great goods to them on the whole and in the end ! "
Obviously , this vision demands that we rethink traditional notions of hell .
As readers of this blog know , I 'm good with that .
In one of my favorites passages from Christ and Horrors Adams says this ( p. 229-230 , emphases hers ) :
" Traditional doctrines of hell err again by supposing either that God does not get what God wants with every human being ( " God wills all humans to be saved " by God 's antecedent will ) or that God deliberately creates some for ruin .
To be sure , many human beings have conducted their ante-mortem lives in such a way as to become anti-social persons .
Almost none of us dies with all the virtues needed to be fit for heaven .
Traditional doctrines of hell suppose that God lacks the will or the patience or the resourcefulness to civilize each and all of us , to rear each and all of us up into the household of God .
They conclude that God is left with the option of merely human penal systems -- viz. , liquidation or quarantine !
Traditional doctrines of hell go beyond failure to hatred and cruelty by imagining a God Who not only acquiesces in creaturely rebellion and dysfunction but either directly organizes or intentionally " outsources " a concentration camp ( of which Auschwitz and Soviet gulags are pale imitations ) to make sure some creatures ' lives are permanently deprived of positive meaning .
My own view is that ante-mortem horror - participation is hell enough .
Horrors constitute the prima facie destruction of the positive meaning of our lives ; a destruction that we lack knowledge , power , or worth enough to defeat ; a destruction that reasonably drives many to despair .
For God to succeed , God has to defeat horrors for everyone .
We have all been to hell by being tainted by horrors ante-mortem .
We all meet the horror of death at the end .
For some , life has been one horror after another between the dawn of personhood and the grave .
In millions of cases , these horrors have been spawned by the systemic evils of human societies .
To be good - to us , God will have to establish and fit us for wholesome society , not establish institutions to guarantee that horrors last forever in the world to come ! "
Ante-mortem horror - participation is hell enough !
Yet again let me just say how much I think Adams " get 's it " !
Let me conclude with a brief comment on unviersalism .
Most people think that universalism is a soteriological move .
That people believe in the idea because universalists just want " everyone to get to go to heaven . "
But for me , and apparently for Adams , the universalist move is rather a theodicy move .
That is , I believe in universalism not because I 'm concerned about Me and You and Our Eternal Destination .
Truly , I do n't worry about that very much at all .
No , I 'm a universalist not because I 'm concerned about Us but because I 'm concerned about God .
Specifically , I 'm concerned about God 's reputation .
God made us radically vulnerable to horrors .
He had his reasons for this .
But whatever those reasons were , God 's reputation for love and goodness demands that he defeat horrors .
And , as Adams correctly and courageously notes , this implies newer , fresher notions of post - mortem ontology and existence .
Two more development builds of Mac OS X 10.5.3 were released recently , according to a report at Apple Insider .
Build 9D20 , quickly following build 9D19 released last Friday , contains only two known , minor issues .
The notes accompanying the build also reduces the areas of focus that developers are asked to keep an eye on while running the build .
Build 9D20 contains nearly 150 fixes and improvements to Leopard .
The 10.5.3 update is also expected to fix graphics issues experienced by Penryn - based laptops owners .
The frequency of build releases and very short list of known issues gives good reason to believe we 'll be seeing the update released very soon .
Thomas Beatie First Pregnant Man ( Photo )
is not your typical male .
In fact he used to be a she .
He has undergone chest reconstruction to eliminate his female breasts .
He has also taken testosterone to deepen his voice and encourage the growth of body hair .
For reasons only he can explain , he left his female reproductive organs intact and is now pregnant .
He admits he had to quit taking testosterone in order to get pregnant .
Beatie is married to a woman named Nancy .
No word on whether she was previously male and / or if artificial insemination was necessary .
He reportedly suffered one ectopic pregnancy previously and had to have one ovary removed .
This pregnancy is reportedly a healthy and uneventful experience and he could n't be happier .
No word on why he opted to have the baby instead of his wife .
The photos are startling to say the least .
The blessed event should occur around July 3 , 2008 .

Republicans lost a long - held House seat Saturday after trying to bring down the Democratic candidate by aligning him with Barack Obama .
Don Cazayoux defeated Woody Jenkins to represent Louisiana 's Sixth District , a seat held by Republicans for decades , boosting Democrats ' optimism heading in to the fall elections .
Mr. Cazayoux , a state representative , ...
During those years , many resentful Basrawis say , the British were involved in a war that was deeply unpopular back home , and therefore had no stomach for sustaining the casualties necessary to restore order .
“ I have been very frustrated at the British , ” said Brig .
Gen. Edan Jaber , a police commander in Basra .
He said the British “ gave a high priority to their own security ” and “ were not forceful with the cases they faced in the street . ”
It is a common criticism .
“ The Americans go in with huge force and hit hard , not like the British , ” one Iraqi soldier complained .
“ Our people need a powerful force , not a weak one .
We had just left Saddam Hussein behind .
How could anyone be soft after that ? ”
THE BRITISH OFFICERS
The British reject such arguments , saying they faced a very different problem from the one facing the Americans 300 miles north .
Here , mafia - style Shiite gangs rose in an overwhelmingly Shiite town ; up north , Sunni and Shiite factions waged civil war in divided cities like Baghdad and Baquba .
Before the British withdrew from the city center , they were already arguing that their continued presence made the situation here worse because they had become a “ magnet ” for attacks .
“ There ’s no doubt that for some parts of the community , we are as much part of the problem as the solution , ” Lt. Col .
Patrick Sanders , the British commander of the Fourth Battalion of the Rifles Regiment said last July .
“ We need to leave .
There is no question about it .
The only way that you can solve the problems of Basra is with an Iraqi solution . ”
Only minutes before , a Mahdi Army mortar attack had forced him and his men to drop to the ground at the riverside Basra Palace headquarters , a site they would soon evacuate .

A male orangutan , clinging precariously to overhanging branches , flails the water with a pole , trying desperately to spear a passing fish .
It is the first time one has been seen using a tool to hunt .
The extraordinary image , a world exclusive , was taken in Borneo on the island of Kaja , where apes are rehabilitated into the wild after being rescued from zoos , private homes or even butchers ' shops .

Monkeying around :
An orangutan clings precariously to overhanging branches in a desperate bid to spear a passing fish
" Orang hutan " means " forest man " in one of Indonesia 's many languages and our long - armed cousins do indeed show a remarkable ability to mimic our behaviour .
This individual had seen locals fishing with spears on the Gohong River .
Although the method required too much skill for him to master , he was later able to improvise by using the pole to catch fish already trapped in the locals ' fishing lines .

This talk was delivered at the Mises Circle in Seattle on May 17 , 2008 .
I ’m sure that you have had this experience before , or something similar to it .
You are sitting at lunch in a nice restaurant or perhaps a hotel .
Waiters are coming and going .
The food is fantastic .
The conversation about all things is going well .
You talk about the weather , music , movies , health , trivialities in the news , kids , and so on .
But then the topic turns to economics , and things change .
You are not the aggressive type so you do n’t proclaim the merits of the free market immediately .
You wait and let the others talk .
Their biases against business appear right away in the repetition of the media ’s latest calumny against the market , such as that gas station owners are causing inflation by jacking up prices to pad their pockets at our expense , or that Wal - Mart is , of course , the worst possible thing that can ever happen to a community .
You begin to offer a corrective , pointing out the other side .
Then the truth emerges in the form of a naïve if definitive announcement from one person : “ Well , I suppose I ’m really a socialist at heart . ”
Others nod in agreement .
On one hand there is nothing to say , really .
You are surrounded by the blessings of capitalism .
The buffet table , which you and your lunch partners only had to walk in a building to find , has a greater variety of food at a cheaper price than that which was available to any living person — king , lord , duke , plutocrat , or pope — in almost all of the history of the world .
Not even fifty years ago would this have been imaginable .
All of history has been defined by the struggle for food .
And yet that struggle has been abolished , not just for the rich but for everyone living in developed economies .
The ancients , peering into this scene , might have assumed it to be Elysium .
Medieval man conjured up such scenes only in visions of Utopia .
Even in the late 19th century , the most gilded palace of the richest industrialist required a vast staff and immense trouble to come anywhere near approximating it .
We owe this scene to capitalism .
To put it differently , we owe this scene to centuries of capital accumulation at the hands of free people who have put capital to work on behalf of economic innovations , at once competing with others for profit and cooperating with millions upon millions of people in an ever - expanding global network of the division of labor .
The savings , investments , risks , and work of hundreds of years and uncountable numbers of free people have gone into making this scene possible , thanks to the ever - remarkable capacity for a society developing under conditions of liberty to achieve the highest aspirations of the society ’s members .
And yet , sitting on the other side of the table are well - educated people who imagine that the way to end the world ’s woes is through socialism .
Now , people ’s definitions of socialism differ , and these persons would probably be quick to say that they do not mean the Soviet Union or anything like that .
That was socialism in name only , I would be told .
And yet , if socialism does mean anything at all today , it imagines that there can be some social improvement resulting from the political movement to take capital out of private hands and put it into the hands of the state .
Other tendencies of socialism include the desire to see labor organized along class lines and given some sort of coercive power over how their employers ’ property is used .
It might be as simple as the desire to put a cap on the salaries of CEOs , or it could be as extreme as the desire to abolish all private property , money , and even marriage .
Whatever the specifics of the case in question , socialism always means overriding the free decisions of individuals and replacing that capacity for decision making with an overarching plan by the state .
Taken far enough , this mode of thought wo n’t just spell an end to opulent lunches .
It will mean the end of what we all know as civilization itself .
It would plunge us back to a primitive state of existence , living off hunting and gathering in a world with little art , music , leisure , or charity .
Nor is any form of socialism capable of providing for the needs of the world ’s six billion people , so the population would shrink dramatically and quickly and in a manner that would make every human horror ever known seem mild by comparison .
Nor is it possible to divorce socialism from totalitarianism , because if you are serious about ending private ownership of the means of production , you have to be serious about ending freedom and creativity too .
You will have to make the whole of society , or what is left of it , into a prison .
In short , the wish for socialism is a wish for unparalleled human evil .
If we really understood this , no one would express casual support for it in polite company .
It would be like saying , you know , there is really something to be said for malaria and typhoid and dropping atom bombs on millions of innocents .
Do the people sitting across the table really wish for this ?
Certainly not .
So what has gone wrong here ?
Why can these people not see what is obvious ?
Why ca n’t people sitting amidst market - created plenty , enjoying all the fruits of capitalism every minute of life , not see the merit of the market but rather wish for something that is a proven disaster ?
What we have here is a failure of understanding .
That is to say , a failure to connect causes with effects .
This is a wholly abstract idea .
Knowledge of cause and effect does not come to us by merely looking around a room , living in a certain kind of society , or observing statistics .
You can study roomfuls of data , read a thousand treatises on history , or plot international GDP figures on a graph for a living , and yet the truth about cause and effect can still be evasive .
You still might miss the point that it is capitalism that gives rise to prosperity and freedom .
You might still be tempted by the notion of socialism as savior .
Let me take you back to the years 1989 and 1990 .
These were the years that most of us remember as the time when socialism collapsed in Eastern Europe and Russia .
Events of that time flew in the face of all predications on the right that these were permanent regimes that would never change unless they were bombed back to the Stone Age .
On the left , it was widely believed , even in those times , that these societies were actually doing quite well and would eventually pass the United States and Western Europe in prosperity , and , by some measures , they were already better off than us .
And yet it collapsed .
Even the Berlin Wall , that symbol of oppression and slavery , was torn down by the people themselves .
It was not only glorious to see socialism collapse .
It was thrilling from a libertarian point of view to see how states themselves can dissolve .
They may have all the guns and all the power , and the people have none of those , and yet , when the people themselves decide that they will no longer be governed , the state has few options left .
It eventually collapses amid a society - wide refusal to believe its lies any longer .
When these closed societies suddenly became open , what did we see ?
We saw lands that time forgot .
The technology was backwards and broken .
The food was scarce and disgusting .
The medical care was abysmal .
The people were unhealthy .
Property was polluted .
It was also striking to see what had happened to the culture under socialism .
Many generations had been raised under a system built on power and lies , and so the cultural infrastructure that we take for granted was not secure .
Such notions as trust , promise , truth , honesty , and planning for the future — all pillars of commercial culture — had become distorted and confused by the ubiquity and persistence of the statist curse .
Why am I going through these details about this period , which most of you surely do remember ?
Simply to say this : most people did not see what you saw .
You saw the failure of socialism .
This is what I saw .
This is what Rothbard saw .
This is what anyone who had been exposed to the teachings of economics — to the elementary rules concerning cause and effect in society — saw .
But this is not what the ideological left saw .
The headlines in the socialist publications themselves proclaimed the death of undemocratic Stalinism and looked forward to the creation of a new democratic socialism in these countries .
As for regular people neither attached to the socialist idea nor educated in economics , it might have appeared as nothing more than a glorious vanquishing of America ’s foreign policy enemies .
We built more bombs than they did , so they finally gave in , the way a kid says “ uncle ” on a playground .
Maybe some saw it as a victory of the U.S. constitution over weird and foreign systems of despotism .
Or perhaps it was a victory for the cause of something like free speech over censorship , or the triumph of ballots over bullets .
Now , if the proper lessons of the collapse had been conveyed , we would have seen the error of all forms of government planning .
We would have seen that a voluntary society will outperform a coerced one anytime .
We might see how ultimately artificial and fragile are all systems of statism compared to the robust permanence of a society built on free exchange and capitalist ownership .
And there is another point : the militarism of the cold war had only ended up prolonging the period of socialism by providing these evil governments the chance to stimulate unfortunate nationalist impulses that distracted their domestic populations from the real problem .
It was not the cold war that killed socialism ; rather , once the cold war had exhausted itself , these governments collapsed of their own weight from internal rather than external pressure .
In short , if the world had drawn the lessons we should have from these events , there would be no more need for economic education and no more need even for the bulk of what the Mises Institute does .
In one great moment of history , the contest between capitalism and central planning would have been decided for all time .
I must say that it was more of a shock to me and my colleagues than it should have been , that the essential economic message was lost on most people .
Indeed , it made very little difference in the political spectrum at all .
The contest between capitalism and central planning continued as it always had , and even intensified here at home .
The socialists among us , if they experienced any setback at all , bounded right back , strong as ever , if not more so .
If you doubt it , consider that it only took a few months for these groups to start kvetching about the horrible onslaught that was being wrought by the unleashing of capitalism in Eastern Europe , Russia , and China .
We began hearing complaints about the rise of a hideous consumerism in these countries , about the exploitation of workers at the hands of capitalists , about the rise of the garish super rich .
Piles and piles of news stories appeared about the sad plight of unemployed state workers , who , though loyal to the principles of socialism their entire lives , were now being turned out onto the streets to fend for themselves .
Not even an event as spectacular as the spontaneous meltdown of a superpower and all its client states was enough to impart the message of economic freedom .
And the truth is that it was not necessary .
The whole of our world is covered with lessons about the merit of economic liberty over central planning .
Our everyday lives are dominated by the glorious products of the market , which we all gladly take for granted .
We can open up our web browsers and tour an electronic civilization that the market created , and note that government never did anything useful at all by comparison .
We are also inundated daily by the failures of the state .
We complain constantly that the educational system is broken , that the medical sector is oddly distorted , that the post office is unaccountable , that the police abuse their power , that the politicians have lied to us , that tax dollars are stolen , that whatever bureaucracy we have to deal with is inhumanly unresponsive .
We note all this .
But far fewer are somehow able to connect the dots and see the myriad ways in which daily life confirms that the market radicals like Mises , Hayek , Hazlitt , and Rothbard were correct in their judgments .
What ’s more , this is not a new phenomenon that we can observe in our lifetimes only .
We can look at any country in any period and note that every bit of wealth ever created in the history of mankind has been generated through some kind of market activity , and never by governments .
Free people create ; states destroy .
It was true in the ancient world .
It was true in the first millennium after Christ .
It was true in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance .
And with the birth of complex structures of production and the increasing division of labor in those years , we see how the accumulation of capital led to what might be called a productive miracle .
The world ’s population soared .
We saw the creation of the middle class .
We saw the poor improve their plight and change their own class identification .
The empirical truth has never been hard to come by .
What matters are the theoretical eyes that see .
This is what dictates the lesson we draw from events .
Marx and Bastiat were writing at the same time .
The former said capitalism was creating a calamity and that abolition of ownership was the solution .
Bastiat saw that statism was creating a calamity and that the abolition of state plunder was the solution .
What was the difference between them ?
They saw the same facts , but they saw them in very different ways .
They had a different perception of cause and effect .
I suggest to you that there is an important lesson here as regards the methodology of the social sciences , as well as an agenda and strategy for the future .
Concerning method , we need to recognize that Mises was precisely right concerning the relationship between facts and economic truth .
If we have a solid theory in mind , the facts on the ground provide excellent illustrative material .
They inform us about the application of theory in the world in which we live .
They provided excellent anecdotes and revealing stories of how economic theory is confirmed in practice .
But absent that theory of economics , facts alone are nothing but facts .
They do not convey any information about cause and effect , and they do not point a way forward .
Think of it this way .
Let ’s say you have a bag of marbles that is turned upside down on the ground .
Ask two people their impressions .
The first one understands what numbers mean , what shapes mean , and what colors mean .
This person can give a detailed account of what he sees : how many marbles , what kinds , how big they are , and this person can explain what he sees in different ways potentially for hours .
But now consider the second person , who , we can suppose , has absolutely no understanding of numbers , not even that they exist as abstract ideas .
This person has no comprehension of either shape or color .
He sees the same scene as the other person but cannot provide anything like an explanation of any patterns .
He has very little to say .
All he sees is a series of random objects .
Both these people see the same facts .
But they understand them in very different ways , owing to the abstract notions of meaning that they carry in their minds .
This is why positivism as pure science , a method of assembling a potentially infinite series of data points , is a fruitless undertaking .
Data points on their own convey no theory , suggest no conclusions , and offer no truths .
To arrive at truth requires the most important step that we as human beings can ever take : thinking .
Through this thinking , and with good teaching and reading , we can put together a coherent theoretical apparatus that helps us understand .
Now , we have a hard time conjuring up in our minds the likes of a man who has no comprehension of numbers , colors , or shapes .
And yet I suggest to you that this is precisely what we are facing when we encounter a person who has never thought about economic theory and never studied the implications of the science at all .
The facts of the world look quite random to this person .
He sees two societies next to each other , one free and prosperous and the other unfree and poor .
He looks at this and concludes nothing important about economic systems because he has never thought hard about the relationship between economic systems and prosperity and freedom .
He merely accepts the existence of wealth in one place and poverty in the other as a given , the same way the socialists at a lunch table assumed that the luxurious surroundings and food just happened to be there .
Perhaps they will reach for an explanation of some sort , but absent economic education , it is not likely to be the correct one .
Equally as dangerous as having no theory is having a bad theory that is assembled not by means of logic but by an incorrect view of cause and effect .
This is the case with notions such as the Phillips Curve , which posits a tradeoff relationship between inflation and unemployment .
The idea is that you can drive unemployment down very low if you are willing to tolerate high inflation ; or it can work the other way around : you can stabilize prices provided you are willing to put up with high unemployment .
Now , of course this makes no sense on the microeconomic level .
When inflation is soaring , businesses do n’t suddenly say , hey , let ’s hire a bunch of new people !
Nor do they say , you know , the prices we pay for inventory have not gone up or have fallen .
Let ’s fire some workers !
This much is true about macroeconomics .
It is commonly treated like a subject completely devoid of any connection to microeconomics or even human decision - making .
It is as if we enter into a video game featuring fearsome creatures called Aggregates that battle it out to the death .
So you have one creature called Unemployment , one called Inflation , one called Capital , one called Labor , and so on until you can construct a fun game that is sheer fantasy .
Another example of this came to me just the other day .
A recent study claimed that labor unions increase the productivity of firms .
How did the researchers discern this ?
They found that unionized companies tend to be larger with more overall output than non-unionized companies .
Well , let ’s think about this .
Is it likely that if you close a labor pool to all competition , give that restrictive labor pool the right to use violence to enforce its cartel , permit that cartel to extract higher than market wages from the company and set its own terms concerning work rules and vacations and benefits — is it likely that this will be good for the company in the long run ?
You have to take leave of your senses to believe this .
In fact , what we have here is a simple mix up of cause and effect .
Bigger companies tend to be more likely to attract a kind of unpreventable unionization than smaller ones .
The unions target them , with federal aid .
It is no more or less complicated than that .
It is for the same reason that developed economies have larger welfare states .
The parasites prefer bigger hosts , that ’s all .
We would be making a big mistake to assume that the welfare state causes the developed economy .
That would be as much a fallacy as to believe that wearing $ 2,000 suits causes people to become rich .
I ’m convinced that Mises was right : the most important step economists or economic institutions can take is in the direction of public education in economic logic .
There is another important factor here .
The state thrives on an economically ignorant public .
This is the only way it can get away with blaming inflation or recession on consumers , or claiming that the government ’s fiscal problems are due to our paying too little in taxes .
It is economic ignorance that permits the regulatory agencies to claim that they are protecting us as versus denying us choice .
It is only by keeping us all in the dark that it can continue to start war after war , violating rights abroad and smashing liberties at home , in the name of spreading freedom .
There is only one force that can put an end to the successes of the state , and that is an economically and morally informed public .
Otherwise , the state can continue to spread its malicious and destructive policies .
Do you remember the first time that you began to grasp economic fundamentals ?
It is a very exciting time .
It is as if people with poor eyesight have put on glasses for the first time .
It can consume us for weeks , months , and years .
We read a book like Economics in One Lesson and pore over the pages of Human Action , and for the first time we realize that so much of what other people take for granted is not true , and that there are exciting truths about the world that desperately need to be spread .
To consider just one example , look at the concept of inflation .
For most people , it is seen the way primitive societies might see the onset of a disease .
It is something that sweeps through to cause every kind of wreckage .
The damage is obvious enough , but the source is not .
Everyone blames everyone else , and no solution seems to work .
But once you understand economics , you begin to see that the value of the money is more directly related to its quantity , and that only one institution possesses the power to create money out of thin air without limit : the government - connected central bank .
Economics causes us to broaden our minds to look at the commerce of society from many different points of view .
Instead of just looking at events and phenomena from the perspective of a single consumer or producer , we begin to see the interests of all consumers and all producers .
Instead of thinking only about the short - run effects of certain policies , we think about the long run , and the spin - off effects of certain government policies .
This is the essence of Hazlitt ’s first lesson in his famed book .
By the way , let me interrupt here to make an exciting announcement .
This book was written more than 60 years ago , and it remains the most powerful first book on economics anyone can read .
Even if it is the last book on economics you read , it will stick with you for a lifetime .
It is a hugely important tool , and though I ’m glad that it has stayed in print , I ’ve not been happy with the edition that has long been distributed .
We had long hoped for a hardback version of this amazing classic to make available at a very low price .
Now we have it .
For a person who has read in economics , and absorbed its essential lessons , the world around us becomes vivid and clear , and certain moral imperatives strike us .
We know now that commerce deserves defense .
We see entrepreneurs as great heroes .
We sympathize with the plight of producers .
We see unions not as defenders of rights but as privileged cartels that exclude people who need work .
We see regulations not as consumer protection but rather cost - raising rackets lobbied for by some producers to hurt other producers .
We see antitrust not as a safeguard against corporate excess , but as a bludgeon used by big players against smarter competitors .
In short , economics helps us see the world as it is .
And its contribution lies not in the direction of the assembly of ever more facts , but in helping those facts fit a coherent theory of the world .
And here we see the essence of our job at the Mises Institute .
It is to educate and instill a systematic method for understanding the world as it is .
Our battleground is not the courts , nor the election polls , nor the presidency nor the legislature , and certainly not the wicked arena of lobbying and political payoffs .
Our battleground concerns a domain of existence that is more powerful in the long run .
It concerns the ideas that individuals hold about how the world works .
As we get older and see ever more young generations coming up behind us , we are often struck by the great truth that knowledge in this world is not cumulative over time .
What one generation has learned and absorbed is not somehow passed on to the next one through genetics or osmosis .
Each generation must be taught anew .
Economic theory , I ’m sorry to report , is not written on our hearts .
It was a long time in the process of being discovered .
But now that we know , it must be passed on — and in this way , it is like the ability to read , or to understand great literature .
It is the obligation of our generation to teach the next generation .
And we are not merely talking here of knowledge for knowledge ’s sake .
What is at stake is our prosperity .
It is our standard of living .
It is the well - being of our children and all of society .
It is freedom and the flourishing of civilization that stands in the balance .
Whether we grow and thrive and create and flourish , or wither and die and lose all that we have inherited , ultimately depends on these the abstract ideas we hold concerning cause and effect in society .
These ideas do not usually come to us by pure observation .
They must be taught and explained .
But who or what will teach and explain them ?
This is the crucial role of the Mises Institute .
And not only to teach but to expand the base of knowledge , to make new discoveries , to broaden the reach of the literature , and to add ever more abundantly to the corpus of freedom .
We need to expand its proponents in all walks of life , not only in academia but in all sectors of society .
This is an ambitious agenda , one that Mises himself charged his descendents with .
You are helping us take up this task , and for this we are so grateful .

Economists in the latest Wall Street Journal forecasting survey are increasingly certain the U.S. has slid into recession , a view reinforced by new data showing a sharp drop in retail sales last month .
" The evidence is now beyond a reasonable doubt , " said Scott Anderson of Wells Fargo & Co .
Thirty - six of 51 respondents , or more than 70 % , said ...
WASHINGTON 
With a fresh strategy team in place , the presidential campaign of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton sought Monday to reassure supporters , contributors and Democratic delegates that her candidacy would withstand and be rejuvenated by the second leadership shakeup in two months .
Geoff Garin , a Democratic pollster , and Howard Wolfson , a longtime adviser to Mrs. Clinton , formally began their duties coordinating the campaign ’s strategic message , replacing her chief strategist , Mark Penn .
They worked feverishly  behind the scenes and through public channels  to convey that Mrs. Clinton ’s efforts to win her party ’s presidential nomination had not let up despite turmoil surrounding Mr. Penn ’s departure .
Mr. Penn , a leading adviser to Bill and Hillary Clinton since 1996 , relinquished his role as chief campaign strategist on Sunday after apologizing for holding talks with officials from the Colombian government about a bilateral trade treaty with the United States that Mrs. Clinton opposes .
He met with the Colombians in his role as chief executive of Burson - Marsteller , a global public relations firm .
Mr. Penn ’s departure followed months of infighting between him and other Clinton aides .
The refurbished Clinton team faced challenges on Monday on two critical fronts : trying to contain any fallout from union members and other blue - collar workers who are essential to her success , and seeking to persuade key supporters and donors that Mr. Penn ’s removal could breathe new energy into the campaign .
BLOOMINGTON , Ind. --
The asteroid presumed to have wiped out the dinosaurs struck the Earth with such force that carbon deep in the Earth 's crust liquefied , rocketed skyward , and formed tiny airborne beads that blanketed the planet , say scientists from the U.S. , U.K. , Italy , and New Zealand in this month 's Geology .
The beads , known to geologists as carbon cenospheres , cannot be formed through the combustion of plant matter , contradicting a hypothesis that the cenospheres are the charred remains of an Earth on fire .
If confirmed , the discovery suggests environmental circumstances accompanying the 65 - million - year - old extinction event were slightly less dramatic than previously thought .
" Carbon embedded in the rocks was vaporized by the impact , eventually forming new carbon structures in the atmosphere , " said Indiana University Bloomington geologist Simon Brassell , study coauthor and former adviser to the paper 's lead author , Mark Harvey .
The carbon cenospheres were deposited 65 million years ago next to a thin layer of the element iridium -- an element more likely to be found in Solar System asteroids than in the Earth 's crust .
The iridium - laden dust is believed to be the shattered remains of the 200 - km - wide asteroid 's impact .
Like the iridium layer , the carbon cenospheres are apparently common .
They 've been found in Canada , Spain , Denmark and New Zealand .
But the cenospheres ' origin presented a double mystery .
The cenospheres had been known to geologists only as a sign of modern times -- they form during the intense combustion of coal and crude oil .
Equally baffling , there were no power plants burning coal or crude oil 65 million years ago , and natural burial processes affecting organic matter from even older ages -- such as coals from the 300 - million - year - old Carboniferous Period -- had simply not been cooked long or hot enough .
" Carbon cenospheres are a classic indicator of industrial activity , " Harvey said .
" The first appearance of the carbon cenospheres defines the onset of the industrial revolution . "
The scientists concluded the cenospheres could have been created by a new process , the violent pulverization of the Earth 's carbon - rich crust .
Geologists do believe the Earth burned in spots as molten rock and super - hot ash fell out of the sky and onto flammable plant matter .
But the charcoal - ized products of these fires only appear in some places on Earth , and are more often found near the asteroid impact site of Chicxulub Crater , just west of Mexico 's Yucatan Peninsula .
Some geologists had thought all carbon particles resulting from the impact was ash from global scale forest fires , but the present research strongly contradicts that assumption .
The scientists examined rock samples from eight marine locations in New Zealand , Italy , Denmark and Spain .
They also examined carbon - rich particles from five non-marine locations in the U.S. and Canada .
Following chemical and microscopic analysis , the researchers concluded the particles were carbon cenospheres , similar to the ones produced by industrial combustion .
The scientists also found that the farther the sample site was from the Chicxulub Crater , the smaller the cenospheres tended to be .
That observation is consistent with the expectation that particles were produced by the asteroid impact , since once the particles are ejected , heavier particles should fall back to Earth sooner ( and travel shorter distances ) than lighter particles .
Last , the scientists estimated the total mass of carbon cenospheres ejected by the asteroid collision , assuming a global distribution , to be perhaps as much as 900 quadrillion kilograms .
Whether or not the carbon cenospheres are truly ubiquitous , however , needs further corroboration .
" There are still clues to unravel about the events occurring around the time of the impact , " Brassell said .
" And there are aspects of the Earth 's natural carbon cycle that we did n't previously consider . "
Harvey is interested in the unique properties of the cenospheres themselves .
" Perhaps we can generate and study carbon cenospheres to better understand them , " he said .
" We also need to look for the cenospheres in other parts of the world and also around the time of other extinction events . "

Harvey conducted the research while he was a master 's student at IU Bloomington .
He is now a geoscientist for Sinclair Knight Merz in New Zealand .
Claire Belcher ( University of London ) and Alessandro Montanari ( Coldigioco Geological Observatory ) also contributed to the study .
It was funded by the Geological Society of America , the Indiana University Department of Geological Sciences , and the Society for Organic Petrology .

JAPAN will pay compensation of three million yen ( $ 30,000 ) to an Australian woman who was raped in 2002 by a US sailor who never faced prosecution .
But the victim , who uses the pseudonym of Jane , says it means little because the rapist is still free .
The woman was raped in 2002 by a then sailor of the USS Kitty Hawk aircraft carrier in the naval port city of Yokosuka , south of Tokyo .
Japanese prosecutors dropped the case without pressing a charge against the sailor .
Researchers at the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at MIT report in the Jan. 24 online edition of Science that they have created a way to see , for the first time , the effect of blocking and unblocking a single neural circuit in a living animal .
This revolutionary method allowed Susumu Tonegawa , Picower Professor of Biology and Neuroscience , and colleagues to see how bypassing a major memory - forming circuit in the brain affected learning and memory in mice .
“ Our data strongly suggest that the hippocampal neural pathway called the tri-synaptic pathway , or TSP , plays a crucial role in quickly forming memories when encountering new events and episodes in day - to - day life , ” Tonegawa said .
“ Our results indicate that the decline of these abilities , such as that which accompanies neurodegenerative diseases and normal aging in humans , is likely to be due , at least in part , to the malfunctioning of this circuit . ”
Combining several cutting - edge genetic engineering techniques , Tonegawa ’s laboratory invented a method called doxycycline - inhibited circuit exocytosis - knockdown , or DICE - K–an acronym that also reflects Tonegawa ’s admiration of ace Boston Red Sox pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka .
DICE-K allows researchers for the first time to induce and reverse a blockade of synaptic transmission in specific neural circuits in the hippocampus .
“ The brain is the most complex machine ever assembled on this planet , ” Tonegawa said .
“ Our cognitive abilities and behaviors are based on tens of thousands of molecules that compose several billion neurons , as well as how those neurons are connected .
“ One effective way to understand how this immensely complex cellular network works in a major form of cognition like memory is to intervene in the specific neural circuit suspected to be involved , ” he said .
Computing memories
The hippocampus , a seahorse - shaped brain region , plays a part in memory and spatial navigation .
In Alzheimer ’s disease , the hippocampus is one of the first regions to suffer damage ; memory problems and disorientation are among the disease ’s first symptoms .
The hippocampus is made up of several regions –CA1 , CA3 and the dentate gyrus–that are wired up with distinct pathways .
The MIT study sought to determine how the interactions between neural pathways and the hippocampal regions affect learning and memory tasks .
Imagine that the three hippocampal regions are computers , and neural pathways are the conduits through which the computers get data from all over the brain .
The computers perform different tasks , so the types of data processing will depend on which conduits the data travels through .
The hippocampus has two major , parallel information - carrying routes : the tri-synaptic pathway ( TSP ) and the shorter monosynaptic pathway ( MSP ) .
The TSP includes data processing from all three hippocampal regions , whereas the MSP skips through most of them .
Using DICE-K , the researchers were surprised to find that mice in which the major TSP pathway was shut down could still learn to navigate a maze .
The shorter MSP pathway was sufficient for the job .
However , the maze is a task that is slowly learned over many repeated trials .
When the mice were tested with a different task in a new environment that required rapid learning and memory formation , the researchers found that the mice with TSP shut down could not perform the task .
Thus , the TSP pathway is required for animals to quickly acquire memories in a new environment .
“ This kind of learning results in the most sophisticated form of memory that makes animals more intelligent and is known to decline with age , ” Tonegawa said .

Although many neuroscientists are trying to figure out how the brain works , Mark Changizi is bent on determining why it works that way .
In the past , the assistant professor of cognitive science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has demonstrated that the shapes of letters in 100 writing systems reflect common ones seen in nature :
Take the letter " A " — it looks like a mountain , he says .
And " Y " might remind one of a tree with branches .
He also showed that across different languages most characters take three strokes to write out .
That 's because , he says , three is the highest quantity a person 's brain can perceive without resorting to counting .
But Changizi's theories are n't limited to writing .
He also believes that primates developed the ability to see in color so that they could figure out if peers were sending emotional cues .
He hatched that theory by comparing the light wavelengths given off by the facial skin of someone blushing to that of a person not flushed .
The prolific Changizi recently published two papers : one that sets out to explain how our lexical systems evolved and another that suggests how the brain 's visual system is adapted to anticipate the future a fraction of a second before we actually see it .
( See related slideshow here . )
Changizi spoke to ScientificAmerican.com about his newest research ; what his forthcoming book , The Vision R( evolution ) : How the Latest Research Overturns Everything We Thought We Knew About Human Vision , has to do with superheroes ; and what kind of scientist he is .
What 's the goal of your research ?
My goal is to understand the principles underlying the design of the brain or visual system or cultural artifact , like language or writing systems .
I 'm not as interested in the mechanisms per se .
People like me make the point that you can't even study those mechanisms without having an idea what those mechanisms are trying to compute .
So you have to have some opinion about what the design or function of those mechanisms are for to even do that .
So , I am focusing on the function from a teleological [ purposive ] point of view .
Of course it 's unpacked with natural selection or cultural evolution .
Are you characterizing the functions of certain systems , so that other researchers can work on how a system performs its tasks ?
It 's certainly a consequence of my work that someone else will be in a better position to pose mechanisms when they know the big constraint of : " What is it that my mechanisms need to be computing ? "
But , that 's not why I do it .
I 'm excited about the selection pressures undergoing why we see in color :
What is color for ?
What is it optimized for ?
Only 1 percent of me is interested in the fact that it 's implemented in the particular way it 's implemented in some part of the brain .
... [ My work ] often makes some predictions about specific aspects of the mechanisms , but once that information is there , there could be infinitely many mechanisms that could carry out that function .
One of your more recent papers deals with the Oxford English Dictionary as an economically organized collection of the words in the English language ?
What is it about its organization that makes it so optimal ?
If you gave definitions of all the words on the basis of some small set of atomic words , then you would have two levels of words : the bottom level , [ a ] small set of atomic words ( between 10 and 50 ) and the other , roughly 100,000 .
That would be a very costly dictionary in terms of the size that 's required .
The signature of an optimally organized lexicon is : you instead take that small set of words and you use them to find a slightly larger set of slightly more complicated words , which are in turn used to build a slightly larger set of still more complicated words and so on .
When you do that seven times , or so , that will then allow you to utilize the minimum amount of definition space to find the target words that you are really interested in defining in the first place .
What type of words serve as the bottom rung , or atomic words , in the lexicon ?
The ones that come out from WordNet [ a lexical database of the English language developed at Princeton that ranks words from the most basic to the most complex ] are words like : abstraction , act , entity , event , group , phenomenon , possession , etcetera .
How does this manner of organization reflect a mechanism in our brain ?
My interpretation of this result is that culture has over time evolved the meanings of the words in our lexicon so as to minimize the total size of definitions .
And the reason that was selected for was because that way we could all fit more words in the head and have a richer vocabulary .
Does that imply an underlying drive toward efficiency or conciseness ?
Sometimes when you speak about evolution , you mistakenly say that evolution is striving for developing a wing .
But , it 's blind cultural evolution .
Over time , meanings of words are going to change .
The structure of the lexicon is passed on , generation to generation , there 'll be selection pressure changing it in certain ways .
Sometimes it will change in ways that are hurtful , making it harder for people to remember .
Those will tend to change back over time .
So , it 's blind cultural selection with no directionality per se .
If the dictionary study involves cultural evolution as its driver , then the new work on the visual system involves natural selection –based evolution .
Why is it that we need to " perceive the present , " as you put it , or see into the future ?
Animals who move or are in a world that moves around them — as long as there are things moving somehow relative to you — will be selected to have perceptions that are true .
We have about a tenth of a second delay between the time light hits the retina and the time of resultant perception , which is considerable given that you move 10 centimeters [ four inches ] in that amount of time even if you 're only walking one meter [ 3.3 feet ] per second .
That means that if you did n't compensate for this neural delay , anything you perceive to be within 10 centimeters of passing ….
[ It ] would have just passed you by the time you perceive it .
You 'd always be seeing the world as it was a tenth of a second earlier and seeing what the world looks like 10 centimeters behind where you in fact are -- if you had n't run into whatever it is you 're looking for .
So , in the new work , you detail various optical illusions .
( See related slideshow here . )
Do these illusions result from all the errors in our visual system that need to be compensated for ?
In this work , it 's ones dealing only with forward motion , which is , I think , one of the main kinds of motion that we 're good at dealing with .
Even when you 're standing still or rotating , for example , that 's going to be a different kind of optic flow .
Potentially , we 're able to correct for those , too .
But , all of these illusions turn out to be explainable from forward motion correlates .
We 're doing compensation all over the place .
We play video games where there are made - up rules of optical flow that our visual systems can figure out on the fly .
In the new work , you were able to sort optical illusions into categories based on four visual features that were being misperceived .
What particular features are those ?
There are four different domains of misperception :
The first is illusions of size .
The second is illusions of speed .
The third is luminance , or contrast .
The last is illusions of perceived distance .
Now , there are different ways of affecting those kinds of misperceptions — the key features that are causing those illusions .
For example , size differences within your visual field could cause misperceptions or illusions of speed .
So , does this work fit in with your forthcoming book , The Vision R( evolution ) ?
The book is about four stories about four of the big areas of vision :
The first is motion , which is this perceiving the present stuff ; binocular vision , which concerns the evolution of forward - facing eyes ; color and luminance , which is like the skin work ; and object recognition — this is a little bit more of a stretch — but it connects to the evolution of writing and reading .
The four areas all have an evolutionary side to them .
Furthermore , they all have a superhero angle to them .
You can describe the perceiving the present stuff as future - seeing .
People have proposed superheroes that see the future and , in a weak sense , we do , too .
For the evolution of forward - facing eyes , I am arguing that it is for a kind of x-ray vision .
It actually allows us to see through stuff — like when you hold up a finger vertically and you see through it instead of beyond it .
For animals that are large and living in forested environments , there should be selection pressure for forward - facing eyes , because you can actually see more of your environment .
For color vision , the cones that we have in our eyes — that [ other ] mammals do n't — are evolved to see the oxygenation modulations in the blood , because we want to sense the emotions in others .
We really have external - sensing equipment that …[ is ] … empathic in nature — mind reading and emotion - reading , like the annoying character in Star Trek , the empath .
A bit of a stretch of the theme is spirit - reading , our ability to read the thoughts of the dead .
Object recognition ( reading and writing ) has allowed us to read the thoughts of the dead .
So , it 's four different stories connected by these kinds of themes .
Interesting .
So , putting all this together , what do you consider your field ?
Is it cognitive science ?
I would call it theoretical neurobiology in vision .
But , it does n't get at the fact that I am more evolutionary - directed , rather than computational modeling - directed — so I think evolutionary , theoretical neurobiologist would be slightly more representative .
Last week ’s stock market blowout added more than 4 per cent to the Dow Jones Industrials , but it had no affect on Libor rates .
Libor rose steadily from Tuesday through Friday signaling more troubles in the banking system .
Libor , which means London Interbank - Offered Rate , is the rate that banks charge each other for loans .
It has a dramatic effect on nearly every area of investment .
When the rate soars , as it did last week , it means that the banks are either too weak financially to lend to each other or too worried about the ability of the other bank to repay them back .
Either way , it puts a crimp in lending .
Banks serve as the transmission point for credit to the broader economy via business and consumer loans .
When they ’re bogged down by their own bad investments or when risks increase , rates go up , lending slows , business activity decreases and GDP shrinks .
It ’s a vicious circle .
The sudden surge in stocks is not a sign that things are back to normal ; far from it .
If anything , things are worse than ever .
Credit remains unusually tight despite Bernanke ’s cuts to the Fed Funds rate or the creation of various “ auction facilities ” that remove mortgage - backed securities ( MBS ) from banks balance sheets .
Businesses and consumers are still having a hard time getting funding , which means that the velocity of money in the financial system is decelerating rapidly and this increases the likelihood of a system - wide freeze - up .
Libor is just the flashing red light .
A rise in Libor adds billions in additional interest payments for homeowners , businesses and other borrowers .
According to the Wall Street Journal :
“ Libor is one of the world ’s most important financial indicators .
It serves as a benchmark for $ 900 billion in subprime mortgage loans that adjust — typically every six months — according to its movements .
Companies globally have nearly $ 9 trillion in debt with interest payments pegged to Libor , according to data provider Dealogic . ”
Commercial real estate deals are mostly pegged to Libor as are adjustable rate mortgages ( ARMs ) .
In fact , most of the mortgages that were written up during the boom - years were tied to Libor .
That ’s why Peter Fitzgerald , chief financial officer at Radco Cos. , said , “ If Libor were at 4 per cent instead of under 3 per cent , there would be a disaster that would take years to unwind . ” ( WSJ )
A rising Libor puts the Fed and the Bank of England in a tough spot .
They ’re trying to keep rates artificially low so the banks can increase their lending and recoup their losses , but the market is not cooperating .
The market is driving Libor upward , which means the Fed is losing control .
The real cost of money is going up .
The Bank of England was forced to intervene on Monday .
Mervyn King , the UK ’s central bank governor , launched a “ Special Liquidity Scheme ” to “ improve the liquidity of the banking system and raise confidence in financial markets while ensuring that the risk of losses on the loans they have made remains with the banks . ”
The plan will provide $ 100 billion for “ illiquid assets of sufficiently high quality ” ( Mortgage - backed securities ) to “ unfreeze ” bank lending .
The plan is similar to the Fed ’s auction facilities which have provided over $ 200 billion in exchange for dodgy MBS , collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) and commercial paper ( ABCP ) According to Bloomberg :
“ The Central Bank ’s move allows financial institutions to add government bonds to their inventory of liquid assets and make it easier for them to raise cash and lend , especially to consumers seeking home loans .
In return the government will hold the riskier mortgage - backed securities . ”
The Bank of England said the swaps would be for a period of one year and could be renewed for up to three years , although the banks would be on the hook for losses on their loans .
It ’s a sweet deal for the investment banks and a total loser for the British taxpayer who could get stuck with hundreds of billions of worthless MBS .
The $ 100 billion liquidity - injection is the biggest bailout in the Bank ’s history , and it was granted without public input or Parliamentary authorization , just like the Bear Sterns transaction .
The bankers call the shots while the public picks up the tab .
The Bank ’s action puts to rest the idea that “ the worst is behind us ” .
It is n’t ; in fact , recent estimates suggest that the losses to the banking system could exceed $ 1 trillion .
There ’s still a lot of carnage ahead .
The $ 100 billion will help to stabilize the money markets and put the banks on sounder footing , but it does nothing to help the housing market .
The British real estate market is on life support because most of the mortgage financing was coming from investors who bought MBS .
Mortgage securities are currently down 92 percent from the same period last year , which leaves potential buyers without a funding source .
The BOE is considering creating a British - style Fannie Mae to kick - start the stalled housing industry by providing government - backed loans .
The private sector will not be a big player in the housing market for the foreseeable future .
The same is true in the US .
If the Fed ca n’t bring Libor down with interest rate cuts , then it will have to develop a back - up plan .
The next step would be “ quantitative easing ” ; a monetary policy that was implemented by the Bank of Japan in 2001 “ to revive that country ’s economy that was stagnant for a decade .
Quantitative easing entails flooding the banking system with excess reserves , resulting in pushing the benchmark overnight bank lending to zero . ” ( Reuters )
There are indications that Bernanke is already preparing for this radical option , but there ’s little chance that it will succeed .
Whether the banks are able to lend or not is irrelevant .
Public attitudes towards indebtedness have changed dramatically in the past few months .
Overextended consumers are looking for ways to pay off their debts .
This will make it more difficult for Bernanke to reflate the equity bubble through credit expansion .
When people are frightened or pessimistic about the future , they naturally curtail their spending .
A recent poll conducted by the Washington Post / ABC illustrates how the public ’s attitude towards the economy has darkened in a matter of months .
According to the survey :
“ Nine out of ten Americans now give the economy a negative rating , with a majority saying it is in ‘ poor ’ shape , the most to say so in more than 15 years .
And the sense that things are bad has spread swiftly .
The percentage who hold a negative view of the economy is up 33 points over the last year , and the percentage who rate the economy ‘ poor ’ has increased 13 points in the last two months .
That is the quickest 60 - day decline since the Post and ABC started asking the question in 1985 ” ( Washington Post )
The average American is showing a better grasp of the deteriorating economic conditions than the stock market .
Housing sales continue to tumble , manufacturing is off , unemployment is steadily increasing , retail sales are flat , and inflation is soaring .
Consumers are feeling the pinch of rising food and energy costs , loss of home equity and a general downturn in the credit markets .
Money is tight and jobs are scarce .
ARE YOU BETTER OFF THAN YOU WERE 8 YEARS AGO ?
When George W. Bush took office in 2000 , oil was $ 28 per barrel , the euro was $ .87 on the dollar , gold was $ 274 per ounce .
Today , oil is a record $ 114 per barrel , the euro is nudging $ 1.60 on the dollar , gold is $ 945 per ounce .
The country is presently engaged in a $ 2 trillion war in Iraq with no end in sight .
The federal government has expanded over 30 per cent under Bush .
Wages for working people have stagnated , unemployment has risen , 47 million Americans are without health care , and the economy is slipping into recession .
Now the banks are buried beneath a mountain of bad investments and foreclosures are at record highs .
In California 65,000 homes are now in some stage of foreclosure while the total number of homes sold in February — new and used — was a mere 20,513 .
The knock - on effects of the housing bust are just now rippling through the broader economy .
Consumer spending is sluggish , growth is weak , and the stock market is more volatile than anytime since the 1930s .
The Fed has usurped congressional powers to deal with insolvency problems at the banks .
Public money is now being provided for the purchase of dubious assets held by unregulated investment banks owned by private speculators .
The Fed is simply making up the rules as it goes along .
Bernanke ’s actions have not yet been challenged by any congressman or senator .
The Fed ’s monetary policies have triggered a run-up in commodities prices which is driving up the cost of everything from corn to copper .
Food riots have broken out in capitals around the world and leaders are worried about growing political instability .
The media is blaming drought , high energy prices , and biofuels for the sudden rise in prices , but these are only secondary factors .
Currency devaluation has played a bigger role than shortages or blight .
The world is awash in dollars which are steadily losing value .
Pension funds and foreign central banks are diverting dollars into commodities rather than keeping them in corporate bonds or the sagging stock market .
Here ’s an excerpt from the Wall Street Journal that sums it up :
“ Inflation is rising throughout the world due to dollar weakness , and the prices of such commodities as oil and corn have soared .
.. As former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker noted last week , we are already in a “ dollar crisis ” .
Even the IMF — typically the temple of devaluationists — is alarmed by the dollar ’s fall .
Dollar weakness has already contributed to soaring commodity prices that have walloped US consumers just when their spending is most needed to offset the housing slump .
… The commodity boom is result in large part of the Fed ’s weak dollar policy , and it may have tipped the US into recession that could have been avoided . ” ( Wall Street Journal )
Foreign banks and investors currently hold $ 6 trillion in dollar - based assets and currency .
When the dollar falls ; speculation will increase and prices will rise .
Currently , the US is exporting its inflation and fueling political unrest in the process .
If Bernanke continues to slash interest rates , the problems will only get worse .
The Fed could raise rates by 50 basis points tomorrow and the commodities bubble would explode overnight , but that does n’t look likely .
The idea that soaring commodity prices are the result of speculation is controversial .
The economist Paul Krugman does not think that “ low interest rates and irrational exuberance ” are responsible for the high prices .
Rather , he thinks they are the result of “ rapidly growing demand and constrained supply ” .
This is certainly possible .
Perhaps , there is no bubble at all .
Currency Intervention to Save the Dollar
The G - 7 finance ministers met in Washington last week and announced their “ resolve ” to minimize the volatility in the currency markets .
Many people took this to mean that foreign central banks would take a more active role in shoring up the dollar .
So far , there ’s been no indication of support .
The dollar has stayed within the $ 1.58 - 1.59 per euro range for more than a week .
Help could be on the way but , then , maybe not .
The only one who can really save the dollar now , is Bernanke .
All he needs to do is indicate that the rate cuts are over and the bleeding will stop .
Bernanke has already cut the Fed Funds rate from 5.25 per cent to 2.25 per cent since September .
( way below the 4.1 per cent rate of inflation )
It ’s clear that he sees a deflationary tidal wave about to hit sometime in the next few quarters .
Why else would he slash rates so aggressively .
Last week , former Fed chairman Paul Volcker took the unusual step of publicly chastising Bernanke in a speech he gave to the Economic Club of New York .
Volcker ’s comments indicate the level of frustration with the Fed ’s dollar - savaging rate cuts which have caused problems around the world .
Volcker said “ The recession is not the Fed ’s problem .
It ’s the government ’s .
The Fed ’s job is to defend the currency and fight inflation — exactly the opposite of what this Fed is doing . ”
The former Fed chief thinks Bernanke should raise rates now , because if he does n’t , he ’ll have to raise them even more later , “ with even more awful consequences . ”
Martin Feldstein , chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Ronald Reagan , joined Volcker in blasting the Fed and calling for an end to the rate cuts .
In a Wall Street Journal editorial on April 15 Feldstein said :
“ It ’s time for the Federal Reserve to stop reducing the federal funds rate , because the likely benefit is small compared to the potential damage ….
Lower interest rates could raise the already high prices of energy and food , which are already triggering riots in developing countries .
In order to offset the inflationary impact of higher imported commodity prices , central banks in those countries may raise interest rates .
Such contractionary policies would reduce real incomes and exacerbate political instability …. lowering interest rates stimulates economic activity to a point at which labor and product markets cause wages and prices to rise .
That is unlikely to happen in the U.S. in the coming year .
The general weakness of the economy will keep most wages and prices from rising more rapidly …..
But high unemployment and low capacity utilization would not prevent lower interest rates from driving up commodity prices .
“ Lower interest rates induce investors to add commodities to their portfolios .
When rates are low , portfolio investors will bid up the prices of oil and other commodities to levels at which the expected future returns are in line with the lower rates . ”
Additional cuts will probably have negligible effect on housing and consumer spending , but they could be a fatal blow to the dollar .
It ’s not worth it .
Lower rates will be devastating for people living in poorer countries .
In the US , middle class families spend only 15 percent of net earnings on food .
In poorer countries people spend upwards of 75 percent of their income just trying to feed themselves .
That ’s why riots are breaking out everywhere ; the Fed ’s monetary policy is a catalyst for political instability .
Besides , lower interest rates do n’t necessarily increase demand or make credit more easily available .
The only way to spark demand is to make sure that wages keep pace with production so that workers can buy the things they produce .
In other words , a prosperous economy requires a strong and well - paid work - force .

Recently I was arguing with one of my dumber friends about the Iraq war .
He loves Bush and thinks bigger bombs is the answer in Iraq .
I wasnâ€™t gaining any ground in the argument until I used a simple analogy .
I said , â€ œYour solution is like shattering an expensive vase and then saying , â€ ˜We need to keep smashing it until itâ€™s fixed .
â€™â€ 
I stumped him .
He was silent .
So hereâ€™s a brief list of other analogies you can use on your dumb friends .
And the truth is , Iâ€™ve seen similar ones work on some of the smartest political pundits .
1 ) The country of Iraq has essentially been demolished .
The right - wingers keep saying the answer is continued large - scale military action .
Thatâ€™s like if someone got into a car accident , went into a coma , and the doctors believed the patient could be healed by more car accidents .
So they just keep putting him into cars and sending him off cliffs .
2 ) Iâ€™ve heard people say that being against Bush or Petraeus or the war in Iraq is equivalent to being against the troops .
Thatâ€™s like if I knew someone who repeatedly sent brave puppies out into traffic .
I called that person an asshole for abusing the puppies and abusing their power .
Then you accused me of being anti-puppy .
3 ) The administration talks about the success of the surge because violence has decreased , but weâ€™re in fact paying the militias not to kill each other or our soldiers .
Itâ€™s like if you were treading water , two sharks approach and begin biting you , you give each one a small piece of fish to distract them .
While they take a moment to eat the fish , you sit there treading water and yelling , â€ œProblem solved !â€ 
4 ) At the Petraeus hearings , he refused to give any sort of definition for â€œvictoryâ€ in Iraq .
Thatâ€™s like running a foot race , youâ €™ve gone 30 miles , youâ€ ™re exhausted , and when you ask your coach driving along next to you how much farther , he just keeps saying â€ œYouâ€™ll know it when you get there .â€ 
He keeps saying that until you collapse and die .
5 ) We claim to be â€œfighting the terroristsâ€ in Iraq , but in fact our presence is helping to create more terrorists .
The disaster in Iraq serves as a great training and recruiting tool for an entire generation of terrorists .
Itâ€™s like trying to kill a gremlin by dousing him in water .
6 ) KBR , Halliburton , Blackwater and other companies have huge pull in our government ( such as the vice presidency ) .
So essentially they decide when the war is over .
They also happen to be making millions upon millions of dollars from the war .
So asking them to decide when the war is over , is like asking an ugly guy cast in a threesome porn movie to decide when the scene is over .
Chances are the scene would go on for months , if not years .
The entire crew would be standing around asking , â€ œItâ€™s not over yet ?
When will we know when itâ€™s time to end it ?â€ 
And the ugly guy would respond , â€ œUm , itâ€™s a bad idea to set timetables .
Just trust me on this.â€ 
7 ) Lastly , President Bush is like a colorblind child with a Rubikâ€™s Cube .
Over the past four years Lee Camp has performed stand - up comedy at over 300 colleges nationwide , but we do n’t hold that against him .
He was called one of the best New Faces at the Montreal Comedy Festival , and he ’s been featured on Comedy Central .
He has also performed countless shows with Laughing Liberally , and writes and produces comedic activism videos .
He recently went on Fox News ’s morning show and called them a “ parade of propaganda and a festival of ignorance . ”
The clip was viewed over half a million times online .
An unmarked black SUV now follows him everywhere he goes .
If you buy a regular old book , CD or DVD , you can turn around and loan it to a friend , or sell it again .
The right to pass it along is called the " first sale " doctrine .
Digital books , music and movies are a different story though .
Four students at Columbia Law School 's Science and Technology Law Review looked at the particular issue of reselling and copying e-books downloaded to Amazon 's Kindle or the Sony Reader , and came up with answers to a fundamental question :
Are you buying a crippled license to intellectual property when you download , or are you buying an honest - to - God book ?
Advertisement
In the fine print that you " agree " to , Amazon and Sony say you just get a license to the e-books — you 're not paying to own 'em , in spite of the use of the term " buy . "
Digital retailers say that the first sale doctrine — which would let you hawk your old Harry Potter hardcovers on eBay — no longer applies .
Your license to read the book is unlimited , though — so even if Amazon or Sony changed technologies , dropped the biz or just got mad at you , they legally could n't take away your purchases .
Still , it 's a license you can't sell .
But is this claim legal ?
Our Columbia friends suggest that just because Sony or Amazon call it a license , that does n't make it so .
" That 's a factual question determined by courts , " say our legal brainiacs .
" Even if a publisher calls it a license , if the transaction actually looks more like a sale , users will retain their right to resell the copy . "
Score one for the home team .

There 's a kicker , though :
If a court ruled with you on that front , you still can't sell reproductions of your copy , an illegal act tantamount to Xeroxing your Harry Potters .
You 'd have to sell the physical media where the " original " download is stored — a hard drive or the actual Kindle or Sony Reader .
Our guess is that it only gets more complicated from here .
What happens when the file itself resides only on some $ 20 - per-month Google storage locker ?
For more details , have a look at the original , surprisingly readable legal summary :
The ( Potential ) Legal Validity of E-book Reader Restrictions By Rajiv Batra , John Padro , Seung - Ju Paik and Sarah Calvert Many users are unhappy that e-book readers , such as the Sony Reader and the Amazon Kindle , restrict the sharing , borrowing and transferring of e-books .
While some argue that the " first sale " doctrine should allow users to transfer an e-book in the same manner as a hard - copy book , these contentious restrictions may be valid under current law .
The Sony Reader and the Amazon Kindle The Sony Reader and the Amazon Kindle are portable media devices designed to carry and display e-books and other electronic documents .
Kindle has a mobile broadband function that allows users to browse online content and download e-books while on the go .
Alternatively , the Sony Reader requires users to download and manage their library of e-books via a home computer .
The contentious characteristic of both products is that they bar users from sharing their e-books with other users .
For example , Kindle 's license agreement grants a " non-exclusive right to keep a permanent copy ... solely for your personal , non-commercial use . "
Consequently , Kindle users may " not sell , rent , lease , distribute , broadcast , sublicense or otherwise assign any rights to ... any third party . "
The Sony Reader has similarly restrictive language in its license , but does allow users to copy e-books to several other Readers as long as they are registered to the same account .
The First Sale Doctrine Some users have argued that these license restrictions violate the " first sale " doctrine .
Under the Copyright Act , the first sale doctrine allows the owner of a particular copy of a work to sell , lease or rent that copy to anyone they want at any price they choose .
These rights only apply , however , to the particular copy that was purchased ; any unauthorized reproduction or copying of that work constitutes copyright infringement .
For instance , you can't give away photocopies of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , but you can auction your paperback on eBay when you 're finished with it .
When it comes to digital works , however , two complications arise : first , consumers might only hold a license to the content , rather than all of the rights that come from a sale ; second , without a traditional physical container for each purchased work , consumers may not practically be able to sell their " particular copy " at all .
License vs. Sale
The first sale doctrine only applies to the " owner " of a copy of a work , so end users who acquire content by license do not enjoy the right to resell their copies .
Whether a transaction is a license or a sale is a factual question determined by courts — even if a publisher calls it a license , if the transaction actually looks more like a sale , users will retain their right to resell the copy .
However , as more commercial transactions involve the transfer of digital content — particularly commercial software — courts have struggled to consistently make the distinction between license and sale .
Software is increasingly transferred with highly restrictive licensing terms , but federal case law has not clearly determined whether these types of transfers are licenses or true sales .
Kindle and the Sony Reader are following this licensing trend and creating restrictive licenses that users must agree to upon using the product .
If these agreements are found to be enforceable licenses , they could serve as the legal authority to limit users from selling or otherwise transferring the e-books they download .
Amazon vs. Sony
Both license schemes are equally restrictive , but each product limits use in a slightly different manner .
Amazon Kindle 's use license expressly limits the extent and use of both the device and the digital media .
The Sony Reader 's restrictions operate in two steps : a license to use the device and a second license to use the e-book library software ( created by Sony ) .
In both devices , users are not allowed to circumvent or alter the pre-installed software on the device .
For digital media , Kindle 's agreement allows users one permanent copy .
The Reader , on the other hand , allows one user to posses multiple copies as long as they are all registered to that user .
Both regimes are equally restrictive on the distribution , copying , and sharing of purchased e-books ( to other users ) .
The reason for the differences in these restrictions is a result of their technical characteristics .
Amazon 's wireless store requires the terms to be agreed on initially , while the Sony Reader 's reliance on iTunes - like software allows a separate use agreement .
In effect , both agreements accomplish the same level of restriction , but you have a little more leeway with the number of copies with the Sony Reader .
Hard Copies vs. Digital Copies
Another possible complication stems from the inherent difference between transferring an e-book and transferring a hard - copy book .
The transfer of a hard - copy book is just that ; the physical transfer of one copy .
The transfer of an e-book , however , requires the digital recreation or copying of that e-book .
Because the first sale doctrine allows transfers of only your particular copy , and not reproductions or recreations , a digital transfer of an e-book is probably impermissible .
Thus , users of Kindle and the Sony Reader can only legally transmit works by selling the physical media on which they are stored — be that the e-book readers themselves or the users ' hard drives .
While the restrictions on e-books may initially seem inconsistent with the rights granted for hard - copy books , these differences are the consequence of new digital products outgrowing traditional copyright doctrines .
Such issues are currently being examined by legal scholars and industry insiders , but only time will tell whether this degree of control over digital media is acceptable to society .

GOP Leaders Struggle to Contain ‘ Revolution ’ Despite changing the rules , closing state conventions , Ron Paul Revolution grows By Pat Shannan Although John McCain is the presumptive Republican nominee , as the various state conventions roll forward in obscurity , conflict and chaos continue to be spread by Ron Paul ’s enthusiastic followers who continue to try to storm the ramparts of the GOP establishment .
These efforts by libertarian - leaning Republicans , looking to strike a blow against the neo-cons , have met with some successes and some failures and certainly a very undesirable backlash .
Their strategy , as demonstrated at district conventions around the country , is to show up in large numbers , use procedural motions to disrupt the convention , and if their forces are sufficient , force a vote to suspend the convention rules , remove the convention leadership , and start over again with their faction in control — all within the rules , of course .
This strategy is continuing at the state level as was demonstrated at the Nevada State Convention in Reno , where an attempt to take over the convention was near succeeding when the sitting chairman countered with a space - skipping checkmate .
He had seen that the Ron Paul faction was far stronger than the John McCain delegation and cleverly adjourned the proceedings altogether in order to avoid the inevitable .
Officials indicated that they are to reconvene at a later date , but the Paul faction suspects a different and secret city .
As news of what happened in Texas Senate District 25 ( where Paul supporters completely took over ) and in Nevada has spread , state party bosses have drawn up their counter - strategies which include changes to how conventions are run which reduce direct input from delegates and motions from the floor , draconian measures to remove anyone they think is “ disruptive ” and in some cases special meetings of credentials committees to disqualify Ron Paul delegates before the convention convenes .
Meanwhile , as more state conventions are held the conflict continues .
At the Maine Republican State Convention in May the screws were tightened , with no microphones on the floor of the convention and a number of Paul delegates forcibly ejected from the hall .
Police were on hand to maintain security .
Scheduled pro-Paul speakers found their time shortened or their appearances canceled .
Attempts to introduce delaying motions were quickly ruled out of order .
The whole proceeding charged ahead with little opportunity to interrupt .
This type of highly managed convention where delegates are treated more like observers than participants may now be the standard for these state conventions .
Not surprisingly , this type of behavior from party bosses has not been well received .
One of the best reports on the Maine convention comes from Robert Miller , a young delegate whose account of the convention stresses the alienation which he felt as a Ron Paul supporter from the convention proceedings from which he described the bias for McCain and the prejudice against Ron Paul .
He said the anti-Ron Paul agenda became evident soon after the hammering of the initiating gavel .
After the first order of business , someone from one county made a motion reminding the convention that since there were two candidates , and John McCain was well represented , someone should be allowed to speak on behalf of Ron Paul also .
Young Miller says that that idea “ must have been too dangerous
Despite the obstacles being put in their path , the Ron Paul faction is having some success .
They have n’t taken over a state convention yet , and may not , considering the stacked deck , but they are gaining delegates here and there .
Some states use a system for selecting delegates to the national convention where a part of the delegation is chosen at district conventions and the rest are selected at the state convention .
Paul supporters have done very well in states which use this approach , taking half of the 12 available delegate slots in Minnesota and a third of the delegate positions in Oklahoma .
This representation , out of proportion to Paul ’s actual standing in the official ( fraudulent ) vote in those states , is made possible because Paul ’s supporters are highly motivated and actually attend the conventions while less motivated partisans stay home , and because of the departure of two moderately successful candidates who have dropped out of the race and left a vacuum which the Paul forces can move in and fill .
If this pattern continues , even with crackdowns at future state conventions , Paul supporters are still likely to fill a lot more seats at the national GOP convention in September than would normally be justified by his showing in the ( fraudulent ) popular vote , “ perhaps 30 times the 21 delegates they are officially entitled to based on the state primary results , ” suggests political writer , Dave Nalle .
“ Along the way they ’re likely to antagonize party organizers and drive away potential allies , ” he says , “ and ultimately make themselves into pariahs .
But the fireworks at the national convention should be fun . ”
Some are suggesting that instead of trying to seize control of convention after convention , the Paul people could have laid relatively low and worked within the system and probably sent even more delegates to the national convention than they are likely to now , and by being more subdued they could have won over allies and made converts within the mainstream of the party .
Then the backlash would have been minimal , and while they might not have been able to stop McCain from getting the nomination they could have had a profound influence on the platform , the issues raised in the election and the future direction of the party .
In addition to the step - child treatment at every state convention , these loyal supporters have witnessed vote theft at every turn , but now the party bosses are is definitely cracking down .
Conservative radio talk show host Mike Gallagher told the hosts of Fox and Friends .
“ There is no question that this could be a major headache for McCain .
“ John McCain would be well - served to kind of reach out and give him an olive branch at the convention , ” Gallagher continued .
“ Let him speak , give him a role , because if these people are disrespected — you know , this , combined with Bob Barr ’s announcement that Barr now is running as a Libertarian — is going to just take votes away from John McCain and could be a disaster for the Republican Party . ”

Albert Hofmann , the pioneering Swiss chemist and advocate of psychedelics who discovered the hallucinogenic properties of LSD , died Tuesday .
He was 102 .
Hofmann reportedly died of a heart attack at his home in Basel , Switzerland .
Hofmann 's most famous discovery happened on April 16 , 1943 .
He was researching the synthesis of a lysergic acid compound , LSD - 25 , when he inadvertently absorbed a bit through his fingertips .
Intrigued by the effect it had on his perception , Hofmann decided further exploration was warranted .
Three days later , on April 19 , he ingested 250 micrograms of LSD , embarking on the first full - fledged acid trip .
That day became known among LSD fans as " bicycle day " because Hofmann began experiencing the drug 's intense effects on his bicycle trip home from the lab .
In his autobiography , LSD , My Problem Child , Hofmann remembered his discovery this way :
" In a dreamlike state , with eyes closed ( I found the daylight to be unpleasantly glaring ) , I perceived an uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures , extraordinary shapes with intense , kaleidoscopic play of colors .
After some two hours this condition faded away . "
The experience led Hofmann to begin experimenting with other hallucinogens and he became an advocate of their use , in both the arenas of psychoanalysis and personal growth .
He was critical of LSD 's casual use by the counterculture during the '60s , accusing rank amateurs of hijacking the drug he still refers to as
" medicine for the soul " without understanding either its positive or negative effects .
In a celebration of Hofmann 's 100th birthday in 2006 , Hofmann told the crowd of well - wishers – which included 2,000 researchers , scientists , artists and historians – that " LSD wanted to tell me something .
It gave me an inner joy , an open mindedness , a gratefulness , open eyes and an internal sensitivity for the miracles of creation . "
Hofmann was also the first scientist to synthesize psilocybin , the active ingredient in psilocybin mushrooms , in 1958 .

NEW ORLEANS ( AP ) 
A concrete schoolyard has been transformed into a garden of learning in hurricane - recovering New Orleans , where students plant and weed , harvest produce and learn to cook it .
There are lessons in arithmetic and science , but chef Alice Waters said what 's most important is the children 's reverence for the food they eat .
Waters helped create the Edible Schoolyard at Samuel J. Green Charter School 14 years after planting the first one in Berkeley , Calif. , where she operates Chez Panisse restaurant .
" They 're learning to work with the tools of the kitchen very confidently , " said Green principal Tony Recasner .
For students shuttled from city to city after Hurricane Katrina flooded 80 % of New Orleans in 2005 , it is a happy distraction amid daily reminders of the devastation .
Even kids who do n't go to Green stop by to plant and weed .
Michael Riley often drops by after changing out of his own school uniform .
" I just saw all the beautiful plants and wanted to help , " Michael said during the recent one - year anniversary garden party featuring hors d'ouvres assembled and passed around by students , including his cousin Terrence Brown .
School gardens are n't new , but the concept is growing as educators try to connect students with practical and less violent interests .
The word " kindergarten " — children - garden — was coined in 1840 by German educator Friedrich Froebel , who saw school as both a metaphoric garden for children and a place for them to learn about nature in planted gardens .
Definitive data is scarce .
However , the National Gardening Association 's online registry lists 1,500 school gardens , up from 1,100 a year ago , spokeswoman Barbara Richardson said .
The actual number is many thousands more .
California alone had about 1,000 instructional school gardens in 1995 and 3,000 in 2000 .
Nearly 3,850 schools — more than 40 % of all state schools — got state grants last year to begin or improve gardens , said Rose Hayden - Smith , adviser for a University of California program that teaches children where food comes from .
Career skills grow along with plants .
For example , garden program graduates have become landscapers and tree surgeons working for the school system , said Matthew " Mud " Baron , garden specialist for the Los Angeles school district .
At Crenshaw High School in Los Angeles , Food from the Hood , a student - run company , sells salad dressings made from school - grown herbs .
Each hour worked by a student - manager translates into scholarship money .
The program at Green began last year .
The concrete schoolyard has given way to one - third acre of pathways , flourishing herbs and sprouting seedlings .
Even the front fence , with sweet peas twining up black iron and blooming in rainbow profusion and the wide brick planters flanking the front steps are part of the Edible Schoolyard .
Basil , sage and rosemary burgeon in the planters along with chives , sweet potatoes , and nasturtiums ( which have edible flowers ) .
Also growing are marigolds , coleus and snapdragons .
" Those are edible by butterflies , " said Donna Cavato , who directs the program .
Green was one of 26 failing schools — 22 of them in New Orleans — offered up by the state in early 2005 for operation by universities or as charter schools .
In July 2005 , it was handed over to Recasner , a psychologist who opened New Orleans Charter Middle School in 1998 .
" Sixty percent of the kids who were attending the school when we took it over had a probation officer , " he said .
In August 2005 , Hurricane Katrina hit .
While nearly two - thirds of the students on probation never returned , the enrollment of 320 students continues to be made up of children from poor and working - class families .
New Orleans Charter Middle School was hit much harder by the storm than Green , so both were consolidated at Green when it reopened for kindergarten through eighth - graders .
A legacy from New Orleans Charter was an elective class on gardening , created with a grant from the Fertel Foundation .
Randy Fertel , of the educational foundation , connected Waters with the school and she offered to establish an Edible Schoolyard at Green .
Recasner turned down Fertel 's idea at first .
There were so many urgent needs .
" I 'd lost the entire school faculty , kids were scattered across the country , and I 'd taken on the responsibility of getting the school open as fast as I could , " Recasner said .
But he quickly changed his mind .
" I realized it was just what we needed to do to restore kids ' confidence in the soil and in the city .
Also , I thought it'd be a great therapeutic tool " — an island of calmness .
" I did n't want to have a building of social workers waiting to greet the kids , " he said .
Waters ' Chez Panisse Foundation is talking with the Monte del Sol charter school in Santa Fe , and with schools in Los Angeles and organizations in Greensboro , N.C. , and Pittsburgh , said Marsha Guerrero , director of partnerships .
Gardening has taken root in 7 - year - old Green student Alshawn Plain , whose grandmother Dianne Lewis said she and Alshawn have planted tomatoes in her backyard .
He 's also planted them at his own house nearby .
" When we go to the store , he wants to get seeds for the plants , " she said .
Renada Jones , who attended Green in the mid-1990s but has lived in Houston since Hurricane Katrina , remembers it as a violent place .
" Now it looks better , " she said as she walked with 9 - month - old son Dawayne Cook Jr. and 2 - year - old daughter Trinity Cook .
" It makes you want to put your children in here . "

Hi , my name is Udschal .
I 'm a Frontend Engineer from Cologne , Germany .
A minor thought for today .
Part of becoming an expert in any programming language is learning the idioms .
Through experience , research and your peers you discover what makes your programming language hum .
How to get the best performance and how to trade that against the best expressiveness .
Since spoken language affects the way that what we think it ’s reasonable to expect that programming languages affect the way we think about programming problems .
I have on a number of occassions wanted to write an expression in Lisp that will return true if all the elements are T and nil if any are not T .
A sort of ‘ and ’ for a list .
It seemed like a classic case of a ‘ reduce ’ or fold operation to me and so I went about doing that as a starting point .
CL - USER > ( reduce #'( lambda ( x y ) ( and x y ) ) '(t t t t t t t ) ) T
Hmm , because AND is a macro it ca n’t be an argument to reduce therefore I have to wrap it in a lambda .
Which is ok but it removes the short - circuit feature from the AND .
So , I was n’t terribly excited by this result but it served the purpose and life continued as normal .
That was until today when I discovered the LOOP tutorial which inspired me with this trivial alternative …
CL - USER > ( loop for x in '(t t t t t t ) always ( eq t x ) ) T
Yes it ’s a little bit less functional but it it ’s very clear what ’s going on here and that was my original problem with the second reduce form .
I was interested to see how the LOOP expanded too , so :
With the expensive part of the Hallowthankmas season now approaching , a question must be looming large in our readers ’ minds :
“ Dear Overcoming Bias , are there biases I can exploit to be seen as generous without actually spending lots of money ? ”
I ’m glad to report the answer is yes !
According to Hsee — in a paper entitled “ Less is Better ” — if you buy someone a $ 45 scarf , you are more likely to be seen as generous than if you buy them a $ 55 coat .
1
This is a special case of a more general phenomenon .
In an earlier experiment , Hsee asked subjects how much they would be willing to pay for a second - hand music dictionary :
2
Dictionary A , from 1993 , with 10,000 entries , in like - new condition .
Dictionary B , from 1993 , with 20,000 entries , with a torn cover and otherwise in like - new condition .
The gotcha was that some subjects saw both dictionaries side - by - side , while other subjects only saw one dictionary . . .
Subjects who saw only one of these options were willing to pay an average of $ 24 for Dictionary A and an average of $ 20 for Dictionary B. Subjects who saw both options , side - by - side , were willing to pay $ 27 for Dictionary B and $ 19 for Dictionary A .
Of course , the number of entries in a dictionary is more important than whether it has a torn cover , at least if you ever plan on using it for anything .
But if you ’re only presented with a single dictionary , and it has 20,000 entries , the number 20,000 does n’t mean very much .
Is it a little ?
A lot ?
Who knows ?
It ’s non-evaluable .
The torn cover , on the other hand — that stands out .
That has a definite affective valence : namely , bad .
Seen side - by - side , though , the number of entries goes from non-evaluable to evaluable , because there are two compatible quantities to be compared .
And once the number of entries becomes evaluable , that facet swamps the importance of the torn cover .
From Slovic et al. : Which would you prefer ?
3
1. A 29/36 chance to win $ 2 . 2 . A 7/36 chance to win $ 9 .
While the average prices ( equivalence values ) placed on these options were $ 1.25 and $ 2.11 respectively , their mean attractiveness ratings were 13.2 and 7.5 .
Both the prices and the attractiveness rating were elicited in a context where subjects were told that two gambles would be randomly selected from those rated , and they would play the gamble with the higher price or higher attractiveness rating .
( Subjects had a motive to rate gambles as more attractive , or price them higher , that they would actually prefer to play . )
The gamble worth more money seemed less attractive , a classic preference reversal .
The researchers hypothesized that the dollar values were more compatible with the pricing task , but the probability of payoff was more compatible with attractiveness .
So ( the researchers thought ) why not try to make the gamble ’s payoff more emotionally salient — more affectively evaluable — more attractive ?
And how did they do this ?
By adding a very small loss to the gamble .
The old gamble had a 7/36 chance of winning $ 9 .
The new gamble had a 7/36 chance of winning $ 9 and a 29/36 chance of losing 5 cents .
In the old gamble , you implicitly evaluate the attractiveness of $ 9 .
The new gamble gets you to evaluate the attractiveness of winning $ 9 versus losing 5 cents .
“ The results , ” said Slovic et al. , “ exceeded our expectations . ”
In a new experiment , the simple gamble with a 7/36 chance of winning $ 9 had a mean attractiveness rating of 9.4 , while the complex gamble that included a 29/36 chance of losing 5 cents had a mean attractiveness rating of 14.9 .
A follow - up experiment tested whether subjects preferred the old gamble to a certain gain of $ 2 .
Only 33 % of students preferred the old gamble .
Among another group asked to choose between a certain $ 2 and the new gamble ( with the added possibility of a 5 cents loss ) , fully 60.8 % preferred the gamble .
After all , $ 9 is n’t a very attractive amount of money , but $ 9 / 5 cents is an amazingly attractive win / loss ratio .
You can make a gamble more attractive by adding a strict loss !
Is n’t psychology fun ?
This is why no one who truly appreciates the wondrous intricacy of human intelligence wants to design a human - like AI .
Of course , it only works if the subjects do n’t see the two gambles side - by - side .
Similarly , which of the two ice creams in Figure 1 do you think subjects in Hsee ’s 1998 study preferred ?
Naturally , the answer depends on whether the subjects saw a single ice cream , or the two side - by - side .
Subjects who saw a single ice cream were willing to pay $ 1.66 to Vendor H and $ 2.26 to Vendor L. Subjects who saw both ice creams were willing to pay $ 1.85 to Vendor H and $ 1.56 to Vendor L .
What does this suggest for your holiday shopping ?
That if you spend $ 400 on a 16GB iPod Touch , your recipient sees the most expensive MP3 player .
If you spend $ 400 on a Nintendo Wii , your recipient sees the least expensive game machine .
Which is better value for the money ?
Ah , but that question only makes sense if you see the two side - by - side .
You ’ll think about them side - by - side while you ’re shopping , but the recipient will only see what they get .
If you have a fixed amount of money to spend — and your goal is to display your friendship , rather than to actually help the recipient — you ’ll be better off deliberately not shopping for value .
Decide how much money you want to spend on impressing the recipient , then find the most worthless object which costs that amount .
The cheaper the class of objects , the more expensive a particular object will appear , given that you spend a fixed amount .
Which is more memorable , a $ 25 shirt or a $ 25 candle ?
Gives a whole new meaning to the Japanese custom of buying $ 50 melons , does n’t it ?
You look at that and shake your head and say “ What is it with the Japanese ? ”
And yet they get to be perceived as incredibly generous , spendthrift even , while spending only $ 50 .
You could spend $ 200 on a fancy dinner and not appear as wealthy as you can by spending $ 50 on a melon .
If only there was a custom of gifting $ 25 toothpicks or $ 10 dust specks ; they could get away with spending even less .
PS : If you actually use this trick , I want to know what you bought .

RAMALLAH , West Bank 
Nibbling doughnuts and wrestling with computer code , the workers at G.ho.st , an Internet start - up here , are holding their weekly staff meeting  with colleagues on the other side of the Israeli - Palestinian divide .
They trade ideas through a video hookup that connects the West Bank office with one in Israel in the first joint technology venture of its kind between Israelis and Palestinians .
“ Start with the optimistic parts , Mustafa , ” Gilad Parann - Nissany , an Israeli who is vice president for research and development , jokes with a Palestinian colleague who is giving a progress report .
Both conference rooms break into laughter .
The goal of G.ho.st is not as lofty as peace , although its founders and employees do hope to encourage it .
Instead G.ho.st wants to give users a free , Web - based virtual computer that lets them access their desktop and files from any computer with an Internet connection .
G.ho.st , pronounced “ ghost , ” is short for Global Hosted Operating System .

Pascal Lamy , the director - general of the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) , told the BBC that " a little more prudential regulation " could have helped prevent the banking crisis that has engulfed the US and Europe .
Mr Lamy said that the fundamental problem was that here was no international consensus on how to regulate the rapidly changing world financial markets or who should be the regulator .
The WTO boss also said that workers hurt by globalisation should receive more help from their governments .
Mr Lamy 's remarks put him at odds with the so - called " Washington consensus " that liberalisation , privatisation , and open markets are the only way to bring about economic growth .
Trade talks
The WTO chief said he was hopeful that the long - stalled Doha round of world trade talks could be revived soon , with a meeting of trade ministers in July .
The trade talks , which have been going on for seven years , have stalled over disagreements between rich and poor countries , and growing public opposition to globalisation .
The WTO chief said he well understood the concerns of those workers who feared that globalisation would cost them their jobs , but argued that the WTO was " not an advocate of unfettered globalisation . '
And he criticised governments - including the US - for not providing enough domestic support , including retraining and job programmes , to help workers displaced by changing global trading patterns .
There is strong opposition in the US to subsidy cuts for farmers
Trade was often just " an excuse " for not making the necessary adjustments in domestic policy to support workers hit by globalisation , he said .
And he added that he was not surprised that protests were strongest in the US , because it has the weakest system of social protection .
Protectionist pressures
Mr Lamy said that he understood the growing protectionist pressures around the world , especially in the US , and accepted that the fears about the too - rapid pace of economic change were genuine .
But he said that there were clear economic gains to be made by freeing up world trade , providing that the inevitable losers were compensated by " appropriate domestic policies " .
The problem which protectionism poses for world trade talks is most acute in the US , he said .
The two Democratic candidates vying for the presidency , Hillary Clinton and Barak Obama , have been increasingly critical of trade deals during their fierce battle in the primaries .
However he insisted that the WTO was still hopeful that that the US would take an active part in the current round of trade talks , and that whoever won the presidential election in November , would see the importance of the US continuing to negotiate .
Food fight
The Doha round of talks were launched in 2001 and aimed at freeing up trade in agriculture in order to benefit developing countries .
The talks broke down in July 2006 over disagreements between the US and the EU over the size of the cuts in agricultural subsidies that each of them would have to make to open up their markets to poor countries .
Now Mr Lamy believes that the two sides are much closer together , with the US pledging to cut 70 % to 80 % of its domestic subsidies - something that is not yet reflected in the farm bill that is being considered by the US Congress .
And he says that the recent rises in world food prices have actually made the task of the trade negotiations easier , as farmers in the rich countries no longer need subsidies to make a profit .
But he warned that action is urgent , because high food prices are here to stay .
Financial markets are not as regulated as trade markets , Mr Lamy says .
The growing global food crisis has worried many poor countries , who feel a stronger need for policies to protect their own farmers and to ensure that they can become more self - sufficient in agriculture .
But Mr Lamy said that the proposed trade deal would ensure that poor countries would be able to act in emergencies and special circumstances to protect key products .
He said the best way to end the food crisis was to encourage economic growth and eliminate poverty so that the poor would be able to afford a decent diet .
Economic slowdown
Mr Lamy said there was no doubt that the effects of the global financial crisis were extremely serious , especially for the US and Europe .
World economic growth and world trade are both slowing sharply .
But Mr Lamy argued that the growing economic power of emerging market countries such as Brazil , China , and India was a crucial counter - weight to the slowdown in the rich countries , adding that this would not have been possible without the expansion of free trade .
Mr Lamy has had a difficult role since he became the head of the WTO just three years ago .
Now he is hoping that his last - ditch attempt to achieve a trade breakthrough will succeed .

What are these ?
David Leonhardt notes that it 's pretty hard to explain what 's going on in the financial world these days ( ht Felix ) .
Here 's how I 'd tell the tale to a child :
Alice , Bob , and Sue have ten marbles between them .
Whenever one kid wants another kid to take over a chore , she promises a marble in exchange .
Alice does n't like setting the table , so she promises Bob a marble if he will do it for her .
Bob hates mowing the lawn , but Sue will do it for a marble .
Sue does n't like broccoli , but if she says pretty please and promises a marble , Bob will eat it off her plate when Mom is n't looking .
One day , the kids get together to brag about all the marbles they soon will have .
It turns out that , between them , they are promised 40 marbles !
Now that is pretty exciting .
They 've each promised to give away some marbles too , but they do n't think about that , they can keep their promises later , after they 've had time to play with what 's coming .
For now , each is eager to hold all the marbles they 've been promised in their own hands , and to show off their collections to friends .
But then Alice , who is smart and foolish all at the same time , points out a curious fact .
There are only 10 marbles !
Sue says , " That can not be .
I have earned 20 marbles , and I have only promised to give away three !
There must be 17 just for me . "
But there are still only 10 marbles .
Suddenly , when Bob does n't want to mow the lawn , no one will do it for him , even if he promises two marbles for the job .
No one will eat Sue 's broccoli for her , even though everyone knows she is promised the most marbles of anyone , because no one believes she will ever see those 17 marbles she is always going on about .
In fact , dinnertime is mayhem .
Spoons are placed where forks should be , and saucers used for dinner plates , because Alice really is hopeless in the kitchen .
Mom is cross .
Dad is cross .
Everyone is cross .
" But you promised , " is heard over and over among the children , amidst lots of stomping and fighting .
Until recently , theirs was such a happy home , but now the lawn is overgrown , broccoli rots on mismatched saucers , and no one trusts anyone at all .
It 's all a bit mysterious to Dad , who points out that nothing has changed , really , so why on Earth is everything falling apart ?
Perhaps Mom and Dad will decide that the best thing to do is just buy some more marbles , so that all the children can make good on their promises .
But that would mean giving Alice 19 marbles , because she was laziest and made the most promises she could n't keep , and that hardly seems like a good lesson .
Plus , marbles are expensive , and everyone in the family would have to skip lunch for a week to settle Alice 's debt .
Perhaps the children could get together and decide that an unmet promise should be worth only a quarter some fraction of a marble , so that everyone is able to keep their promises after all .
But then Sue , the hardest working , would feel really ripped off , as she ends up with a much more modest collection of marbles than she had expected .
Perhaps Bob , the strongest , will simply take all the marbles from Alice and Sue , and make it clear than none will be given in return , and that will be that .
Or , perhaps Alice and Bob could do Sue 's chores for a while in addition to their own , extinguishing one promise per chore .
But that 's an awful lot of work , what if they just do n't want to , who 's gonna force them ?
What if they'd have to be in servitude to Sue for years ?
Almost whatever happens , the trading of chores , so crucial to the family 's tidy lawns and pleasant dinners , will be curtailed for some time .
Perhaps some trading will occur via exchange of actual marbles , but this will not be common , as even kids see the folly of giving rare glass to people known to welch on their promises .
It makes more sense to horde .
A credit crisis arises when many more promises are made than can possibly be kept , and disputes emerge about how and to whom promises will be broken .
It 's less a matter of SIVs than ABCs .
Update : Mark Thoma offers characteristically thoughtful comments .
I also liked this , by Alex Whalen .
( BTW , I do n't have children , though my wife is urging we remedy that soon . )
In the comments , Arun Garg is reminded of Paul Krugman 's Baby - sitting Co-op , whose influence I 'm happy to acknowledge .
Krugman is a master of this sort of parable , see also hot dogs and buns .
Update 2 : ( Not for kindergarteners ! )
There 've been comments here and elsewhere suggesting that the numbers in this story can't be made to work .
They can .
Note that the 40 marbles the children think they have is before netting .
As the piece says , " They 've each promised to give away some marbles too , but they do n't think about that , they can keep their promises later , after they 've had time to play with what 's coming . "
That 's realistic .
It 's why people who borrow from banks think they have cash , even though , if you net it out , that cash is offset by a liability to the bank .
On idealized balance sheets , the promises made to us are represented as assets .
The promises we 've made are our liabilities , and the promises that can't be kept show up as negative equity .
On net , across people , all promises sum to zero , and all equity sums to the real value of all the stuff .
It 's the distribution of gross numbers that gives rise to a credit crisis .
It 's an accounting identity that , on net , everything balances .
But that does n't help anybody .
For the very geeky among you , click the link below to reveal balance sheets that comport with this tale .

I was just doing an interview on an Aussie radio station and was asked to name some traits of successful bloggers .
My initial reaction was to giggle – because no two successful bloggers are the same – however as I began to answer I realized that there are some common traits among bloggers who gain popularity .
Here ’s a list , presented in no particular order , of some of the traits of successful bloggers that I observe :
1. Creative and Playful
One of the things I love about blogging is that it can be a very playful space .
Bloggers who find new ways to communicate old truths and that have the ability to surprise their readers with fresh perspectives and means of communication often find themselves on a fast track to a wide readership .
Also , in the midst of ‘ playful ’ experimentation new discoveries come that help a blogger to develop in maturity and influence in their niche .
Image by Yelnoc
“ There is no doubt that creativity is the most important human resource of all .
Without creativity , there would be no progress , and we would be forever repeating the same patterns . ” – Edward de Bono
2. Innovative
Often ‘ innovative ’ is used to describe a blogger ’s use of technology – but it goes well beyond this .
Innovative bloggers are those that are able to extend and explore their topic in ways that others are not .
They are thought leaders and forge into new ground not only in the way that they present in what they say .
“ Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower . ” – Steve Jobs
3. Connectors
Most successful bloggers that I ’ve interacted with have an insatiable desire to connect with as many people as they can .
They have an ability to connect not only with their readers but other bloggers and key people in both the online and offline world .
Their networks are often far reaching – enabling them to draw on all kinds of relationships when needed .
“ It ’s not what you know but who you know that makes the difference . ” – Anonymous
4. Community Enablers
There are many blogs with great information – but it ’s those that are able to draw in and build up a community of passionate and energetic people that often go to the next level .
Readers are no longer satisfied just to consume content – they want to participate and belong online .
Successful bloggers do n’t always actively participate in or lead the community aspect of their blogs but they do have an ability to attract other community builders and to empower them to build a community around the content on the blog .
“ Call it a clan , call it a network , call it a tribe , call it a family :
Whatever you call it , whoever you are , you need one . ” – Jane Howard
5. Information Mavens
Successful bloggers are often quite addicted to the gathering of information .
What sets them apart from other information gatherers is their ability to filter the vast quantities of information that they collect and to identify and communicate that which applies to others .
Image by dsevilla
“ What sets Mavens apart , though , is not so much what they know but how they pass it along .
The fact that Mavens want to help , for no other reason than because they like to help , turns out to be an awfully effective way of getting someone ’s attention . ”
Malcolm Gladwell ( Tipping Point ) .
6. Communicators
Some might think that this point is all about bloggers having the ability to write well – but that is only part of being a good communicator .
Successful bloggers have a knack of knowing connecting with readers that goes beyond the way they use words .
Good communication has more to do with knowing your audience and connecting with their needs and desires .
Successful bloggers have the ability to trigger some sort of response in their reader .
“ The two words ‘ Information ’ and ‘ Communication ’ are often used interchangeably , but they signify quite different things .
Information is giving out ; communication is getting through . ” – Sydney J. Harris
7. Interest
Bloggers know how to be interesting – but being interesting starts with being interested .
Most successful bloggers that I ’ve met would blog on their chosen topic for free – because they have some kind of passion or interest in it themselves .
This energy that they have for their topic shines through and is infectious to others .
It ’s one of the main reasons that readers are drawn to them .
“ There are two levers for moving men : interest and fear . ” – Napoleon Bonaparte
8. Entrepreneurs
Successful bloggers are always on the look out for opportunities to go to the next level .
They leverage what they currently have to grow something more .
They do n’t just rely upon others to make their dreams a reality but are self starters and ‘ doers ’ that go and get what they want .
“ The entrepreneur in us sees opportunities everywhere we look , but many people see only problems everywhere they look .
The entrepreneur in us is more concerned with discriminating between opportunities than he or she is with failing to see the opportunities . ” – Michael Gerber
9. Originality
It is difficult to be unique in the blogging space but successful bloggers find ways to make what they do stand out from the crowd .
They develop a distinct voice , use media in different ways and develop their own unique spin on life that sets them apart from the rest .
“ Eveyone is a genius at least once a year .
A real genius has his original ideas closer together . ” – Georg C. Lichtenberg
10 . Perseverance
Successful bloggers know that it takes time to grow a blog and look past those initial awkward months ( and longer ) after a blog is launched to motivate them to persevere .
They do know when to give up when something is n’t working but also have an ability to develop their blog ’s with focus and discipline and unswerving conviction over the long haul .
“ If at first you do n’t succeed , get a bigger hammer . ” – Alan Lewis
11 . Focus
What strikes me about many of the most successful blogs out there is that in a time where there ’s an incredible development of new technology happening that many of them do n’t allow themselves to get distracted by it .
Yes they experiment and play with new ways of delivering content to readers but they do n’t become distracted from their core task of producing useful and engaging content for readers .
Being able to identify what matters most and sticking to it is so important – particularly in a medium with so many time sucking distractions .
“ Take up one idea .
Make that one idea your life – think of it , dream of it , live on that idea .
Let the brain , muscles , nerves , every part of your body , be full of that idea , and just leave every other idea alone .
This is the way to success . ”
– Swami Vivekananda
12 . Curiosity
Lastly , one of the traits that I see in many great bloggers is a restlessness and a dissatisfaction with the current state of play in their world / blog / industry .
They are not content to sit comfortably but are always exploring , pushing boundaries and experimenting .
They are curious people who are always asking ‘ what if ….?’ – a question that leads to all kinds of discoveries and possibilities that the rest of us could only dream of discovering .
“ We keep moving forward , opening new doors , and doing new things , because we ’re curious and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths . ” – Walt Disney

I also do n't mind that bit of commercialism as it is
quicker
dumped in the e-mail than in the waste paper basket if I
do n't want it .
I still like to find a comprehensive list of commercial
suppliers .
The list between Purdue and Munich is pretty
good
but not necessarily up to date .
Dako has for example their
own home page and Biorad was n't on them the last time
either .
Perhaps the best way to keep up to date is to
allow
the commercials to add their address to the pages
themselves
like Paul intends to do with the other site links .
Another thing that would be nice to have is some listing of
' useful information ' like the compensation tutorial of Mark
Roederer , the lin to log conversion from Dave Coder , the
useful tips for winmdi users , how to clean laser brewster
windows .... just to name a few .
It also would be nice to
get some of the commercial slides on flow principles ( not
pictures of gray or beige boxes on lab - benches ) on the
internet with the intention of free use .
Perhaps even the
flow tutorial from Coulter might be somewhere on the net .

Thanks ,
Jeff , for letting us know about the Bio - Rad website .
One does n't always have the time to check on all of the FCM related
sites and update our links .
You 're correct to point out that commercialism should be kept at a
minimum on this list , but short notices regarding useful info , I
believe , are OK .
( Sorry if I stepped on anyone 's toes re : my BDIS homepage post ; just
wanted to get the info out and , no , I do n't get any commission ) :-)
Ciao ,

I still like to find a comprehensive list of commercialsuppliers .
The list between Purdue and Munich is prettygoodbut not necessarily up to date .
Dako has for example theirown home page and Biorad was n't on them the last timeeither .
Perhaps the best way to keep up to date is toallowthe commercials to add their address to the pagesthemselveslike Paul intends to do with the other site links .
Another thing that would be nice to have is some listing of 'useful information ' like the compensation tutorial of MarkRoederer , the lin to log conversion from Dave Coder , theuseful tips for winmdi users , how to clean laser brewsterwindows .... just to name a few .
It also would be nice toget some of the commercial slides on flow principles ( notpictures of gray or beige boxes on lab - benches ) on theinternet with the intention of free use .
Perhaps even theflow tutorial from Coulter might be somewhere on the net .

The original May 11 deadline for Real ID compliance has come and gone , but not a single state has implemented the program , which calls for uniform standards for state - issued ID cards and a system that would provide the federal government with broad access to state identification records .
The Real ID Act , which was squeezed into a 2005 military spending bill and passed with virtually no discussion or debate in Congress , has met with heavy resistance from civil liberties advocates and state governments .
The implementation costs have far exceeded the original meager estimates and the federal government is providing virtually no cash to support the initiative .
A growing number of states are determined to defy Congress and have passed bills rejecting Real ID implementation .
All 50 states have been granted extensions from the Department of Homeland Security , ensuring that their citizens will still be permitted to board planes and enter government buildings .
Given the nature of the extended deadlines , some speculate that the Bush administration wants to avoid a direct confrontation with the states and that the next president could pressure Congress to institute some changes to the Real ID program .
" By granting all 50 states waivers , the current administration has handed off the issue to the next administration , " Center for Democracy and Technology director Jim Dempsey told the Washington Independent .
In addition to serious cost issues , the Real ID Act also raises valid privacy concerns .
Although it does not technically create a centralized database , the program would make an enormous amount of widely distributed identity information accessible to the federal government in a manner that security experts say heightens the risk of identity theft — a highly counterproductive outcome for a plan that is touted as a means of reducing risks to national security .
It seems apparent now that the Real ID Act was fundamentally misguided , but an acceptable resolution to the problem is n't immediately apparent .
Additional extensions only delay the inevitable and do n't change the realities of inadequate funding and unreasonable expectations .

GUANTANAMO BAY U.S. NAVAL BASE , Cuba ( Reuters ) - The U.S. military will televise the Guantanamo trial of accused September 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and five other suspects so relatives of those killed in the attacks can watch on the U.S. mainland .
A guard tower of Camp Delta is seen at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba September 4 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Joe Skipper / Files
“ We ’re going to broadcast in real time to several locations that will be available just to victim families , ” Army Col .
Lawrence Morris , chief prosecutor for the controversial war crimes court , said at the naval base recently .
In February , military prosecutors charged Mohammed and five other captives with murder and conspiracy and asked that they be executed if convicted of plotting to crash hijacked planes into New York ’s World Trade Center and the Pentagon in 2001 .
No trial date has been set but they are the first Guantanamo prisoners charged with direct involvement in the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people .
Morris said several of the victims ’ relatives asked to watch the trials at the detention center set up in Guantanamo Bay naval base to try foreign terrorism suspects .
The base sits on a dusty patch of the island of Cuba and does not have many flights , beds or courtroom seats to accommodate spectators .
The trials will be beamed to closed - circuit television viewing sites on military bases at Fort Hamilton in New York , Fort Monmouth in New Jersey , Fort Meade in Maryland and Fort Devens in Massachusetts , Morris said .
The military is borrowing a page from the civilian court sentencing hearing of Zacarias Moussaoui , a flight school student who is the only person convicted in the United States in connection with the September 11 plot .
He pleaded guilty to conspiring with al Qaeda and was sentenced to life in prison .
U.S. federal courts normally ban cameras .
But through an act of Congress , Moussaoui ’s 2006 court hearing in Virginia was shown by closed - circuit television to victims ’ families at courthouses in Boston , New York , New Jersey and Pennsylvania .
“ We got much more information from those hearings than we ever got from the 9 - 11 Commission , ” said Lorie Van Auken , whose husband Kenneth died in the World Trade Center , referring to the investigation the U.S. Congress launched into the attacks .
FAIR TRIALS OR SHOW TRIALS ?
Some of the victims ’ relatives praised the U.S. military for ensuring they had access to the Guantanamo proceedings .
Hamilton Peterson , whose father and stepmother , Donald and Jean Peterson , died on the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania , called the prosecutors “ true patriots , ” and said he was grateful for “ the ability to see justice being fulfilled in one of the most significant attacks on America ’s heartland . ”
Others urged the trials be televised nationwide without restriction because of the sweeping impact of the attacks .
The broadcasts will mark the first time a Guantanamo detainee ’s face has been shown publicly .
The U.S. military prohibits journalists and other visitors from taking photographs or video that shows faces , citing a provision of the Geneva Conventions that aims to protect war captives from “ insults and public curiosity . ”
The U.S. military lawyer assigned to defend Mohammed , Navy Capt .
Prescott Prince , said if the trials are truly fair , then broadcasting them widely would prove that to the world .
But he worried about setting a precedent by televising what he suspects will be show trials .
“ I can just imagine American soldiers and sailors and airmen being subjected to similar show trials worldwide , ” he said .
He said he doubts the defendants can get a fair trial in the Guantanamo court because it accepts hearsay evidence that may have been obtained through cruel and dehumanizing means .
The Geneva provision cited in shielding prisoners ’ faces also bans “ acts of violence or intimidation , ” he noted .
The CIA held Mohammed in a secret prison for years and acknowledged interrogating him with methods that included the simulated drowning technique known as waterboarding .
Some of the victims ’ relatives also said they thought the trials should be held in a regular court , open to the public and using only “ evidence that ’s above reproach . ”
“ This is not about revenge , it ’s about justice , ” said Valerie Lucznikowska , a New Yorker whose nephew Adam Arias died in the World Trade Center .
“ I do n’t want it to be a lynching .
I ’m concerned that people like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , we wo n’t be able to find them guilty because of what we ’ve done with them .
It ’s a horrible conundrum . ”
Where to put the watch depends largely on one ’s own preferences , which can be influenced by the size of a person ’s collection , lifestyle and economy or space .
Unless you only have one watch , like a fake Rolex , and wear it every day , you ’ll likely need a place to store them when they ’re not on your wrist .
Storage options for watches can include original boxes , showcases , cases , packaging , wallets , winders , safes , and so on , so let ’s explore some of the most common and relevant pros and cons .
This one is probably not ideal for many people and is a proposal I would only advocate if space were severely limited .
Keeping the original box and papers of a watch you have bought yourself or managed to obtain pre-loved is essential should you ever wish to sell the replica watch for its maximum secondary market value , but using these boxes as storage systems is not a good idea on several fronts .
To begin with , overusing a box will only harm its condition and reduce its value .
I store all of my original boxes in a separate box in a cool , dry location , away from any kind of light to prevent the exterior fading or becoming laden with dust .
Second , it looks a little messy .
On most models , you ca n’t see the watches at a glance , and in some cases , the boxes of the same brand do n’t have any visible signs that tell you what to see when you open them .
For me , as long as the watch comes out of its original packaging , it should n’t go back there until it delivers it to a new home .
A display cabinet is a bit of an old - fashioned concept in this slick , tech - heavy world in which we live , but for those who prefer to arrange their watches behind glass in a static position , it is still an option .
Individual watch stands are ever more available and can make for a display when marshaled with care and attention .
One of the reasons I favor cases is because I am often on the move , and sometimes need to travel with a huge number of watches in my possession for fairs or RedBar meet - ups .
However , sometimes traveling with 15 - 20 watches is not only unnecessary but simply untenable due to luggage restrictions .
Here watch wraps and watch wallets become necessary pieces of kit , and while I would n’t leave my replica rolex timepieces in either for a significant period , I ’ve lost count of how many times I ’ve relied on these light - weight and durable options to get my beaters from A to B .
Look , it is certainly true that leaving a watch unused for a long time is unhealthy for it , but for a few days or several weeks at a time , it makes no practical difference .
On the contrary , leaving a watch running constantly obviously increases the wear and tear sustained by the components , which are of course working harder and for longer than is necessary .
Whether a watch is a good fit for your collection depends on its size and composition .
For example , if you rarely wear a watch , it ’s not a bad idea to give them a little activity every few weeks to make sure the lubricant is still working , but does n’t need to leave these rarely worn winder models running forever .
However , speaking of perpetuity , certain models would benefit from life on a watch winder , and those are very sophisticated models featuring things like perpetual calendars or complex moonphase indications that can run for over 100 years without needing to be reset .
Watches of this complexity will benefit a lot from the wind - up mechanism of a watch , which is the main reason they exist in my mind .
Despite the high price tag of this stylish security device , it can be a drop in the ocean compared to the cost of replacing or repairing a fake watch that has been stolen or damaged due to a lack of storage solutions .
Aside from insurance and regular maintenance to keep your replica watches in good working order , finding a home for them that will keep them happy and healthy for years to come is not something to sneeze at .
Throughout all the lies and crimes of the Bush administration 's reign of terror , there have been few heroes in the Congress and Senate who have championed the cause of truth like Florida Congressman Robert Wexler .
He has led the fight for impeachment hearings , and has never backed down from a fight , no matter the odds against him .

As a resident of the great state of Texas , I have no dog in the fight when it comes to Congressional elections in Florida .
I can only lament that my Congressman is Louis Gohmert , who looks and sounds exactly like Gomer Pyle , only half as smart and twice as arrogant .
Gohmert 's best moment in his short congressional career came after he stole a poster from the front of a Democratic member 's office - who just happened to be former NFL quarterback Heath Shuler .
Wonkette reported :
The next day , according to Roll Call , “ Shuler , a former NFL quarterback , was spotted towering over a seated Gohmert , wagging a finger in his face during the heated session . ”
The furious Shuler was yelling at Gohmert for being a “ gutless chickenshit thief ” and was apparently barely able to keep from stomping the little Republican ’s skull .
Gohmert later said , " I know I did not steal anything ; but I am still trying to discern if he might be right about my being chicken excrement . "
No , really - that 's what he said .
That 's my Congressman .
He does not like it when my letters to the editor are printed in our local newspapers .
And being that my state 's Senators are also two of the worst in the entire body ( John Cornyn and Kay Bailey Hutchison ) , I am in the position of having to work with the legislators of other states if I want to do anything other than complain .
Congressman Wexler is one of the most accessible and hard - working members in the entire Washington circus , and he is one of the few who have refused to resign themselves to the status of " dancing bear . "
Following is the e-mail Congressman Wexler sent out yesterday about former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan 's new book that reveals much more about the crimes of the Bush cadre :
Last night , significant news broke that directly impacts our push for Impeachment Hearings and a possible Inherent Contempt charge for Bush Administration officials such as Karl Rove :
Former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan has revealed in his upcoming book that :

THE failure of diplomacy to stop Iran ’s nuclear program became obvious this week , when President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad revealed the installation of 6,000 new centrifuges at the country ’s main uranium enrichment complex .
His announcement was accompanied by the now customary assertion that outsiders can do nothing to stop Iran from fulfilling its nuclear destiny .
Once , not so long ago , this kind of boast would elicit clear American declarations that Iran would never be allowed to develop nuclear weapons .
Everything , President Bush would say ominously , is on the table .
This time he has been quiet .
I wish I believed that it is the quiet before a storm of laser - guided action .
It seems more likely that it is the abashed silence of an American president whose bluff has been called in front of the entire world .
Washington ’s performance should concern anyone who cares about long - term American influence in the Islamic world .
But for Israel ( and Israel ’s supporters ) , this is an urgent problem .
It is Israel , after all , that has been set by the Iranian leadership as the target for annihilation .
In response to the news from Iran , some supporters of Israel have started to suggest that the failed efforts at prevention be replaced by assured American deterrence : any Iranian nuclear attack on Israel would be treated as an attack on the United States .
Charles Krauthammer , a Washington Post columnist , recently referred to this as “ the Holocaust doctrine . ”
The effect , when the light - emitting wallpaper is ' switched on ' , is stunning
An enterprising young designer from the Netherlands has invented what has to be the ultimate in home illumination – light emitting wallpaper .
The luminescent wallpaper is the brainchild of Jonas Samson , who designed and submitted it as part of his final - year postgraduate degree .
Explanation
So how does it work ?
Well , speaking exclusively to TechRadar , Samson explained that the wallpaper actually uses existing technology , but applies it in a different way :
" The base material is made from a commercially available product that ’s manufactured by a number of companies .
What I have done , though , is to apply that technology in a different way . "
Delving deeper , Samson revealed that the wallpaper is constructed by " sandwiching " a number of layers together that combine to produce light :
" The back layer is a silver - based solution that conducts electricity , while the layer above this contains phosphorous pigments that light up .
On top of this is a flexible , transparent ITO conductor layer , with regular wallpaper placed on top to act as the final , outwardly visual layer , " he explained .
Off the wall
The result , when it ’s switched on , is a visually stunning wall - of - light that can be turned off and on , just like a regular light .
Although Samson first revealed his creation to the public last year , this year ’s upcoming Salone Internazionale del Mobile interior design show in Milan , where he is exhibiting , looks set to make his creation a must - have for those who can afford it .
Ah yes , the price …
Well , given that everything is designed from scratch and made to order , there are no set costs for installation of Samson ’s light - emitting wallpaper .
That said , Samson told us that 6,000 euros could be considered a basic " starting price " .
Obama and his supporters have so far refrained from rummaging through the Clintons ' dirty laundry .
What Obama wishes he could say
Thrown off his game by the Rev. Jeremiah Wright uproar , Barack Obama ’s strongest answer to Hillary Rodham Clinton is one he wo n’t give : Senator , do you really want to get in a contest with me over who has more unsavory personal associations ?
For all the coverage about the rising heat between Clinton and Obama , this year ’s nomination race still is a mild affair by historical standards — restrained by a powerful sense on both sides that there are lots of things they could say but should n’t .
Advertisement
There is one theme , however , that runs through not - for - attribution conversations with both sides : Each candidate thinks the other has unmitigated gall .
The Clintons , to hear associates tell it , are more contemptuous than they ever acknowledge publicly about what they believe is Obama ’s breathtaking arrogance — the way he blithely dismisses the ideological showdowns and policy achievements of the 1990s as “ old politics , ” the way he thinks his thin résumé leaves him qualified to lead the country .
Lately , the contempt level on the Obama side toward his rivals likewise has been soaring .
More precisely , things that many people around the candidate have always believed about the Clintons — about their trail of controversies , about their style of politics — have in recent weeks seemed much more relevant .
That ’s made the temptation to say them in a more public fashion more powerful .
A couple weeks ago , we wrote a column about what Clinton would say if she said what she really thought .
Fairness dictates that we take a crack at the other side of the question :
What arguments has Obama taken off the table , even though he thinks they are true ?
Like the earlier column , sourcing on this one must stay pretty opaque .
And like the earlier column , this one is intended as a reflection , not a validation , of the views expressed in a collection of not - for - attribution conversations with political associates about the behind - the - scenes thinking of the Obama camp .
The one line from the what - Clinton - thinks column that most agitated Obama supporters was our assertion that Clinton , for better or worse , was a known commodity .
Her “ baggage ” has already been “ rummaged through . ”
To which Obama supporters say : Oh yeah ?
All manner of Clinton controversies , Obama partisans argue , have not been fully ventilated .
This includes old issues , like Hillary Clinton ’s legal career , which includes lots of cases that never got much public attention even during the Whitewater era .
It also includes new ones , like recent stories raising questions about the web of personal and financial associations around Bill Clinton .
Since leaving the presidency , he has traveled the globe to exotic places and with sometimes exotic characters , raising money for projects such as his foundation and presidential library and making himself a very wealthy man .
Which gets us back to gall .
In the fantasies of some of his high - level supporters , Obama would peel off the tape to say something like this :
You want to talk hypocrisy ?
How about piously criticizing me for Jeremiah Wright when you have a trail of associations that includes golden oldies like Webb Hubbell ?
( ‘90s flashback :
He was one of Hillary Clinton ’s legal partners and closest friends , whom she installed in a top Justice Department job before prosecutors sent him to prison . )
It also includes modern hits like Frank Giustra .
( In case you missed it : There was a January New York Times story , which did not get the attention the reporting deserved , highlighting how this Canadian tycoon and major Bill Clinton benefactor was using his ties to the ex-president to win business with a ruthless dictatorship in Khazakstan . )
Obama has never pressed Clinton to talk about Marc Rich , even though the former fugitive financier who won a controversial pardon from Bill Clinton gave money to her first Senate campaign .
He has never mentioned her brothers , even though Hugh and Tony Rodham once defied Bill Clinton ’s own top foreign policy advisers by entering into a strange investment in hazelnuts in the former Soviet republic of Georgia ( they later dropped the deal ) and Hugh Rodham took large cash payments for trying to broker presidential pardons .
Obama is likewise galled to be lectured by Clinton for not being sufficiently committed to universal health coverage .
Why is it , his team asks , that Democrats have done so little to advance a long - time progressive goal for the past 15 years ?
The answer has everything to do with Hillary Clinton ’s misjudgments when she was leading the reform effort in 1993 and 1994 .
Most irritating of all to Obama partisans is what they see as her latest pose : that she is selflessly staying in the race despite the long odds against her because of devotion to the Democratic Party and the belief that she is a more appealing general election candidate .
It is an article of faith among most people around Obama that the Clintons were a disaster for the party throughout the 1990s .
When Bill Clinton came to town in 1993 , Democrats were a congressional majority , with 258 seats in the House .
When he left in 2001 , they were a minority with 46 fewer seats .
There were 30 Democratic governors when he arrived , 21 10 years later .
As for electability , the Obama side believes — for all his trouble winning lower - income whites in recent primaries — that it is ludicrous to believe she is the stronger candidate in the fall .
A recent ABC News / Washington Post poll found nearly 60 percent of voters think Clinton is dishonest .
Think about that :
Only four in 10 voters do not think she lies when she needs to .
A majority hold an unfavorable view of her .
Will those numbers improve if she wins the nomination and Republicans resurrect the scandals , the Bill Clinton sexual affairs and her Bosnia fib with the same intensity they brought to the Wright uproar ?
Unthinkable .
Now that the Democratic superdelegates are facing their moment of decision in this close race , you might think it would be time for politesse to give way to an unvarnished discussion about both candidates ' real strengths and liabilities .
The Obama side is frustrated with the news media for not carrying more of its argument .
His operatives thought a Newsday story looking exhaustively at her legal career — including the revelation that as a young lawyer she attacked the credibility of a 12 - year - old rape victim — would provoke a herd of other coverage .
It did not happen .
If he really wanted , Obama could generate all the coverage he wanted about Clinton ’s past by leveling accusations in his own words .
But that is not going to happen .
Politically , he correctly believes that he would be called out as a hypocrite if he practiced the conventional art of attack politics after preaching against it .
And , to view his motives in the best light — a benefit of the doubt extended by his own team — he believes this campaign would also undermine his governing strategy if elected .
He has told associates it would be impossible to win support for a progressive agenda unless he assumes the presidency as a uniting figure who can transcend the personality - obsessed brand of combat that has dominated Washington for the past generation .
“ I told this to my team , you know , we are starting to sound like the other folks , we are starting to run the same negative stuff , ” he told a crowd in North Carolina this week .
“ It shows that none of us are immune from this kind of politics .
But the problem is that it does n’t help you . ”
This is part of a series on the Erlang Exercises which is a great set of programming problems that challenge you to implement solutions to some common Erlang problems .
I 'm going to share some of my solutions to these problems .
Implementing Talk with Distributed Erlang
Make a simple
Talk program that makes it possible to chat with friends at other nodes / hosts .
Hints :
Your program should consist of two registered processes one for reading from the terminal and the other one for recieving messages from the other node then writing them to the terminal .
- module ( tal k2 ) . - compile ( export_all ) . start ( ) ->
OtherNode = clean ( io: get_line ( ' What node ? ' ) ) , FullNode = string : concat( OtherNode , " @localhost " ) , io : format ( " talking to : ~ s~n " , [ FullNode ] ) , register ( receiver , spawn ( ?
MODULE , receiver , [ ] ) ) , register ( sender , spawn ( ?
MODULE , sender , [ list_to_atom ( FullNode ) ] ) ) , get_input ( ) .
get_input ( ) ->
Message = clean ( io: get_line ( ' Talk : ' ) ) , case string : equal ( " exit ! " , Message ) of true -> receiver !
done , sender !
done ; false -> talk ( Message ) , get_input ( ) end. talk ( Message ) -> sender !
{ send , Message}. sender ( OtherNode ) -> receive {send , Message} -> rpc:call( OtherNode , talk2 , send_message , [ Message ] ) , sender ( OtherNode ) ; done -> void end. send_message ( Message ) -> receiver !
{ message , Message} . receiver ( ) -> receive {message , Message} -> io :format ( " ~s~n " , [ Message ] ) , receiver ( ) ; done -> void end. clean ( Data ) -> string : strip ( Data , both , $
) .
Explanation
This is functionally similar to Erlang Talk with Sockets .
The difference is that it is doing Erlang - to - Erlang only communication taking advantage of Erlang 's distributed functionality .
The Socket example could have been made to interact with any programming language that can do socket programming .
start ( ) ->
This starts the application by asking the user for the name of the other Erlang node to talk to .
Erlang nodes are started by running them with a node name erl - name foo .
That along with host information are used to talk to a remote node .
So , first using io : get_line ( ' What node ? ') we ask the user then name of the other node .
Then we spawn 2 processes .
One to receive messages and one to send them .
The interesting part here is the use of the register function .
It takes an atom and a process id .
The register function basically binds a pid to an atom and creates a globally accessible pid .
It just simplifies the code a bit so you do n't have to pass those pids to all of the other functions .
get_input ( ) ->
This is the main user input loop .
It asks the user for a message and then sends that message to the sender process .
io : get_line ( ' Talk : ') waits for user input before it returns , so only after a user types something and hits return will this function continue .
If the case string : equal ( " exit ! " , Message ) do evaluates to true , then the sender and receiver processes are told to exit and the program ends naturally .
Otherwise the message is sent .
talk ( Message ) ->
This function sends the message to the sender process .
sender ( OtherNode ) ->
This is the function that is running as the sender process .
It is initialized with the remote OtherNode information .
It receives messages and forwards them to the OtherNode .
The rpc:call( OtherNode , talk2 , send_message , [ Message ] ) , call invokes the send_message function running on the remote node .
send_message ( Message ) ->
This is really an RPC helper method that passes messages it get to the process running the receive function .
receiver ( ) ->
The receiver is the function that is being run as the receiver process .
It listens for messages and when it gets one it prints it out to the user .
Thoughts
The other interesting way to solve this would be to actually spawn processes remotely on the other node .
The code can then have a reference to a pid running on the remote node and can pass messages to it directly without using the RPC approach .
This would allow one side of the conversation to initiate it without the other knowing about it .
register ( remote_receiver , spawn ( OtherNode , talk2 , receiver , [ ] ) ) , remote_receiver !
" Hello " .
An exercise I 'll leave up to you !
There is just so much wrong with this story that I can't stop laughing at all the possible punchlines available .
This story just does n't stop either .
First Indiana 's 2nd Congressional District Republican candidate Tony Zirkle advocates segregation .
Then he speaks at an Illinois neo -nazi dinner in honor of Adolph Hitler 's birthday .
So how does he follow up ?
He says he was misunderstood .
He did n't mean all Jews .
He only meant the ones having sex with white Christian women .
Zirkle said he feels he was misunderstood .
His real mission , he said , is to rid the country of pornography , and that 's what he was saying at the ANSWP gathering .
So how did his comment about Jews fit in ?
" Most of the male porn stars were Jewish at the beginning , " Zirkle explained .
Now the male porn stars are mostly black , he claimed , and the women who appear in pornographic works tend to be " young , white , Christian women . "
If people think he is targeting the Jews , he said , they are misinterpreting his position .
He is targeting , Zirkle said , the " porn dragon " that inspires Jews to get involved in pornography .
Video of Zirkle 's speech to the American National Socialist Workers Party after the jump .
Notice there 's no birthday cake for Hitler .
You know it 's because Hitler wanted vanilla cake with white frosting and everyone else wanted chocolate .
What a freakin ' idiot .

NBC Anchor Sue Simmons Drops F Bomb on the Air ( Video )
Longtime WNBC - TV news anchorblurted an expletive on the air during a news promo Monday evening .
During the 10 p.m. hour , the station featured a brief promotion for the 11 p.m. news with Simmons and Chuck Scarborough .
Simmons was teasing a story about rising grocery prices when the footage laid over her voice switched to a cruise ship that had a passenger go overboard .
That 's when Simmons blurted " What the f*** are you doing ? "
The outburt was followed by nearly eight seconds of silence .
When the 11 p.m. broadcast aired , Simmons offered an apology to the thousands of shocked viewers .
She said :
I have to acknowledge an unfortunate incident ... I used a word that many people find offensive .
It was a mistake I made and I 'm truly sorry . "
Check out the video below .
The video is unedited so be prepared for what the viewers heard on air .

Remember film ?
Loading it , shooting it all too quickly , driving to the Fotomat — lots of delayed gratification and blurry prints .
Before digital banished those bad memories , there was Polaroid , whose SX - 70 was the first mainstream instant camera to develop photos with no chemical bath — or film - peeling — required .
A smashing success , the camera made Polaroid synonymous with automatic film development and became such a staple of ' 70s life that at one point , Americans reportedly spent more money on Polaroid film than on toothpaste .
The product also endured through the company 's 2001 bankruptcy : Film for the SX - 70 was discontinued only a year ago .
Jake Young , with an excellent post on conditional models :
Now I am not an economist , and I am not qualified to speak to the relative merits of each of these models .
However , I am a scientist , and I have do have experience dealing with conditional models .
By conditional models , I mean that there are circumstances under which the model applies and explains a lot and circumstances under which it does n't .
I can give you an example .
If you work in animal behavior , you learn very quickly that animals -- like people -- respond to incentives .
Give the rat a treat , and you can get the rat to do what you want .
However , incentive learning does not apply under all circumstances .
One example is habitual learning .
If you teach a rat that every time it presses a lever that it gets a treat , it will press that lever a lot .
However , after the animal has repeatedly done this over and over for a long time , you find that if you remove the reward the animal will just keep on pressing that lever -- even though it gets nothing for it .
We say then that the response has become habitual and resistant to reward devaluation .
So I could say that incentives matter in learning generally , but there are circumstances where they do n't .
This is what I see when I read this debate about the minimum wage .
It could be that the perfect competition model functions rather nicely except in the particular circumstance of a small increase in minimum wage .
The question then becomes : what is small ?
Is it 10 cents ?
Is it a dollar ?
When scientists create models , we also have to spend a lot of time defining when and where they apply .
Under 99 % of situations humans deal with , Newtonian mechanics predicts outcomes just fine .
It is just situations near the speed of light where relativity becomes important .
I 'd say that within a dollar or so , increases in the minimum wage produce employment effects that are generally too small to measure .
They also do n't seem to produce much of a measurable reduction in the poverty rate , which is not surprising , because so few workers actually earn minimum wage .
We do have a lot of good literature on price controls , though , and the results are generally pretty much what you 'd expect .
Artificially raise the price , and you get too much supply and not enough demand ; artificially lower it , and you get too much demand and not enough supply .
Lowering product quality may compensate for some of these problems ( employers turn off the air conditioning and end overtime ; landlords stop painting and become profoundly disinterested in pest control . )
But there is no such thing as a free lunch .
These effects mount over time .
Rent control was a great deal in New York in 1955 .
By 1990 , rent controlled , or rent stabilized apartments were generally pretty squalid -- do not believe television shows showcasing palatial apartments available for a song .
Any apartment that great is occupied by a 90 year old lady who moved in during World War II , and you can bet the landlord has a camera on the door so he can prove that whoever tries to inherit it on joint tenancy did not actually live there .
More typical was my ex-boyfriend 's rent stabilized deal on the Upper East Side -- $ 1400 a month for two small bedrooms overlooking an airshaft , a stove that had n't worked since about 1970 , and do n't forget to step over the dead roaches as you come through the door .
The better the deal , the more likely it comes with a " key fee " , aka a very large bribe that returns much of the consumer surplus to the landlord .
And of course , the owner of such a desireable property can afford to be choosy about tenants , so they tend to go to affluent people .
Rent control / stabilization is also the reason that developers refuse to build housing for anyone poor enough to attract sympathetic politicians to their plight -- and thus , in part , for New York 's sub - 2 % vacancy rate .
When I was apartment hunting in DC , I surprised the hell out of potential landlords by showing up with notarized copies of my credit report , wads of cash , and checks ready for deposit and first / last rent -- the standard procedure for procuring an inexpensive apartment in New York .
Apparently , the standard procedure here is to think about it for a few days and then mosey over and sign a lease sometime that month .
But over the short term , price controls can look like they are working ( for some values of the word " working " ) , because price elasticity is almost always much greater over the long run than short term .
The real reason that minimum wages have n't been particularly worrisome in the United States is that there has n't been much of a long run over the past few decades ; inflation and GDP growth have eroded its value before it got too onerous .
Of course , supporters of the minimum wage are working very hard to change that .
BAGHDAD 
The commander of United States troops in Baghdad asked local leaders and tribal sheiks this weekend for their forgiveness after the discovery that a soldier had used a Koran for target practice at a shooting range .
Responding to an episode ripe with the potential to stoke unrest , the commander , Maj. Gen. Jeffery Hammond , held a meeting Saturday with Iraqi leaders .
“ I come before you here seeking your forgiveness , ” General Hammond said at the meeting , in remarks carried by CNN .
“ In the most humble manner , I look in your eyes today and I say , please forgive me and my soldiers . ”
General Hammond also read a letter of apology from the soldier , who was not identified .
“ I sincerely hope that my actions have not diminished the partnership that our two nations have developed together , ” the general read from the letter .
The AP tracks the delegate races by projecting the number of pledged national convention delegates won by candidates in each presidential primary or caucus , based on state and national party rules , and by interviewing unpledged delegates to obtain their preferences .
In some states , like Iowa and Nevada , local precinct caucuses are the first stage in the allocation process .
The AP uses preferences expressed in those caucuses to project the number of national convention delegates each candidate will have when they are chosen at county , congressional district or state conventions .
Unpledged Democratic delegates , known as " super delegates , " are not bound by the results of the primary or caucus and can vote for any candidate they choose at the party 's national convention , Aug. 25 - 28 in Denver .
The elected officials , Democratic National Committee members and party leaders who are " super delegates " can change their presidential preferences at any time , and the AP changes delegate numbers accordingly when they do .

— The parents of a 6 - year - old girl say her quick thinking saved the life of her little brother .
The girl was traveling in a GMC Yukon when another vehicle hit it Saturday .
It happened on Highway 210 in Angier .
" It was on fire , ” daughter Alexis Pencola said Wednesday .
The SUV caught fire immediately after being struck .
" All I thought about was the truck was going to explode .
The trooper told me that does n't happen , only in movies , but that 's what you think about , ” mother Chrystal Pencola said .
The Highway Patrol said the Yukon slid about 83 feet before stopping .
" I could n't get my seatbelt off , the door would n't open and my kids were in the back , ” Chrystal Pencola said .
So it was up to Alexis , 6 , to get her 3 - year - old brother , Tyler , out of the vehicle .
The airbags had deployed and the automatic locks had shut down .
" I unlocked his seatbelt and I unlocked mine and I unlocked my door and everything , ” Alexis Pencola said .
" She could have just gotten out and ran from being scared .
She could have locked up and not even been able to get the door open or even get her seatbelt off , but she didn't , ” Chrystal Pencola said .
" We are blessed .
We are very blessed that none of us were hurt or killed . "
The driver of the vehicle that hit the Pencola family was charged with failure to yield .

Hillary Clinton pulled out a dramatic late night squeaker of a win in Indiana 51% - 49 % , but Clinton wo n’t be appearing on the morning news shows as scheduled , and she only has kept a fundraiser on her schedule for tomorrow .
This is looking like the behavior of a candidate that is n’t long for this race .
A deflated sounding Hillary Clinton vowed to fight on last night , “ Not too long ago , my opponent made a prediction .
He said I would probably win Pennsylvania .
He would win North Carolina , and Indiana would be the tie - breaker .
Well , tonight we ’ve come from behind , we ’ve broken the tie , and thanks to you , it ’s full speed on to the White House . ”
The funny thing about Indiana was that the polls had the state a dead heat , and this primary turned out to be a virtual tie .
What this close win , along with her blowout loss in loss in North Carolina , does is that it makes it virtually impossible for her to win the nomination .
Even if Michigan and Florida are counted , Clinton would still trail in delegates and the popular vote .
Advertisements
The money is n’t coming in , and the Clintons really need to think about whether or not they want to run up campaign debt for an election they can’t win .
Clinton also sounded the horn of party unity during her Indianapolis speech , “ It is time for all of us to recognize what is at stake in this election , not just for Democrats as we decide who will be our nominee , but for all Americans . ”
For the first time last night , Clinton looked defeated .
She may stay in the race and pick up easy wins in West Virginia , Kentucky , and Puerto Rico , but I think that her days of seriously contesting the nomination are winding down .
I would not be surprised if she quits buying television time , and scales back her campaign .
No one should be surprised if Hillary retires her negative campaign and takes a more unifying tone .
I think even she sees that this is all but over .

The result : an instant classic , even without the Hovitos .
Let 's hope the actual movie is this crazy and preposterous .

Who are they talking about ?
Why have n’t I ever heard of him ?
I was at SRI , a research institute by the Stanford campus .
Around me was a lively group of some of the best minds in Computer Science , some of them have had their PhDs in the field for 40 years .
I had the honor of being the least credentialed person in the room .
As I listened to some of the discussions , I noticed that they seemed to keep bringing up the name “ Licklider . ”
Sometimes they ’d just call him “ Lick . ”
Other times they ’d mention projects along with his name that I had n’t heard about before like “ Project MAC . ”
Since the guys talked so much about him , I knew I had to find out more about who this “ Lick ” guy was .
One of them suggested that I read the book “ The Dream Machine : J.C.R. Licklider and the Revolution That Made Computing Personal ” by M. Mitchell Waldrop .
My local library had the book .
I was a bit worried when I saw that it had n’t been checked out for three years .
“ Hmm … maybe it ’s not that good ? ” I thought .
I was pleasantly surprised .
At about 500 pages , it ’s not a small book .
Fortunately , I was able to finish it just before the library forced me to return it since I hit the maximum amount of renewals on it .
The book put me on a journey that filled in a lot of details about computing history that I did n’t even know I was clueless about while weaving a story about a man from Missouri .
Although his full name was Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider , just about everyone called him “ Lick , ” a name he acquired in his fraternity days .
Lick ’s story is bigger than just one guy .
It ’s a story that goes back to the dawn of computing right up to the personal computer .
While reading the book , I had a lot of “ Aha ! ” moments that helped fill me into the colorful history of computing .
For example , I had heard a lot about DEC ’s PDP system , but it was interesting to know that they were specifically called “ Programmed Data Processors ” instead of “ computers ” because congress was pressured not to spend any more money on computers at the time .
By itself , facts like these seem to be obscure trivia , but when you read about the politics of funding at the time , you can really understand that DEC had few alternatives .
I ca n’t recall ever hearing Licklider ’s name before that meeting at SRI , but that ’s probably because I did n’t try too hard .
As a kid interested in computers growing up in the 1990’s , I really focused my attention on learning about one person - Bill Gates .
I read several books about him and had a reasonably good idea of his background and the history of Traf - O - Data , Microsoft and some of its products like BASIC , DOS , OS /2 , Windows , and NT .
Perhaps in the back of my mind I thought that learning about him would me emulate his success and make me millions billions .
Too bad that did n’t work out .
In addition to the books , my other major source of information was when I watched Bob Cringely ’s Triumph of the Nerds on PBS in the summer before I started high school .
In hindsight , after reading this book I really wish I would have watched the 1998 follow - on to the series called “ Nerds 2.01 : A Brief History of the Internet . ”
I would have at least heard about Licklider and the computing days before Microsoft and Apple and not been so clueless back at that room in SRI .
What a story it is !
It ’s not really just about Lick ; it ’s about how he helped build a community that fostered the explosive computing growth in the 1960 ’s right through the 70’s and 80’s .
Since I like to ask others what stuck out in books that they ’ve read , I thought I ’d share some things I found interesting :
22 Days of Beeps Can Change a Nation
Chapter 6 opens on a rocket launch pad in the early morning of October 1957 at a top secret Soviet Union location .
When the rocket took off and deployed its payload , the world came to know Sputnik by its incessant beep beep beep transmissions .
Waldrop quotes this account :
” [ Sputnik ’s ] two transmitters would fail twenty - three days after launch - but their arrogant beeping would continue to sound in the American memory for years to come …
Gone forever in this country was the myth of American superiority in all things technical and scientific . ” ( p. 197 )
Although the U.S. had rockets under development that were more sophisticated than the Soviet ones , it was a huge blow to American pride and there was a large public outcry .
Everyone made the connection : if the Soviets could launch a satellite into space , they could probably launch a missile into any major U.S. city .
One famous result of this perceived threat was President Eisenhower ’s endorsement of “ a plan to consolidate all the Pentagon ’s space research under a new civilian agency reporting directly to the secretary of defense .
It would be called the Advanced Research Projects Agency , or ARPA . ”
Well it did n’t quite work out exactly as planned .
Before ARPA opened for business , it had already been split up .
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) would handle all the non-military space projects and the services would get a large amount their funding back to handle most of their development projects .
This left ARPA with “ the kind of beyond - the - cutting - edge stuff that the services were willing to do without . ” ( p. 198 )
ARPA was n’t initially interested in computers .
To them , they were really only helpful for things like accounting and payroll .
This changed when ARPA was tasked to research new command and control ideas that would require a lot of data processing .
This seemed like an ideal fit for computers .
Licklider was asked to come over to ARPA and lead the new project .
He did n’t want to take the job at first .
He was already doing interesting things with computers and was so busy working on fleshing out his ideas of computer assisted “ libraries of the future ” to even think about burying himself in “ the bureaucratic limbo of Washington . ” ( p. 201 )
Once he warmed up to the idea of going to ARPA , he began thinking that the command and control concept was ultimately a man-machine symbiosis , something he had been thinking about for years .
In March of 1960 , he published his famous “ Man- Computer Symbiosis ” which began :
“ The fig tree is pollinated only by the insect Blastophaga grossorun .
The larva of the insect lives in the ovary of the fig tree , and there it gets its food .
The tree and the insect are thus heavily interdependent : the tree cannot reproduce without the insect ; the insect cannot eat without the tree ; together , they constitute not only a viable but a productive and thriving partnership .
This cooperative ‘ living together in intimate association , or even close union , of two dissimilar organisms ’ is called symbiosis .
‘ Man - computer symbiosis ’ is a subclass of man-machine systems .
There are many man-machine systems .
At present , however , there are no man-computer symbioses .
The purposes of this paper are to present the concept and , hopefully , to foster the development of man-computer symbiosis by analyzing some problems of interaction between men and computing machines , calling attention to applicable principles of man-machine engineering , and pointing out a few questions to which research answers are needed .
The hope is that , in not too many years , human brains and computing machines will be coupled together very tightly , and that the resulting partnership will think as no human brain has ever thought and process data in a way not approached by the information - handling machines we know today . ”
This might not seem radical in 2008 , but it was revolutionary back in the 1960 ’s when most people could only think of computers as batch processing machines .
Lick saw computers in a symbiosis where humans could do the thinking and the machines would do the “ algorithmic chores they were so good at ” ( p.148 ) .
In order to find out how much of a benefit they ’d be , he did an experiment on himself and found to his horror that he spent 85 % of his time just “ getting into a position to think , to make a decision , to learn something I needed to know . ”
The rest of the time was just clerical or mechanical .
Computers would be a perfect fit to handle all the dreary stuff that got in the way of real thinking .
Lick knew that he could start making the man-computer symbiosis concept real and get the government to pay for it through his association with ARPA .
Lick ’s view was “ that the problems of command and control were essentially problems of man-computer interaction .
I thought it was just ridiculous having command - and - control systems based on batch processing .
Who can direct a battle when he ’s got to write a program in the middle of a battle ? ” ( p. 202 )
On the next page we see :
“ Improbably , miraculously , through some once - in - a - lifetime alignment of all the right planets , ARPA was offering him a chance to turn his vision into a reality .
He could reinvent the whole field of computing .
He could transform those giant calculating machines into full - fledged partners in a human creativity .
He could create ‘ information utilities ’ that spanned the continent .
He could democratize information by opening up vast libraries of material to instant access by anyone .
And he could do it all with the Pentagon ’s money . ” ( p. 203 )
And boy did he ever :
“ [ The professional bureaucrats ] had a history of giving grants to individual people in twenty - thousand - dollar chunks .
But Lick was talking about millions of dollars and whole teams of people .
It was as though these folks had encountered this alien creature : friendly , but strange . ” ( p. 206 )
In addition to funding research organizations like SDC , RAND , and SRI , Lick is remembered for helping fund the new computer science departments at Berkeley , Stanford , Carnegie Mellon , and perhaps most famously , MIT .
Lick ’s funding at MIT went towards a system that would put together several foundational ideas needed for his man-computer symbiosis .
The goal was “ Machine - Aided - Cognition , ” but since computer time was hard to come by and they had to invent a lot of the concepts for time - sharing to allow multiple people to access a computer at once , the project also went by the name “ Multiple Access Computer . ”
Regardless of which one you chose , the acronym was the same .
“ So that ’s the Project MAC the folks in the room were talking about , ” I thought as I read about it .
Project MAC would lay a lot of the foundations for modern operating systems .
Examples include technologies like multitasking and file systems to policies such as regular backups to protect themselves from their mistakes .
They had to introduce passwords to stop some people from stealing computer time as well as ideas from unpublished academic papers .
Unix and the C language it was written in was an offshoot of this project as an attempt to write a simpler version than what the Project MAC team was trying to accomplish .
And yet , Project MAC was just one of the many projects that Lick was funding and tracking .
To the outside observer , all of the projects seemed like an ad hoc mess rather than a carefully crafted plan .
Lick knew that his man-computer symbiosis dream would need to be maintained by more than just him .
Waldrop writes :
“ Lick realized , if this vision was ever going to outlast his tenure at ARPA , he would somehow have to forge all these groups into a self - reinforcing , self - sustaining community . ” ( p. 225 )
One such example of how he did this was his famous 1963 memo which began : “ [ to the ] Members and Affiliates of the Intergalactic Computer Network . ”
In his mind , Lick was referring to a human network .
He continued : “ It is evident that we have among us a collection of individual ( personal and / or organizational ) aspirations , efforts , activities , and projects . ”
The challenge now was to exploit “ the possibilities for mutual advantage ” .
He went on to describe a connected system that would keep all the research projects together , a network focused on human thoughts but connected by wires .
In essence , the early signs of the Internet .
But it took some time to materialize and did n’t happen during Lick ’s ARPA tenure .
He did make progress .
Due to the computing focus that Lick had caused , his ARPA division was given the title “ Information Processing Techniques Office ” ( IPTO ) .
After his two year tenure at ARPA , Lick handed the reins over to a young Ivan Sutherland ( creator of Sketchpad , which launched the field computer graphics and computer aided design ) .
When Sutherland finished his tenure , Bob Taylor would take over and proceed to actually make Lick ’s “ Intergalactic Network ” of people a real physical thing by linking ARPA people together into ARPANET , the direct predecessor of the Internet .
The first message went across it at 10:30 PM on October 29 , 1969 .
Two interesting things from the book stand out right around this period of time .
The first was that the height of the Vietnam War was taking a huge toll on the nation , both in terms of people and dollars .
In a reported attempt to limit spending on the war , Montana senator Mike Mansfield proposed an amendment that would prevent the Defense Department from “ [ carrying ] out any research project or study unless such project or study has a direct and apparent relationship to a specific military function . ”
The practical effect of the “ Mansfield Amendment ” was that it diverted a large percentage of people ’s time into writing how their project had a “ direct and apparent ” relevancy .
It ’s also one of the largest reasons why ARPA is now known as DARPA :
“ In retrospect , moreover , [ the Mansfield Amendment ] came to be seen as the symbolic watershed for ARPA , the point at which it started its downhill slide from being a cutting - edge agency that was blessedly free to take risks to being an ordinary agency that was cautious and risk - averse . ” ( p. 395 )
The second big thing was that in May of 1969 , Xerox was making a lot of money selling copiers .
But their management knew they had to be more than a one product company .
In an attempt to branch out and “ go digital , ” they purchased Scientific Data Systems ( SDS ) .
However , they had a problem : the company was largely computer illiterate .
They needed to go out and recruit the best computer people the world had .
One of their first hires was none other than former ARPA IPTO director Bob Taylor .
Taylor would go on to attract many from Lick ’s “ Intergalactic Network ” ARPA community who had been distressed by the Mansfield Amendment and its research cutting implications .
The resulting Xerox Palo Alto Research Center ( PARC ) was the place to be in the 1970’s .
It fostered freedom to explore ideas just like the early ARPA days since its backers were willing to invest in long - term innovation .
Its anti-corporate culture included meetings filled with beanbag chairs which prevented people from leaping out of their chair to argue with someone .
This ‘ helped ’ you hear them out .
PARC would go on to create the foundations of personal computing as we know it with their Alto personal computer which was named after the city they were in .
The Alto had new ideas like bitmapped displays , windows , an Ethernet network , WYSIWYG word processing , laser printing , and roots of modern object oriented programming .
Unfortunately , Xerox ’s management did n’t quite understand the business value of what their PARC guys were creating .
Additionally , the guys inside PARC had a hard time creating a clear path and business model for getting their ideas to market .
There was one notable exception .
Waldrop writes :
“ If [ Jack Goldman ] had n’t thrown a tantrum [ in order to get the business guys to listen ] , they might just have rejected the laser printer itself - the one PARC - bred product that would eventually earn billions for Xerox and repay its investment in PARC many times over . ” ( p. 392 )
Steve Jobs , along with some other engineers , would visit PARC in December of 1979 for a demonstration of the Alto system .
Jobs was so enamored by the graphical interface that he saw that he did n’t even explore the object oriented programming and networking ideas .
During the visit , Jobs reportedly exclaimed “ Why has n’t this company brought this to market ? ” ( p. 443 ) He did n’t wait around for Xerox .
Apple ’s first graphical computer , “ Lisa , ” ‘ borrowed ’ several ideas from the Alto .
When the Lisa and IBM PC hit the market in the early 80’s , the guys inside PARC realized that Xerox had blown a huge opportunity .
Many jumped ship .
One example was Charles Simonyi , who took his ideas Bravo word processing ideas north to a relatively new company in Washington named Microsoft .
It was a huge difference in culture .
Simonyi ’s commented on the contrast :
“ It was like going into the graveyard or retirement home before going into the maternity ward .
You could see that Microsoft could do things one hundred times faster , literally , I ’m not kidding .
Six years from that point , we overtook Xerox in market valuation . ” ( p. 449 )
And that brought me full circle back to the pop culture history I was more familiar with .
Throughout the years
Lick would stay involved in some part with the research community , sometimes getting bogged down with management tasks which he despised .
He would teach at MIT through the 80s with students that would only later realize all that he had done .
Failing health caused him to pass away at the age of 75 on June 26 , 1990 : just before the world at large would come to use the “ Intergalactic Network . ”
Lick was known for being quite modest about his contributions , often minimizing his role .
When asked about what he did , he said :
“ I think that I found a lot of bright people and got them working in this area .
I got it moving .
[ And it was ] a fantastic community .
I guess that ’s the word .
It was more than just a collection of bright people .
It was a thing that organized itself into a community , so that there was some competition and some cooperation , and it resulted in the emergence of a field . ” ( p. 258 )
So that ’s why they kept talking about him .
Now I get it .
Lick organized a community that would change the computing world .
He realized that it ’s ultimately the people that matter .
I think that our industry puts too much emphasis on technology and tends to marginalize people .
I think that one of the first steps to reverse this trend is to understand the contributions of its founders like Lick .
“ The Dream Machine ” was a good book .
I recommend it to anyone who might be curious about what happened in computing before the Microsoft , Apple , and especially Google days .
From the early days of Von Neumann and Turing , right up to the 90’s , Waldrop ’s detailed research helped the story come alive .
The book appears to be out of print , but it is well worth a visit to your library or getting a used copy .
If you made it this far , I ’d really love to hear your comments on a few related questions :
“ Come and see our overflowing morgues and find our little ones for us …
You may find them in this corner or the other , a little hand poking out , pointing out at you …
Come and search for them in the rubble of your “ surgical ” air raids , you may find a little leg or a little head … pleading for your attention .
Come and see them amassed in the garbage dumps , scavenging morsels of food …
Come and see , come … ”
— “ Flying Kites ” Layla Anwar
The US military has won every battle it has fought in Iraq , but it has lost the war .
Wars are won politically , not militarily .
Bush does n’t understand this .
He still clings to the belief that a political settlement can be imposed through force , but he is mistaken .
The use of overwhelming force has only spread the violence and added to the political instability .
Now Iraq is ungovernable .
Miles of concrete blast - walls snake through Baghdad to separate the warring parties .
The country is fragmented into a hundred smaller pieces each ruled by local militia commanders .
These are the signs of failure not success .
That ’s why the American people no longer support the occupation .
They ’re just being practical ; they know Bush ’s plan wo n’t work .
As Nir Rosen says , “ Iraq has become Somalia . ”
The administration still supports Iraqi President Nouri al Maliki , but al - Maliki is a meaningless figurehead who will have no effect on the country ’s future .
He has no popular base of support and controls nothing beyond the walls of the Green Zone .
The al - Maliki government is merely an Arab facade designed to convince the American people that political progress is being made .
But there is no progress ; its a sham .
The future is in the hands of the men with guns ; they ’re the ones who have divided Iraq into locally - controlled fiefdoms and they are the ones who will ultimately decide who will rule the state .
At present , the fighting between the factions is being described as “ sectarian warfare , ” but the term is intentionally misleading .
The fighting is political in nature ; the various militias are competing with each other to see who will fill the vacuum left by the removal of Saddam .
It ’s a power struggle .
The media likes to portray the conflict as a clash between half - crazed Arabs — “ dead - enders and terrorists ” — who relish the idea killing their countrymen , but that ’s just a way of demonizing the enemy .
In truth , the violence is entirely rational ; it is the inevitable reaction to the dissolution of the state and the occupation by foreign troops .
Many military experts predicted that there would be outbreaks of fighting after the initial invasion , but their warnings were shrugged off by clueless politicians and the cheerleading media .
Now the violence has flared up again in Basra and Baghdad , and there is no end in sight .
The only thing that ’s certain is that Iraq ’s future will not be decided at the ballot box .
Bush has made sure of that .
The US military does n’t rule Iraq nor does it have the power to control events on the ground .
It ’s just one of many militias vying for power in a state that is ruled by warlords .
After the army conducts combat operations , it is forced to retreat to its camps and bases .
This point needs to be emphasized in order to understand that there is no real future for the occupation .
The US simply does not have the manpower to hold territory or to establish security .
In fact , the presence of American troops incites more violence because they ’re seen as occupiers rather than liberators .
Surveys show that the vast majority of the Iraqi people want the troops to leave .
The military has destroyed too much of the country and slaughtered too many people to expect that these attitudes will change anytime soon .
Iraqi poet and blogger Layla Anwar sums up the feelings of many of the war ’s victims in a recent post on her web site “ An Arab Women ’s Blues ” :
At the gates of Babylon the Great , you are still struggling , fighting away , chasing this or the other , detaining , bombing from above , filling up morgues , hospitals , graveyards and embassies and borders with queues for exit-visas .
Not one Iraqi wishes your presence .
Not one Iraqi accepts your occupation .
Got news for you Motherfuckers , you will never control Iraq , not in six years , not in ten years , not in 20 years …
You have brought upon yourself the hate and the curse of all Iraqis , Arabs and the rest of the world … now face your agony . ”
( Layla Anwar ; “ An Arab Women ’s Blues : Reflections in a sealed bottle ” )
If Bush hoping to change the mind of Anwar or the millions of other Iraqis who have lost loved ones in the war , he ’s wasting his time .
The hearts and minds campaign is lost .
The US will never be welcome in Iraq .
According to a survey in the British Medical Journal Lancet more than a million Iraqis have been killed in the war .
Another four million have been either internally - displaced or have fled the country .
But the figures tell us nothing about the magnitude of the disaster that Bush has created by attacking Iraq .
The invasion is the greatest human catastrophe in the Middle East since the Nakba in 1948 .
Living standards have declined precipitously in every area — infant mortality , clean water , food - security , medical supplies , education , electrical power , employment etc .
Even oil production is still below pre-war levels .
The invasion is the biggest policy blunder since Vietnam ; everything has gone wrong .
The center of the Arab world is in chaos and the suffering is incalculable .
The main problem is the occupation ; it is the catalyst for the violence and an obstacle to political progress .
As long as the occupation persists , so will the fighting .
The claims that the so - called surge has changed the political landscape are greatly exaggerated .
Retired Lt. General William Odom commented on this point in an interview on the Jim Lerher News Hour :
The surge has sustained military instability and achieved nothing in political consolidation . . .
Things are much worse now .
And I do n’t see them getting any better .
This was foreseeable a year and a half ago .
And to continue to put the cozy veneer of comfortable half - truths on this is to deceive the American public and to make them think it is not the charade it is …
When you say that the Lebanization of Iraq is taking place , yes , but not because of Iran , but because the U.S. went in and made this kind of fragmentation possible .
And it has occurred over the last five years . . .
The al - Maliki government is worse off now . . .
The notion that there ; ’s some kind of progress is absurd .
The al - Maliki government uses its Ministry of Interior like a death squad militia .
So to call Sadr an extremist and Maliki a good guy just overlooks the reality that there are no good guys .
The war in Iraq was lost before the first shot was fired .
The conflict never had the support of the American people and Iraq never posed a threat to US national security .
The whole rationale for the war was based on lies ; it was a coup orchestrated by elites and the media to carry out a far - right agenda .
Now the mission has failed , but no one wants to admit their mistakes by withdrawing ; so the butchery continues unabated .
Iraq : How Will It End ?
The Bush administration has decided to pursue a strategy that is unprecedented in US history .
It has decided to continue to prosecute a war that has already been lost morally , strategically , and militarily .
But fighting a losing war has its costs .
America is much weaker now than it was when Bush first took office in 2000 .
The army is stretched to the breaking point and US prestige has never been lower .
Still , the troops probably wo n’t be withdrawn until all other options have been exhausted .
And that could turn out to be a serious miscalculation .
Deteriorating economic conditions in the financial markets are putting tremendous pressure on the dollar .
The corporate bond and equities markets are in disarray , the banking system is collapsing , consumer spending is down , tax revenues are falling , and the country is headed into a deep and protracted recession .
The US will leave Iraq sooner than many pundits believe , but it will not be at a time of our choosing .
More likely , the conflict will end when the United States no longer has the capacity to wage war , that is , when the Chinese and the oil - producing countries ( The Gulf States ) stop financing our enormous current account deficit .
When the funding stops , the bloodshed will end .
The Iraq War signals the end of US interventionism for at least a generation or more .
The sting of withdrawal will not be quickly forgotten .
The ideological pillar upon which the war was built — regime change — has been exposed as a fraud , a baseless justification for unprovoked aggression .
Someone will have to be held accountable .
There will have to be tribunals to determine who is responsible for the deaths of over one million Iraqis .
It is one of the oddest facts in American history that the two most important American political speeches in the twentieth century were delivered about 70 hours apart .
The most prophetic Presidential speech in American history ever delivered by a sitting President was made by a man who possessed , at least until the arrival of George W. Bush , the reputation for being the least competent verbal communicator in modern Presidential history .
The other speech laid the rhetorical foundations for a foreign policy that has culminated in the worst military disaster in American history .
The first speech is Eisenhower ’s Farewell Address .
We call it the Farewell Address in honor of George Washington ’s Farewell Address .
These are the only two departing Presidents ’ speeches that anyone remembers .
Yet Eisenhower ’s was the only true address .
Washington ’s was never spoken .
It was a speech printed in a newspaper .
The two farewell addresses are remembered for two phrases relating to the same theme : American foreign policy .
The phrase of Washington ’s that has rung out down through the centuries is this : “ no entangling alliances . ”
The phrase of Eisenhower ’s that is remembered is this : “ the military - industrial complex . ”
The concept of no entangling alliances has become the hallmark of Washington ’s recommended legacy to the nation .
It has served as a guiding star to American defenders of a non-interventionist foreign policy .
It is a therefore a shame that he never said it .
What he said was this :
It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world ; so far , I mean , as we are now at liberty to do it ; . . .
Taking care always to keep ourselves by suitable establishments on a respectable defensive posture , we may safely trust to temporary alliances for extraordinary emergencies .
This does not have the same ring to it , does it ?
Then who said “ no entangling alliances ” ?
Jefferson , in his First Inaugural .
The second speech of the century was delivered a little under 70 hours after Eisenhower ’s : John F. Kennedy ’s Inaugural Address .
We recall its ringing phrase : “ And so , my fellow Americans , ask not what your country can do for you ; ask what you can do for your country . ”
And so , my fellow Americans , let us review these two speeches .
EISENHOWER’S FAREWELL ADDRESS ( Jan. 17 , 1961 )
This speech was as accurate an assessment of what faced the nation as any public address ever delivered by a sitting President .
Given what has happened since the evening when he delivered the speech , we can call it near - prophetic .
The only document that I can think of that matches it for the accuracy of both its assessment and its predictive accuracy is Edmund Burke ’s Reflections on the Revolution in France ( 1790 ) .
That document was a lot longer and reached a much smaller audience .
Eisenhower began with an assessment of what he had pulled off during the previous six years .
He did it graciously .
I can think of no one who has ever publicly denied the accuracy of his assessment .
Instead , pundits and historians have preferred to ignore it .
Eisenhower had faced a Congress controlled by the Democrats for the final six years of his two terms .
Yet he had got what he asked for most of the time .
In this final relationship , the Congress and the Administration have , on most vital issues , cooperated well , to serve the nation good , rather than mere partisanship , and so have assured that the business of the nation should go forward .
So , my official relationship with the Congress ends in a feeling — on my part — of gratitude that we have been able to do so much together .
Eisenhower had avoided what could have been six years of confrontation with a hostile Congress .
He and they went along to get along .
Then he got to the point of his rhetorical legacy to the nation : America ’s military and economic power .
We now stand ten years past the midpoint of a century that has witnessed four major wars among great nations .
Three of these involved our own country .
Despite these holocausts , America is today the strongest , the most influential , and most productive nation in the world .
Understandably proud of this pre-eminence , we yet realize that America ’s leadership and prestige depend , not merely upon our unmatched material progress , riches , and military strength , but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment .
That was the crucial political issue in 1961 , and it remains so today .
Eisenhower had bought into the Wilsonian Party Line , which Franklin Roosevelt had also adopted and Truman had extended .
Throughout America ’s adventure in free government , our basic purposes have been to keep the peace , to foster progress in human achievement , and to enhance liberty , dignity , and integrity among peoples and among nations .
To strive for less would be unworthy of a free and religious people .
Any failure traceable to arrogance , or our lack of comprehension , or readiness to sacrifice would inflict upon us grievous hurt , both at home and abroad .
He then referred to the Soviet menace , though not by name .
He referred to “ the conflict now engulfing the world . ”
Unhappily , the danger it poses promises to be of indefinite duration .
To meet it successfully , there is called for , not so much the emotional and transitory sacrifices of crisis , but rather those which enable us to carry forward steadily , surely , and without complaint the burdens of a prolonged and complex struggle with liberty the stake .
Only thus shall we remain , despite every provocation , on our charted course toward permanent peace and human betterment .
Here was Woodrow Wilson ’s vision of American foreign policy : “ our charted course toward permanent peace and human betterment . ”
It declares a comprehensive , messianic worldview .
But Eisenhower , unlike his successors and his predecessors , had counted the cost and then issued a warning .
Do not put your faith in miracles at the Federal level , he said .
Crises there will continue to be .
In meeting them , whether foreign or domestic , great or small , there is a recurring temptation to feel that some spectacular and costly action could become the miraculous solution to all current difficulties .
Then the retired general made an assessment of what had happened during his term in office .
A profound transition had occurred .
Our military organization today bears little relation to that known of any of my predecessors in peacetime , or , indeed , by the fighting men of World War II or Korea .
Until the latest of our world conflicts , the United States had no armaments industry .
American makers of plowshares could , with time and as required , make swords as well .
But we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense .
We have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions .
. . .
Now this conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience .
The total influence — economic , political , even spiritual — is felt in every city , every Statehouse , every office of the Federal government .
We recognize the imperative need for this development .
Yet , we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications .
Our toil , resources , and livelihood are all involved .
So is the very structure of our society .
For a man who had the reputation within the media of a verbal fumbler and golf - playing time - server , this was potent rhetoric .
It was not just potent rhetoric .
It was a profound insight into the nature of American society .
I can think of no greater profundity in any President ’s speech .
Then he escalated his rhetoric .
In the councils of government , we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence , whether sought or unsought , by the military - industrial complex .
The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist .
We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes .
We should take nothing for granted .
Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals , so that security and liberty may prosper together .
Next , he referred to the growing influence of the Federal government over scientific and technological research .
He used highly effective imagery .
Today , the solitary inventor , tinkering in his shop , has been overshadowed by task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields .
In the same fashion , the free university , historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery , has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research .
Partly because of the huge costs involved , a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity .
For every old blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers .
The prospect of domination of the nation ’s scholars by Federal employment , project allocations , and the power of money is ever present — and is gravely to be regarded .
Five years later , Robert Nisbet wrote “ Project Camelot and the Science of Man . ”
He drew a bead on one military research project out of tens of thousands as the archetype of what too much money , too much arrogance , and too much Federal power can produce .
But he added nothing of substance to what Eisenhower said in his Farewell Address .
Yet , in holding scientific research and discovery in respect , as we should , we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific - technological elite .
This , too , was then and remains a powerful elite .
It is a well - funded elite .
The Federal government is the primary source of its funding .
Then he moved to economics .
Specifically , he described the present - orientation of government spending , which is accompanied by unstoppable and irreversible debt .
Another factor in maintaining balance involves the element of time .
As we peer into society ’s future , we — you and I , and our government — must avoid the impulse to live only for today , plundering for our own ease and convenience the precious resources of tomorrow .
We cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without risking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage .
We want democracy to survive for all generations to come , not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow .
Then he called for international disarmament .
Consider the context .
John F. Kennedy had barely defeated Richard Nixon .
He had offered only one substantive issue : an alleged missile gap between the United States and the Soviet Union .
There was no such gap , and Kennedy did not again refer to it .
He had played the “ weapons of mass destruction ” card .
He bluffed .
It had worked .
Eisenhower called for the elimination of such a weapons gap , not by accumulating more weapons of mass destruction but fewer .
Disarmament , with mutual honor and confidence , is a continuing imperative .
Together we must learn how to compose differences , not with arms , but with intellect and decent purpose .
Because this need is so sharp and apparent , I confess that I lay down my official responsibilities in this field with a definite sense of disappointment .
As one who has witnessed the horror and the lingering sadness of war , as one who knows that another war could utterly destroy this civilization which has been so slowly and painfully built over thousands of years , I wish I could say tonight that a lasting peace is in sight .
Eisenhower was trapped between Woodrow Wilson ’s messianic vision for America and the costs of implementing it .
Wilson ’s vision was a systematic and self - conscious secularization of the Presbyterian postmillennialism that his father , Rev. Joseph Ruggles Wilson , the Stated Clerk of the Southern Presbyterian Church , had held dear .
Eisenhower waxed uncharacteristically eloquent in his praise of the younger Wilson ’s vision .
To all the peoples of the world , I once more give expression to America ’s prayerful and continuing aspiration :
We pray that peoples of all faiths , all races , all nations , may have their great human needs satisfied ; that those now denied opportunity shall come to enjoy it to the full ; that all who yearn for freedom may experience its few spiritual blessings .
Those who have freedom will understand , also , its heavy responsibility ; that all who are insensitive to the needs of others will learn charity ; and that the sources — scourges of poverty , disease , and ignorance will be made [ to ] disappear from the earth ; and that in the goodness of time , all peoples will come to live together in a peace guaranteed by the binding force of mutual respect and love .
Three days later , his successor waxed even more eloquent in the defense of this vision .
KENNEDY ’S INAUGURAL ADDRESS ( Jan. 20 , 1961 )
Kennedy began with a declaration : this coronation event was strictly nonpartisan .
This could easily be dismissed as political business as usual , yet it was an accurate assessment .
Eisenhower three days before had articulated a similarly nonpartisan declaration of dedication to Wilson ’s vision .
We observe today not a victory of party , but a celebration of freedom — symbolizing an end , as well as a beginning — signifying renewal , as well as change .
This is covenantal language — the language of covenant renewal .
Every covenant has five sections : a declaration of sovereignty , a doctrine of institutional representation , a system of law , a system of institutional sanctions — positive and negative — and a system of succession .
Every covenant rests on a public oath before God.
Covenant renewal is an aspect of the covenantal oath : point four of the covenant model .
For a church , covenant renewal is the Lord ’s Supper .
For a civil government , it is voting .
In the United States , the Inaugural Address of a President is the supreme act of national covenant renewal .
It is the celebration of succession .
Kennedy ’s speech writers fully understood this , just as Franklin Roosevelt ’s speech writers had in 1933 .
But Kennedy ’s language was far more self - conscious than even Roosevelt ’s had been .
For I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our forebears prescribed nearly a century and three - quarters ago .
This oath has always been exclusively secular .
Its legal foundation is the United States Constitution .
The Senators and Representatives before mentioned , and the Members of the several State Legislatures , and all the executive and judicial Officers , both of the United States and of the several States , shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation , to support this Constitution ; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States ( Article VI , Section 3 ) .
From the day that George Washington put his hand on a Bible supplied by the Freemasons of New York City — the very same Bible used by Harding , Eisenhower , Carter , and George H. W. Bush at their inaugurations — a national deception has gone on every four years .
At the inauguration of a new President , the imagery of biblical covenantalism is invoked for the sake of easily deceived voters .
A man puts one hand on a Bible , which is not required by the Constitution , raises his other hand toward the heavens , from where no alleged Dweller is allowed to impose a political test oath to Himself , and swears allegiance to the Constitution .
That event is the last time that he pays any attention to the Constitution unless he is re-elected four years later .
Kennedy then celebrated the sovereignty of man .
This was the continuing theme in his address .
He began with an assertion of the existence of a technological new world order — one very different from 1789 .
The world is very different now .
For man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life .
And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe — the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state , but from the hand of God .
So , his speech began with two mutually conflicting affirmations : the sovereignty of mankind and the sovereignty of God .
He affirmed that supreme earthly power is lodged in the hands of mankind .
Every covenant invokes sanctions , both positive and negative .
Man has the power of eliminating poverty or destroying himself as a species .
However , the rights of man — legal immunities from the state — come from God .
This was powerful rhetoric .
It rested on theological schizophrenia .
It is the supreme schizophrenia in American political history since 1788 .
Every covenant has a system of inheritance .
Kennedy ’s next words invoked inheritance .
We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution .
Let the word go forth from this time and place , to friend and foe alike , that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans — born in this century , tempered by war , disciplined by a hard and bitter peace , proud of our ancient heritage , and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed , and to which we are committed today at home and around the world .
This is Woodrow Wilson ’s covenant .
It is all - encompassing .
Let every nation know , whether it wishes us well or ill , that we shall pay any price , bear any burden , meet any hardship , support any friend , oppose any foe , to assure the survival and the success of liberty .
This much we pledge — and more .
More ?
How much more ?
A lot more .
As much as Congress , the President , and the Federal Reserve System can fund by extracting wealth from the American electorate .
He referred obliquely to the entangling alliances that had been created under Truman , beginning in 1949 with NATO .
American textbooks never mention this inconvenient fact : after the Treaty with France of 1778 lapsed with the replacement of the Articles of Confederation by the Constitution in 1788 , the United States did not enter into a military defensive treaty until NATO .
To those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share , we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends .
United there is little we cannot do in a host of cooperative ventures .
Divided there is little we can do — for we dare not meet a powerful challenge at odds and split asunder .
Then he announced his commitment to a system of international relations that officially renounces colonialism .
It is a system that today involves at least 737 American military bases inside foreign nations .
To those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free , we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny .
We shall not always expect to find them supporting our view .
But we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own freedom — and to remember that , in the past , those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside .
The media today delight in roasting George W. Bush ’s less felicitous verbal commitment to this same vision .
But Bush has what Kennedy lacked after the Bay of Pigs fiasco of 1961 was followed by the October Crisis in 1962 over the use of weapons of mass destruction : a willingness to back up his rhetoric , however garbled , with concentrated military force .
Bush has said nothing in defense of his foreign policy that Kennedy did not say in defense of his .
He has acted decisively to enforce Wilson ’s covenant .
Kennedy called the nation to make this same commitment .
To those people in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery , we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves , for whatever period is required — not because the Communists may be doing it , not because we seek their votes , but because it is right .
If a free society cannot help the many who are poor , it cannot save the few who are rich .
He then affirmed his commitment to the United Nations Organization .
To that world assembly of sovereign states , the United Nations , our last best hope in an age where the instruments of war have far outpaced the instruments of peace , we renew our pledge of support — to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for invective , to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak , and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run .
That a brand - new President could publicly affirm with a straight face his faith in that toothless institution of tax - free lifetime employment indicates just how universal the Wilsonian covenant was inside the Beltway in 1961 .
In contrast to Eisenhower ’s call for disarmament , Kennedy called for an escalation of the arms race .
Finally , to those nations who would make themselves our adversary , we offer not a pledge but a request : that both sides begin anew the quest for peace , before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self - destruction .
We dare not tempt them with weakness .
For only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed .
But then he offered an olive branch of peace .
He did so with a rhetorical flourish that reminds me of Rev. Jesse Jackson .
So let us begin anew — remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness , and sincerity is always subject to proof .
Let us never negotiate out of fear , but let us never fear to negotiate .
He called for a specific form of disarmament : the disarmament of nations .
But in order to accomplish this , the covenant ’s authority to impose sanctions had to be transferred .
To what ?
To a new world government .
Let both sides , for the first time , formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and control of arms , and bring the absolute power to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all nations .
This was Woodrow Wilson ’s covenant .
And , like former Ruling Elder Wilson , Kennedy invoked the language of the prophets .
Let both sides unite to heed , in all corners of the earth , the command of Isaiah — to “ undo the heavy burdens , and [ to ] let the oppressed go free . ”
Every new covenant requires a new legal system .
As the New Testament says , “ For the priesthood being changed , there is made of necessity a change also of the law ” ( Hebrews 7:12 ) .
Kennedy proposed a change in the law , as befits a new priesthood .
And , if a beachhead of cooperation may push back the jungle of suspicion , let both sides join in creating a new endeavor — not a new balance of power , but a new world of law — where the strong are just , and the weak secure , and the peace preserved .
Once again , he invoked the language of covenant renewal .
In your hands , my fellow citizens , more than mine , will rest the final success or failure of our course .
Since this country was founded , each generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national loyalty .
The graves of young Americans who answered the call to service surround the globe .
Now the trumpet summons us again — not as a call to bear arms , though arms we need — not as a call to battle , though embattled we are — but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle , year in and year out , “ rejoicing in hope ; patient in tribulation , ” a struggle against the common enemies of man : tyranny , poverty , disease , and war itself .
This was a new national covenant .
It broke with the old one of 1788 as surely as the new covenant of 1788 had broken with the old covenant of 1781 .
Can we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance , North and South , East and West , that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind ?
Will you join in that historic effort ?
The liberal media today ridicule George W. Bush , which they did not do from September 12 , 2001 through late 2003 .
But President Bush is merely the latest bearer of the torch which Kennedy said must be passed down through the ages .
In the long history of the world , only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger .
I do not shrink from this responsibility — I welcome it .
I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation .
The energy , the faith , the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it .
And the glow from that fire can truly light the world .
This is truly fire in the minds of men .
This brings us to the capper .
And so , my fellow Americans , ask not what your country can do for you ; ask what you can do for your country .
My fellow citizens of the world , ask not what America will do for you , but what together we can do for the freedom of man .
Finally , whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world , ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you .
With a good conscience our only sure reward , with history the final judge of our deeds , let us go forth to lead the land we love , asking His blessing and His help , but knowing that here on earth God ’s work must truly be our own .
CONCLUSION
Americans live today under a new covenant .
While there is constant jostling for access into the priesthood within the tribe of political Levites , this covenant guides the policy - makers who establish the terms of public discourse .
There are insiders and outsiders .
There are backbenchers , to use an analogy from the House of Commons .
There are ranking committee members of Congress and committee chairmen .
But there is a single national civil covenant .
There are two great teams .
I do not mean the Republican Party and the Democratic Party .
I mean Council on Foreign Relations Team A and Council on Foreign Relations Team B .
On both teams , there are varsity players — neoconservatives — who are trying mightily to keep from being consigned once again to the junior varsity .
But all of the players have invoked an oath of allegiance — not to the Constitution of the United States but to Woodrow Wilson ’s covenant .
Afghanistan in 1984 was not Charlie Wilson ’s war .
It was Woodrow Wilson ’s war .
It has been one long war since 1917 .
We need a better covenant .
“ Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them ; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them : and I will place them , and multiply them , and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore ” ( Ezekiel 37:26 ) .
Until that day , my fellow Americans , ask not what your country can do for you .
Ask instead what your country has been doing to you and is likely to keep doing to you for as long as it can buy with fiat money the votes of a majority .

About 12 people have died in a suspected missile strike on a house in north - west Pakistan , residents and security sources say .
Local sources told the BBC two missiles were fired by a suspected US drone aircraft at Islamic militants inside the home near the village of Damadola .
The strike was in the Bajaur tribal area close to Afghanistan .
Unmanned American drones have targeted a number of suspected al - Qaeda and Taleban targets in the area this year .
A US Predator drone apparently targeted al - Qaeda deputy leader Ayman al - Zawahiri in Damadola in January 2006 , but missed him .
The BBC's Barbara Plett in Islamabad was told by local sources that about 30 people had gathered for a formal dinner near the same village , targeted on Wednesday .
The sources told our correspondent that unmanned US aircraft had been patrolling the skies since early morning .
Neither Pakistan nor the US confirm American air strikes , which are condemned in the country as a violation of Pakistani sovereignty .
Our correspondent says since the beginning of the year there has been an increase in US missile attacks in the tribal areas , apparently as part of a US agreement with Pakistan 's President Pervez Musharraf .
But the country 's newly elected government has asked the US to stop striking within its territory to aid its policy of negotiating with pro-Taleban militants , she says .
Can you imagine losing your home over a $ 68 dental bill ?
That 's what happened to one Utah woman .
Sonya Capri Ramos ( center ) and her four children .
( Courtesy of Sonya Capri Ramos )
Sonya Capri Ramos says her Salt Lake City home was sold out from under her in 1996 to pay a collections agency seeking payment for dental work performed on one of Ramos 's daughters .
And despite the fact that she had made three years of payments on a $ 51,000 mortgage , the title changed hands for just $ 1,550 at a sheriff 's auction .
But the story does n't end there : Ramos , 41 , said she did n't find out that her home no longer belonged to her until two years after the sale .
To date , she has n't moved out .
Instead , she said she continues to make mortgage payments on the home and is fighting what has become a decade - long legal battle to reclaim ownership .

Learning , Arts , and the Brain , a study three years in the making , is the result of research by cognitive neuroscientists from seven leading universities across the United States .
In the Dana Consortium study , researchers grappled with a fundamental question :
Are smart people drawn to the arts or does arts training make people smarter ?
For the first time , coordinated , multi-university scientific research brings us closer to answering that question .
Learning , Arts , and the Brain advances our understanding of the effects of music , dance , and drama education on other types of learning .
Children motivated in the arts develop attention skills and strategies for memory retrieval that also apply to other subject areas .
The research was led by Dr. Michael S. Gazzaniga of the University of California at Santa Barbara .
“ A life - affirming dimension is opening up in neuroscience , ” said Dr. Gazzaniga , “ to discover how the performance and appreciation of the arts enlarge cognitive capacities will be a long step forward in learning how better to learn and more enjoyably and productively to live .
The consortium ’s new findings and conceptual advances have clarified what now needs to be done . ”
Participating researchers , using brain imaging studies and behavioral assessment , identified eight key points relevant to the interests of parents , students , educators , neuroscientists , and policy makers .
An interest in a performing art leads to a high state of motivation that produces the sustained attention necessary to improve performance and the training of attention that leads to improvement in other domains of cognition .
Genetic studies have begun to yield candidate genes that may help explain individual differences in interest in the arts .
Specific links exist between high levels of music training and the ability to manipulate information in both working and long - term memory ; these links extend beyond the domain of music training .
In children , there appear to be specific links between the practice of music and skills in geometrical representation , though not in other forms of numerical representation .
Correlations exist between music training and both reading acquisition and sequence learning .
One of the central predictors of early literacy , phonological awareness , is correlated with both music training and the development of a specific brain pathway .
Training in acting appears to lead to memory improvement through the learning of general skills for manipulating semantic information .
Adult self - reported interest in aesthetics is related to a temperamental factor of openness , which in turn is influenced by dopamine - related genes .
Learning to dance by effective observation is closely related to learning by physical practice , both in the level of achievement and also the neural substrates that support the organization of complex actions .
Effective observational learning may transfer to other cognitive skills .
Much of this research is of a preliminary nature , yielding several tight correlations but not definitive causal relationships .
Although “ there is still a lot of work to be done , ” says Dr. Gazzaniga , the consortium ’s research so far has clarified the way forward .
“ We now have further reasons to believe that training in the arts has positive benefits for more general cognitive mechanisms . ”

Any hope of resuscitating our Constitutional Republic , and keeping our nation from descending into the tar pit of One World Fascist government , exists in an informed population throwing off apathy , turning OFF corporate media , paying attention to what is really happening , and making sacrifices only by which the psychopaths now in power may be exposed for their crimes and brought to justice .
They do n’t have our guns , yet , but with martial law just one more false flag terror contrivance away ( all “ legalities ” are in place , along with the 800 +
Rex 84 “ camps ” WE paid for ) , they think they have already won .
Surely , the odds are in their favor , and they ’re getting cocky — giving us our last , best window of hope — if enough Americans can still think for themselves .
Clarification of the feds ’ plans fill neo-con Phillip Bobbitt ’s new book , Terror and Consent .
For a rebuttal of a fawning review of Bobbitt ’s New World Order screed , please see this excellent article by Paul Joseph Watson :
http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/
april2008/041608_shredding_constitution.htm
Neo-con cockiness is a fetid odor permeating Bobbitt ’s pages .
He foresees wars ( started by “ us ” , of course ) “ plaguing ” the 21st Century , and posits that the only way to successfully fight them is by replacing sovereign nation states with a new order built around multinational corporations , one with totally unfettered powers of aggression toward any holders of valuable resources .
Much like what we ’ve seen in Iraq , but with no moral or legal issues impacting profits .
Visual neo-con glories of Bobbitt ’s book include the line : “ Everything must go ” above an image of a shredded U.S. Constitution .
Also , filling in for a torn - out piece of The Bill of Rights , the words : “ How to Fight Terrorism ” .
It ’s all the same nefarious neo -con slobber about scuttling the United States in favor of a One World Fascist Government to better fight terror … .
A main reason the neo-cons are so cocky : A nation of sheep begets a government of wolves , and our “ democracy ” has effectively been reduced to two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for dinner .
Certainly , it started out as a noble experiment : “ … a nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal . ”
So how did the United States become so dosed with systemic biocide that those words , along with the “ Pledge of Allegiance ” , are simply very , very bad jokes ?
Terrorism .
Exactly what is terrorism ?
By definition , terrorism is “ the systematic use of terror , especially as a means of coercion ” .
Terror is simply a state of intense fear .
Fear is the biocide helping turn a nation conceived in liberty , to one decommissioned by terrorism .
How is this happening ?
Step by step .
Systematically , one official lie after another , always .
A fresh example of the sheer scope of deceit comes from that terrorist organization , Fox “ News ” .
Consider their slogan , “ We report , you hide . ”
This little coercion is simply subliminal mind control — the image of John McCain and his wife Cindy flashing almost imperceptibly in a “ news ” report logo .
Please watch , “ Who ’s That Hiding In My Fox 5 Logo ? ”
http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/
may2008/120508_b_Hiding.htm
Subliminal mind control …is that reporting ?
Yes , to Fox “ News ” ; this is the kind of trustworthiness characteristic in everything Fox reports .
When not numbing and dumbing people senseless with trivial garbage , celebrities and sports , or frothing the tube with “ pundits ” in bigot gravy , they augment their fare of fear and lies with tricks like this .
And what a candidate they ’ve chosen !
McCain recently stated that one of the TOP things his administration would achieve by the end of his first term is the killing or capture of Osama bin Laden .
Wait a minute !
Even
Fox reported the death of bin Laden , shortly after he died in 2001 .
Does n’t anybody remember ?
http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,41576,00.html
For information on the death of a man hiding in remote mountains while needing frequent dialysis to survive , and a list of others that reported the news , such as CNN , please see the article : “ Osama Bin Dead ” .
http://www.starchiefpress.com/articles/article15.html
Recently ( 5 -16-08 ) , the Associated Press announced : “ Bin Laden plans new message ” .
Yes , the man everyone in any way connected with intelligence around the world knows has been dead almost seven years , is on the verge of releasing “ … a new Internet message dealing with Israel and the Palestinians . ”
Realistically , the biggest problem here is not that domestic terrorist organizations like Fox , the Associated Press and the rest of corporate media keep shoveling these kinds of howlers to Americans , nor is it that they think Americans are ignorant and stupid enough to believe such howlers … the biggest problem is that enough Americans actually DO believe at least enough of the bullshit to doom us all .
Back to Fox …how could a “ news ” organization be considered a terrorist organization ?
All they do is report , so you can hide , right ?
Well , fundamentally , they are simply a propaganda tentacle of the world ’s preeminent terrorist organization , the United States Federal Government ( CorpoGov ) .
If not for the fed , terrorism would hardly be an issue .
But a government that rules by fear is terrorist by definition .
When terrorism is your government ’s greatest creation and best friend , well , just look around —
ATTENTION !: Current Terror Alert Status issued by the Department of Homeland Security ….

FOR THE U.S. : ELEVATED
FOR U.S. AIRCRAFT : HIGH
Basically , BE AFRAID !
Basically , this is terrorism .
Unlike a horrendous number of Americans seem unwilling to do , please consider what we have done to Iraq .
Cindy McCain , wife of Presidential candidate John McCain , is a wealthy heiress who vows to “ never ! ” release her tax returns — even if she becomes First Lady …could vast profits from war corporation investments be a factor ?
Cindy insists that America ’s reasons for “ war ” in Iraq ( killing over 1 million Iraqis so far , creating over 4 million Iraqi refugees , permanently poisoning their land and water with hundreds of tons of depleted uranium munitions — many other officially omitted horrors ) , and threatening to occupy them for another hundred years if they do n’t surrender control of their oil , as her husband touts ( all but the oil part ) … the reason is : “ Honor , and bringing freedom to the Iraqis ” .
Orwellian enough ?
Hideous enough ?
Cindy , coy financier of death — do n’t you remember , the evening of 9/11 , Wolf Blitzer ’s immortal deception : “ We have been attacked by Iraq ! ” ?
Such are the kinds of things Americans do and do n’t get from mainstream “ news ” .
Such are the kinds of things keeping people who get “ their news ” from CorpoGov propaganda tentacles as misinformed , ignorant , terrorized and endangered as any people in history .
UPDATE !
John McCain has just flopped away from the 100 - year occupation of Iraq , to a pullout of “ combat ” troops by the end of his first term !
So , arbitrarily and in all good senility , he just cut 95 years from our achievement of honor , and delivering freedom to any Iraqis we have n’t murdered by then … .
Does anybody really believe there is even a shadow of truth to anything John McCain says ?
Like all CorpoGov candidates who have passed AIPAC ( American Israeli “ Public Affairs ” Committee ) screening , McCain simply says whatever it takes to get votes ( remember Hillary Clinton ’s recent bluster about vaporizing Iran if they are n’t nice to Israel ? )
Back to shining examples of mainstream truth : “ We are in Iraq for honor , and to bring freedom to the Iraqi people ” … as long as enough Americans believe such fantastically obvious lies , believe even small wettings of the daily tsunami of propaganda from corporate media , believe federal elections are not rigged , America is doomed .
As long as people disregard evidence in favor of what they want to believe , and are told by career liars … that smell of rotting flesh wafting from just around the corner ?

Who ever said you have to go to an amusement park to enjoy a roller - coaster ride ?
Jeremy Reid decided to put all his effort into creating a fully - working roller - coaster ride in his very own backyard .
It only cost him 9.500 pounds of lumber , a lot of time and $ 5.500 , a very small price considering he created a ride with a maximum drop of 20 feet and a “ lightning speed ” of 20 mph .
That wood seems a little rotten to me , so I would n’t have the guts to take a ride on these guy ’s roller - coaster , but still it ’s pretty decent work .
In the last couple months , we 've brought you 14 new Street View cities .
Now we 're touching up Manhattan , one of the first locations we launched .
The new imagery is more recent ; for example , we now have the appropriately - named New Museum in the Bowery in its near - complete state :
We also have sharper images -- check out Times Square :

or the arch in Washington Square Park :

And in our new images you can look upward , so now you can fully appreciate Manhattan 's many skyscrapers :

We 're also taking this opportunity to test our new face - blurring technology on the busy streets of Manhattan .
This effort has been a year in the making -- working at Street View - scale is a tough challenge that required us to advance state - of - the - art automatic face detection , and we continue working hard to improve it as we roll it out for our existing and future imagery .
Here are just a couple examples from the bustling streets of Manhattan :
Two remarkable events happened during this presidential cycle that went underreported by big media but produced huge splashes on the internet .
The first was the song sung by John McCain answering a question about the Middle East .
The other was the whisper , probably coming from a hidden wire worn by Romney during a debate .
Yesterday , the Song " Bomb bomb bomb , bomb bomb Iran " was officially endorsed by the Whisper " He raised taxes , I am not gonna . "
" This is a man capable of leading our country at a dangerous hour , " said Mitt the Whisper about John the Song .
" Senator McCain understands the war we are in , the necessity of victory , and the consequences of surrender . "
I am not going to argue that we are not in a war , but in an occupation ; not in a military but in a police action ; that we have already killed so many people , destroyed so many buildings , and killed or otherwise replaced so many government officials of Iraq that it would satisfy the definition of victory for any of the bloodthirsty tyrants from across the entire world military history .
These are not my points .
At the last debate , Ron Paul actually told Romney and McCain that there is no difference between them , and that they have no money to continue the war anyway .
Money ?
During the debates , Ron Paul was essentially making the argument that the income tax brings in about one trillion dollars , which is about the amount we waste in maintaining our empire not only in Iraq , but also in Korea , Japan , and dozens of other countries , so by pulling out we could easily abolish the income tax .
The Republican candidates still talk about smaller government and smaller taxes .
Their stance is similar to the Democrats ' stance on the war : they talk about stopping it , somehow , but they do nothing .
The Democrats ' stance on the income tax is also similar to the Republicans ' stance on the occupation : increase it .
Ron Paul and Mike Huckabee talked about actually abolishing the IRS .
Paul has his record to back it up , though Huckabee does not , but at least he talks about it .
The rest of the Republican Party just uses slogans to hypnotize the masses : " smaller government , less taxes " like the mantra " four legs good , two legs bad " from Animal Farm .
I doubt that anybody seriously believes that any remaining presidential candidate will do anything to abolish income tax or to even reduce taxes .
The term " tax cut " itself has even been accepted in our society to mean a government action which results in some people getting their taxes reduced .
Hello Maymin 's lemma :
After any zero - sum redistribution , some people will end up with more money than they had at the beginning .
In other words , the redistribution , the opposite of the tax cut , is nowadays called a tax cut .
I know , I know , nobody thinks that the income tax is that bad .
Fifty percent of wage earners do n't pay any income tax .
And the rest of the voters who are not wage earners do n't pay income tax by definition , so income tax payers are an insignificant minority .
The greedy , the wealthy .
Who cares about them or about the income tax ?
I wrote a novel exploring how much the government can tax before the people object .
You can read the book free online here .
You think I am overreacting ?
Just remember : when whispers join songs , they are soon followed by war marches , patriotic chants , and funeral hymns .
Gordon Brown has suffered a devastating collapse in his public standing , according to a new survey published in The Observer today which will put his leadership under intensified pressure .
As the Prime Minister begins his fightback with new proposals entitling mothers to more flexible working hours , the research shows that only one in five voters thinks he is doing a good job .
He is rated worse than David Cameron on every key leadership quality , including competence , decisiveness , fairness , likeability , trustworthiness and strength .
A unique opinion tracker using a panel of 5,000 voters , much larger than conventional opinion polls , reveals that he is floundering in his attempt to campaign for public respect after Labour 's large losses in the council elections .
Three - quarters think he is doing a bad job , and nearly half of them believe he is doing a very bad job , according to the first results from the survey , which was published on the website PoliticsHome.com .
In what is expected to be one of his toughest weeks yet , Brown is expected to show his support for the rights of millions more mothers to request flexible working hours as Labour attempts to pick itself up after its disastrous showing in the local elections .
A government review by Sainsbury 's human resources director Imelda Walsh will recommend that millions of working mothers should gain the right to demand flexible hours .
At present only mothers of children up to the age of six , those caring for elderly relatives or those whose child has a disability are entitled to make such a request .
Walsh will suggest that the current age limit should be at least doubled to include children up to 12 , giving new rights to a least 2.6 million parents .
Her recommendations are expected to be ' warmly ' received by Downing Street .
Later this week the Prime Minister is expected to announce a draft legislative programme for the next parliamentary session , foreshadowing the Queen 's Speech in the autumn .
But the scale of the downturn in his personal reputation with voters will further swell mounting anxiety among Labour MPs and ministers , especially those defending marginal seats .
It is bound to amplify concerns that Brown lacks the presentational skills and leadership qualities to turn round the government 's fortunes .
There is speculation about a challenge to his leadership as Labour backbenchers reel from the impact of their party 's massacre in the local elections and the fear of losing the Crewe and Nantwich by - election to a resurgent Tory party on 22 May .
Based on internet responses from a 5,000 - strong panel taken over the past five days , the survey shows that Brown 's overall satisfaction rating has crashed to minus 55 per cent .
Fewer than a quarter of voters now think he is the best person to be in Number 10 .
And 43 per cent choose Cameron as best Prime Minister against just 23 per cent for Brown .
The panel was also asked to say what sort of government they would prefer if forced to choose between a Brown - led government and a Cameron one .
This is often a better predictor than party shares of the outcome of general elections .
A Tory government is preferred to a Labour one by a margin of 50 to 32 per cent .
There are more voters who think the Conservatives would do a better job of governing than there are voters who think they would do a worse job .
In every key leadership category , Brown is now seen less favourably than his rival .
Cameron is seen as more caring , competent , decisive , effective , fair , forward - looking , in touch with normal people , intelligent , likeable and moderate .
He is also rated as stronger , more reliable and more trustworthy .
More damage was done to Brown 's leadership last night as John Prescott revealed in his memoirs that he had urged Tony Blair to sack his Chancellor , but that Blair was ' scared ' of him .
The former Deputy Prime Minister described Brown as ' annoying , bewildering and prickly ' .
Brown is also fighting demands for Scottish independence , and last night said : ' I will do whatever is necessary to ensure the stability and maintenance of the Union . '
The Prime Minister called for pro-Union parties , together with business and trade unions , to form an alliance to prevent the breakup of the UK .
There ’s been a lot of great discussions about email productivity going around on sites I enjoy , so I thought I ’d throw in five no -brainers that I ’ve seen help a lot of folks .
Shut off auto - check - Either turn off automatic checking completely , or set it to something reasonable , like every 20 minutes or so .
If you ’re doing anything with new email more than every few minutes , you might want to rethink your approach .
I ’m sure that some of you working in North Korean missile silos need real - time email updates , but I encourage the rest of you to consider ganging your email activity into focused ( maybe even timed ) activity every hour or three .
Process , tag , respond to the urgent ones , then get the hell back to work .
( See also , NYT : You There , at the Computer : Pay Attention )
Pick off easy ones -
If you can retire an email with a 1 - 2 line response (< 2 minutes ; pref. 30 seconds ) , do it now .
Remember : this is about action , not about cogitating and filing .
Get it off your plate , and get back to work .
On the other hand , do n’t permit yourself to get caught up in composing an unnecessary 45 - minute epistle ( see next item ) .
Write less -
Stop imagining that all your emails need to be epic literature ; get better at just keeping the conversation moving by responding quickly and with short actions in the reply .
Ask for more information , pose a question , or just say “ I do n’t know . ”
Stop trying to be Victor Hugo Marcel Proust , and just smack it over the net — especially if fear of writing a long reply is what slows your response time .
N.B. : This does not mean that you should write elliptically or bypass standard grammar , capitalization , and punctuation ( unless you want to look 12 years old ) ; just that your well - written message can and should be as concise as possible .
That saves everyone time .
Cheat -
Use something like MailTemplate to help manage answers to frequent email subjects .
Templates let you create and use boilerplate responses to the questions and requests to which you usually find yourself drafting identical replies over and over from scratch .
At least use a template as a basis for your response , and then customize it for that person or situation .
Do n’t worry — you can still let your sparkling prose and winning wit shine through , just without having to invent the wheel 10 times each day .
Be honest -
If you know in your heart that you ’re never going to respond to an email , get it out of sight , archive it , or just delete it .
Guilt will not make you more responsive two months from now , otherwise , you ’d just do it now , right ?
Trust your instincts , listen to them , and stop trying to be perfect .
Update 2005-10-18 07:33:45
Yep , you read it right : in the eightish months since I posted this , I 've set my email to check every hour .
The result ?
I ai n't missing much .
A lot of stuff that can wait , a lot that resolves itself , and a huge mass of items that previously would have sent me on a 50 - yard - dash to nothing .
Friends : stop letting your email poke you with a stick .
It 's just not worth it .

Once upon a time there were three ducks .
Their names were Jean - Claude , Antoine and Bernadette .
They were a happy threesome just trying to have a good time on the Spiderman Slip - n - Slide .
That was ... until Carlos and Maria decided that they were missing out on good times and waddled on over , trying to make the ménage à trois , a ménage à cinq .
Carlos said , " Holaaaa Bernadette ... you lookin ' fuego . "
Maria said , " I 'm outta here . "
Jean Claude said , " Quack . "
Bernadette said , " You people ..uh.. ducks are stupid .
I 'm going back to see Spidey . "
Antoine said , " Mange d'la marde . "
Then Antoine got all up in Carlos ' face and proceeded to commit homosexual duck rape , first brought to our attention by the Smiling Infidel .
Only she left out the homosexual part and I had to sort of discover that for myself .
Yeah - I 'm awake now too .
On the furrier side of our petting zoo , I 've decided to show you a pic of my visiting raccoon who likes to come late at night while I'm on the computer and fiddle with the doorknob .
Do you know what a raccoon fiddling with a doorknob sounds like ?
Yeah ... a rapist duck .
But we 're best buds now that I 've stopped freaking out everytime the knob rattles .
I do give him treats and y'all can spare me the rabies lecture since Babycakes already gave it to me .
See - he 's even sticking his tongue out at you !

5 Years after George W. Bush ’s infamous speech aboard the USS Lincoln , the mission seems incomplete .
Bush imagined that he could get rid of Saddam Hussein and install exiled businessman and bank fraudster Ahmad Chalabi in his place .
Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz told Congress that the US would be out of Iraq , except for a division ( 20,000 men or so ) , by October of 2003 .
Wolfowitz and other Bush officials depicted Iraqis as secular and downplayed the possibility of ethnic violence in the aftermath of the overthrow of the Baath Party .
Here are some memorable phrases from Bush ’s mendacious speech half a decade ago :
‘ . . . major combat operations in Iraq have ended .
In the battle of Iraq , the United States and our allies have prevailed . . .
And now our coalition is engaged in securing and reconstructing that country .
. .
In this battle , we have fought for the cause of liberty and for the peace of the world .
. .
Because of you our nation is more secure .
. .
[ Note that he is trying to attribute to the poor enlisted men his policies . ] . . .
In the images of fallen statues we have witnessed the arrival of a new era . . .
[ The statue was pulled down by the US military and the whole thing was staged before a tiny Iraqi crowd , the small size of which media close - ups disguised . ] . . .
In defeating Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan , Allied forces destroyed entire cities , while enemy leaders who started the conflict were safe until the final days .
Military power was used to end a regime by breaking a nation .
Today we have the greater power to free a nation by breaking a dangerous and aggressive regime .
With new tactics and precision weapons , we can achieve military objectives without directing violence against civilians .
. .
[ The US has probably directly killed about 200,000 Iraqis and destroyed the city of Fallujah as well as damaging and repeatedly bombing others .
Bush ’s fascist attempt to reconfigure warfare as a humanitarian gesture is the biggest lie of all ] . . .
Men and women in every culture need liberty like they need food and water and air .
[ Foreign military occupation is not generally considered ‘ liberty ’ by most people . ] . . .
We ’ve begun the search for hidden chemical and biological weapons , and already know of hundreds of sites that will be investigated .
[ The sites were being investigated before the war , and nothing was being found , so Bush pulled out the inspectors and went to war .
Nothing ever was found . ] . . .
Our coalition will stay until our work is done and then we will leave and we will leave behind a free Iraq .
[ When will that be exactly ? ] . . .
In the battle of Afghanistan , we destroyed the Taliban . . . [
Maybe not so much ; this ‘ mission accomplished ’ passage has not been sufficiently criticized ] . . .
The liberation of Iraq is a crucial advance in the campaign against terror .
We have removed an ally of Al Qaida and cut off a source of terrorist funding .
[ There was no operational connection between Iraq and al - Qaeda .
None .
And the US occupation of Iraq gave al - Qaeda a new lease on life ] . . .
We are committed to freedom in Afghanistan , Iraq and in a peaceful Palestine . . . [ 90 % of the world fell down laughing at that point in the speech ; only gullible , self - righteous Americans could even think about taking this snow job seriously ] . . .

Hulu – Watch TV Shows For Free ( Review )
Skatter
Tech recently got access to Hulu , a new service launched by News Corporation and NBC Universal , which offers streaming access to high quality TV Shows and short videos .
When we say TV Shows , we do n’t mean random content , we mean real actual prime time shows that you would watch on TV such as The Office , Heroes , The Simpsons , House , Chuck , Prison Break , and 24 .
Even talk shows and comedy sketches including Saturday Night Live ( SNL ) , Late Night with Conan O’Brien , and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno are available through Hulu .
The premium content will be distributed by streaming the video directly to your browser using flash player , so no additional plugins or software is needed .
The player is quite advance and allows pausing , forwarding / rewinding , controlling volume , and even watching in full screen .
And even when I played an episode of Scrubs in full screen , although the frame rate was a bit low , it was still much better than any other service I have seen to date .
Viewers will have the ability to email the show to friends or embed them onto their own blogs and web pages .
So how much does this all cost ?
Absolutely nothing !
Unfortunately the service is in beta and access is limited to testers , but should be opened to the public soon .
We ’ve included a embedded a full video of the latest episode of Heroes for your entertainment .
In general , new shows will become available on Hulu once it has been broadcasted on television throughout the United States .
( So , after it airs in Hawaii . )
TV shows are automatically purged after approximately five weeks or five new episodes of that series has been added to collection .
The content will obviously not be available for an infinite amount of time since studios will obviously loose revenue from DVD sales .
Despite this , you now have free , legal , and high quality access to all your favorite TV shows .
This is probably one of the smartest moves production studios have made in a while .
Instead of wasting time suing those who distribute or download copyrighted content illegally through P2P Networks or BitTorrent , they have decided to offer the shows themselves .
The studios finally realized that if people are always going to find a way to get their content without paying for it , why not at least give it to them in high quality for free .
News Corp. and NBC has done by launching Hulu .
With this new service , studios are hoping to deter people from downloading their content illegally .
The studios will also retain profits since advertisements are embedded into their content .
So yes , you ’ll have to watch ads .
Fortunately they were n’t too bad , there were usually three to four 15 - second ads for an hour - long show .
Either way , this is a “ win win ” situation for both consumers and studios , since we get to watch shows for free and that they keep their content locked up in a secure player with ads to retain revenue .
As of now , TV Shows will come from 15 different studios including FOX , NBC , Bravo , E ! Entertainment , FX , SiFi Network , and USA Networks .
( See the PDF for a full list of shows and networks . )
Hopefully more networks will join this venture soon .

P.S. I sadly do n’t have any invites to give away , but go ahead and try signing up anyways .
You might get lucky !
And as promised , here ’s the entire latest episode of Heroes – “ Cautionary Tales ” ( S02E09 ) :
New data on Comcast 's interference with BitTorrent traffic shows that the company misinformed the FCC this February .
Comcast has always argued that BitTorrent upstream traffic was only blocked during periods of heavy network traffic , this turns out to be a lie .
BitTorrent throttling is not a new phenomenon , but it is getting more attention lately , because the number of people who use BitTorrent keeps growing .
Up until today however , there has been no reliable data that revealed the scope of it .
Last week we reported on a new and reliable tool that tests whether or not your BitTorrent traffic is being limited .
The tool is developed by the Max Planck Institute , who have released new data today .
The findings reveal that the BitTorrent connections of half of Comcast and Cox ’s customers are being cut .
In addition , the data shows that these practices take place 24/7 , disproving Comcast ’s earlier statement to the FCC
“ Comcast ’s network management practices ( 1 ) only affect the protocols that have a demonstrated history of generating excessive burdens on the network ; ( 2 ) only manage those protocols during periods of heavy network traffic , ” Comcast wrote in a filing to the FCC last February .
This is far from the truth .
As can be seen for the graph below , there is little difference in the percentage of blocked customers throughout day .
Furthermore , the data shows that there is also no difference between weekends and weekdays .
BitTorrent is simply blocked all day long , no matter how busy their network is .
The Max Planck Institute tested the connections of 788 Comcast customers , 494 ( 62 % ) experienced a slowdown of BitTorrent traffic .
Comcast is not alone though , well over 50 % of the Cox subscribers that participated in the study were also throttled .
The good news is , other ISPs do n’t seem to restrict BitTorrent traffic on a wide scale .
Ben Scott , policy director of Free Press , said in a response : “ Consumers have no reason left to trust their cable company .
This independent study confirms that Comcast is still blocking its customers from using popular applications — despite the FCC ’s investigation and widespread public outrage .
And worse , the harmful practice appears to be spreading through the marketplace . ”
After being pressured by the press and thousands of upset customers , Comcast has announced that it will stop targeting BitTorrent transfers , ( somewhere in the future ) and promised to invest in its network capacity .
For the time being the company will continue to throttle BitTorrent users .
We have asked the FCC for a response , but they had not yet responded at time of going to press
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Iraqi troops backed by U.S. forces battled gunmen in Baghdad ’s Sadr City on Sunday , a return to heavy fighting in the capital after Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr pulled his militiamen off the streets a week ago .
Hospital sources said at least 25 Iraqis were killed in the clashes and 98 wounded .
Rocket or mortar attacks killed three U.S. soldiers and wounded 31 of them in Baghdad , among the biggest tolls of injured troops faced by the Americans in months .
That included two U.S. soldiers killed and 17 wounded in a strike on the fortified Green Zone government and diplomatic compound .
A fourth U.S. soldier was killed by a roadside bomb in Diyala province to the north and a fifth died in an attack in eastern Baghdad in which the military gave no further details .
The fighting follows a week of relative calm after a crackdown by Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki on Sadr followers led to battles across the capital and the south late last month .
Iraqi soldiers were moving through two southern sectors of Sadr City , a Shi’ite slum of 2 million people and stronghold of Sadr ’s Mehdi Army militia , said U.S. military spokesman Lieutenant - Colonel Steven Stover .
U.S. helicopters fired at least two Hellfire missiles , killing nine fighters , he added .
The unrest comes two days before U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker and U.S. commander General David Petraeus are due to deliver key testimony to the U.S. Congress on progress in Iraq .
Police said the joint U.S. - Iraqi military operation began early on Sunday .
Gunfire could be heard throughout the day .
Lieutenant - General Abboud Qanbar , head of the Iraqi military in Baghdad , said all armed groups must hand in their weapons .
“ If they refuse to surrender their arms , we will confiscate them , ” Qanbar told reporters at a police station in Sadr City .
Mehdi Army fighters bristled at the raids .
“ I have lost my cousin in these clashes today .
I think Maliki will be happy now , ” a Mehdi Army street commander giving his name as Abu Ammar told Reuters .
U.S. Apache helicopter gunships swooped overhead and a column of black smoke towered over the Jamila market , a vast bazaar on the edge of the slum that supplies wholesale food for much of the eastern half of the capital .
“ Criminals fired rockets and they hit the Jamila market .
I do n’t know how many people they killed , ” Stover said .
Police said a fire at the market destroyed 100 shops , blazing unchecked for hours because firefighters could not reach it .

BLOCKADE
U.S. and Iraqi forces have imposed a blockade on vehicle traffic in and out of Sadr City for two weeks .
Residents of the besieged district describe skyrocketing food prices , rubbish piling up and claustrophobia from being trapped indoors .
“ We have n’t been able to sleep since this fighting started two weeks ago , ” said Wardan Ali , a student from Sadr City who walked 10 km ( 6 miles ) to university because of the blockade .
Sadr ’s bloc in parliament denounced the raids .
“ The intervention of U.S forces is horrible and unjustified .
Some people in Sadr City believe these forces will hunt and kill them , ” said Hassan Hashem , a Sadrist member of parliament ’s security committee .
The fighting in Sadr City followed a joint call by Iraq ’s main factions , apart from the Sadrists , for all militias to hand over weapons , an apparent attempt to isolate Sadr .
Sadr has called for 1 million Iraqis to march against U.S. “ occupiers ” on Wednesday , when Crocker and Petraeus are due to conclude two days of testimony before the U.S. Congress .
The two top U.S. officials in Iraqi are expected to call for a pause in American troop withdrawals after 20,000 U.S. soldiers return home over the next four months .
Near the northern city of Mosul , at least 40 students on a bus were kidnapped by gunmen for several hours before Iraqi security forces freed them , said Brigadier - General Khalid Abdul - Sattar , security spokesman for Nineveh province .
The incident was a reminder of continuing unrest in Iraq ’s northern mixed and Sunni Arab areas at a time when attention is focused on violence in Shi’ite areas in Baghdad and the south .
“ These are terrorist groups linked to al Qaeda and Saddam ’s former regime who are terrorizing innocent people constantly , ” government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh told Al Arabiya television .
Sunni Islamist al Qaeda has regrouped in northern provinces after being pushed out of western Anbar province and Baghdad .
MOVEMENTS in financial markets are correlated to the levels of hormones in the bodies of male traders , according to a study by two researchers from the University of Cambridge ( newscientist.com ) .
John Coates , a research fellow in neuroscience and finance , and Joe Herbert , a professor of neuroscience , sampled the saliva of 17 traders on a stock trading floor in London two times a day for eight days .
They matched the men ’s levels of testosterone and cortisol with the amounts of money the men lost or won on the markets .
Men with elevated levels of testosterone , a hormone associated with aggression , made more money .
When the markets were more volatile , the men showed higher levels of cortisol , considered a “ stress hormone . ”
But , as New Scientist asked , “ which is the cause and which is the effect ? ”
According to the researchers ’ analysis , the men who began their workdays with high levels of testosterone did better than those who did not .
“ The popular view is that experienced traders can control their emotions , ” Mr. Coates told New Scientist .
“ But , in fact , their endocrine systems are on fire . ”
The information passed on related to Taiwan 's new air defence system A US defence department analyst has admitted giving classified information about military communication systems to a businessman working for China .
Gregg Bergersen , 51 , pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to disclose national defence information " to persons not entitled to receive it " .
Mr Bergersen faces up to 10 years in prison when he is sentenced on 20 June .
Correspondents say his admission comes amid growing concern in Washington about the activities of Chinese spies .
Four others were arrested in separate case last month for allegedly passing secret details about the space shuttle and other US aerospace programmes to China .
Air defence system Mr Bergersen , a weapons systems policy analyst at the US Defence Security Co-operation Agency ( DSCA ) , was arrested last month with joint Taiwanese - US national Tai Shen Kuo and Yu Xin Kang , a Chinese national living in the US .
The FBI said Mr Bergersen had received thousands of dollars for passing on classified information to Mr Kuo , a New Orleans - based furniture salesman who has also been accused of turning over that information to the Chinese government .
In hindsight , he understands that the money was given to him in anticipation that he would provide documents
Mark Cummings
Gregg Bergersen 's lawyer
The US government said that Mr Bergesen thought Mr Kuo was closely affiliated with Taiwan 's ministry of defence and was unaware he was in contact with Chinese officials .
Mr Bergesen 's lawyer , Mark Cummings , said that there had been no explicit exchange of money for information .
For instance , Mr Bergesen had won $ 3,000 from Mr Kuo in cash in a poker game in Las Vegas in April 2007 , he said .
" In hindsight , he understands that the money was given to him in anticipation that he would provide documents , " Mr Cummings added .
Ms Kang ferried the information between Mr Kuo and Chinese officials , the FBI alleged .
Mr Kuo , 58 , and Ms Kang , 33 , face a more serious charge of " conspiracy to disclose national defence information to a foreign government " .
They face up to life in prison if convicted .
The information passed on related to Taiwan 's new Po Sheng air defence system .
Taiwanese officials said that some damage had been caused by the disclosures , but that they had not compromised key technology .
The Chinese government has dismissed the espionage accusations as groundless and accused the US of " Cold War thinking " .

What are these ?
Despite the MPAA 's recent admission that its collegiate file - swapping numbers were wildly inaccurate , the College Opportunity and Affordability Act sailed through the House today by a 354 - 58 margin with its controversial intellectual property provisions still in place .
COAA makes a host of changes to the higher education landscape in the US , but for our purposes , the most interesting was the requirement that schools make plans to offer some form of legal alternative to P2P file - swapping and that they also make plans to implement network filtering .
Not making such plans would carry no consequences , however , and we 're told by House staffers that no one 's federal financial aid is in danger .
Still , the requirement that schools plan for filters and for legal music options is one that universities largely oppose .
EDUCAUSE , which represents IT managers at more than 2,000 US universities , has consistently opposed to the provisions on the grounds that schools are n't in the business of pushing commercial music services to students .
When it comes to filtering , schools do n't like to block services with legal uses .
Intense opposition has also come from groups that believe the measure would cut federal funding to schools that do n't comply ( see this Santa Clara University newspaper article for an example ) .
While Congressional staffers insist this is n't true , others in Congress have gone so far as to offer amendments spelling it out explicitly .
Rep. Steve Cohen ( D - TN ) introduced and then pulled such an amendment yesterday , with his staff telling reporters that Cohen wanted to offer the amendment himself ; when that proved impossible due to his travel schedule , he apparently decided to pull it .
It 's an odd explanation , but it 's the only one were getting right now .
The White House yesterday also issued a " Statement of Administration Policy " that laid out its own objections to COAA .
Most of these have little to do with technology ( the Administration opposes any support for explicit racial quotas , for instance ) , though the document does say that the Administration will " work to address other concerns with the legislation . "
These other concerns include " addressing the information policy and technology requirements throughout the bill to ensure they are consistent with current Administration policies , and not duplicative of existing Federal programs . "
Opponents of the bill 's IP provisions had hoped that the MPAA 's inaccurate numbers might derail that section of the legislation , but that does not appear to have happened .
For the last several years , the MPAA has claimed that college students are responsible for 44 percent of film piracy " losses " in the US ; after reviewing the numbers recently , though , the MPAA realized that a mistake had been made .
The numbers have since been revised downward by nearly two - thirds .

Hollywood ’s striking writers and major studios have reached the outlines of a new employment contract , resolving key sticking points over how much writers should be paid for work that is distributed over the Internet , people familiar with the negotiations said Saturday .
A final contract could be presented to the Writers Guild of America board as early as Friday , according to three people close to the talks who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential .
The 3 - month - old strike is expected to end once the board approves the contract .
The tentative deal came after two weeks of talks that culminated in a marathon bargaining session Friday that was attended by News Corp.
President Peter Chernin , Walt Disney Chief Executive Robert A. Iger and Writers Guild of America negotiators David Young , Patrick M. Verrone and John F. Bowman .

Progress had been made in previous meetings on payment for work sold online , but Friday ’s session saw a breakthrough on the most contentious issue : compensation for the free streaming of films and TV programs over the Internet .
Representatives of the Writers Guild and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers , which represents the studios , declined to comment , citing a media blackout .
Attorneys from the studios and the guild were meeting over the weekend to discuss contract language for the proposed agreement , which would need to be ratified by the union ’s 10,500 members .
Even before a vote by members , the strike would probably be called off if board members strongly endorse the deal .
There are some issues that have yet to be resolved , including defining what qualifies as promotion on the Internet .
The debate centers on the extent to which networks can run video clips and other materials on their websites to promote TV programs before paying writers .

Both the writers and the studios faced rising pressures to find a way to end Hollywood ’s costliest strike in two decades .
Concluding the strike would allow thousands of workers who lost their jobs when television production shut down to return to work .
It would also allow the broadcast networks to salvage the upcoming fall season .
Production of pilots is scheduled to begin this month .
An end to the strike would also ensure that Hollywood ’s most glamorous party , the Feb. 24 Academy Awards , would air on ABC as scheduled .
Last month ’s Golden Globes were dramatically scaled back after writers and many actors refused to cross the picket line .
The Oscars would likely have faced similar boycotts .
The writers began their strike Nov. 5 in a fight largely about securing their future as digital technology transforms the film and TV industry .

Writers fear being shortchanged as the studios rush to distribute their TV shows and movies on the Web , cellphones , video iPods and other devices .
The payments they receive when their material is reused , known as residuals , help writers weather the feast - and - famine cycles of the business .
Studios , confronted with rising marketing and production costs and flattening DVD revenue , have been reluctant to commit to the guild ’s new - media pay demands when the economics of the Internet and other digital technologies are uncertain .
The latest round of discussions began two weeks ago after directors quickly negotiated their own accord with studios .
In Hollywood , the first union to reach a contract often sets the template for the other talent unions in a process known as pattern bargaining .
The tentative writers ’ agreement is largely modeled on the directors ’ pact , which doubles residual payments for films and TV shows sold online , secures the union ’s jurisdiction over shows created for the Internet ( above certain budgets ) and establishes payments for shows that are streamed on advertising - supported websites .

A number of top screenwriters and TV writer - producers known as show runners had in recent weeks lobbied their leaders to use the Directors Guild deal as template for their own agreement , eager to put the town back to work .
The directors ’ deal , however , stirred a debate among striking writers .
Many complained that the directors ’ contract offered meager residuals on shows that were streamed free on advertising - supported websites .
Another criticism was that the directors ’ deal limited the union ’s jurisdiction over shows created for the Web at a time when online entertainment is burgeoning .
That complaint was echoed a few days ago by the Screen Actors Guild , whose leaders publicly disparaged the directors ’ contract .
On Friday , however , studios offered some key concessions to ease those concerns and keep the talks on track .
Those included more favorable pay terms for streaming than those offered to directors .
Studios also offered “ separated rights ” provisions for shows created for the Web , ensuring , for example , that writers would receive extra compensation and credit for online shows that spawn TV pilots , two people close to the talks said .

Writers made some important concessions of their own earlier when they dropped demands to unionize work on animated movies and reality TV shows -- both of which had been viewed as non-starters by the studios .
The agreement was negotiated on the studio side by Chernin and Iger , who had been designated by the heads of the other studios to negotiate on their behalf .
That stood in contrast to previous sessions with the writers in which top media executives were n’t at the bargaining table and were led instead by Nick Counter , president of the producers association , and labor relations executives from the major studios .
Having done the heavy lifting , Chernin and Iger will now step back and rely on labor relations executives to formalize contract language this week .

Guild negotiators Young , Verrone and Bowman on Monday are expected to brief the union ’s 17 - member negotiating committee and board of directors on the proposed contract .

The fatal stabbing of a man yesterday in one of London 's busiest shopping streets in broad daylight has again thrown up headlines about knife crime in Britain .
Boris Johnson , in accepting the office of London mayor , pledged to rid the capital of the " scourge " of knife crime .
Just hours beforehand , 15 - year - old Lylle Tulloch had been stabbed to death in stairwell in Southwark , the 12th teenage fatality in London this year .
Since then , 16 - year - old Jimmy Mizen was murdered in south - east London , and yesterday a young man in his twenties was knifed outside a McDonalds in Oxford Street .
Incidents such as these have fuelled the public perception that knife crime is out of control , yet this is not borne out by the statistics .
According to the British Crime Survey , knife - enabled crime ( any crime involving a knife ) over the past decade has remained stable at around 6 - 7 % of all crime , comprising 30 % of all homicides .
In fact , the most recent crime survey by the Metropolitan police showed that knife crime has actually dropped by 15.7 % over the past two years , from 12,122 to 10,220 incidents .
Nevertheless , that still amounts to a knife - related incident every 52 minutes .
Knife crimes were also four times more prevalent than gun crimes ; and the risk of serious injury was more than double than that for gun crime – statistics that will give the London mayor and his newly appointed knife tsar , Ray Lewis , pause for thought .
Concern over stabbings is not limited to the capital , however .
The prevalence of knives on the streets has increased in recent years , according to the Police Federation of England and Wales which will be discussing knife crime and gang violence at the organisation 's annual conference next week .
Knife crime affects young people disproportionately .
Statistics show that teenagers in London , particularly those between the ages of 17 and 20 , are the most likely to be victims of knife crime , according to the Metropolitan police .
Also notable is the increase in violent crimes committed by 15 and 16 - year - olds .
According a survey compiled by the Youth Justice Board ( YJB ) , violent offences committed by 16 - year - olds rose from 17 % in 2004 , to 25 % in 2005 , while those perpetrated by 15 - year - olds climbed from 20 % in 2004 , to 26 % in 2005 .
Related to this is the increased number of young people arming themselves with knives .
The YJB survey reported a 12 % increase in the number of teenagers carrying knives since 2002 , with the proportion of girls carrying knives rising sharply in recent years , from 15 % in 2004 to 21 % in 2005 .
One in five of those convicted for possessing a knife were aged between 10 and 17 in 2006 , according to Home Office statistics .
In their report , the YJB asserted that the increase in children carrying knives was primarily out of fear of bullying or attack , the perception that all their peers carry knives , or to gain " street cred " .
" There is an overlap between teenagers who carry weapons and those who have been victims of knife crime , " Enver Solomon , deputy director of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies told the Guardian .
" If someone has been a victim of crime , they might carry a weapon because they feel unsafe .
They do n't inherently want to stab someone ; it 's just that the knife in the pocket makes them feel secure .
The majority of children are carrying pen-knives , not machetes , " he said .
Simply clamping down on the supply of knives – such as the installation of metal detectors at schools or equipping police with mobile metal detectors , as Mayor Johnson recently suggested – is not sufficient to address the problem , he added .
Instead , the mayor should focus on the social conditions in a cluster of boroughs that have generated a disproportionate number of the capital 's knife crimes .
Quoting Metropolitan police studies , Solomon said 2 % of London wards have been responsible for 10 % of all violent crimes involving teenagers .
" If you examine the conditions in these wards , these are areas of high social deprivation , social exclusion and lack of opportunities for young people , " he explained .
" The focus should not be on enforcement , but rather on opportunities for kids , through youth support services , peer mentoring schemes and employment opportunities for school - leavers . "
Home Office measures to tackle knife crime have included an amnesty in 2006 , which resulted in almost 100,000 knives being handed in , the doubling of the maximum penalty for possession of a knife from two to four years ' imprisonment , giving teachers new powers to search students for weapons , raising the minimum age for knife ownership to 18 and , most recently , imposing a ban on samurai swords .
But focusing on deterrence is inadequate , said Solomon , adding that the key to reducing knife crime was creating a safer environment for youngsters as well as increasing opportunities for young school leavers .
" You have to look at the social drivers .
Why do young boys slip into the illegal drugs economy ?
It 's not a positive choice , but for some of them it seems to be the only choice .
You have to use a range of policy levers to tackle this problem . "

Democrats benefited from getting involved early and spending money in support of Cazayoux .
House losses stoke GOP tensions
House Republicans who hoped to be on a slow climb back to the majority by now are reeling from Democratic victories in special elections in Illinois and Louisiana , and sources say another loss in Mississippi next week would roil an already poisoned relationship between House Minority Leader John A. Boehner and National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Cole .
Although there ’s no love lost — and plenty of blame to share — between the two leaders , a well - connected Republican operative said that Boehner probably lacks the “ muscle ” to push Cole out .
Advertisement
But Boehner and other Republicans have already expressed a lack of confidence in Cole by raising money for GOP candidates and incumbents outside the NRCC ’s purview , and they could further marginalize the NRCC chairman if he can’t keep now - Sen .
Roger Wicker ’s seat in the Republican column next Tuesday .
“ Illinois was really bad , Louisiana was worse , if that ’s possible , but if we do n’t win in Mississippi , I think you are going to see a lot of people running around here looking for windows to jump out of , ” said a Republican leadership aide .
House Republicans had assumed the worst was behind them when they were swept out of power in 2006 .
Yet after losing former House Speaker Dennis Hastert ’s old Illinois seat in March and Rep. Richard Baker ’s Louisiana seat on Saturday , there is growing dread among members , staff and outside lobbyists that the party could lose even more ground in November .
But Republicans have few options available to change direction at this stage in the cycle .
GOP insiders acknowledge that it ’s too late to replace Cole .
The NRCC wo n’t be able to overcome the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ’s huge fundraising advantage by November .
And President Bush remains at historically low approval ratings , further dragging down the party ’s hopes for a congressional comeback .
The reality is that , with six months to go until the elections , Boehner and Cole remain tethered together , their political fates intertwined in spite of the animosity between them .
Experts on both sides of the aisle are privately predicting that House Democrats will pick up more seats in the fall , despite the continued uncertainty about who will be at the top of the Democratic presidential ticket .
The range of potential GOP losses is expected to be three to eight seats , experts say .
Wider losses would all but guarantee that Cole will quit or be ousted as NRCC chairman , and could threaten Boehner ’s hold on the Republican Conference .
“ If there is a bloodbath in November , Cole would be gone , but I think you could see Boehner , [ Minority Whip Roy ]
Blunt and the rest of the leadership be replaced as well , ” said a GOP lobbyist close to the leadership .
Cole ’s supporters , for their part , are laying the blame for Saturday ’s loss directly at the feet of their candidate , former Louisiana state legislator Woody Jenkins , calling him a “ flawed candidate ” who failed to raise enough money or come up with a message to beat Democrat Don Cazayoux .
But that ’s the argument the NRCC made when Democrat Bill Foster beat Republican Jim Oberweis in the March 8 election in Hastert ’s old district , and the excuse is wearing thin for some Republicans .
Although there is no active movement to replace Cole , many of his colleagues are unhappy with the NRCC ’s performance and question its tactics , including Cole ’s refusal to get involved in disputed Republican primaries for open seats .
Asked about criticism that he might not have been the best candidate to fill that seat , Jenkins told Politico on Monday : “ There are always these people nipping at your heels .
I do n’t know who else it would have been . ”
Jenkins , who said he may run again for the seat in November , said the party did what it could in the limited amount of time between the primary and the special election , but the Democrats benefited from getting involved early and spending money in support of Cazayoux months before the NRCC could , given Cole ’s decision not to get involved in primary fights .
The NRCC spent $ 440,000 in the Louisiana special election trying to prop up Jenkins , an effort further bolstered by hundreds of thousands of dollars in TV ads paid for by the conservative groups Freedom ’s Watch and Club for Growth .
The NRCC tried to tie Cazayoux to Sens. Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) and Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) as well as to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) , but nothing seemed to move the needle in Jenkins ’ favor .
The Republican ended up losing to Cazayoux 49 percent to 46 percent — a result that mirrored the 49 percent to 44 percent lead Cazayoux held in a poll his campaign released in March .
Cole has been very pragmatic about his naysayers since winning the NRCC post , acknowledging that every member has a right to second - guess but remaining steadfast in his own beliefs as a veteran campaign manager who also helmed the committee as an aide .
In Cole ’s defense , Rep. Eric Cantor ( R - Va. ) , the chief deputy minority whip , said the Republicans have “ some forces out there that need to be reckoned with . ”
“ There is a national mood that is reflected in the generic ballot .
It ’s a difficult environment .
My sense would be that instead of assigning blame , we need to go forward . ”
“ I think that people are recognizing that this is a turbulent election where there are a lot of uncertainties , a lot of economic discontent , ” said Rep. Phil English ( R - Pa. ) , who unsuccessfully challenged Cole for the NRCC chairmanship in late 2006 .
“ There is a great deal of discontent with both parties . ”
English insisted that “ two specials do not make a trend . ”
The NRCC tried to spin away Saturday ’s result in Louisiana by saying that Cazayoux ’s 49 percent victory was a “ warning shot to Democrats ” who needed to understand that “ the elitist behavior of the Democratic front - runner , and the liberal and extremist positions that he and his fellow Democrats in Congress have staked their claim to , do not appear to be as salient as they once hoped . ”
Further underscoring his differences with Cole , Boehner will take exactly the opposite approach when he speaks to House Republicans on Tuesday .
“ The result this weekend in Louisiana ’s 6th Congressional District should serve as a wake - up call to Republican candidates across the country , ” reads a draft of Boehner ’s speech provided to Politico .
“ As I said last week , this is a change election , and Republican candidates must show they are ready to lead a movement for reform . ”
A GOP leadership aide said that , for all the unhappiness directed at Cole , there ’s a limit to what others in the leadership can do .
“ Leadership has tried to support the NRCC , but ultimately they ca n’t go and take over the day - to - day running of the committee , ” the aide said .
For now , it ’s a waiting game until next Tuesday , when Democrat Travis Childers and Republican Greg Davis face off in Mississippi .
The two are locked in a tight battle for the Wicker seat , with internal GOP polling showing Childers with a slight lead .
Both the NRCC and DCCC have pumped hundreds of thousands of dollars into the race .
The DCCC , which has a huge cash - on - hand advantage over the NRCC , has spent $ 1.29 million so far , compared with just under $ 1 million for Republicans .
“ I would certainly be concerned if we lose the Wicker seat , just as I was concerned about losing the Hastert seat , ” said Rep. Charles Boustany ( R - La . ) .
Boustany said Jenkins ’ defeat was part of a “ worrisome trend , ” although he declined to say that it was a bellwether for the GOP ’s prospects in the fall .
Boustany defended Cole ’s decision to have the NRCC back Jenkins .
Boustany said he and his GOP colleagues in the Louisiana delegation asked Cole to spend money on behalf of Jenkins , even though popular Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal made only one appearance with the candidate .
“ Well , you ’re damned if you do , and you ’re damned if you don’t , ” Rep. Jim McCrery ( R - La. ) said of Cole ’s decision to spend money on Jenkins .
“ I thought the NRCC made a perfectly appropriate move in that situation . ”
Clinton campaign 's new strategy ... vote for Chelsea in 2016
The souvenir vendors outside Hillary Clinton 's campaign appearances have added a new badge to their wares that reads " Chelsea in 2016 " with a picture of the former first daughter .
Attention , whether from badge sellers or the national media , is leaving the fading presidential candidacy of Senator Hillary Clinton behind as the former front - runner faces what most see as impossible odds to win the Democratic nomination .
Now in the spotlight is her rival , fellow Senator Barack Obama , who has solidified his lead among Democrats and is setting his sights on Republican candidate John McCain in the November election .
Chip off the block : Chelsea Clinton speaks before her mother at a retirement community in Boca Raton , Florida
While Mr Obama and Mr McCain spar - the two clashed this week over whether the United States should talk to leaders of hostile nations - Mrs Clinton 's struggle to collect votes in Florida that were cast months ago but invalidated feels like a sideshow .
Mr Obama 's milestone victory in Oregon on Tuesday that gave him a majority of pledged delegates to the Democratic nominating convention graced front pages of U.S. newspapers .
Mrs Clinton 's simultaneous victory in Kentucky , which did little to close her gap with Mr Obama , was a much smaller story .
" The shrinking candidacy of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton all but vanished from the television set , " wrote The New York Times .
Either will do : Ricardo Marquez holds pictures of the two Democratic presidential candidate during a Clinton 's campaign event at the University of Miami
Even calls for the former first lady to drop out have abated , whether because she seems less of a threat to damage Mr Obama or because she paid them no heed .
Despite a campaign deeply in debt , she vows to compete through the last primaries on June 3 .
After the mixed results in Oregon and Kentucky , Mrs Clinton soldiered on this week in Florida which , along with Michigan , saw its January primaries invalidated because they were held earlier than Democratic Party rules allowed .
She won both primaries and wants the votes counted and the delegates seated .
She maintains she would lead Mr Obama in the popular vote if both states were counted .
Although delegates select the party nominees , contenders such as Mrs Clinton hope to win uncommitted superdelegates , who can back any candidate .
Vote push : Clinton supporters hold a count Florida and Michigan votes sign , during the Solutions for America event at Century Village West , Boca Raton , Florida
In Florida , Clinton 's speeches were part civics lesson , part call to action and part comparison to the state 's voting recount in 2000 .
Voting confusion in south Florida left the contest between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore undecided , but a controversial U.S. Supreme Court decision resolved the race in favor of Bush .
Gore won the popular vote .
" We are still arguing , are n't we , for counting all the votes back in 2000 , and we should be just as passionately arguing for that principle today , here in Florida and in Michigan , " Mrs Clinton told retirees in Boca Raton .
As she spoke , an elderly man sitting behind her , directly in the eye of television cameras , yawned deeply , rubbed his eyes and battled to stay awake .

Campaign debt : New York Senator Hillary Clinton
Despite Mrs Clinton 's efforts , Mr Obama holds what almost everyone outside her campaign and her hardcore supporters sees as a nearly insurmountable mathematical lead in party delegates .
So much so , many political observers have written off her campaign as a lesson in recent history .
" Hillary Clinton 's Defeat : A Historic Triumph " declared a headline on the Huffington Post , a news and politics Web site .
On Slate , a commentary site , correspondent John Dickerson wrote : " Forget maths majors -- what about science ? "
" The race for the Democratic nomination -- ' race ' is hardly the right word , is it ? -- now feels like a quantum physics problem :
How long can a body exist in a state approximating motionlessness without actually stopping ? " he wrote .
But for supporters like Nora Blake , 85 , who listened to Mrs Clinton speak at a senior citizens center in Sunrise , Florida , the media and the Democratic Party are to blame for unfairly dismissing the New York senator 's candidacy .
" I do n't understand why they are so anti-Hillary , " said the retiree from Brooklyn , New York .
" The Democratic Party is dismissing her , the Democratic National Committee is dismissing her .
I think they should all be junked . "
Mrs Clinton 's staff tried to stir up enthusiasm for her ongoing campaign among the exhausted reporters trailing her around Florida and griping that editors at home do n't care about any Clinton story unless she dropped out of the race .
" I 'm not hearing the excitement , " one campaign aide said as the candidate 's plane landed in Palm Beach and a second aide launched into a rehearsed speech on Clinton 's strategy .
" Did you hear that ? " another aide prodded a reporter .
" A little bit , " the reporter replied .

" I have been in the market for a new computer for the past few weeks and I know that I want to run Linux on it .

They are more expensive , and it's not hard just to reformat the PC with Linux .

Advance Auto Parts , a leading auto parts retailer , has begun sending letters to customers impacted by a data breach that may have exposed financial information of up to 56,000 people .
The retailer reported March 31 that a " network intrusion " had exposed financial information and was the subject of a criminal investigation .
Fourteen of the retailer 's stores , including locations in Georgia , Ohio , Louisiana , Tennessee , Mississippi , Indiana , Virginia and New York , are believed to have been affected .
Advance Auto Parts did not specify how customer financial information had been revealed or how access had been gained to its network .
In response to the incident , the company notified its credit , debit and check processors .
Customers of the 14 locations listed in an advisory who do not receive a letter can call a toll - free - number provided by the company to find out if they were affected , according to the company .
Company officials said in the advisory that they believed the incident to be contained , and that the company is working with law enforcement and a third - party security expert to uncover what happened .
Advance Auto Parts is offering the affected customers a credit monitoring product from a national credit reporting agency at no cost for one year .
" We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this attack on our network may cause .
Advance Auto Parts has been dedicated for the past 75 years to earning customer trust and for providing Legendary Customer Service , " said Darren Jackson , president and chief executive officer , in a statement .
What used to be called the Olympics are likely this summer to become the Paramilitary Games .
China is planning to deploy more than 94,000 security personnel at the Beijing celebration in August , which means that uniformed and plain - clothes operatives will outnumber the 10,500 athletes by nearly nine to one .
Leading what will be the biggest security effort the world has ever seen is the People 's Armed Police , a 660,000 - strong militia force , which has been involved in the crackdown on Tibetan demonstrators in Lhasa .
The PAP is also believed to have provided the squads of blue and white tracksuited paramilitaries who formed the controversial phalanx of guards for the Olympic torch as it made its chaotic way across London , Paris and San Francisco last week .
On Thursday , the People 's Armed Police News reported that the PAP force was told to prevent any security threats that could upset the Games .
The paper issued a " political mobilisation order " to PAP troops telling them to prepare for an arduous time ensuring order and control before and during the Games .
Beijing is worried that activists from abroad , who have disrupted the journey of the Olympic torch relay , will also stage protests inside China over Tibet , Darfur , human rights and other issues before and during the Games .
As a result , security experts forecast that the PAP 's ranks will swell further .
There has already been high - profile shows of strength by the militia in Beijing , public display exercises to show its carefully honed organisation .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The willingness of the torch 's minders over the past week to weigh in and protect the flame – even on foreign soil where the guards have no jurisdiction – introduced the force 's strict approach to a wider , worldwide audience for the first time and reflects the way security forces in China can pretty much do what they like on their own territory .
About 20 government agencies – from the world 's largest standing army , the two - million strong People 's Liberation Army , to the fire service – will be involved in the security operation for the Olympics , supported by thousands of volunteers recruited from military and police academies .
Organisers in Beijing insist they have spent less on security than the Athens Games in 2004 , glossing over the argument that the last Olympics were considered a special case because they were the first to be held after the 11 September attacks on the United States .
Even then , security personnel in Greece numbered between 50,000 and 70,000 operatives , far fewer than will be ready for action in Beijing .
The worldwide relay passed through Buenos Aires on Friday night with a comparatively smooth ride .
Disruption had been expected but a tossed water balloon was the stiffest challenge faced by the heavy police guard .
But the path ahead remains rocky .
India has severely cut back the route and warned Chinese officials that it will not attempt to stop peaceful protests when the torch arrives .
A similar stance has been taken in Indonesia .
Japan has also mapped out a strategy , banning the PAP force from running beside its own police officers when it passes through Nagano .
And all of that precedes the most controversial passage ofall : an ascent of Mount Everest in May followed by a tour of the Tibetan capital of Lhasa , the scene of rioting in March .
The focus on Chinese state television for the past week has been on the larger crowds of well - wishers who lined the route of the torch relay and showed nothing of the protests , although commentators did mention " vile " disruptive elements .
After disturbances in Paris , the communist newspaper The People 's Daily led with stirring reports of a disabled athlete who fought to keep the " sacred flame " alight against the threat of Tibetan " splittists " .
In China , where all areas of media activity are tightly controlled by the government , where dissent is forbidden and can result in a jail sentence , the Olympic torch relay has been portrayed as an outstanding success so far .
The coverage on the official news agency , Xinhua , has shown mostly smiling athletes and civic leaders passing the torch .
The news reports quote leaders and passers - by wishing Beijing well .
Ever since Beijing was granted the Games in 2001 , there has been an automatic assumption that security would be no problem for the Chinese authorities , who have a lengthy track record of keeping the streets safe and a lid on dissent .
Public demonstrations of protest in China are illegal and China is ruthlessly efficient at dealing with protest within its borders , as was seen in Tibet last month and in Tiananmen Square in June 1989 .
China is freer now than it has ever been .
It has the biggest number of internet users in the world , and its citizens enjoy more liberty than they ever did under the emperors or under the Communist Party before or during the Cultural Revolution .
They have money in their pockets and they can express their views relatively openly on the streets .
That said , the Chinese government is deadly serious when it comes to containing public displays of dissent at the Olympics .
Last summer , dozens of security guards with metal pipes beat up a group of construction workers at the National Stadium , centrepiece of the Olympic Games , who were having a cigarette break in breach of a strict no smoking rule .
More recently , Beijing claimed to have uncovered a plot by Muslim separatists in Xinjiang to sabotage the celebrations with suicide bombings and kidnappings .
Asked on US television on Friday whether he wanted the world to boycott the Beijing Games , the Dalai Lama , Tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , said no before sending the message to China : " We are not against you – and I 'm not seeking separation . "
Chinese President Hu Jintao said he was ready to meet the Dalai Lama but accused him of trying to " ruin the Beijing Olympics " .
He said talks could open only if he desisted from trying to " split the motherland " and " incite violence " .
President
Hu said : " Our conflict with the Dalai clique is not an ethnic problem , not a religious problem , nor a human rights problem .
It is a problem of either preserving national unity or splitting the motherland . "
International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge , who visited Beijing this week for planning meetings , was pressed on whether he could help to bring the two sides together , but ruled out an intervention .
He said : " This is the line we do not have to cross .
This is a political matter in which the IOC cannot enter .
This is a sovereign matter for China to decide . "
Focus has also centred on world leaders who may or may not be at August 's opening ceremony .
Gordon Brown and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will not be there – even if both are insisting this does not amount to a boycott .
US President George Bush has been left with a dilemma .
John McCain , the Republican senator has already said he would not go unless China cleaned up its act on human rights , while Democrat candidates Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have called on Bush to swerve the opening ceremony .
Bush , who needs Chinese help to confront Burma 's military junta and North Korea 's nuclear programme , has indicated he will go and that it will allow him to put concerns directly to President Hu .
His former Asia adviser Michael Green said : " The problem with a boycott is you end up taking 1.3 billion Chinese – who have different views of democracy , of the United States , of human rights , but all want the Olympics to be successful – and you turn them all against the United States . "
The Chinese government also has a balancing act on security .
If it reacts in too severe a fashion , China risks the ire of the international community .
Appear too soft on the terrorist threat , and it risks being labelled incompetent and unstable .
More than half a million foreign visitors are expected for the Olympics , and two million Chinese , so if the skirmishes around the torch relay prove to be a prelude to bigger protests , the scope for an international incident is there
Our visions of future events do n’t include a lot of detail .
In the Sept. 7 Science , Gilbert and Wilson discuss the many resulting biases :
We feel better when we imagine going to the theater than to the dentist , but we feel better imagining either event on a sunny day than on a rainy day , or when we are well rather than ill . …
When people who have missed trains in the past are asked to imagine missing a train in the future , they tend to remember their worst train - missing experience rather than their typical train - missing experience .
… which leads them to overestimate how painful the next train - missing experience will be .
Similarly , when people experience an unpleasant episode that ends in brief relief – for example , submerging their arms for 90 s in a bath of ice water that is slightly warmed in the final 30 s – they tend to remember the closing moments of the experience rather than the most typical moments … which leads them to underestimate how painful the recurrence will be .
It seems that everyone remembers their best day , their worst day , and their yesterday .
Because unusual events and recent events are so memorable , people tend to use them when constructing simulations of future events .
…
Because simulations omit inessential features , people tend to predict that good events will be better and bad events will be worse than they actually turn out to be …
Participants in one study were told that in a year there would be an interesting lecture at an inconvenient location and a boring lecture at a convenient location .
Because their simulations of the lecture contained the essential features ( e.g. , the topic ) but lacked the inessential features ( e.g. , the location ) , participants predicted that they would attend the more interesting lecture .
But participants who were told that the same lecture was taking place tomorrow instead of next year tended to simulate both the essential and inessential features , and thus predicted that they would attend the more convenient lecture .
The fact that simulations of far - future events are especially likely to omit inessential features is one of the reasons why people so often make future commitments that they regret when the time to fulfill them arrives . …
When people imagine what their lives would be like if they won the lottery or became paraplegic , they are more likely to imagine the first day than the two - hundred - and - ninety - seventh .
The problem with imagining only the early moments of an event is that hedonic reactions to events typically dissipate over time , which means that mental simulations tend to overrepresent the moments that evoke the most intense pleasure or pain .
This is one of the reasons why healthy people consistently underestimate how happy they would be in various states of ill - health . …
When students at a university library were approached by a researcher and given a $ 1 coin , those who received an explanation for the event were less happy 20 min later than those who did not .
But when students were asked to simulate the event , they predicted that they would be happier if they received an explanation .
Participants in another study were more satisfied with a gift when they were not given the opportunity to exchange it because inescapability , like explanation , facilitates adaptation .
And yet , participants who merely simulated receiving gifts failed to realize that they would be more satisfied with gifts that they could n’t exchange .
…
Hungry people mistakenly expect to like eating spaghetti for breakfast the next day , and sated people mistakenly expect to dislike eating it for dinner the next day .
People who have just exercised mistakenly expect to enjoy drinking water the next day more than do people who are about to exercise .
… people overestimate how unhappy they will be after their team loses a football game and how happy they will be after becoming wealthy .
It seems to me that intellectual commentary about the distant future suffers from similar lack of detail .
People focus on a few abstract moral or aesthetic considerations and extreme cases , and forget the vast detail that will make the difference between slightly more or less satisfying lives .
To a large extent the main things that matter about the future are how many people there are and how rich they are , so they can buy all those details that matter .

The Telectroscope is more than a giant telescope — looking through its lens in NYC , you can see all the way to London — and vice versa .
These steampunk creations were unveiled today in the two cities to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the Brooklyn Bridge .
Artist Paul St George 's Victorian - style gold and wood trim make the behemoth - size scopes impressive to look at , but the most amazing part is how he claims they work .

St George says in the 19th century his great - grandfather , Alexander Stanhope St George , built a trans -Atlantic tunnel from London to New York which was forgotten by time .
The artist discovered his great - grandfather 's plans recently and using the diagrams installed parabolic mirrors at both locations that reflect what 's happening 3500 miles across the pond .
Now , I can't say for sure since I have n't seen the Telectroscope in person , but a picture in the gallery above suggests a more logical explanation that involves built - in webcams and broadband internet sending live video in both directions .
Either way , the scope looks fantastic and I can't wait to check it out .

The Telectroscopes are on display 24/7 until June 15 .
New Yorkers can check out the Brits by heading to Fulton Ferry Landing in Brooklyn ; Londoners will need to head to Tower Bridge if they want their fix of spying on the Yanks .

The Ninth Circuit 's recent ruling ( pdf ) in United States v. Arnold allows border patrol agents to search your laptop or other digital device without limitation when you are entering the country .
EFF and many civil liberties , travelers ’ rights , immigration advocacy and professional organizations are concerned that unfettered laptop searches endanger trade secrets , attorney - client communications , and other private information .
These groups have signed a letter asking Congress to hold hearings to find out what protocol , if any , Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) follows in searching digital devices and copying , storing and using travelers ’ data .
The letter also asks Congress to pass legislation protecting travelers ’ laptops and smart phones from unlimited government scrutiny .
If privacy at the border is important to you , contact Congress now and ask them to take action !
In the meantime , how can international travelers protect themselves at the U.S. border , short of leaving their laptops and iPhones at home ?
Many travelers practice security through obscurity .
They simply hope that no border agent will rummage through their private data .
Too many people enter the country each day for agents to thoroughly search every device that crosses the border , and there is too much information stored on most devices for agents to find the most revealing and confidential tidbits .
But for travelers who may be targeted based on their celebrity , race or other distinguishing factor , obscurity is not an option .
As last week 's news that Microsoft is giving away forensic tools that can quickly search an entire hard drive on a USB “ thumb drive ” shows , it wo n't be long before customs agents can efficiently perform a thorough search on every machine .
So long as there are no protocols or oversight for these searches , every traveler 's personal information is at risk .
Encryption is one ( imperfect ) answer .
If you encrypt your hard drive with strong crypto , it will be prohibitively expensive for CBP to access your confidential information .
This answer is imperfect for two reasons — one is practical , the other is technological .
Practically , the government has not disclosed CBP 's laptop search practices , despite our Freedom of Information Act lawsuit for these documents .
We do n't know what a border patrol agent will do when confronted with an encrypted machine .
One possibility is that the agent will simply give up and let the traveler pass with her belongings .
Other possibilities are that the agent will turn the traveler and her machine away at the border , or that he will seize the laptop and allow the traveler to continue on .
I suspect that on most occasions , CBP agents confronted with encrypted or password - protected data tell the owner to enter the password or get turned away , and the owner , eager to continue her voyage or to return home , simply complies .
If you do n't want to comply , CBP cannot force you to decrypt your data or give over your password .
Only a judge can force you to answer questions , and then only if the Fifth Amendment does not apply .
While no Fifth Amendment right protects the data on your laptop or phone , one federal court has held that even a judge cannot force you to divulge your password when the act of revealing the password shows that you are the person with access to or control over potentially incriminating files .
See In re Boucher , 2007 WL 4246473 ( D. Vt. November 29 , 2007 ) .
If , however , you do n't respond to CBP ’s demands , the agency does have the authority to search , detain , and even prohibit you from entering the county .
CBP has more authority to turn non-citizens away than it does to exclude U.S. persons from entering the country , but we do n't know how the agents are allowed to use this authority to execute searches or get access to password protected information .
CBP also has the authority to seize your property at the border .
Agents cannot seize anything they like ( for example , your wedding ring ) , but we do not know what standards agents are told to follow to determine whether they can and should take your laptop but let you by .
Technologically , encryption is imperfect because even strong crypto can be cracked when someone obtains the keys .
Border agents can demand the keys from travelers unwilling to face seizure or detention .
Agents may also be able to extract and use keys that are stored on the machine itself .
Generally , if you keep your keys with the laptop , in your head or on your disk , then the encryption is easier to socially engineer or break than if you keep the keys elsewhere .
( Discussion of what encryption techniques to use or avoid is beyond the scope of this post . )
Encryption aside , there may be other ways you can show CBP that your laptop is indeed a normal computer and that you mean no harm while keeping confidential information from prying eyes .
Most operating systems let users to create multiple accounts on a single machine .
A traveler could allow CBP to examine his own account , while storing client data or trade secrets in a separate account “ owned ” by his law firm or corporation .
Under typical border search circumstances , this might satisfy CBP concerns .
However , simply storing information in a different account — even one protected by a password — is not the same as encrypting it .
If CBP is interested , the most commonly used forensic search tools can access and search non-encrypted data in every account on the machine .
Law firms , corporations and other entities that routinely deal with confidential information are handing their business travelers forensically clean laptops loaded with only what the traveler needs for that particular business trip .
Leaving unnecessary data , like five years of email , behind may be the best thing .
Of course , if trade secrets or client information are the reason for the trip , this plan will not help .
Another option is to bring a clean laptop and get the information you need over the internet once you arrive at your destination , send your work product back , and then delete the data before returning to the United States .
Historically , the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) generally prohibited warrantless interception of this information exchange .
However , the Protect America
Act amended FISA so that surveillance of people reasonably believed to be located outside the United States no longer requires a warrant .
Your email or telnet session can now be intercepted without a warrant .
If all you are concerned about is keeping border agents from rummaging through your revealing vacation photos , you may not care .
If you are dealing with trade secrets or confidential client data , an encrypted VPN is a better solution .
Finally , however useful these techniques might be to protect laptops , travelers do not have this array of options for protecting data stored on less configurable smart phones .
Of course , many phones do have a lock or password protection option , which travelers might consider enabling before heading to the airport .
In sum , while you must submit yourself and your electronic devices to warrantless and suspicionless searches at the border , you are not legally obligated to decrypt information or reveal passwords .
However , if you fail to do so , the border agents may detain or search you , or even seize the device .
There are no options that provide perfect privacy protection , but there are some options that reduce the likelihood that a legitimate international traveler 's confidential information will be subjected to arbitrary and capricious examination .
Example Security Precaution
Attorney Alice needs to have confidential attorney - client privileged information overseas .
Before departure , she removes unnecessary information , encrypts her hard drive with strong crypto and sets up a login for a protected account and a travel account on her computer .
To access the confidential data , one would need to first login to the protected account , and then open the encrypted files .
Only Alice ’s employer ( The Law Offices of Bob ) knows the passwords to the account and encrypted data , and keeps them secret until Alice arrives at her destination .
Bob then sends the passwords to Alice in an encrypted email message .

The chemical seeds of Earthly life were planted by meteorites , says Columbia University chemist Ronald Breslow – and if it happened here , it could happen elsewhere .
In a report delivered to the American Chemical Society 's annual meeting ,
Breslow simulated the behavior of " left - handed " amino acids in an
Earth - like environment .
The acids ' appendage appellation derives from their molecular orientation , also known as chirality ; except for a few oddball bacteria , all living creatures are composed of proteins made from left - handed amino acids .
This phenomena has long perplexed scientists .
Why left instead of right - handed ?
Why not both ?
One possible explanation : because the first amino acids came from space , riding to Earth on meteorites .
When the meteorites passed neutron stars , they were blasted with circular polarized light , in which photons corkscrew to either the left or right .
Breslow 's earlier experiments showed that CPL damages amino acids of corresponding handedness : if , on a fateful journey some four billion years ago , an Earthbound meteorite passed a star emitting right - spiraling CPL , it would have been stripped of right - handed acids , leaving the present orientation of life 's building blocks as a biochemical echo of our extraterrestrial origin .
In his ACS report , Breslow added left - handed amino acids to the amino acid precursors found on pre-biotic Earth .
The resulting acids were also left - handed and eventually dominated Breslow 's mixture , suggesting that a similar process could have happened four billion years ago after a rock from space hit our hot and lifeless world .
Will we ever know for sure ?
Of course not .
But it 's plausible , and excesses of left - handed amino acids have indeed been found on meteorites landing in Australia and Tennessee during the last century .
Breslow next plans to study the origin of nucleic acids – the chemical units of DNA .
“ This work is related to the probability that there is life somewhere else , ” said Breslow in a press release .
“ Everything that is going on on
Earth occurred because the meteorites happened to land here .
But they are obviously landing in other places .
If there is another planet that has the water and all of the things that are needed for life , you should be able to get the same process rolling . ”

In the aftermath of World War II , the Japanese economy went through one of the greatest booms the world has ever known .
From 1950 to 1970 , the economy ’s output per person grew more than sevenfold .
Japan , in just a few decades , remade itself from a war - torn country into one of the richest nations on earth .
Yet , strangely , Japanese citizens did n’t seem to become any more satisfied with their lives .
According to one poll , the percentage of people who gave the most positive possible answer about their life satisfaction actually fell from the late 1950s to the early ’ 70s .
They were richer but apparently no happier .
This contrast became the most famous example of a theory known as the Easterlin paradox .
In 1974 , Richard Easterlin , then an economist at the University of Pennsylvania , published a study in which he argued that economic growth did n’t necessarily lead to more satisfaction .
People in poor countries , not surprisingly , did become happier once they could afford basic necessities .
But beyond that , further gains simply seemed to reset the bar .
To put it in today ’s terms , owning an iPod does n’t make you happier , because you then want an iPod Touch .
Relative income — how much you make compared with others around you — mattered far more than absolute income , Mr. Easterlin wrote .
Did anyone else catch what Hillary said last night during the debate about her Bosnia sniper - fire fiasco ?
Here ’s ABC ’s transcript :
HILLARY : On a couple of occasions in the last weeks , I just said some things that were n’t in keeping with what I knew to be the case and what I had written about in my book .
She ’s now saying that she said things that she knew at the time were not true .
And to compound matters , she and her staff and her husband spent two weeks lying about the lie , trying to claim that she only said it one time ( she said it four ) , she said it late at night and was therefore tired ( she said it at 9 am , the last time ) , they even sent surrogates out to claim that what she said was true ( even though she now says she knew at the time that it was n’t true ) .
So , if Hillary knew that what she said was n’t true , then she intentionally and knowingly coordinated a campaign to cover up her own lie for two whole weeks .
And now , the best explanation she can give , is “ I intentionally lied . ”
When 60 Minutes called Kanzius RF therapy , which uses gold nanoparticles and radio waves , one of the most promising breakthroughs in cancer research , I raised my eyebrows and started compiling a list of other treatments that seem even more viable :
5. Gene Knockdown
Simply put , cancer is what happens when some cells start multiplying uncontrollably .
Tiny molecules , called siRNA , can halt the production of proteins that help tumors grow and survive .
Several companies , including Alnylam Pharmaceuticals , are pursuing that strategy .
Their experimental drug , ALN - VSP01 , is a cocktail that stops the production of two molecules .
In doing so , it can simultaneously cut off the supply of blood to a tumor and halt cell division .
Unfortunately , siRNA molecules are quite fragile .
The trickiest part of this treatment is slipping them into the cancer cells before they are destroyed by enzymes called nucleases .
One classic approach is to package them in a tiny bubble of fat molecules called a liposome .
4. Viruses
Years of evolution have given viruses an unprecedented ability to enter cells and hijack or destroy them .
Several rather harmless varieties can kill tumors while leaving normal cells unscathed .
Often , they are genetically modified to increase their effectiveness .
Jennerex biotherapeutics is one of several companies that is testing vaccinia as a cure for some types of the deadly disease .
A similar virus has been used on hundreds of millions of people as a smallpox vaccine .
3. Small Molecules
Chemotherapy is a blunt instrument .
Many drugs work by killing cancer cells just a little bit faster than they destroy the normal ones .
However , medicinal chemists are hard at work making molecules that will take a smarter approach to fighting the disease .
For instance , Johnson and Johnson is testing drug called Tipifarnib , which gums up farnesyl transferase , an enzyme that aggravates cancer .
Unlike earlier cancer treatments , it is not meant to kill cancer cells , but rather to calm them down .
2. Vaccines
In many instances , researchers have been able to train the human body to attack cancer cells .
In some instances , the scientists take whole cells from a tumor , kill them , and then douse them with molecules that are known to anger the immune system before injecting them back into a patient .
On other occasions , they pick a single molecule that adorns the surface of cancer cells and try to get the immune system to recognize it as a signal to attack .
One such treatment , which uses whole cancer cells , has been approved by the Russian Food and Drug Administration .
In the United States , many of the treatments are in Phase III clinical trials , which means they are almost ready for prime time .
On another front , vaccines like Gardasil can protect people from some of the viruses which cause genetic damage .
In that case , it wards of human papillomavirus , which is known to cause cervical cancer .
1. Epigenetic Drugs
Mutations , scrambled genes , can cause cells to malfunction and divide uncontrollably , but that is only one cause of cancer .
In many cancer cells , tumor suppressor genes , which should always be on , get switched off accidentally .
Sophisticated drugs might be able to turn our natural defenses back on – causing cancer cells to fix or kill themselves , or at least making them more responsive to chemotherapy .
Two epigenetic drugs , Valproic acid and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid , are already on the market .
They make cancer cells more willing to kill themselves by inactivating histone deacetylase – an enzyme that silences genes – including those that act as safeguards .
Meanwhile , Curagen is testing a compound called PXD101 , which acts on the same protein .

In our society , it often takes tragedy , to bring about change ; unfortunate , but true .
I am no exception .
Over the weekend , I may have accidently left a few ports open .
With 65,535 of them , it 's hard to remember if they 're all closed and stealthed , or if 1241 is still open from my Nessus session , if my Slingbox is still slinging shows over 5001 , or if one of those ports in the 27000 range was left open by my alter - ego , half - life addict .
Lucky for me , someone kindly let me know that some ports were left open , through the generous installation of free software ( trojans , key loggers , and other malware goodies ) on my server and several PCs .
After some digital house cleaning , I decided to sprinkle a new layer of security on my network .... port knocking .
This security approach was never fully embraced by the network community .
I think this was partially due to the misunderstanding of its true purpose .
It was never meant to act as a standalone method of security ; just a thin lining in your multilayered approach .
Port knocking ( PK ) is a firewall based method of user authentication .
Using a generic client - server model , it is platform independent .
A client is able to externally open a port by generating a specific sequence of connection attempts on closed ports .
This is analogous to the antiquated practice of using predefined rhythmic knocking on a door , as a sort of pass code , to gain entrance .
Let 's forget about the server daemon , client software , dynamic firewall rules , sequencing mechanisms and encryption use , and just look at the basic process .
Imagine a server with no open ports , and no vulnerable or critical services running .
A client PC wants to create a remote connection to the server , but the service port is closed and the service is n't even running .
The client PC sends connection attempts to a series of ports , in a particular order , with specific time intervals .
If the sequence of " knocks " correctly matches a predetermined authorization set , then the service port is opened and the service is started .
This mechanism provides several benefits .
It is a transparent means of controlled access , by restricting service usage to clients producing the correct " knock " sequence .
Common port scanning wo n't reveal open ports , with corresponding services to attack .
Furthermore , to prevent hackers from obtaining the knock sequence , through packet capture and analysis , it can be frequently changed with pseudo random generators and employing encryption .
Another benefit of PK is its ease of implementation .
The protected services require no modification and , with legitimate use , there is no degradation of performance .
Additional functionality consists of setting specific packet sequences , for both opening and closing ports , and remotely performing administrative tasks .
No information is readily provided to the hordes of port scanning hackers , which would indicate the presence of the PK security layer running on a system .
Even if discovered , attempts at brute forcing the knock sequence would generate traffic in quantities easily detected by an IDS , and possibly appearing as a DoS attack .
Implementing a PK system can be achieved in many ways ..... a good list of available options can be found here .
PK critics have analyzed various implementations ( without encryption ) , and are quick to point out their potential flaws .
Preventing replay attacks could be a problem if the system was susceptible to packet sniffing and eavesdropping .
Furthermore , client IP spoofing , overloading computational resources , packet synchronization errors , and the development and use of single packet authorization ( SPA ) techniques , have overshadowed its use in recent years .
While , " security through obscurity " is an unacceptable form of security , ( although still used way too much ) , sometimes it 's beneficial , when part of a multilayered approach .
The hacker community has offensively embraced PK systems for creating " invisible " back doors .
Trojans are planted in servers , which monitor traffic for the correct opening knock sequence , as configured by the hacker .
When detected , the back door is opened ( usually an ephemeral port ) , and the hacker has access to the server .
To all the PK skeptics reading this blog , I can assure you that this is an effective and commonly used method .
No matter what strategy is used for your network protection , it should consist of a layered security architecture .
Instead of analyzing methods individually , it is more important to understand the role they play and their effectiveness in your overall security solution .
Part of my personal strategy , is to occasionally employ an older , or less common security method as one of the layers of my defense .
Usually , the latest hacker applications and tools , are geared towards defeating the latest security measures , occasionally overlooking the simple , the obscure and the unsuspecting .
Descriptive characteristics that usually apply to me .
My ports are always open .

Мы поздравляем вас с Международным денём космоса !
Вы спросите , но ведь есть официальный день - Международный день полета человека в космос , также известный как Всемирный день авиации и космонавтики .
Да , но как видно , оптимистам космических перспектив этого мало !
Придумал и провозгласил этот праздник 21 мая 1998 году американский космонавт австралийского происхождени я
Энди Томас , на тот момент служивший на борту орбитальной станци и " Мир " в качестве второго бортинженера .
За 20 лет идея космонавта о таком праздничном дне прижилась во многих странах .
И хотя ООН , курирующая большинство международных праздников , не дала ему официальный статус , но он очень важен для тех , кого с юных лет манили космические дали .
В Харьковском планетарии им. Ю.А. Гагарина в Музее космоса есть модель Шаттла , где первый космонавт независимой Украины Леонид Константинович Каденюк оставил пожелание харьковчанам : « Дорогие друзья !
От всего сердца желаю вам добыть крылья для счастливого полета сквозь всю вашу жизнь , как у космического самолета — могучие , надежные , красивые ! »
« В международную ночь музеев в музее космонавтики и уфологи и Харьковского планетария им .
Ю. А. Гагарина экспозицию осматривают 5 живых существ .
И они никогда не расскажут о своих впечатлениях .
Эти живые существа не только не говорят , но и не ходят , а плавно перемещаются .
Удивлены ?
Сотрудники планетария нисколько их не боятся , более того - они их кормят и сами с ними разговаривают понемногу .
В необычную карантинную ночь раскрываем имена этих существ : две Кометы и три Сомика !
Улыбнитесь вместе с нами и вспомните ещё несколько космических названий для рыб : рыба - Солнце , рыба - Луна ...
А светящиеся рыбки разных цветов напоминают разноцветные звёздочки .
А какие рыбы летали в космос ?
С нетерпением ждём , когда же отменят карантин .
И мы расскажем всем любителям космоса много интересного !
Вітаємо з Всесвітнім Днем Землі 22.04.2020 !

Вітаємо з Всесвітнім Днем космонавтики та Днем працівників ракетно - космічної галузі України !
Нагадаємо , що 12 квітня 1961 року старший лейтенан т Ю. А. Гагарін на космічному кораблі « Восток » вперше в світі здійснив орбітальний облі т
Землі , відкривши епоху пілотованих космічних польотів .
Політ , що тривав всього 108 хвилин , став потужним проривом в освоєнні космосу .
Ім'я Юрія Гагаріна стало широко відомим в світі , а сам перший космонавт достроково отримав звання майора і звання Героя Радянського Союзу .
Нагадаємо також , що багато харків 'ян та підприємств міст а
Харків приймали участь у будівництві космодромі в
Байконур і запуску першого космонавта на орбіту !
Харків 'яни згадують :
Полковник ракетних військ у відставці Леонід Ганжа розповів , як будучи старшим лейтенантом очолював групу , що обробляла результати вимірювань життєвих параметрів першої людини в космосі .
За його словами , Юрій Гагарін був « залізною » людиною - всі його медичні показники протягом польоту були в нормі .
« Пульс , тиск , температура й інше - все було в порядку .
Він нормально себе почував і як сказав : « Поїхали ! » - так і « поїхав » , - поділився спогадами ветеран . - Мене вражає те , якими темпами розвивалася галузь .
У серпні 1957 року стався пуск балістичної ракети ( на її основі був розроблений космічний корабель ) , в тому ж році запустили два супутники і в 1961 ( через 4 роки ) людина - в космосі ... Фантастика якась » .
Харків 'янин Володимир Івашкевич теж згадав гагарінський політ .
Він розповів , що в чині капітана артилерійських військ відповідав за забезпечення рухової установки стисненим повітрям і стиснутим азотом , а також за те , щоб справно працювали механізми зниження температури в руховому відсіку при старті .
За словами ветерана , всі , причетні до історичного пуску , відчували особливу відповідальність , адже йшлося про життя людини .
« Звичайно , переживав , тим більше до цього траплялися невдалі старти ракет .
Запуск пройшов вдало , хоча про це Корольов нам сказав тільки за годину .
Коли наша група вже виїжджала з космодрому , по радіо передали , що стався запуск ракети , пілотованої майоро м
Гагаріним , а він же ж тоді був старшим лейтенантом .
У всіх нас відлягло від серця » , - розповів Володимир Івашкевич .

SAN FRANCISCO 
The Olympic torch arrived at the airport here from Paris in the wee hours Tuesday morning , exited out a side door and was escorted by motorcade to a downtown hotel .
There it took a well - deserved break in a room complete with cable TV , room service and views of the city ’s popular Union Square shopping district .
“ It has very comfortable accommodations , ” said Mike McCarron , an airport spokesman , who said the flame  ensconced in a handsome brass lantern and accompanied by several backup flames  was “ treated similar to a head of state . ”
On Wednesday afternoon , the flame will be under no such bushel as it makes its only appearance in the United States on an increasingly tense international tour en route to Beijing .
It will star in a two - and - a - half - hour relay along this city ’s waterfront , involving six miles of pavement , 79 runners and untold scores of law enforcement officials .
The precise route remained in flux on Tuesday as the torch extravaganza threatened to become more civic migraine than celebration in the face of potential protests by those upset with China ’s human rights record and recent crackdown in Tibet .
Mayor Gavin Newsom met with police and relay officials amid concerns that disruptions in London and Paris this week not be repeated here .
Chinese demand for oil to power its economy has sustained high prices
Oil prices have hit a record high approaching $ 128 a barrel on speculation that China will need to import more fuel , stretching supplies .
With more energy needed to rebuild areas devastated by the earthquake this week , US light sweet crude hit $ 127.82 a barrel before falling to $ 126.29 .
Prices were also supported by Goldman Sachs forecasting that oil would reach $ 141 a barrel later this year .
London Brent crude also rose , touching $ 125.82 a barrel before also slipping .
" Tight supply conditions continue to be the primary catalyst for higher crude prices , " Goldman Sachs analysts said .
The bank had previously predicted that US crude would reach $ 107 a barrel in the second half of the year .
Earlier this month , Goldman Sachs predicted that oil could reach $ 200 a barrel in the not too distant future .
Supplies
As the oil price rose , pressure from congress prompted the Bush administration to decide to cease renewing a critical governmental oil stockpile on Friday , in order to boost supplies .
The move by the US Energy Department follows legislation stipulating that emergency stocks should not be replenished until the price of crude oilis less than $ 75 per barrel .
The Bush administration has also been urging Saudi Arabia to increase output .
The US has already agreed to help protect Saudi Arabia 's oil infrastructure from terrorists and help it develop environmentally cleaner energy options .
Prices have risen by about 25 % since the beginning of the year , lifted by geopolitical worries and the weakening US dollar , which makes oil cheaper for foreign buyers .
At the same time demand from fast - growing Asian economies , notably China , has exacerbated price pressures .
The following is reprinted from The Best of Uncle John 's Bathroom Reader .
In the 1920s , a crossword puzzle craze swept the nation that drove some people over the edge : a man shot his wife when she would n't help him and another man killed himself leaving a suicide note in the form of a crossword puzzle .
Here 's the story of how crossword puzzles came to be and why it took over twenty years for The New York Times to convince itself to carry the puzzles .
Origin Arthur Wynne was a writer for the game page of the New York World at the turn of the 19th century .
One winter afternoon in 1913 , while trying to think up new types of games for the newspaper 's special Christmas edition , he came up with a way to adapt the " word squares " his grandfather had taught him when he was a boy .
In a word square , all of the words in the square have to read the same horizontally and vertically , like the example below .
But in the new puzzle Wynne came up with , the " across " words were different from the " down " words .
It was more challenging , since there were more words to work on .
Wynne 's puzzle , which he called a " Word - Cross , " debuted on Sunday December 21 as planned .
And it was well - received .
So many people wrote in to praise the puzzle that he put one in the paper the following Sunday and again on the third Sunday .
( See if you can solve the World 's First Crossword Puzzle ) Reversal of Fortune Four weeks after the puzzle first appeared , typesetters at the newspaper inadvertently transposed the words in the title to read " Cross - Word . "
For some reason , the name stuck - and so did the puzzle .
When the World tried to drop it a few months later , readers were so hostile that the paper reversed itself and decided to make it a permanent feature of the puzzle page instead .
Though the puzzles were popular with readers , they were decidedly unpopular with editors .
Crosswords were difficult to print and were plagued with typographical and other errors .
In fact , no other newspaper wanted any part of them .
So for the next 10 years , if you wanted to work on a crossword puzzle , you had to buy the World .
Enter Simon and Schuster According to legend , in 1924 a young Columbia University graduate named Richard L. Simon went to dinner at his Aunt Wixie 's house .
A World subscriber and a cross - word devotee , she asked where she could buy a book of crossword puzzles for her daughter .
Simon , who was trying to break into the publishing business with college chum M. Lincoln Schuster , told her there were no such books … and then hit on the idea of publishing one himself .
M. Lincoln Schuster ( R ) and Ricahrd L. Simon ( L ) .

The next day , he and Schuster went to the World 's offices and made a deal with the paper 's crossword puzzle editors .
They would pick the newspaper 's best crossword puzzles and pay $ 25 apiece for the rights to publish them in a book .
The pair then used all their money to print The Cross Word Puzzle Book .
Hot off the Presses It was literally an overnight success .
The World 's crossword puzzlers flocked to stores to get copies , and by the end of the year more than 300,000 crossword books had been sold .
The book turned Simon & Schuster into a major publisher .
( Today it 's the largest U.S. publishing house and the second - largest publisher on earth ) .
It also started a major craze .
Crossword puzzles became a way of life in the 1920s .
Newspaper started adding them to increase circulation .
They inspired a Broadway hit called Games of 1925 and a hit song called " Crossword Mama , You Puzzle Me . "
Sales of dictionaries soared , and foot traffic in libraries increased dramatically .
Clothes made with black - and - white checked fabric were the rage .
The B&O Railroad put dictionaries on all of its mainline trains for crossword - crazy commuters .
Crossword Casualties
Some folks were driven over the edge by the craze .
In 1924 , a Chicago woman sued her husband for divorce , claiming " he was so engrossed in solving crosswords that he did n't have time to work . "
The judge ordered the man to " limit himself to 3 puzzles a day and devote the rest of his time to domestic duties . "
In 1925 , a New York Telephone Co. employee shot his wife when she would n't help with a crossword puzzle .
And in 1926 , a Budapest man committed suicide , leaving an explanation in the form of a crossword puzzle .
( No one could solve it . )
Eventually , the craze died down .
It took The New York Times to revive it .
Today ,
The New York Times crossword puzzle is considered the puzzle of choice for hardcore addicts , but that has n't always been true .
Believe it or not , the Times resisted crosswords for more than two decades .
Here 's the story of how the newspaper changed its mind .
Hard Times
By the late 1930s , the crossword puzzle boom that started in 1924 had begun to fizzle - largely because the crossword puzzles in most newspapers had become predictable .
They constantly repeat boring clues like " Headgear " ( hat ) , " Writing instrument " ( pen ) and " Woody plant " ( tree ) .
But readers of The New York Times never got bored with their crossword puzzle … because the Times did n't have one .
Then , as now , the Times considered itself America's " newspaper of record " and the guardian of journalistic standards .
It scoffed at crossword puzzles as " a primitive form of mental exercise " in a1924 editorial , and refused to print them .
Eighteen years later , it was one of the last puzzle holdouts among America 's major newspapers .
All this and World War II Still , the Times had crossword puzzle fans on its staff .
Publisher Arthur Hays Sulzberger is said to have loved crosswords almost as much as he hated having to buy copies of the rival New York Herald Tribune in order to get them .
And as America teetered on the brink of war in the early 1940s , the mood at the paper began to change .
Less than two weeks after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941 , Lester Markel , the Times ' Sunday editor , dashed off a memo to his superiors suggesting that they consider adding a puzzle to the Sunday paper .
The pressures and demands of the war played heavily on his mind .
" We ought to proceed with the puzzle , " he wrote , " especially in view of the fact that it is possible that there will now be bleak blackout hours - or if not that , then certainly a need for relaxation of some kind of other …
We ought not to try to do anything essentially different from what is now being done - except to do it better . "
Markel had met with Margaret Petherbridge Farrar , senior crossword puzzle editor at Simon & Schuster , and he attached a memo from her :
The Herald Tribune runs the best puzzle page in existence so far , but they have gotten into a bit of a rut .
Their big puzzle never ventures even one imaginative definition , and lacks the quality that I believe can be achieved and maintained .
We could , I dare to predict , get the edge on them .
I do n't think I have to sell you on the increased demand for this kind of pastime in an increasingly worried world .
You can't think of your troubles while solving a crossword … Getting Started
The argument worked .
The Times hired Farrar away from Simon & Schuster and made her its crossword editor , a position she held until she retired in 1969 .
The first puzzle appeared on February 15 , 1942 , in the Sunday magazine section .
( Weekday puzzles were n't added until September 1950 . )
" The puzzle , " writes Times reporter Richard Shepard , " was an instant success . "
Under Margaret Farrar 's direction , the crossword " constructors " ( freelance puzzle makers ) developed a clever and elaborate style .
Instead of giving clues like " Stinging insect " ( bee ) and " Bird 's home " ( nest ) , they phrased them as " Nectar inspector " and " Nutcracker 's suite . "
The Times ' clever , whimsical style almost single - handedly ushered in a crossword renaissance , as newspapers all over the U.S. followed its lead .
Today , more than 90 percent of newspapers around the world have crossword puzzles , and , according to a study by the U.S. Newspaper Advertising Bureau , 26 percent of people who read newspapers regularly attempt to solve them .
Setting the Pace The New York Times crossword puzzle sets the standard that other puzzles follow .
Here are just some of the informal ( but strictly followed ) " rules " that were established by the Times ' example :
There can be no unkeyed letters - letters that appear in only one word of the puzzle .
Every single letter of the puzzle must be part of both a horizontal and a vertical word .
The black and white pattern must be " diagonally symmetrical . "
The black squares should not take up more than one - sixth of the total design .
The puzzle should n't have " dirty double - crossers " - that is , obscure words should not intersect one another .
Puzzling Facts
The Times estimates that it takes the average puzzler half an hour to solve the 15 - square - by - 15 - square daily puzzle , and two hours to solve the much larger Sunday puzzle .
The Times daily puzzles are designed to get progressively harder from Monday through Saturday .
The Saturday puzzle is nearly impossible for anyone but experts to solve .
The Sunday puzzle is even worse .
The paper figures that the weekend puzzles should be the hardest , because that 's when people have the most time to work on them .
Constructing the crossword puzzles take a lot more time than solving them .
" It takes me a day to make a Times Sunday puzzle , " says Maura B. Jacobson , one of the Times ' constructors .
" I spend at least 10 or 12 hours making definitions .
My research takes a day , then a day to get the words into the diagram to make them cross .
But the hardest is making the definitions . "
Making a puzzle that lives up to The New York Times standards is n't easy - Eugene Maleska , the paper 's crossword editor in 1992 , estimates that there are n't more than 600 people in the entire country skilled enough to do it .
And the puzzles have to be thoroughly edited before the go to press .
" I and all editors change about a third of the definitions , " Maleska told reporters in 1992 .
" I have a notebook filled with definitions so I do n't repeat them . "
The New York Times goes to great length not to offend anyone with its puzzles .
Words as innocuous as " bra " are forbidden , as are the names of illegal drugs .
Words such as " ale " and " rum " are considered to be at the extreme limit of good taste - they are permitted but are n't used often .

ActiveMerchant E-Book by Cody Fauser
By Peter Cooper
ActiveMerchant is a new e-book written by Cody Fauser and produced by Geoffrey Grosenbach 's PeepCode which , unsurprisingly , is about the Active Merchant Ruby library and Rails plugin ( past Ruby Inside reference ) .
Cody Fauser is a key developer on the Active Merchant project , so all the knowledge is from the " horse 's mouth , " as it were !
The Active Merchant library was initially developed as part of the Shopify e-commerce system , and is an excellent library for interacting with payment gateways from Ruby ( and Rails ) code .
It 's been in production use handling tens of thousands of payments since 2006 and it now has support for several payment gateways , including PayPal , Authorize .
Net , and TrustCommerce .
Cody 's e-book comes in PDF format and is immaculately produced with helpful diagrams , concise code snippets , and it proves incredibly easy to read on the screen while retaining the ability to give a good printed copy .
At 74 pages it goes into just the right amount of detail , and at $ 9 is a bargain for anyone wanting to get involved with processing payments and dealing with payment gateways from Ruby or Rails applications ( you 'll hopefully make that back on your first couple of payments ! )

It truly is a good e-book !
THE race for the White House has been a depressing experience for anyone foolish enough to have hoped for a rational debate about economic policy .
John McCain , who is at least in favour of free trade , admits to being an economic illiterate , while Hilary Clinton and Barack Obama have been united in their remorseless , largely baseless bashing of foreigners ( especially the Chinese ) and big business .
Ordinary Americans may be the main beneficiaries of global capitalism , but it is more likely to be celebrated in Beijing than on America 's hustings .
The topic that best showcases the candidates ' appalling economic cluelessness is the surge in oil prices .
American drivers are now paying well over $ 3 for a gallon of fuel .
Both Mr McCain and Mrs Clinton advocate a “ gas-tax holiday ” over the summer to ease the burden for drivers .
Neither of them bother to let their supposed concern for the environment affect their pandering .
They ought to delight in higher gas prices — indeed , they should be arguing vigorously for further increases to help wean Americans off their addiction to oil .
AP
Of course , none of the three candidates mentions to the American public that drivers in most European countries pay several times what Americans do for their petrol .
Mrs Clinton is typical of the three candidates in railing against everything from the American government 's ongoing purchases of oil for the country 's strategic reserve ( even though no expert thinks these make more than a tiny difference to the oil price ) to alleged manipulation of the price by energy traders .
True , Mrs Clinton may have greater expertise about trading than the typical politician , once having famously made a tidy profit during her brief , controversial foray into pork - belly futures .
But most experts doubt that speculators have driven up the price to its record highs , while almost everyone agrees that the traditional forces of supply and demand ( growing strongly , especially in the developing world ) and the plunging dollar have played major roles .
Besides , even if traders are to blame , it is not obvious what an American president could do to stop it , given that oil is an integrated worldwide market with a price set globally .
The policy likely to appeal most to Congress , and proposed by both Mrs Clinton and Mr Obama , is to levy a “ windfall tax ” on oil - company profits to punish them for the high price of oil .
No matter that this might simply be passed on to consumers in the form of even higher prices at the pump , there are several other reasons why most economists think windfall taxes are a bad idea .
At the margin , it would probably discourage oil companies from investing in expanding supply — something that , all things being equal , would help to lower oil prices .
The last time America tried a windfall tax , in 1980 , it generated far less revenue than expected ( though that would not necessarily be the case this time ) and required the creation of a vast bureaucracy with mountains of red tape .
Mrs Clinton 's other policy solution is more logical , though completely impractical .
One reason the oil price is so high is the existence of a cartel run by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) .
Unfortunately , breaking up that cartel is easier said than done .
Mrs Clinton , in a rare moment of enthusiasm for the institutions governing the global trading system , suggests action by the World Trade Organisation .
But it has jurisdiction over only a handful of OPEC members , and has so far given no indication that it can impose antitrust rules on what is , after all , a cartel made up of sovereign governments .
Over the years , various attempts to sue OPEC have been made under American antitrust law .
In 2007 , even Congress voted to sue OPEC for engaging in a “ price fixing conspiracy ” that has “ unfairly driven up the price ” of crude oil and , in turn gasoline .
This lawsuit would also have removed sovereign immunity that protects the governments in OPEC from prosecution or having their assets seized as punishment .
The trouble is , even if OPEC were found guilty of antitrust abuses in an American court , how would the cartel actually be punished or broken up ?
Ultimately , there is no way to secure compliance with America 's courts short of military action , which is one reason why even the Bush administration opposed last year 's Congressional vote .
But , if oil prices continue to rise and the election race remains close , how long before one of the presidential candidates proposes bombing OPEC , even though there could be no surer way to send oil prices soaring to new highs ?
Though they expect he would finish far closer to Obama in the popular vote , the thinking is that McCain could win by as many 50 electoral votes .
GOP strategists mull McCain ‘ blowout ’
It sounds crazy at first .
Amid dire reports about the toxic political environment for Republican candidates and the challenges facing John McCain , many top GOP strategists believe he can defeat Barack Obama — and by a margin exceeding President Bush ’s Electoral College victory in 2004 .
At first blush , McCain ’s recent rough patch and the considerable financial disadvantage confronting him make such predictions seem absurd .
Indeed , as Republicans experience their worst days since Watergate , those same GOP strategists are reticent to publicly tout the prospect of a sizable McCain victory for fear of looking foolish .

But the contours of the electoral map , combined with McCain ’s unique strengths and the nature of Obama ’s possible vulnerabilities , have led to a cautious and muted optimism that McCain could actually surpass Bush ’s 35 - electoral - vote victory in 2004 .
Though they expect he would finish far closer to Obama in the popular vote , the thinking is that he could win by as many 50 electoral votes .
By post - war election standards , that margin is unusually small .
Yet it ’s considerably larger than either Bush ’s 2004 victory or his five - electoral - vote win in 2000 .
“ A win by 40 or 50 electoral votes would be an astonishing upset , just a watershed event with all the issues that were stacked against him from the very beginning , ” said David Woodard , a Republican pollster and Clemson University political science professor .
“ But it could happen .
I know this seems like wishful thinking by Republicans .
I ’m thinking that Republicans could win by 40 electoral votes .
But I dare not say it , ” he added .
“ Certainly what is possible could come to pass . ”
A top strategist with the Republican National Committee , who asked that his name be withheld to speak candidly , explained that by his own examination , “ we ’re actually sitting pretty well in most states . ”
“ There are a lot of scenarios that look good for McCain , and I almost would go so far to say that there are a lot more scenarios [ than for Obama ] , ” the strategist added .
“ I do n’t think anybody over here wants to let themselves get too excited about it .
It is an eternity between now and November .
But McCain looks a lot stronger than our prospects as a party . ”
It is virtually impossible to find an established GOP strategist who believes McCain will win in a landslide .
But in light of the circumstances , more than a few Republicans are pleasantly surprised to find that McCain is at all situated to defeat Obama .
“ The broader environment clearly favors the Democrat , ” said Whit Ayers , another veteran GOP pollster .
But Ayers argued that “ a state - by - state analysis actually makes McCain a narrow favorite to win the Electoral College majority . ”
“ That would certainly run against the grain of history , if he pulled that off , ” Ayers added .
“ But it ’s also clearly plausible and a manageable outcome partly because of John McCain ’s strength among independents and partly because of Obama ’s weakness in culture , ideology and association . ”
Some Republican strategists can envision a scenario in which Obama wins the popular vote but loses in the Electoral College — he might galvanize Southern black turnout , for example , but still fail to switch a state in the region .
Among the 10 strategists interviewed by Politico for this story , there was near - uniform belief that had any other Republican been nominated , the party ’s prospects in November would be nil .
“ No disrespect to the other candidates , ” said GOP pollster Glen Bolger , “ but if anyone else had been nominated we ’d be toast . ”
The case they make for a comfortable McCain win is not beyond reason .
Begin with the 2004 electoral map .
Add Iowa and Colorado to Obama ’s side , since both are considered states Obama could pick off .
Then count McCain victories in New Hampshire and Michigan , two states where McCain is competitive .
In this scenario , McCain wins the Electoral College 291 - 246 , a larger margin than Bush four years ago .
If Obama managed only to win Iowa from Republicans and McCain managed only to win Pennsylvania , McCain would still win by a much greater margin than Bush — 300 - 237 .
“ McCain is in a remarkably strong position for how poor the political environment is right now , ” said Brian Nienaber , a GOP pollster .
“ McCain could win Pennsylvania , Ohio , Colorado and Nevada with a high Hispanic population .
It really does scramble the map of where Obama does find those electoral votes . ”
Naturally , Democrats do not concede the point .
But conversations with several Democratic strategists reveal that many acknowledge that the Republican scenarios are at least reasonable , though they say less likely to occur because Obama has the potential to dramatically alter the map , putting some nontraditional states in play at the same time .
The bottom line , though , is that McCain ’s ability to compete in some big industrial states offers a ray of hope in an otherwise dismal election cycle .
“ We have to hold Michigan and Pennsylvania .
McCain wins one of those states , we are in trouble .
They have to hold Florida and Ohio or they are trouble , ” Democratic pollster Paul Maslin said .
“ The truth about this race [ is ] , this is the year that we should n’t lose , and we could lose . ”
The GOP scenarios do not rely on some game - changing event but rather the possibility of Obama failing to overcome his own and his party ’s weaknesses .
Obama has long been thought by analysts to have a higher electoral vote ceiling as well as a lower floor than Hillary Clinton .
It is that potential Obama floor that increasingly occupies the minds of Republicans studying the map .
Even the potentially dramatic rise in turnout of African - Americans may only gain Obama 1 percentage point in many swing states , according to Maslin .
Yet Obama ’s weaknesses may end up neutralizing some of those relatively modest gains .
Since 1968 , Democrats have had a deficit with whites , particularly men .
Some Republicans believe that Obama may exacerbate those Democratic challenges , especially in key rural regions like Appalachia , struggle to win back Hispanics or some women , and dash Democratic prospects during their most favorable landscape in at least three decades .
“ There is a one in four shot that McCain can win an electoral majority in excess of 50 electoral votes , which by most recent standards would be a blowout , ” Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio said .
“ Considering where the Republican brand is right now , that ’s pretty phenomenal . ”
Update [ 2008-5-14 7:43:51 by DemFromCT ] :: Love the headline !
Dem beats Republican in a race that may predict November For Republicans , Davis ' defeat is viewed as a possible preview for a widespread GOP thrashing in November , and it shows that trying to link local Democrats in conservative districts to Sen.
Barack Obama and his former pastor was not a winning strategy .
The 2008 Republican brand is in deep , deep trouble .
As Al Hunt noted a few days ago :
With few other reeds , embattled Republicans see McCain as a lifeboat .
They know voters do n't like President George W. Bush or being in bed with sleazy special interests .
That 's the identity of the national party .
More than that , the Republicans are not trusted on any of the issues that matter to Americans .
How bad is it ?
Chris Cillizza dissected the recent ABC / WaPo poll a bit more and gleaned this :
A look at the presidential vote by region suggests a shift in political inclination is at work .
Not surprisingly , Obama holds his largest lead over McCain ( 18 points ) in the Northeast -- an area that has become increasingly dominated by Democrats in recent elections .
But , Obama also holds a lead in the traditional battleground area of the Midwest -- where Obama takes 54 percent to McCain 's 41 percent -- and in the Republican - leaning territory of the West where Obama holds a double - digit lead at the moment .
And , even in the South , where Republicans have dominated at the federal level for much of the past four decades , Obama is competitive ; McCain takes 49 percent to 45 percent for the Illinois senator .
While McCain trails by double digits in three of the four regions of the country , he actually far over performs his own party 's showing in the Post poll .
Asked which party they trusted to " do a better job of coping with the main problems the nation faces over the next few years , " voters across the country opted for Democrats by wide margins .
In the Northeast , Democrats outpaced Republicans by 29 points while the margin was 26 points in the Midwest .
The news was n't much better for Republicans in the West ( Democrats + 18 ) or the South ( Democrats +15 ) .
Those two sets of numbers provide clear evidence of two things : the Republican brand is badly damaged and McCain may be the GOP 's best ( and only ) chance to redefine it and win in November .
Know what else it means ?
The Republicans , under George W. Bush , have succeeded in remaking themselves from a national party into a regional party ( the South ) .
In that context , losing Hastert 's seat in IL - 14 is n't so much of a shocker , nor is it an isolated phenomenon .
" After three consecutive Special Election defeats in districts President Bush twice won easily , it is abundantly clear the American people have turned their back and shut the door on the special interest driven agenda of the Republican Party , " Van Hollen said .
" There is no district that is safe for Republican candidates because President Bush 's failed policies have hurt every community in America . "
House Minority Leader John Boehner said the election " should serve as a wake - up call to Republican candidates nationwide . "
" As I 've said before , this is a change election , and if we want Americans to vote for us we have to convince them that we can fix Washington , " Boehner said .
" Our presidential nominee , Senator McCain , is an agent of change ; candidates who hope to succeed must show that they 're willing and able to join McCain in a leading movement for reform .
MS - 01 , wherein Travis W. Childers ( D ) beat Greg Davis ( R ) , makes it 3 of 4 districts that now field a Democratic congressman in redder than red Mississippi ( 60 % Bush in 2004 ) .
That means that the GOP may be a regional party , but the Democrats just beat the Republicans in their own region .
No wonder no one wants to be a Republican .
The only way for McCain to win is to run away from the Republican brand .
But if he does that , he runs the risk of alienating the knuckle - draggers who ARE the Republican party , at least what 's left of them .
Running Green in Oregon ?
I do n't think so .
Running as a change agent in PA ?
Wait until we start talking about health care , and social security .
The Midwest ?
Wait until we focus on the economy .
And Republican George W. Bush is just so popular everywhere .
Hunt again :
The party 's fundamental situation is terrible : Republicans are saddled with an enormously unpopular president , a war , a troubled economy and a Democratic opposition that 's being energized by important constituent groups .
Frankly , I do n't think McCain can pull it off , nor will he have coattails .
This is not going to be a good year to be a Republican .
Thank you , George W. Bush , for ruining the brand .
It 's just the beginning of what history is going to credit you with .

New Doctor
Who episodes may be available for mobile phones
He announced plans for the MyBBCPlayer - which will allow viewers to legally download seven days of programmes - at the Edinburgh Television Festival .
He said he hoped the service would launch next year .
Mr Thompson said that unless the BBC adapted " we wo n't deserve or get licence - fee funding beyond 2016 ... that is very definitely not our plan " .
A simulcast of BBC One or BBC
Two , letting UK viewers see programmes on the web at the same time as they go out on TV , is also planned as part of MyBBCPlayer .
' Sophisticated ' viewers
" We believe that on - demand changes the terms of the debate , indeed that it will change what we mean by the word ' broadcasting ' , " said Mr Thompson .
" Every creative leader in the BBC is wrestling with the question of what the new technologies and audience behaviours mean for them and their service , " he added .
" An expanding portion " of the BBC 's audio and video material from the archive will also be able to be accessed via MyBBCPlayer .
" It should make it easier for users to find the content they want whenever and wherever they want it , " Mr Thompson said .
Mr Thompson said he hoped the MyBBCPlayer would launch next year
The popularity of the BBC's Bitesize revision series and Beethoven symphonies made available via the internet proves that viewers are already " very sophisticated in the use of this media , " he said .
In a departure from past corporation policy , the player would also enable viewers to buy items via the BBC site .
" The idea that in the age of the iPod that the public would not welcome the opportunity to buy a piece of music they heard on the site seems to me to be ridiculous , " he said .
Mr Thompson said he would be unable to estimate the cost of the MyBBC Player scheme until the government had confirmed a date for digital switchover - when all of the UK 's analogue TV signals will be switched off .
He also responded to Lord Birt 's James MacTaggart Memorial lecture , in which Lord Birt suggested that Channel 4 should receive extra funding to secure its status as a public service broadcaster .
Mr Thompson said this aim should not be achieved by giving the channel a share of the BBC 's licence fee .
" If you want to strengthen public service broadcasting , beginning to unpick the solidity of the BBC funding to shore up other channels is the wrong way to do it , " Mr Thompson said .
Proposals to make clips available on mobile phones are also being speeded up , director of TV Jana Bennett said last week .
The BBC received a " wake - up call " about the demand for new technology in March when the first episode of the new Doctor Who was leaked on to the internet , she said .
Internet debuts
A BBC spokesman said the corporation was aiming to simulcast a channel permanently but would restrict it to UK viewers only .
" These plans are subject to the approval of the board of governors and the resolution of rights clearance issues on content like music and imported shows , " he said .
As well as the simulcast plan , more shows are set to follow the lead of BBC Three comedy The Mighty Boosh and appear on the internet before TV .
Sketch show Titty Bang Bang , sitcom Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps and Johnny Vegas ' show Ideal will be made available on the internet first .
Clips from the shows will also be made available on mobile phones .
The makers of the new Doctor Who series are among the producers who have been developing ways to use mobile phone and portable players .
And extra content has been filmed for broadband to accompany BBC One 's autumn contemporary Shakespeare series .
