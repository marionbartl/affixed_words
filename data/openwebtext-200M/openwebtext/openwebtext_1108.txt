( CNN ) --
The battle raging over President Obama 's health care plan has spread from across the aisles in Congress to across the country .
A Tampa , Florida , health care reform meeting sparks noisy exchanges between attendees .
Senators this week joined their colleagues from the House at town hall meetings as they spent their August recess in their home districts .
But disruptive protests are turning town hall meetings into shouting matches and drowning out discussion over what is and is n't in health care plans in the House and Senate .
Videos of the protests have been circulating on the Internet , showing raucous crowds heckling their congressmen , and carrying posters with devil horns drawn on lawmakers ' heads , swastikas or Obama with Adolf Hitler 's mustache .

Rep. Lloyd Doggett , D - Texas , who had a town hall meeting disrupted by angry protesters earlier this month , said he had never experienced such emotion in his 15 years of holding such forums .
Democratic Rep. Brad Miller of North Carolina even had a death threat phoned into his office .
A caller said that if Miller supported Obama 's plan , it could cost him his life , Miller told CNN .
" Of course we want a full debate .
Of course we want people who have dissenting views from the administration and Congress to have a full hearing .
But that 's not what this is about .
That 's not the intent of most of these people .
It 's not the way the press is covering it , " Mark Halperin , editor - at - large and senior political analyst for TIME magazine , said on CNN's " Reliable Sources . "
The protesters ' gimmicks , Halperin said , are grabbing the public and media 's attention , and valid arguments over the cost and content of the proposals are being put on the back burner .
" There needs to be a debate in America on whether we should have universal health care .
There needs to be a debate on the president 's ideas .
If these protesters have ideas , great .
Let 's hear them .
But if they 're just stunts to cause a disruption that gets the media tripped in every time , again , I think it 's bad for the country whether you want the president 's plan or not , " he said .

Obama 's health care battle has been compared to former President Bill Clinton 's failed effort more than 15 years ago , but CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider said the climate toward health care reform was actually more negative back then .
Clinton 's plan had less public support than Obama's , and Clinton himself was less popular than Obama , Schneider said .
Clinton 's plan also barely got off the ground when it went to Congress , and Obama 's proposals have already been through a few congressional committees .
So why did n't lawmakers experience the same backlash during the Clinton years ?
" Three reasons , " Schneider said .
First of all , " the calendar . "
Clinton proposed his plan in September 1993 , and by the time Congress went on recess in August of the following year , the plan was dead .

Secondly , people did n't use the Internet the way they use it today , " so you did n't have the viral communications that rally people to attend town halls . "
And finally , experience .
" Conservatives are emboldened by what happened to the Clinton plan .
They want to relive 1994 , " Schneider said .
Democrats have accused conservative groups of manufacturing the outrage , while others say the uproar is a reflection of the opposition to Obama 's plans .
" These are average Americans that are concerned about this long litany of borrowing and spending and bailouts and government takeover of one industry after another .
And this government takeover of health care is just the last straw for many Americans , " Rep . Mike Pence , R - Indiana , told " Fox News " on Monday .
As the emotion has intensified , misinformation has spread about what is and is n't in current health care proposals .
" People are just getting information that 's flat wrong , " Sen .
Claire McCaskill , D - Missouri , told CNN on Monday as a town hall meeting she held came to an end .
One of the allegations that picked up traction in recent days is that Obama 's plan encourages euthanasia .
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin fueled the charge on her Facebook page Friday , writing that " the sick , the elderly , and the disabled " would suffer as doctors have to " ration care . "
In her post , the former Republican vice presidential candidate said Obama 's health care plan would create a " death panel " that would weigh whether her parents or son Trig were " worthy of health care . "
Former Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean told CNN on Sunday that Palin had deliberately fabricated the charges .
" About euthanasia , they 're just totally erroneous .
She just made that up , " he said .
" Just like the ' Bridge to Nowhere ' that she supposedly did n't support .
" There 's nothing like euthanasia in the bill .
I practiced medicine for a long time , and of course you have to have end - of - life discussions -- the patients want that .
... Euthanasia 's not in this bill . "
McCaskill said she hoped Monday that she was able to correct some of false information out there .
" The notion that I would ever , or that our government would ever do anything to cut short or dismiss the quality of life for our seniors is so offensive to me as an American .
...
There 's no rationing of health care that 's being proposed for our elderly , " she said .
" Hopefully , I was able to reassure people that -- not in America .
That 's not going to happen . "
In his weekend radio address , Obama sought to dispel what he called " the outlandish rumors that reform will promote euthanasia , cut Medicaid or bring about a government takeover of health care .
That 's simply not true . "
The White House on Monday launched what it calls a Health Insurance Reform Reality Check Web site designed to combat what the administration considers misinformation about the issue .
The Web page features Obama aides discussing various aspects of health care reform .

IT ’S NOT ABOUT THE UNINSURED ?….
Just for a moment , let ’s put aside the important discussions of specific provisions — public option , co-ops , mandates — of the health care reform debate .
Instead , let ’s consider why reform is worthwhile in the first place .
Why do reformers want reform ?
Painting with the broadest possible brush , there are two main reasons : ( 1 ) there are tens of millions of uninsured Americans who have no coverage , a moral outrage in the wealthiest nation in the world ; and ( 2 ) there are tens of millions who have been , could be , or will be screwed over by insurance companies , and they need some protections .
Whether you like the various proposals or not , this is why health care reform is on the table .
It ’s what reform is all about .
This is what it ’s always been about .
If only the leading Blue Dog on health care agreed .
Rep. Mike Ross ( D - Ark. ) said on Wednesday that providing healthcare to uninsured Americans is “ not what this healthcare reform debate is about . ”
In making his comments , Ross , who is the centrist Blue Dogs ’ health reform point man , questioned one of the primary healthcare goals of the White House and Democratic leaders .
“ That is a side benefit to healthcare reform and an important one , ” Ross told the Arkansas Educational Television Network .
Instead , the fifth - term congressman said the bill should focus on “ cost containment . ”
We ’re the only industrialized democracy on the planet that does n’t guarantee health care coverage for all of its citizens .
Tens of millions of Americans have no coverage , and half of all bankruptcies in the United States stem from health care expenses that destroy families financially .
Addressing this is a “ side benefit ” ?
For what it ’s worth , Ross identified specific provisions that would prevent him from voting for reform — forcing Americans who want a private insurer to take the public option , taxpayer subsidies for abortions , coverage for illegal immigrants , rationing , and deficit increases .
Depending on whether Ross is prepared to use Republican - friendly definitions of some of these phrases , it sounds like he should be able to support the Democratic proposal .

Swansea City 1 - 2 Scunthorpe United
CHAOS broke out at the Liberty Stadium as Swansea City crashed out of the Carling Cup against the backdrop of a bizarre refereeing performance .
Swans boss Paulo Sousa and his bench were left urging the fourth official to abandon the game as they were left with just SIX players on the field as the game entered its dying stages .
Swansea , who had already seen Garry Monk sent off for a clash of heads after 85 minutes , fell behind in extra-time after Alan Tate was penalised for a handball that brought huge protests from the home players .
But then Isle of Wight official James Limmington proceeded to send off both Gorka Pintado and Angel Rangel which , with goalscorer Stephen Dobbie already off with a suspected broken rib and all replacements used , left Swansea with just seven men and raging against the actions of the man in the middle .
New boy Bresian Idrizaj was also unfit to continue in the dying stages , while angry confrontations between the two benches broke out as officials failed to control the match .
But , as the dust settles , the real cost could soon become clear with Swansea facing a striker crisis before the weekend Championship clash with Watford with Pintado and Dobbie now seemingly unavailable .
Add in the fact Monk will face a three - game ban and it will leave Swansea with a shortage of centre - backs as Albert Serran remains sidelined with a knee injury .
That is the harsh reality after the unbelievable scenes of this Carling Cup second - round clash which both the FA , FAW and the referee ’s panel will surely have to investigate .
Swansea are already facing a charge of failing to control their players after the minor melee with Reading a week ago .
But that was nothing compared to the furious scenes here , initially sparked when Monk was given his marching orders with five minutes of normal time remaining and the scores deadlocked .
The Swans skipper had been involved in a head - to - head clash with Scunthorpe sub Michael O’Connor , Monk deserving his action for getting involved – yet O’Connor was surprisingly left unpunished .
And , as the game proceeded into extra-time , as Dobbie had cancelled out Niall Canavan ’s early opener with 11 minutes to go , things flared up as Tate was found guilty of the handball to allow Gary Hooper to score from the spot .
With Dobbie already off after taking a nasty kick in the ribs from Josh Wright , Pintado then went for a late tackle having already been booked for an innocuous aerial challenge moments earlier .
And then the red was flamboyantly waved at Rangel 60 seconds later as he was accused of swinging an elbow at Matt Sparrow , prompting the angry scenes on the touchline .
All this from a game that had offered so little in terms of action or entertainment early on .
Especially from Swansea ’s point of view , as it took far too long for a reshuffled rearguard to settle and solidify , by which time the hosts were a goal down .
Paul Hayes had caused the initial damage as he slammed a shot at young goalkeeper David Cornell at the near post , winning the corner that Canavan all - too - easily glanced home for a 13th - minute opener .
It would be wrong to suggest the effort from Swansea was n’t there .
Nathan
Dyer continued where he left off at Coventry by tracking and attacking with equal amounts of enthusiasm .
And fellow wideman Kerry Morgan was eager to impress once more , the Merthyr - born youngster rifling one shot from distance that had Scunthorpe stopper Joe Murphy concerned .
It was on the flanks that Swansea were finding some first - half joy , Rangel keen to get in on the act as the Iron refused to make more of the hosts ’ below - par start .
And , from one right - sided move , Jordi Lopez was able to display a brief moment of ability , turning crisply on the edge of the box and shooting smartly enough to bring a smothering save out of Murphy .
But , while Swansea were pressing fairly timidly for the leveller , it was Scunthorpe who should have scored once more , Marcos Painter misreading the play in his first start in 10 months after recovering from serious knee injury and allowing Justin Forte to centre , only for Martyn Woolford to scuff his shot .
Swansea , though , were refusing to really count their blessings and , despite growing into the game , they were not troubling the scoreboard .
Gorka Pintado , sluggish throughout , did not pounce on the crosses that were coming his way like the hungry striker he is supposed to be , while Chad Bond was also guilty of mis-controlling he ball at the crucial moment .
Bond would make way at the break to allow the introduction of Dobbie , Swansea and Sousa clearly keen to continue in the Carling Cup .
And some last - minute extra words of advice on the pitch before the restart must have had an impact with Dobbie forcing a save from Murphy as he worked his way to a shot at the far post .
And the Scot would again be involved following good work between Pintado and Rangel , shooting inches wide with the pressure building .
Fed by fellow sub Mark Gower , Dobbie smashed an effort against the bar on 76 minutes as Scunthorpe went into their shells and decided to try and hang on for the victory to make cup progress .
But it was denied when Dobbie , played through by new boy Idrizaj , lashed home the leveller with 11 minutes remaining to force extra-time .
The normal time drama was n’t over , however , as Monk saw red meaning Swansea would face the added 30 minutes with 10 men – yet Sousa refused to rein in his attacking formation with three players up front .
Before the end of the first period such good intentions would leave him with two men down , Dobbie the victim of a high challenge from Josh Wright that left the striker nursing what seemed like a rib injury .
But , as Swansea pressed , Hayes ’ shot was blocked by Tate leading to the penalty that Hooper slammed home , sparking the start of an incredible finish that will now almost certainly have repercussions for all three parties .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - JetBlue Airways Corp , which last week began offering a one - month unlimited travel pass , ended the sale early when the passes sold out before the promotion was set to expire , the airline said on Thursday .
The low - cost airline was offering $ 599 passes that allow holders to travel to any of JetBlue ’s 56 destinations .
The passes are valid between September 8 and October 8 .
The offer was set to expire on Friday .
“ We wanted to ensure those who bought the pass could get the flights they want , so we capped the number of passes we would sell , ” said JetBlue spokeswoman Jenny Dervin .
“ And we reached that number yesterday . ”
U.S. airlines , battered this year by an economic recession that has eroded travel demand , aim to bolster bookings in the fall with sales and creative marketing .
The Air Transport Association ( ATA ) , an industry trade group , this week predicted the number of passengers on U.S. airlines during the Labor Day holiday would fall 3.5 percent .
Planes are likely to be full , however , because of sweeping capacity cuts last year and this year at major airlines .
Shares of JetBlue were up 4 cents to $ 5.12 on Nasdaq in early trade .

A 22 - year - old Northern Territory man who bit his ex-wife 's ear off and blinded her in one eye has been sentenced in the Alice Springs Supreme Court today .
Selwyn Katakarintja was in breach of a domestic violence order when he went to the White Gate Camp in Alice Springs in January .
He bit part of his wife 's ear off , exposing the cartilage and punched her so hard her eyeball ruptured .
The court heard the assault came after she rejected his suggestion they should get back together .
He pleaded guilty to causing serious harm .
Justice John Mansfield described it as " a cowardly and stupid attack " and told Katakarintja he had to pay the price for such a devastating injury .
He convicted Katakarintja and sentenced him to three years and three months ' jail , suspended after eighteen months .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Sales under the U.S. government ’s “ cash for clunkers ” auto incentive topped 180,000 with Toyota Motor Corp overtaking Ford Motor Co with the top - selling vehicle , officials said on Wednesday .

Separately , a Senate vote on a $ 2 billion proposal to extend the popular program was set for Thursday after Democrats and Republicans agreed to consider seven possible amendments .
All seven are expected to be defeated , Democratic aides said , clearing the way for final passage of the measure passed last week by the House of Representatives .
“ There ’s a significant majority that wants to move forward with this legislation , ” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said before reaching an agreement with Republicans on how to proceed .
The White House supports the extension .
Transportation Department figures show federal reimbursements under the program , which offers rebates of up to $ 4,500 when consumers trade in older cars for new more fuel efficient ones , totaled $ 775.2 million .
The consumer response since dealers began offering “ clunker ” rebates in July has been overwhelming , government and industry officials say .
They expect sales already confirmed by the government and those completed by dealers but not yet through the regulatory pipeline will come close to exhausting the incentive ’s $ 1 billion budget .
More than 80 percent of vehicles traded - in were light trucks , including sport utilities , pickups and vans , while 59 percent of the new vehicles purchased were passenger cars , which as a class are more fuel efficient .
Toyota ’s Corolla sedan overtook the Ford Focus as the best - selling vehicle in the “ clunker ” program .
Toyota had two other passenger cars , the Prius hybrid and the Camry , in the top five .
The Honda Motor Co Civic was No. 3 .
Vehicles made by U.S. manufacturers accounted for all of the top 10 traded - in vehicles , which is to be expected since rebate terms require the older model get no more than 18 miles per gallon in most cases .
The “ clunker ” group included five light truck models made by Ford .
The list also included three Jeep and Dodge brands made by Chrysler and two GM Chevy models .
Increasing gas mileage and lowering tailpipe emissions are key goals of the program , which is mainly aimed at boosting U.S. sales overall and helping General Motors Co and Chrysler Group recover from bankruptcy .
New vehicles sold under the program average 25.3 miles per gallon while those traded - in got 18.5 mpg .
ATHLETICS WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS
Venue : Olympic Stadium , Berlin Date : 15 - 23 August
Coverage : Watch the action live and highlights on BBC Two , BBC HD , Red Button , Radio 5 live and the BBC Sport website ( video for UK users only )
Full BBC coverage details Triple Olympic champion Usain Bolt set a new world record as he stormed to a stunning victory in the 100 m at the World Championships in Berlin .
The 22 - year - old Jamaican recorded a time of 9.58 seconds to take 0.11 off the mark he set last year when winning gold at the Beijing Olympics .
American Tyson Gay was second in a time of 9.71 , with Jamaica 's Asafa Powell claiming bronze in 9.84 .
Britain 's Dwain Chambers came sixth in a season 's best time of 10.00 .
Bolt , who set three world records when winning his Olympic golds in Beijing last summer , served up another superlative display to enhance his reputation as the best sprinter of all time .

To take another 11 hundredths of a second off that defies logic , history and everyone else 's biology
In the final , he powered out of the blocks at the first time of asking and took control of the race within the first 30 m , the crowd going wild as he streaked across the line .
Bolt 's time represents the biggest increase in the record since electronic timing was introduced in 1968 .
" I was ready , I was feeling good after the semi-finals , " Bolt told BBC Sport .
" I knew it was going to be a great race and I came out and executed it .
It 's a great time .
I did well and I feel good in myself . "
Former world record holder Powell paid tribute to his compatriot , saying : " When I saw the time I had to try and catch him , but I could n't . "
Gay , who went into the final as the reigning world champion , has been troubled by a nagging groin pain and had to cut practice on his start .
" I ran the best I could but it was not enough , " he said .
" I believe I put in a championship performance and I am very pleased with the national record .
" I 'm happy he ran 9.5 because I knew he could do it .
I 'm happy for him . "
Chambers , back competing at the top level after serving a two - year ban for taking the designer steroid THG in 2003 , said the final was a " great experience " .
" It is hard to explain what it is like to go out there and stand on the line to compete with the best in the world , " said the 31 - year - old .
" It does not get easier as you get older but it is worth it . "
Earlier , there was controversy as Britain 's Tyrone Edgar was disqualified from the semi-finals .
After Bolt made the opening false start , Edgar was ruled to have transgressed the second time , although initial reaction times seemed to suggest that decision was harsh .
" I do n't think it was a false start , " said the 27 - year - old Edgar , who was also disqualified at the London Grand Prix last month .
" To me it looked pretty good but there is nothing I can do .
I am not going to argue the point .
I am disappointed right now because I reckon I would have made the final . "

Windows 7 ( Final ) vs. Windows Vista VGA game performance analysis
ATI and NVIDIA -- Single versus Multi-GPU .
Last week Microsoft released the final build ( RTM ) version of Windows 7 to MSDN members , yes Windows 7 has gone gold , though you as a consumer might have to wait a while longer ( October ) for you to be able to upgrade to Windows 7 .
MSDN members already have access to the final build and as such can prepare and migrate to the new Operating system .
Guru3D received a couple of licenses and as such we started to install our test systems with Windows 7 Professional edition , and we were curious .
See , when Windows Vista was released we consumers ran into a stack load of driver issues .
I remember Catalysts received WHQL status , yet the drivers secretly missed out on half of their functionality .
But it was n't as bad as NVIDIA , no Sir. NVIDIA arrived on the scene with their Windows Vista driver massively late and under - developed .
In fact " VISTA GEFORCE CRASH " was one of the most popular Google search combos at that time .
Credit where credit is due , once the press started to really tackle the issues NVIDIA and ATI were both nearly ready with some proper drivers .
Initially though , overall game performance was still lacking opposed to Windows XP with a 10 ~ 15 % performance differential .
The bugs and negative performance impact was one of the many things that made Windows Vista spin into a negative spiral , from which for the bigger part , Microsoft never recovered .
It 's a branding stigma similar to say the TLB bug that haunted AMD with the first Phenom release .
Fact remains that over time all these issues ironed themselves out , and to date I consider Windows Vista to be a lovely platform to work and game with .
But now there is the pending release of Windows 7 ; roughly two months ago I had already been contacted by parties like NVIDIA and AMD asking if we wanted to test their drivers with the Windows 7 Beta .
I refrained form that offer as I strongly felt it makes no sense whatsoever to publish results based on a beta driver with a beta operating system .
Last week Microsoft released the RTM build of Windows 7 , this is the final build that is going gold .
With ATI and NVIDIA releasing Windows 7 compatible drivers for a while now , we figured now's a good time to see how well game graphics performance is on Windows 7 and how stable the platform actually is .
The good news is that both ATI and NVIDIA for the Windows 7 release did their homework this time around .
As such in this article we will check out the current Windows 7 drivers , look at performance in - between Windows Vista and Windows 7 and look at stability .
We can already say that not only do we like Windows 7 very much , but also the VGA drivers are extremely mature and performance is actually right on par with the latest Vista drivers .
Let 's start off this article , with a VGA performance overview in - between Windows Vista 64 - bit and Windows 7 64 - Bit .
WASHINGTON , D.C. , August 24 , 2009  -- Susan Burke supported the Democratic candidate , Barack Obama , during the 2008 US presidential campaign .
But now that Obama is in office , she finds her views diverging widely from his .
Obama is opposed to investigating the excesses of the administration of his predecessor , former President George W. Bush .
Burke , an attorney , favors an investigation .
Obama has thus far avoided answering the question of whether the US Constitution was violated in Bush 's so - called " war on terror . "
Burke wants an investigation to focus on precisely this question .
Obama is looking forward , while Burke is looking back .
What Burke sees when she looks into the rearview mirror is indeed ugly .
She sees 17 dead , including women and children , lying on Nisoor Square in Baghdad , killed on Sept. 16 , 2007 by mercenaries working for Blackwater , a private American security firm .
She sees Blackwater employee Andrew Moonen who , after a Christmas party in 2006 , drove through Baghdad , heavily armed , and shot a man for no reason .
She hears the shot , fired from a Blackwater helicopter , that killed an innocent man on Baghdad 's Wathba Square on Sept. 9 , 2007 .
But most of all , Burke sees Erik Prince , Blackwater 's founder and former owner .
In her suit , she refers to him as a " modern - day merchant of death , " and she alleges that the 40 - year - old created a " culture of lawlessness and unaccountability " at Blackwater , where the " excessive and unnecessary use of deadly force " was commonplace .
In her motion , Burke also accuses Blackwater of war crimes .
The US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia , in Alexandria , Virginia , will now decide whether to take on Burke 's civil suit .
Committed In the Name of America
The political world will also have to make some decisions .
The first question is whether the US government will make public on Monday the most comprehensive report to date on the treatment of terrorism suspects .
That alone would trigger a political hurricane in Washington , says former CIA Director Porter Goss .
It would also make it much more difficult for the government to rebuff calls for it to finally investigate all the alleged illegal activity carried out in the fight against terrorism .
It was not until the end of June that US Attorney General Eric Holder read the report , which was prepared by the CIA 's inspector general in 2004 .
But then he spent a full two days in his office in Washington D.C. studying the document .
When he had finished reading it , he apparently stood at the window for a long time , staring out at Constitution Avenue .
Horrified over what had been done in the name of America , Holder looked into the possibility of appointing a special prosecutor .
Sources in Washington say that he has now achieved his goal , which puts him more squarely in Burke 's camp than Obama's .
Blackwater characterizes Burke 's accusations as " scandalous and baseless , " and claims that the cases she cites were isolated incidents .
According to Blackwater attorneys , " no diplomat under the protection of this service died or even was injured during the entire duration of the contract . "
Symbol of an Era
Prince , who earlier in his career claimed to have " the heart of a warrior , " is intent on preventing the civil suit from going to trial .
To that end , he has hired a team of lawyers working for the law firm of Mayer Brown , which also represents 89 companies on Fortune magazine 's list of the top 500 US companies ranked by revenues .
Peter
White , the head of the Mayer Brown team , plans to convince the judges in Alexandria this week that the Blackwater case is n't a case at all .
In his written response to Burke 's lawsuit , White argues that any public disclosure of Blackwater 's methods would endanger its personnel in war zones , and her suit should be dismissed .
White also argues that if there is any culpability , it rests with the individuals who committed the acts in question , not the entire company .
He points to unsuccessful lawsuits that were filed against US corporations after the Vietnam War , including the case of Vietnamese plaintiffs who tried and failed to sue the US multinational corporation Dow Chemical , the manufacturer of the defoliant Agent Orange .
In one respect , the comparison is apt : Blackwater has become a symbol of an entire era , just as Agent Orange was a potent symbol of the Vietnam War .
Outsourcing War
After the al - Qaida attack on the World Trade Center on Sept. 11 , 2001 , Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney began using large numbers of private security contractors for the first time .
The mercenaries were intended to make up for a lack of manpower , especially in the area of personal security , as well as to perform the dirty work , such as interrogating detainees , thereby leaving US military personnel untainted .
Erik Prince 's company turned into an empire practically overnight , collecting more than $ 1 billion ( €700 million ) in revenues from US taxpayers .
Seventy percent of Blackwater 's contracts with the government were no -bid contracts .
The company 's most important personnel , its fighters , who were known internally as " shooters , " were recruited around the world , including from places like the Philippines and Latin America .
In 2007 , the company proudly changed its name to Blackwater Worldwide .
The advantage of privatizing the war was obvious for the Bush administration .
Blackwater contractors are cheaper than regular US soldiers .
When they were killed , their widows received only minor compensation , while the US military pays lifelong survivor benefits .
Besides , Blackwater employees died quietly -- in other words , they were never part of the official death statistics , which was convenient for the president .
With the end of the Bush administration , Blackwater received fewer contracts and the company changed its name to Xe Services .
But its founder 's most determined adversary , Susan Burke , continued her fight .
' A Christian Crusader '
Burke now plans to call 40 witnesses to testify against Prince .
If the court agrees to hear her suit on Friday , eyewitnesses to the various killings will be summoned from Baghdad .
In the United States , Burke , who made a name for herself defending detainees subjected to abuse at Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad , will ask the court to subpoena several former Blackwater employees , including a former executive .
Two affidavits that have been filed in the Alexandria court contain serious allegations against company founder Erik Prince .
The men who signed the affidavits , fearing that their lives could be put in danger if their identities were revealed , are identified anonymously as John Doe 1 and John Doe 2 .
In his affidavit , John Doe 1 , who served in Iraq , writes that he " personally observed multiple incidents of Blackwater personnel intentionally using excessive and unjustified deadly force . "
John Doe 2 , who worked for Prince , writes that the former head of Blackwater " views himself as a Christian crusader tasked with eliminating Muslims and the Islamic faith from the globe . "
He claims that company employees treated the killing of Iraqis as sport .
The Blackwater attorney questions the validity of these witnesses , saying that much of what they claim is based on hearsay .
The fact that the witnesses are remaining anonymous , says
White , makes it impossible to verify their credibility .
He calls the tactics " unfair " and highly prejudicial to defendants .
But the key witnesses ' fear of retaliation is considerable , which also has something to do with the fact that Prince has powerful friends in the government , particularly inside the CIA .
Assassination Teams and Extraordinary Renditions
In addition to working for government departments , Blackwater also worked directly for the intelligence agency , as the new CIA director recently confirmed in a closed - door hearing in the US Congress .
And in a memo SPIEGEL has obtained , two other former employees describe , for the first time , the details of this covert collaboration .
The two informants are referred to as " Source A " and " Source B " in the internal memo .
According to Source B , Blackwater , working on behalf of the CIA , flew terror suspects from Guantanamo to Pakistan , Afghanistan and Uzbekistan , where the detainees apparently faced " special treatment " in secret prisons .
The intelligence service commissioned Blackwater and its subsidiaries to transport terror suspects from Guantanamo to interrogations at secret prison camps in Pakistan , Afghanistan and Uzbekistan .
The paper identifies aircraft movements and unveils how the flights were disguised .
The memo reads : " The CIA hired Blackwater to conduct extraordinary renditions " and " Blackwater flew the rendition targets from Fort Perry and Cuba to Kandahar , Afghanistan . "
' The CIA Hired Blackwater '
According to the informant , some of the flights were provided by two other companies Prince owned , Presidential Airways and Aviation Worldwide , which were given special clearance in 2003 by the US Defense Department to conduct such flights .
Source B even knew the tail numbers of the aircraft that were allegedly involved : N962BW , N964BW and N968BW .
The flights also involved Satelles Solutions , another Prince subsidiary , which operates a training and recruitment camp in the Philippines designed to accommodate about 1,000 soldiers .
According to Source A , Blackwater also helped out the CIA with another controversial activity during the Bush years .
In the memo , Source A writes : " The CIA hired Blackwater to conduct targeted killings in Afghanistan . "
In June Leon Panetta , Obama 's new CIA director , told lawmakers in a closed - door hearing on Capitol Hill about a secret program to kill or capture al - Qaida operatives that was begun eight years ago .
The purpose of the so - called assassination program was to recruit and train special forces to assassinate senior al - Qaida leaders .
Authority to Kill
According to Panetta , Cheney asked the CIA not to disclose the covert program to Congress .
The argument that was used at the time was that when combating terrorism , the CIA has the authority to kill without special congressional approval .
The program , however , never quite went beyond the training phase , according to CIA testimony before the US Senate .
The memo by the two sources gets more specific .
Source A names five people who were allegedly involved in the development of assassination teams , including a man who left Blackwater in mid-2005 and last worked as the head of the Blackwater 's OGA division .
The acronym stands for " Other Government Agencies , " which included the connection to the CIA .
The other men on the source 's list are a former member of Blackwater 's paratrooper unit , an employee of Blackwater Security Consulting who , according to the memo , was designated as a " hit man " within the unit and Alvin Bernard Krongard , the most senior employee on the list , who the source claims was responsible for assembling the teams .
" Krongard set up the teams , " the paper claims .
But the memo does not specify whether agreements were made with individuals or the company itself , or what Krongard 's role was exactly .
The latter is particularly difficult to determine , given that Krongard has worked on both sides of the desk .
From March 2001 to September 2004 , Krongard served as the CIA 's executive director , under then - CIA Director George Tenet .
After leaving office , he switched to the private sector , joining Blackwater 's advisory board .
' We Are Not Inclined to Comment '
SPIEGEL confronted the company , the CIA and Krongard with the contents of the memo last Wednesday , but they had declined to comment by Friday .
A CIA spokesman was unwilling to confirm or deny cooperation with Blackwater with regard to the assassination program or the secret detainee transports .
" We do not comment on our contractual relationships , " the spokesman said .
He did note , however , that the details of the memo included " mistakes , " although he chose not to elaborate .
Stacy DeLuke , the spokeswoman of Xe Services ( as Blackwater is now called ) , answered in an e-mail : " Due to the sensitive nature of these allegations , we are not inclined to comment at this time . "
Krongard 's assistant Cathy Davis said : " I received your e-mail and confirm receipt by Mr. Krongard as well , " but did not respond to questions about Krongard 's role .
The allegations have triggered growing unease on Capitol Hill , where senators want to know more about the covert assassination program .
Last Friday , it was also revealed that Blackwater assisted in drone attacks in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
In a letter to fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton , Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky urged the secretary of state " not to enter into further contracts with Xe and to immediately review any existing contracts . "

The rise in calls may be because boys feel less pressure to be macho A record number of boys called the children 's counselling service ChildLine last year - double the amount seeking help five years ago .
More than 58,000 boys phoned the charity in 2007 / 8 with problems ranging from loneliness to violent abuse .
Most calls to ChildLine are from girls - but during the past five years the proportion made by boys rose from one in every five to one in every three .
Boys are most likely to call about bullying , with 12,568 cases last year .
Head of ChildLine Sue Minto said : " Desperate boys call because they feel they have no - one to turn to .
" It 's heartbreaking to hear their stories of rape and violent beatings , often by their parents . "
She continued : " There 's still the stigma that boys do n't cry but it may be there 's no longer so much pressure to be macho .
" They sometimes suffer in silence for months - by the time they call us they can be suicidal . "
The calls included one from a 14 - year - old boy who said : " My dad hits me with a belt as punishment .
" This happens once or twice a month and leaves marks for days . "
Vivid memories
Another boy , 17 , told a counsellor : " I was sexually abused by a relative when I was a child .
" I have very vivid memories - I still feel angry that it ever happened . "
WHY BOYS RING CHILDLINE
The most common concerns of boys calling in 2007/ 8 : Bullying , 12,568 calls Physical abuse , 6,403 calls Family problems , 6,016 calls Facts of life , 5,362 calls Sexual abuse , 4,780 calls Sexuality , 3,510 calls Loneliness , 1,817 calls Rape , 1,803 calls
Rise in calls from Scots boys Alex Gray , a ChildLine counsellor , said : " Sometimes you have to work hard to get boys to talk about what 's really troubling them .
" But once they do they 're surprised that someone 's there listening to them . "
ChildLine was launched in 1986 to provide youngsters with free and confidential advice .
It is run by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children ( NSPCC ) .
Children 's Minister Delyth Morgan said : " ChildLine is a vital resource for thousands of children and that is why the government is providing £ 30 m to support the expansion of the NSPCC helpline .
" Bullying must be stamped out and bullies must be made to understand the harm they have been doing . "

STUCK : An inquisitive cub finds out that yummy snacks can come at a price .
It was not quite a honey pot like in Winnie the Pooh , but an inquisitive bear cub in Wisconsin was spotted with a bird feeder stuck on its head .
A landowner in the northwestern part of the state told the state Department of Natural Resources about the cub .
But the mother was so protective that DNR officers could n't get near the young bear , who was still able to climb a tree .
When the DNR finally set out a live trap it caught both the cub and the mom .
The feeder was found in pieces next to them , possibly chewed apart by the mom .
Both bears were released into the woods .

GAO : Major Security Flaws at Federal Buildings
By Ed O'Keefe
The police agency in charge of protecting thousands of federal buildings nationwide has failed to keep bomb - making materials out of several high - security facilities in the past year , according to Congressional testimony provided by Senate aides .
In the past year , investigators successfully smuggled bomb - making materials into ten high - security federal buildings , constructed bombs and walked around the buildings undetected , exposing weaknesses in security provided by the Federal Protective Service .
More than one million government employees work in 9,000 facilities guarded by FPS around the country , including at least 350,000 in the Washington region .
The revelations come as the Obama administration prepares to reorganize the agency in the coming weeks .
Investigators carried liquid explosives and low - yield detonators -- materials investigators note are not normally carried into federal buildings .
The GAO said security concerns prevent it from revealing the exact locations or cities of the affected facilities , but that eight of them were government owned , while two were leased .
They included offices of a U.S. senator and House member , as well as offices for the departments of Homeland Security , Justice and State , the GAO reported .
In one instance , the GAO obtained a building security tape showing an investigator walking through a security checkpoint with bomb making materials .
In the past , security experts have criticized some GAO investigators for publicizing sensational findings or " sting " operations that are not based on intelligence - driven risk assessments .
Investigators for the Congressional auditing agency stress however that they followed generally accepted government standards with this round of testing .
" It is simply unacceptable that federal employees working within buildings under FPS ’ protection , and the visitors who pass through them , are so utterly exposed to potential attack by terrorists and other enemies , " Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) said in a statement .
He chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee , which will hold a hearing on the findings tomorrow .
" We knew that the FPS was a troubled agency , but that GAO could penetrate security at these buildings and make bombs without detection is truly shocking . "
“ American taxpayers are simply not receiving the security we pay for and should expect the Federal Protective Service to provide , " said Sen. Susan Collins ( R - Maine ) , the panel 's ranking Republican .
The agency will review all of its security and training procedures in the next two months and will perform more drills to test for potential vulnerabilities , according to director Gary W. Schenkel 's prepared testimony for tomorrow 's hearing .
FPS has 1,200 full - time employees and roughly 13,000 contract guards deployed at 2,300 of the 9,000 federal facilities .
It uses security cameras and perimeter lighting to help protect the other locations .
The findings revealed today are consistent with other recent investigations into the agency 's performance .
An April Homeland Security inspector general report faulted its contracting processes , while a 2008 GAO survey found the agency so short - staffed it exposed buildings to risk of terrorist attacks .
FPS has existed as a bureaucratic hot potato in recent years , moving from the General Services Administration to the Department of Homeland Security in 2003 .
There it became part of Immigration and Customs Enforcement , which most observers agree was a bad move .
The transition also cost the agency hundreds of millions of dollars in annual subsidies , forcing it to reduce staff and depend more on contract guards .
Legislation passed last year once again boosted staffing levels .
The DHS appropriations bill under consideration this week moves FPS once again from ICE to the National Protection and Programs Directorate , a collection of divisions tasked with assessing security risks .
The White House announced its support for the move today , saying it will provide more details on the reorganization in the coming weeks .

Procrastination is something most people have had to deal with at some point in their lives .
We put things off , especially things that are boring , lengthy , drudgery , or might challenge us in some unexpected or unforseen way .
It ’s not that we do n’t think we can do it ( although for some people , that ’s indeed a thought that enters their mind ) ; it ’s more often the case that we know we can do it , we just do n’t want to .
Procrastination can be beaten through some simple tips — by becoming more aware of the self - defeating thoughts you ’re telling yourself about doing the task , and by becoming better organized .
Although the tips are easy , putting them into use takes practice and repetition .
Do n’t get discouraged if you do n’t succeed at first ; just try it again .
Take charge over your procrastination with these tips :
1. Know how long it takes .
Sometimes we do n’t do something because we imagine it will take much longer than it actually does .
This false belief keeps us from even starting something .
It is usually easy to estimate the actual amount of time it takes to complete a task by simply keeping track of the amount of time spent on tasks just once .
For example , if you track that it takes you approximately 5 hours of study time to get a good grade on a history exam , you can use that information for helping to better schedule your study time on future exams .
2 . No time like the present .
You will be no better motivated in the future than you are right now , at this very moment .
This common fallacy leads many people who procrastinate to simply putting off things into the future when they ’re in “ the right mood . ”
Your ability to be successful at any task is not dependent upon your mood .
Sometimes we have to do something we do n’t like to do , even if we do n’t feel like it , just to get it done .
3. Challenge irrational thoughts and cognitive distortions in a daily journal .
A lot of the things we tell ourselves to put off doing something are actually one of the common cognitive distortions .
Challenging your thoughts and beliefs about how you work and how to best complete a task is something you should get in the habit of doing on a daily basis .
It is sometimes helpful to people to keep a little journal of your thoughts that need to be challenged , as well as a rational response to the thought .
4 . All tasks can and should be broken down into parts .
Tasks are usually easier when we break them down into smaller , more digestible parts .
You do this by setting smaller milestones , dates when certain parts of that task should be completed .
For instance , writing a paper might have 5 or 6 milestones : ( 1 ) select topic ; ( 2 ) research topic ; ( 3 ) organize notes into a paper outline ; ( 4 ) write rough draft ; ( 5 ) have friend review ; ( 6 ) write final draft and review .
Each one of these should be noted in the organizer with a due date .
Cleaning out the garage might be : ( 1 ) organize stuff into piles of ( a ) to store and organize in garage , ( b ) throw out , ( c ) find place in house , and ( d ) take to storage ; ( 2 ) processing the piles ; ( 3 ) take trash to dump ; ( 4 ) sweep out clean garage .
5 . Work backwards from a due date .
Some things are easier to organize and beat procrastinating about than others .
Things with a due date — like a project , a big presentation , meeting or exam — are usually the easiest .
Start by working backwards from the due date .
Use the information gathered from “ know how long it takes ” and breaking a task down into parts to set a weekly backwards countdown of specific parts of the task and the day that part needs to be completed by .
In this way , you ’ll know exactly where you stand every day and week .
6 . Keep track of it all in an organizer ( or organizer app ) .
Some people find an organizer ( or organizer app ) can be an invaluable tool in helping keep themselves on - task on a daily basis .
But organizers are not just for projects , appointments , classes or meetings .
Note holidays , times you need to set aside for other social activities , other professional appointments , and dates that impact your work ( or school ) schedule .
Sometimes people leave these things out of their organizer , forgetting that a trip to visit some far away friends could easily impact their study time a day or two ahead of time as they have to pack , make arrangements for their pets , etc. Schedule social time ?
You bet .
If scheduling your life and being better organized helps you get more things done , then it ’s a beneficial tool that you should use .
7 . Keep a daily to - do list .
Some people hate them , some people can’t live without them .
For most procrastinators , it ’s a good idea to keep a to - do list every day of things that should be accomplished for both the day and the week .
Even if you have to write a new one every day , keeping such a list will go a long ways to keeping your procrastination under control .
8 . Start every day with a review of your day , week and to - do list .
At the start of every day , make it a habit to begin your day by opening to that day in your organizer and reviewing not only that day ’s tasks or appointments , but also review the entire week .
If it ’s a Friday , look to next week in case there are any deadlines on the following Monday .
Keep your to - do list updated — cross things off that are done , add things you need to do in the future , and rewrite the list once a week ( or better yet , keep it all electronically organized on your cell phone or the like ) .
9 . Keep your schedule up - to - date .
A schedule is only as good as it is current .
Mark due dates in your appointment book the first moment you are aware of them ( such as a new appointment , a date with a friend or your significant other , a meeting , or a project deadline ) .
Sometimes people get lost or confused by keeping an organizer because they do n’t take the time or effort necessary to maintain it and keep it updated .
Get into the habit of doing it , and it ’ll become second nature within a few weeks .
10 .
Take back control and reward yourself when you finish a task .
Procrastination is a means of letting our assignments , projects , meetings and due - dates get the better of us .
Instead of being in control of our lives , we let our life ’s responsibilities take control of us .
By combatting procrastination head - on with tools and strategies , you ’re taking back control of your own life .
The feeling of having this renewed sense of control can be empowering and re-energize you , even allowing you to consider taking on more in the future .
A part of feeling empowered is also to reward yourself when you complete a task .
Because life is n’t simply about getting things done , but enjoying the process too .
Even if you ca n’t enjoy every task needing to be done , you can at least enjoy the sweet success of completing it with a token reward ( such as buying yourself a small gift , indulging in something you would n’t ordinarily eat , etc. ) .
It also gives you something to look forward to in completing the next task on your list .

The Cassini -Huygens mission is , at this point , one of the most abundant sources of information about celestial bodies in the solar system , alongside the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ( MRO ) , and the rovers Spirit and Opportunity .
A decade ago , the space probe was last seen orbiting the Earth , as it made a fly - by to boost its speed enough to get to Saturn as fast as possible .
Mission planners and controllers at NASA , ESA and the Italian Space Agency are currently celebrating the achievement , and they have reason to be joyful – the mission has been already extended over its planned duration .
Although it was launched in October 1997 , the space probe did not leave the inner solar system until August 1999 .
The reason for that was that it did not have sufficient speed to make the trip to the second largest inhabitant in the system in a period of time smaller than a decade .
So , it turned to the slingshot effect , and carried out a total of four fly - by maneuvers , two around Venus , one around the Earth and another one later on , around Jupiter .
The Earth phase was sufficient to boost its speed by about 5.5 kilometers per second ( or about 12,000 miles per hour ) .
Overall , the four in - flight moves boosted the probe 's speed by more than 21.44 kilometers ( 13.64 miles ) per second , enough to get it to Saturn within five years .
It reached its destination on June 30th , 2004 , when it was successfully captured by the gas giant 's gravitational pull .
Since then , it has been constantly beaming back a wealth of information about the planet , its moons and moonlets , as well as its rings .
It is responsible for everything we know now about Titan and Enceladus , and it led astronomers to find that methane existed on the former , and ice on the latter .
It has also discovered a large number of other bodies orbiting the planet , which are so small that they were detected only by their shades .
The craft also used its spectrometers to analyze the gas giant 's rings for traces of ice and dust , and determined that Enceladus spewed ice through its volcanoes outside its atmosphere , and into the rings .
The main instruments on Cassini include :
Optical Remote Sensing
Mounted on the remote - sensing pallet , these instruments study Saturn and its rings and moons in the electromagnetic spectrum .
Composite Infrared Spectrometer ( CIRS ) .
Imaging Science Subsystem ( ISS ) .
Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph ( UVIS ) .
Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer ( VIMS ) .
Fields , Particles and Waves
These instruments study the dust , plasma and magnetic fields around Saturn .
While most do n't produce actual " pictures , " the information they collect is critical to scientists ' understanding of this rich environment .
Cassini Plasma Spectrometer ( CAPS ) .
Cosmic Dust Analyzer ( CDA ) .
Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer ( INMS ) .
Magnetometer ( MAG ) .
Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument ( MIMI ) .
Radio and Plasma Wave Science ( RPWS ) .
Microwave Remote Sensing
Using radio waves , these instruments map atmospheres , determine the mass of moons , collect data on ring - particle size , and unveil the surface of Titan .
Radar .
Radio Science ( RSS ) .
The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA , the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency .
The Cassini orbiter was designed , developed and assembled at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , in Pasadena , California .
The JPL manages the mission for the Science Mission Directorate at the NASA Headquarters in Washington .

Android is an open platform , but watch out :
It includes a lot of proprietary apps , including Google's .
A popular Android hacker found out the hard way when he received a cease - and - desist letter from Google for his latest modification of the Android OS .
Steve Kondik , also known as " Cyanogen " , has been distributing a version of the Android firmware that includes multitouch and other capabilities not included in the base version .
Google took exception to his inclusion of code owned by the search giant and sent him a cease - and - desist letter demanding that he stop distributing it .
Kondik 's story created an uproar within the Android community and raised questions about how much the Android OS relied on closed - source applications for its functionality .
That 's because the base of the platform is indeed open source , but without the applications that run on top of it , it 's not very useful to consumers .
However , the controversy has sparked constructive discussions about the future of Android , and has even motivated Google to extend a helping hand to independent developers .
In 2007 , Google , along with 47 other companies , formed the Open Handset Alliance to oversee the first free , open mobile platform to accelerate innovation in the mobile ecosystem .
The Android Open - Source Project became the platform of OHA , allowing enthusiast developers to freely contribute and improve the mobile experience for others .
Google stated Kondik was illegally distributing closed - source applications within his revamped Android OS .
These closed - source applications include Gmail , Maps , gTalk , YouTube , Market , Contact Sync and other essential services – what many people , perhaps naively , may consider to be the heart of the OS .
Google 's legal action most likely stemmed from the latest CyanogenMOD update , which included Google 's not - yet - released upgrade to the Android Market .
An excerpt from a statement on the official Android Developer blog clarified the line between Android and Google 's proprietary applications :
" These apps are Google ’s way of benefiting from Android in the same way that any other developer can , but the apps are not part of the Android platform itself , " Google 's Dan Morrill said on the company 's developer blog .
The situation even irked an engineer within Google , Jean Baptiste Queru , who tweeted , " To my Apple , Microsoft and Palm buddies : are you hiring to work on mobile stuff ? "
However , Queru later moved the discussion in a more constructive direction , tweeting a link to a Google Group post where he calls on the Android community to help improve Android , asking " Who 's with me ? "
The Android engineers at Google are now making available previously unreleased components – makefiles and configuration files – that will give independent developers the ability to create Android releases in the same manner that Google does , but without using Google 's proprietary apps .
These engineers are working with volunteers from the community and have already begun working on alternatives to the proprietary Google applications .
Meanwhile , other developers have formed a new group , the Open Android Alliance and they , too , are working on building alternatives to Google 's applications .
Eventually , these tools should allow developers to create working versions of Android that work " out of the box , " something that is currently very difficult to do .
According to Kondik 's latest blog post , he is working around the setback by building a backup tool that will let users of vanilla Android distributions save a copy of their existing applications .
Then , after installing Kondik 's Cyanogen mod , they can restore their apps and continue using them – without having downloaded them from Kondik 's site .
" There are lots of things we can do as end - users and modders , though , without violating anyone 's rights .
Most importantly , we are entitled to back up our software , " Kondik wrote .

On some days , I wake up and truly believe the world as we know it is going to end .
As the government funnels money upwards towards the rich , and outwards towards endless wars , it would only be logical to assume the economy is destined to fall apart .
As we increase our food consumption and continue to rely on fossil fuels to provide our energy , it would only be logical to assume climate catastrophe in the near future ( and there is much evidence to say we 're living through it now ) .
But on other days , I feel optimistic that human decency , ingenuity and survival instinct will pull us back from the brink and find a more sustainable way to live .
And occasionally , I think that our power to adapt to a changing environment means all of the above wo n't be as bad as many people make it out to be .

While the science seems to predict the worst , the environment is so complex and humans so unpredictable there are literally a million different outcomes possible .
It is hard to know which view is the more accurate , as each are highly dependent on mood .
In a fascinating article in the Scientific American , Mark Maslin and John Adams put forward a proposal that our environmental beliefs are reliant on how individual humans respond to risk and uncertainty .
They have broken down the environmental beliefs , or ' myths ' that people subscribe to into four categories :

1 ) Nature is benign : Earth is predictable and robust , able to withstand or bounce back from any damage .
This view corresponds with what they call individualists ,
entrepreneurial types who do n’t necessarily believe in control or
intervention from others .
Maslin uses the example of self - made oil
barons .
2 ) Nature is ephemeral : Earth is fragile and it is in danger of collapse .
And this view is held by egalitarians ,
people who have strong democratic group loyalties but do not respect
externally imposed rules .
Radical environmentalists might fall into
this category .
3 ) Nature is tolerant : Earth can handle some changes , but major excesses will send it reeling .
This is a view held by hierarchists , people who know their place , and adhere to strong social structures .
Scientists or soldiers might be examples .
4 ) Nature is capricious : Earth ’s reactions are so unpredictable that we cannot predict nor accurately plan our future .
This is the view of fatalists , those who feel they have little control over their lives .
Generally speaking , I feel I am a mixture of 1 , 2 and a little bit of 4 , although I 'm sure that would change on any given day .
Which one are you ?

In the summer of ’ 71 , The Rolling Stones , seeking shelter from their UK tax woes , exiled to the South of France .
Keith Richards set up house with Anita Pallenberg and their son Marlon in Villa Nellcôte — a 16 room waterfront mansion that once served as Gestapo headquarters for the Nazis during WWII .
The infamy continued with it now best remembered among rock fans as the grand flop - house where Exile On Main Street was recorded .
French photographer Dominique Tarle chronicled perhaps the most notorious house party ever , and had full access to goings - on over a period of six crazy months .
He later recounted to the New York Times– ” They built a studio in the basement of Keith ’s house because the band knew it would be easiest for Keith , ” says Dominique Tarlé , who had an all - access pass inside the villa for six months .
“ Engineers and technicians slept over , illegal power lines from the French railway system juiced their instruments , and when the temperature hit 100 , they rehearsed with their pants off .
A carnival of characters paraded through– Terry Southern , Gram Parsons , John Lennon , even a tribal band from Bengal … dope dealers from Marseille ; petty thieves , who stole most of the drugs and half the furniture ; and hangers - on , all of them there to witness what was happening . ”

During that time , Keith Richards & Gram Parsons were close friends– with Gram feeding Richards a steady diet of country music influence .
They both were pretty wrecked most of the time on anything from marijuana , cocaine , heroine , you name it , to plain ol ’ booze .
Keith Richards recalls –
“ I first met Gram in 1968 , when the Byrds were appearing in London — I think it was a club called Blazes .
I knew the Byrds from Mr. Tambourine Man ; the Stones had worked some shows in California with them back then .
But when I saw them at Blazes with Gram , I could see this was a radical turn .
I went backstage , and we hooked up .
Then the Byrds came through London again , on their way to South Africa .
I was like , ‘ Man , we do n’t go there . ’
The sanctions and the embargo were on .
So he quit the Byrds , right there and then .
Of course , he ’s got nowhere to stay , so he moved in with me . ”
“ As a songwriter , Gram worked very much like I do , which is knock out a couple of chords , start to spiel and see how far it can go .
Rather than sitting around with a piece of paper and a pen , trying to make things fit neatly together , if you just get on the microphone , things come to you .
Lines come to you that you would n’t dream of , because they have to come to you in a split second .
Gram liked to do that .
But he would also work very hard — harder than I ever did — on honing it down .
It ’s difficult for me to pick one of his songs as a favorite .
Sin City , on the Flying Burrito Brothers ’ first album , is great .
I love I Ca n’t Dance , on GP .
But you ’ll never get a full portrait of him from one or two songs . ”
*

“ Mick and Gram never really clicked , mainly because the Stones are such a tribal thing .
At the same time , Mick was listening to what Gram was doing .
Mick ’s got ears .
Sometimes , while we were making Exile on Main Street in France , the three of us would be plonking away on Hank Williams songs while waiting for the rest of the band to arrive .
Gram had the biggest repertoire of country songs you could imagine .
He was never short of a song . ”
“ The drugs and drinking — he was no better or worse than the rest of us .
He just made that one fatal mistake — taking that one hit after he cleaned up , still thinking he could take the same amount .
And it was too f*cking much .
But he did n’t get into dope because of us .
He knew his stuff before he met us .
I think he was just getting into his stride when he died ( In ’ 73 Gram Parsons fatally overdosed from a lethal combo of morphine and alcohol ) .
His actual output — the number of records he made and sold — was pretty minimal .
But his effect on country music is enormous .
This is why we ’re talking about him now .
But we ca n’t know what his full impact could have been . ”

Gram Parsons tagged along with the Rolling Stones on their 1971 tour , hoping they ’d sign him to their newly formed Rolling Stones Records to record a duo album with Richards .
Parsons extended his stay by moving himself into Villa Nellcôte during the recording of Exile on Main Street , and from most accounts he was routinely smashed and feuding with his girlfriend a lot– aspiring actress Gretchen Burrell , who would later become his wife .
Eventually Pallenberg had enough and kicked Parsons out .
Some say that he appears somewhere on Exile on Main Street– Richards believes that Gram Parsons is most likely among the chorus of singers on Sweet Virginia , but no one truly knows .
After parting from Richards and The Stones in France , Parsons attempted to reconnect on their 1972 tour– but with no luck .
*
*
Gram Parsons starting spending more and more time at a place that had long been dear to him– Joshua Tree National Monument .
He ’d spend days there on LSD getting lost , chasing UFOs , whatever .
Tragically it was there that Parsons overdosed in ’ 73 at the age of 26 .
According to to girlfriend Margaret Fisher ’s account in the 2005 biography Grievous Angel : An Intimate Biography of Gram Parsons by Jessica Hundley , the amount of morphine consumed by Parsons would be lethal to three addicts – it ’s thought that he ’d likely overestimated his tolerance considering his past experience with opiates .
Parson ’s stepfather arranged for a private ceremony back in New Orleans , and neglected to invite any of his friends from the music industry .
In a strange turn of events , Parsons ’ body somehow disappeared from LAX before it could be shipped to New Orleans for burial .
You see , prior to his death Parsons stated that he wished to be cremated at Joshua Tree and have his ashes spread over Cap Rock , a prominent natural feature there .
To fulfill Parsons ’ “ funeral ” wishes , Phil Kaufman and a friend stole his body from LAX and drove it in a hearse to Joshua Tree– where they attempted to cremate it by pouring five gallons of gasoline into the open coffin and throwing a lit match inside .
What resulted was an enormous fireball .
Police chased them , but according to one account they were unencumbered by sobriety and got away .
The two were arrested several days later .
Since there was no law against stealing a dead body , they were only fined around $ 750 for stealing the coffin , and were surprisingly not prosecuted for leaving 35 lbs of Gram Parsons ’ charred remains in the desert .

Keith Richards on Gram Parsons ’ passing –
“ In a way , it ’s a matter of lost love .
Gram was everything you wanted in a singer and a songwriter .
He was fun to be around , great to play with as a musician .
And that motherf * cker could make chicks cry .
I have never seen another man who could make hardened old waitresses at the Palomino Club in L.A. shed tears the way he did . “
“ It was all in the man .
I miss him so . ”

Anita Pallenberg entered The Rolling Stones ’ lives when in 1965 a friend took her to Munich for one of their concerts , and they worked their way backstage .
Anita offered The Stones some hash , but they said they could n’t smoke before a concert– though Brian Jones was ‘ kind enough ’ to invite her to his hotel room afterwards .
They stayed together for two years but he was increasingly abusive , drunk and paranoid .
On holiday in Morocco in 1967 , Keith saw Brian beating Anita up and grabbed her , threw her in his car and took her back to England .
She from then on lived with Keith Richards .
*
*
Life with the Stones was fun at the beginning , Anita Pallenberg says , because they were always playing music– but soured once they became a huge money - making machine .
She says she did n’t even see them that much , “ because at that time no girls were allowed in the studio when they were recording .
You were n’t allowed even to ring .
I did other things , I did n’t sit at home . ”
What she did do– a few films , lots of drugs and tons of screwing around …
*
*
Author A. E. Hotchner has this to say about Anita Pallenberg ’s influence on the development and presentation of The Rolling Stones from the late 1960s and through the 1970s –
She played an unusual role in the male - dominated world of rock music in the late 1960s , acting as much more than just a groupie or partner of a band member .
Mick Jagger apparently respected her opinion enough that tracks on Beggars Banquet were remixed when Pallenberg criticised them .
In the 2002 compilation release of Forty Licks , Pallenberg is credited as singing background vocals on Sympathy for the Devil .
*
*
Throughout the decade that Anita Pallenberg was Richards ’ companion in vice , her interest in the occult was a featured style component that marked The Stones concerts and public presentation .
Tony Sanchez ’s account of his time as Richards ’ bodyguard and drug dealer mentions Pallenberg ’s strange spiritual practices –
“ She was obsessed with black magic and began to carry a string of garlic with her everywhere — even to bed — to ward off vampires .
She also had a strange mysterious old shaker for holy water which she used for some of her rituals .
Her ceremonies became increasingly secret , and she warned me never to interrupt her when she was working on a spell . ”
*
*
Anita Pallenberg more than shared Richards ’ drug addiction and was charged in the 1977 Toronto heroin arrest that almost destroyed The Rolling Stones .
A warrant for her arrest was the reason that police came to search Richards and Pallenberg ’s hotel rooms ; she pled guilty to marijuana possession and was fined , several weeks after Richards ’ headline - grabbing arrest .
Richards and Pallenberg separated on the advice of Richards ’ lawyers , who believed that if they stayed together , they would end up in more serious trouble .
Richards stated that he still loved Anita and saw her as much as he ever did , despite his relationship with his future wife Patti Hansen .
In a 1985 Rolling Stone interview , Mick Jagger claimed that Pallenberg “ nearly killed me “ , when he was asked whether The Rolling Stones had any responsibility for the personal drug addictions of people close to the band .
*
*
There were persisting rumors that Anita Pallenburg also had a brief affair with Keith Richards ’ band - mate Mick Jagger while the two worked together during the filming of Performance , although Pallenberg denies this .
Personally , I would n’t put it past either of them , if you know what I mean .
They both were easy pickin’ back then .

There 's an old joke that goes something like this :
A self - absorbed fellow , meeting a friend , launches into an endless soliloquy about himself , then abruptly stops and says , " Well , enough about me .
Now , tell me what you think of me . "
Sometimes Washington has a similar quality to it .
A week ago , TomDispatch had three pieces focused on war , American - style ; this week is proving no less thematic ; it 's focused on how the world is changing just beyond the view of the " sole superpower . "
Today , Dilip Hiro , TomDispatch regular and author of Blood of the Earth : The Battle for the World 's Vanishing Oil Resources , focuses on how , despite some genuine changes , Washington 's Iran policy is , in crucial ways , stuck in the past .
He emphasizes , as few in the U.S. do , how a new constellation of forces involving China and Russia is coalescing around that energy - rich country .
In fact , just beyond our normal American sightlines , much is happening in the world .
As a small example of a sort that largely escapes mainstream American reporting , and that you 're only likely to notice if you visit a website like the War in Context , Turkey , too , is moving closer to Iran and energy is again at the heart of the matter .
Among other things ,
Turkey is now negotiating for a huge expansion of Iranian natural gas supplies flowing from its enormous South Pars field to , and through , Turkey , while its prime minister has just visited Tehran .

While the tone of the Obama administration is different from that of its predecessor , and some of its foreign policies diverge from those of George W. Bush , at their core both administrations subscribe to the same doctrine :
Whatever the White House perceives as a threat -- whether it be Iran , North Korea , or the proliferation of long - range missiles -- must be viewed as such by Moscow and Beijing .
In addition , by the evidence available , Barack Obama has not drawn the right conclusion from his predecessor 's failed Iran policy .
A paradigm of sticks - and - carrots simply is not going to work in the case of the Islamic Republic .
Here , a lesson is readily available , if only the Obama White House were willing to consider Iran 's recent history .
It is unrealistic to expect that a regime which fought Saddam Hussein 's Iraq ( then backed by the United States ) to a standstill in a bloody eight - year war in the 1980s , unaided by any foreign power , and has for 30 years withstood the consequences of U.S. - imposed economic sanctions will be alarmed by Washington 's fresh threats of " crippling sanctions . "
Most important , the Obama administration is ignoring the altered international order that has emerged in the wake of the global financial crisis triggered by Wall Street 's excesses .
While its stimulus package , funded by taxpayers and foreign borrowing , has arrested the decline in the nation 's gross domestic product , Washington has done little to pull the world economy out of the doldrums .
That task -- performed by the U.S. in recent recessions -- has fallen willy - nilly to China .
History repeatedly shows that such economic clout sooner or later translates into diplomatic power .
Backed by more than $ 2 trillion in foreign exchange reserves , the state - owned Chinese oil corporations have been locking up hydrocarbon resources as far away as Brazil .
Not surprisingly , Iran , with the second largest oil as well as gas reserves in the world , looms large in the strategic plans of Beijing .
The Chinese want to import Iran 's petroleum and natural gas through pipelines across Central Asia , thus circumventing sea routes vulnerable to U.S. naval interdiction .
As this is an integral part of China 's energy security policy , little wonder that Chinese oil companies have committed an estimated $ 120 billion dollars -- so far -- to Iran 's energy industry .
During a recent meeting with Iran 's first vice president , Muhammad Reza Rahimi , in Beijing , Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao stressed the importance of cooperation between the two countries when it comes to hydrocarbons and trade ( at $ 29 billion a year , and rising ) , as well as " greater coordination in international affairs . "
Little wonder , then , that China has already moved to neutralize any sanctions that the United States -- backed by Britain , France and Germany -- might impose on Iran without United Nations authorization .
Foremost among these would be a ban on the export of gasoline to Iran , whose oil refining capacity falls significantly short of domestic demand .
Chinese oil corporations have already started shipping gasoline to Iran to fill the gap caused by a stoppage of supplies from British and Indian companies anticipating Washington 's possible move .
Between June and August 2009 , China signed $ 8 billion worth of contracts with Iran to help expand two existing Iranian oil refineries to produce more gasoline domestically and to help develop the gigantic South Pars natural gas field .
Iran 's national oil corporation has also invited its Chinese counterparts to participate in a $ 42.8 billion project to construct seven oil refineries and a 1,000 mile trans - Iran pipeline that will facilitate pumping petroleum to China .
Tehran and Moscow
When it comes to Russia , Tehran and Moscow have a long history of close relations , going back to Tsarist times .
During that period and the subsequent Soviet era , the two states shared the inland Caspian Sea .
Now , as two of the five littoral states of the Caspian , Iran and Russia still share a common fluvial border .
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 , relations between the Islamic Republic and Russia warmed .
Defying pressures from both the Clinton and Bush administrations , Russia 's state - owned nuclear power company continued building a civilian nuclear power plant near the Iranian port city of Bushehr .
It is scheduled to begin generating electricity next year .
As for nuclear threats , the Kremlin 's perspective varies from Washington's .
It is far more concerned with the actual threat posed by some of Pakistan 's estimated 75 nuclear weapons falling into militant Islamist hands than with the theoretical one from Tehran .
Significantly , it was during his recent trip to Beijing to conclude ambitious hydrocarbon agreements with China that Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said , " If we speak about some kind of sanctions [ on Iran ] now , before we take concrete steps , we will fail to create favorable conditions for negotiations .
That is why we consider such talk premature . "
The negotiations that Putin mentioned are now ongoing between Iran and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council ( the U.S. , Britain , China , France , and Russia ) as well as Germany .
According to Western sources , the agenda of the talks is initially to center on a " freeze for freeze " agreement .
Iran would suspend its nuclear enrichment program in exchange for the U.N. Security Council not strengthening its present nominal economic sanctions .
If these reports are accurate , then the chances of a major breakthrough may be slim indeed .
At the heart of this issue lies Iran 's potential ability to enrich uranium to a level usable as fuel for a nuclear weapon .
This , in turn , is linked to the way Iran 's leaders view national security .
As a signatory to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) , Iran is , in fact , entitled to enrich uranium .
The key point is the degree of enrichment : 5 % enriched uranium for use as fuel in an electricity generating plant ( called low enriched uranium , LEU ) ; 20 % enriched for use as feedstock for producing medical isotopes ( categorized as medium enriched uranium , MEU ) ; and 90 % - plus for bomb - grade fuel ( known as high enriched uranium , HEU ) .
So far , what Iran has produced at its Natanz nuclear plant is LEU .
At the Iran - Six Powers meeting in Geneva on October 1st , Iran agreed in principle to send three - quarters of its present stock of 1,600 kilograms ( 3,500 pounds ) of LEU to Russia to be enriched into MEU and shipped back to its existing Tehran Research Reactor to produce medical isotopes .
If this agreement is fleshed out and finalized by all the parties under the aegis of the International Atomic Energy Agency , then the proportion of Iran 's LEU with a potential of being turned into HEU would diminish dramatically .
When it comes to the nuclear conundrum , what distinguishes China and Russia from the U.S. is that they have conferred unconditional diplomatic recognition and acceptance on the Islamic Republic of Iran .
So their commercial and diplomatic links with Tehran are thriving .
Indeed , a sub-structure of pipelines and economic alliances between hydrocarbon - rich Russia , Iran , and energy - hungry China is now being forged .
In other words , the foundation is being laid for the emergence of a Russia - Iran - China diplomatic triad in the not - too - distant future , while Washington remains stuck in an old groove of imposing " punishing " sanctions against Tehran for its nuclear program .
Tehran and Washington
There is , of course , a deep and painful legacy of animosity and ill - feeling between the 30 - year - old Islamic Republic of Iran and the U.S. Iran was an early victim of Washington 's subversive activities when the six - year - old CIA overthrew the democratically elected government of Prime Minister Muhammad Mussadiq in 1953 .
That scar on Iran 's body politic has not healed yet .
Half a century later , the Iranians watched the Bush administration invade neighboring Iraq and overthrow its president , Saddam Hussein , on trumped - up charges involving his supposed program to produce weapons of mass destruction .
Iran 's leaders know that during his second term in office -- as Seymour Hersh revealed in the New Yorker -- Bush authorized a clandestine CIA program with a budget of $ 400 million to destabilize the Iranian regime .
They are also aware that the CIA has focused on stoking disaffection among Sunni ethnic minorities in Shiite - ruled Iran .
These include ethnic Arabs in the oil - rich province of Khuzistan adjoining Iraq , and ethnic Baluchis in Sistan - Baluchistan Province abutting the Pakistani province of Baluchistan .
Little wonder that Tehran pointed an accusing finger at the U.S. for the recent assassination of six commanders of its Revolutionary Guard Corps in Sistan - Baluchistan by two suicide bombers belonging to Jundallah ( the Army of Allah ) , an extremist Sunni organization .
As yet , there is no sign , overt or covert , that President Obama has canceled or repudiated his predecessor 's program to destabilize the Iranian regime .
Insecure regimes seek security in nuclear arms .
History shows that joining the nuclear club has , in fact , proven an effective strategy for survival .
Israel and North Korea provide striking examples of this .
Unsure of Western military assistance in a conventional war with Arab nations , and of its ability to maintain its traditional armed superiority over its Arab adversaries , Israel 's leaders embarked on a nuclear weapons program in the mid-1950s .
They succeeded in their project a decade later .
Since then Israel has acquired an arsenal of 80 to 200 nuclear weapons .
In the North Korean case , once the country had tested its first atomic bomb in October 2006 , the Bush administration softened its stance towards it .
In the bargaining that followed , North Korea got its name removed from the State Department 's list of nations that support international terrorism .
In the on - again - off - again bilateral negotiations that followed , the Pyongyang regime as an official nuclear state has been seeking a guarantee against attack or subversion by the United States .
Without saying so publicly , Iran 's leaders want a similar guarantee from the U.S. Conversely , unless Washington ends its clandestine program to destabilize the Iranian state , and caps it with an offer of diplomatic acceptance and normal relations , there is no prospect of Tehran abandoning its right to enrich uranium .
On the other hand , the continuation of a policy of destabilization , coupled with ongoing threats of " crippling " sanctions and military strikes ( whether by the Pentagon or Israel ) , can only drive the Iranians toward a nuclear breakout capability .
During George W. Bush 's eight - year presidency , the U.S. position in the world underwent a sea change .
From the Clinton administration , Bush had inherited a legacy of 92 months of continuous economic prosperity , a budget in surplus , and the transformation of the U.N. Security Council into a handmaiden of the State Department .
What he passed on to Barack Obama was the Great Recession in a world where America 's popularity had hit rock bottom and its economic strength was visibly ebbing .
All this paved the way for the economic and political rise of China , as well as the strengthening of Russia as an energy giant capable of extending its influence in Europe and challenging American dominance in the Middle East .
In this new environment expecting the leaders of Iran , backed by China and Russia , to do the bidding of Washington means placing a bet on the inconceivable .

The Laffer Curve is a simple idea : a government can't raise taxes forever and expect to increase revenue along the way .
Eventually you 're taking so much in taxes that people do n't have any reason to earn income .
The argument is simple ( and correct ) : if you have zero tax rate you get zero tax revenue .
If you raise taxes just a bit , nobody will be discouraged from working , and you will collect some amount of revenue ; therefore , the curve of revenue versus tax rate starts at zero and initially rises .
But if the tax rate is 100 % , nobody has any reason to work , and your total revenues will be back at zero .
By the wonders of math , there must therefore be a maximum of the curve somewhere in between 0 % and 100 % tax rate .
An important question is , where are we on the curve ?
The notion of the Laffer curve has been used to justify all sorts of tax cuts , under the assumption / claim that we are to the right of the maximum , so that cutting taxes will actually increase revenues .
Serious economists generally do n't believe this holds true in the U.S. right now , but the lure of the idea is undeniable : lose weight by eating more ice cream !
Via Marginal Revolution , here 's a study by Mathias Trabandt and Harald Uhlig that tries to get it right .
Obviously they have models that make various assumptions , and I have no idea how realistic those assumptions are .
They study the U.S. and several European countries , and find that Denmark and Sweden are just a bit on the wrong side of the curve for the specific case of capital income taxation .
For the most part , however , tax rates lie to the left of the maximum .
In the U.S. , especially , we are significantly on the left .
Here is the graph for labor taxes :
The vertical line is our average tax rate ; the curves represent different model assumptions .
They estimate the U.S. could increase revenues by about 36 % by raising taxes .
That obviously does n't necessarily imply that we should -- but we could .
Sir Alex Ferguson 's growing dislike of Manchester City manifested itself in another outspoken and wide - ranging attack by the Manchester United manager last night in which he branded them " cocky " and backed the Football Association 's decision to ban Emmanuel Adebayor .
At his most provocative , Ferguson also played down City 's impressive form this season by describing them as having a " softish start " and he raised the stakes ahead of Sunday 's potentially volatile derby at Old Trafford by questioning whether it would have to be regarded as a failure if Mark Hughes , having spent £ 120 m this summer alone , did not win the Premier League this season .
Ferguson described Adebayor 's behaviour in City 's 4 - 2 defeat of Arsenal last weekend as " very aggressive " and he made it clear that he was still aggrieved about the manner in which United 's neighbours had taunted them after signing Carlos Tevez by putting up a Welcome to Manchester billboard in the city centre .
" The rivalry has gone up a notch in the last few months , with them signing all those players and then coming up with that advert and all their posters , " he said .
" They 've been a bit , how can I put it , cocky – yes , a bit cocky . "
Ferguson was " surprised " City had beaten Arsenal and there was the first sign that he might want to indulge in some mind games with the most prolific spenders in English football .
" I think they 've got seven centre - forwards now , which is crazy , just amazing , but when you have spent that amount of money , and the wages they are paying , you have to win the league with that kind of investment and that 's where the difficulty will come for them , " he said .
" It 's going to be very difficult for them to win the league when you see the likes of ourselves , Liverpool , Chelsea and Arsenal because they 've got to beat the four of us at some point this season to get the league .
It 's very difficult to get into the top four and it's even more difficult to get into the top one , and that 's what this league is all about – being No1 . "
Ferguson , speaking to Sirius XM Radio in the United States , was asked about Adebayor 's stamp on Robin van Persie and the manner in which the striker had celebrated scoring against his former club by running the length of the pitch to goad the Arsenal fans .
United 's manager believes it was more serious than when Gary Neville celebrated a goal in front of Liverpool 's supporters at Old Trafford in 2006 , incurring a £ 5,000 fine from the FA .
Adebayor , according to Ferguson , had left the FA with no choice but to suspend him for violent conduct for the Van Persie challenge , with the possibility of further sanctions to come .
" It was surprising [ behaviour ] .
I could n't believe it .
He was very aggressive , the boy . "
Asked what he would do if one of his players had behaved like that , Ferguson said : " I 'd take them into a dark room . "
City have won all four of their Premier League games going into what Ferguson predicts will be " quite a volatile " match .
" They [ City ] have had a softish start to the season , with two or three easier games , " he said .
He was , however , prepared to admit that City would go to Old Trafford in a confident mood .
" Their result on Saturday was the one that surprised people because scoring four goals against Arsenal was an emphatic result .
So they have had a good start and , when you get a good start , it can galvanise you and give you confidence , and of course they 've got all those players now . "
Researchers from the Helmholtz - Zentrum Berlin für Materialien und Energie have , in cooperation with colleagues from Dresden , St. Andrews , La Plata and Oxford , for the first time observed magnetic monopoles and how they emerge in a real material .
Results of their research are being published in the journal Science .
Magnetic monopoles are hypothetical particles proposed by physicists that carry a single magnetic pole , either a magnetic north pole or south pole .
In the material world this is quite exceptional because magnetic particles are usually observed as dipoles , north and south combined .
However there are several theories that predict the existence of monopoles .
Among others , in 1931 the physicist Paul Dirac was led by his calculations to the conclusion that magnetic monopoles can exist at the end of tubes – called Dirac strings – that carry magnetic field .
Until now they have remained undetected .
Jonathan Morris , Alan Tennant and colleagues ( HZB ) undertook a neutron scattering experiment at the Berlin research reactor .
The material under investigation was a single crystal of Dysprosium Titanate .
This material crystallises in a quite remarkable geometry , the so called pyrochlore - lattice .
With the help of neutron scattering Morris and Tennant show that the magnetic moments inside the material had reorganised into so - called ' spin-spaghetti ' .
This name comes from the ordering of the dipoles themselves , such that a network of contorted tubes ( strings ) develops , through which magnetic flux is transported .
These can be made visible by their interaction with the neutrons which themselves carry a magnetic moment .
Thus the neutrons scatter as a reciprocal representation of the Strings .
During the neutron scattering measurements a magnetic field was applied to the crystal by the researchers .
With this field they could influence the symmetry and orientation of the strings .
Thereby it was possible to reduce the density of the string networks and promote the monopole dissociation .
As a result , at temperatures from 0.6 to 2 Kelvin , the strings are visible and have magnetic monopoles at their ends .
The signature of a gas made up by these monopoles has also been observed in heat capacity measured by Bastian Klemke ( HZB ) .
Providing further confirmation of the existence of monopoles and showing that they interact in the same way as electric charges .
In this work the researchers , for the first time , attest that monopoles exist as emergent states of matter , i.e. they emerge from special arrangements of dipoles and are completely different from the constituents of the material .
However , alongside this fundamental knowledge , Jonathan Morris explains the further meaning of the results : " We are writing about new , fundamental properties of matter .
These properties are generally valid for materials with the same topology , that is for magnetic moments on the pyrochlore lattice .
For the development of new technologies this can have big implications .
Above all it signifies the first time fractionalisation in three dimensions is observed . "
Sometimes it takes a visual illustration to make the strongest argument .

It ’s time for another episode of the Up the Moo Herd : MooTools Tips and Tricks series , where we ’ll talk about classes , the backbone of MooTools .
Other JS libraries thrive using plugins and extensions , but MooTools keeps its object - oriented focus by using classes and mixins to new functionality to the framework .
Due to length concerns , I split up the article on classes into two parts .
This one tackles constructors , implement and extend , singletons , and private methods and variables .
The next part will deal with mutators , mixins , inheritance and reusable code .
I went directly to the various tips and tricks that involve classes in this post rather than explain the basics .
If you get lost , it might be good to get a firmer grasp on how classes work .
The series introduction linked above contains links to tutorials and sites that would help you to do just that .
The title for this post is taken from Breathe Carolina ‘s second album , which I was listening to while writing this article .
They ’re a really awesome band , and I admire them for being able to make Miley Cyrus ’ “ See You Again ” palatable .
With that , let ’s start getting classy !
Getting Classy
Class is the constructor used for creating classes in MooTools .
There are two ways to create a class , the first being the standard way , which is available since version 0.87 ( maybe even older–but that ’s the version I could verify without digging too much ) .
This involves passing an object that acts as the prototype of the class :
// standard way of creating classes : var Barn = new Class ( { initialize : function ( name ) { this .
fowl = name ; } , get Fowl : function ( ) { return this .
fowl ; } , set Fowl : function ( name ) { this .
fowl = name ; return this ; } } ) ; var myBarn = new Barn ( ' chicken ' ) ; myBarn .
get Fowl ( ) ; // returns ' chicken ' myBarn .
set Fowl ( ' turkey ' ) myBarn .
get Fowl ( ) ; // returns ' turkey '
The second way comes from the new Class / Class.js , which was overhauled in MooTools 1.2.2 .
From this version onwards , Class will accept a function that will become your initialize method instead of an object :
// alternative , constructor based way : var Barn = new Class ( function ( name ) { this .
fowl = name ; } ) ; Barn .
implement ( { get Fowl : function ( ) { return this .
fowl ; } , set Fowl : function ( name ) { this .
fowl = name ; return this ; } } ) ; var myBarn = new Barn ( ' chicken ' ) ; myBarn .
get Fowl ( ) ; // returns ' chicken ' myBarn .
set Fowl ( ' turkey ' ) myBarn .
get Fowl ( ) ; // returns ' turkey '
This alternative way might look alien at first , but it opens up new possibilities that we ’ll use later .
Implement and Extend
Classes have an implement method used to add new methods .
Similar to the implement function in Natives , it can be used in two ways :
// key - value way ..
Barn .
implement ( ' feed Fowl ' , function ( ) {...} ) ; // hash way ..
Barn .
implement ( { feed Fowl : function ( ) { ... } , prepareFowl : function ( ) { ... } } ) ;
Always use the second syntax if you ’re adding multiple methods to avoid repeated calls to implement .
Classes also have an extend method .
While implement adds methods to the prototype of the class , extend adds methods to the class constructor itself .
In other words , implement creates instance methods and members , extend creates class methods and variables :
var Barn = new Class ( ) ; // instance method using implement ..
Barn .
implement ( { instanceMethod : function ( ) { return ' From an instance ! ' ; } } ) ; // class method using extend ..
Barn .
extend ( { classMethod : function ( ) { return ' From the class itself ! ' ; } } ) ; var myBarn = new Barn ( ) ; typeof ( myBarn . instanceMethod ) ; // returns ' function ' myBarn . instanceMethod ( ) ; // returns ' From an instance ! ' typeof ( my Barn .
classMethod ) ; // returns ' undefined ' typeof ( Barn .
classMethod ) ; // returns ' function ' Barn .
classMethod ( ) ; // returns ' From the class itself ! ' typeof ( Barn . instanceMethod ) ; // returns ' undefined '
Extended Omission
You might have noticed that extend is n’t listed in the docs for Class / Class .
That ’s because it ’s not a special method for classes .
It ’s actually a method for Native .
Functions are natives and class constructors are functions , so they get this method as well .
extend is also available to all natives , except Array ( because of the Array. extend generic ) .
This is an embarrassing omission on my part when I wrote the post on Natives .
So in case you ’re wondering , you could also use extend on any other native constructor ( String , Hash , etc.–except Array ) to add class methods to them .
extend is a very useful method , especially if you want to keep your code clean .
Instead of doing this :
var Barn = new Class ( ) ; Barn .
fowlCount = 0 ; Barn .
countFowls = function ( ) { return Barn .
fowlCount ; } ; Barn .
add Fowl = function ( ) { Barn .
fowlCount += 1 ; } ;
You can do this instead :
var Barn = new Class ( ) ; Barn .
extend ( { fowlCount : 0 , countFowls : function ( ) { return this .
fowlCount ; } , add Fowl : function ( ) { this .
fowlCount += 1 ; } } ) ;
Your Class Just Changed His Status to Single ( ton )
There are several available techniques for creating singletons , so let me share the ones I know and I ’ve used before .
The first one is the easiest and the best solution : use an object :
// Create the singleton object .. var Singleton = { greeting : ' Howdy ' , greet : function ( name ) { return [ this .
greeting , name , '!' ]. join ( ' ' ) ; } } ; Singleton .
greet ( ' Mark ' ) ; // returns ' Howdy Mark ! ' ; // this will throw an error because Singleton is not a constructor .
var newSingleton = new Singleton ( ) ;
But how about mixins like Events ?
Use the $ extend function :
// Create the singleton object .. var Singleton = { name : ' Mark ' , greeting : ' Howdy ' greet : function ( name ) { return [ this .
greeting , name || this .
name , '!' ]. join ( ' ' ) ; } } ; $ extend ( Singleton , new Events ( ) ) ; Singleton .
addEvent ( ' greet ' , function ( ) { this .
greet ( ' Joseph ' ) ; // returns ' Howdy Joseph ! ' this .
greet ( ) ; // returns ' Howdy Mark ! ' } ) ; Singleton .
fireEvent ( ' greet ' ) ;
There ’s also a way to get singletons by using vanilla MooTools classes .
The way to do that is to keep your class declaration inside a closure , create a local variable to hold the instance to your singleton and use that for every call :
( function ( ) { // variable for holding the instance .. var instance = null ; this .
Singleton = new Class ( { initialize : function ( name ) { if ( instance ) return instance ; this .
name = name ; instance = this ; } , getName : function ( ) { return this .
name ; } } ) ; } ) ( ) ; var mySingleton = new Singleton ( ' Mark ' ) ; mySingleton . getName ( ) ; // returns ' Mark ' ; var newSingleton = new Singleton ( ' Joseph ' ) ; newSingleton . getName ( ) ; // returns ' Mark ' ; // both instances refer to the same object ..
mySingleton == newSingleton ;
The second one has the benefit of having a familiar syntax , and mixins and other class features work without having to use a different technique .
But because it ’s still a class , your singleton will have a public constructor available , so make sure that you document that it ’s a singleton .
It ’ll be confusing for other people who ’ll try to use your code when they create new instances and fail–so document !
Closures
A lot of the code presented in this series will deal with closures in one form or another , and MooTools uses closures for a lot of stuff , so I recommend that you take your time to understand them .
Richard Cornford ’s article explains them in depth , and there are a lot of articles that deal with them .
Take your pick and read : you ’ll be a better Javascript developer once you grasp the power of closures .
Another way is the double new operator hack :
var Singleton = new new Class ( {...} )
What happens here is that the second new operator is used to create an new Class , which returns a constructor function for the class .
The first new is used to create a new instance of the class .
To avoid confusion and to allow for passing constructor variables , you can group them into parentheses .
var Singleton = new ( new Class ( { initialize : function ( name ) { this .
name = name ; } , getName : function ( ) { return this .
name ; } } ) ) ( ' Mark ' ) ; Singleton . getName ( ) ; // returns ' Mark ' //
This throws an error .. new Singleton ( ' Joseph ' ) ;
Singled
Out I ’m putting my foot down on this issue : implement singletons using simple objects as shown in the first example .
Unless there are firm reasons on why you should use a MooTools class rather than an object , there is no better way to create a singleton in Javascript other than using an actual object .
The other two ways , while valid in themselves , should only be used when using an object as a singleton will not suffice .
And if you find yourself in a position to decide which one you ’ll use , pick the first–always .
The double new operator technique is an ugly hack and it defeats the whole point of beautiful code that MooTools promotes .
The only reason I even added it to this article is for the sake of completeness , and I still do n’t think it was a good idea for me to do so .
Keeping Secrets
Closures are the easiest way to create private variables .
You can wrap the class declaration in a closure and declare your private variables inside it to create a local scope :
( function ( ) { var secret = ' I like bacon . ' ; this .
Secretive = new Class ( { getSecret : function ( ) { return secret ; } , setSecret : function ( newSecret ) { secret = newSecret ; return this ; } } ) ; } ) ( ) ; var secret = new Secretive ( ) ; typeof ( secret .
secret ) ; // returns ' undefined ' secret .
getSecret ( ) ; // returns ' I like bacon . ' secret .
setSecret ( ' I like bacon too ! ' ) ; secret .
getSecret ( ) ; // returns ' I like bacon too !'
I mentioned a few paragraphs ago that MooTools 1.2.2 and above allows passing a constructor function to Class rather than a prototype object .
This feature gives us another way to create private variables :
var Secretive = new Class ( function ( ) { var secret = ' I like bacon . ' ; $ extend ( this , { getSecret : function ( ) { return secret ; } , setSecret : function ( newSecret ) { secret = newSecret ; return this ; } } ) ; } ) ; var secret = new Secretive ( ) ; typeof ( secret .
secret ) ; // returns ' undefined ' secret .
getSecret ( ) ; // returns ' I like bacon . ' secret .
setSecret ( ' I like bacon too ! ' ) ; secret .
getSecret ( ) ; // returns ' I like bacon too !'
You might notice that we use $ extend inside the function because this .
implement would n’t be available inside the constructor function .
You can still use implement after you declared your constructor , but make sure that any function that needs access to the private variable are declared inside the constructor .
Otherwise , it ’ll be out of scope and you wo n’t be able to access the variable .
Mutating Privates Private variables are so sought after that there has been a slew of work done to get them in MooTools .
In particular , there are several Mutators available to get private variables in your classes .
I did n’t include them in this article because they ’re not part of the MooTools core , but a quick google search will bring up a list of them .
I leave it to you to investigate further .
Ca n’t Touch
This !
The same techniques for creating private variables can be used to create private methods .
Here ’s one involving a closure :
( function ( ) { // our private method .. var secretFunction = function ( ) { return ' The cake is a lie . ' ; } ; this .
Secretive = new Class ( { tellSecret : function ( ) { return secretFunction ( ) ; } } ) ; } ) ( ) ; var secrets = new Secretive ( ) ; secrets .
tellSecret ( ) ; // returns ' The cake is a lie . ' typeof ( secrets .
secretFunction ) ; // returns ' undefined '
And here ’s one using the new MooTools feature of passing a constructor function :
var Secretive = new Class ( function ( ) { // our private method .. var secretFunction = function ( ) { return ' The cake is a lie . ' ; } ; $ extend ( this , { tellSecret : function ( ) { return secretFunction ( ) ; } } ) ; } ) ; var secrets = new Secretive ( ) ; secrets .
tellSecret ( ) ; // returns ' The cake is a lie . ' typeof ( secrets .
secretFunction ) ; // returns ' undefined '
Fortunately , you do n’t need to use the techniques above because of a new feature that arrived in MooTools 1.2.2 .
It solves the problem of creating private methods using a new Function method called protect .
What it does is it sets some variables on your function that makes it impossible to call the method from the outside of a class .
It will still be visible , but it ca n’t be invoked :
var Secretive = new Class ( { secretFunction : ( function ( ) { return ' The cake is a lie . ' ; } ) . protect ( ) , tellSecret : function ( ) { return this .
secretFunction ( ) ; } } ) ; var secrets = new Secretive ( ) ; secrets .
tellSecret ( ) ; // returns ' The cake is a lie . ' typeof ( secrets .
secretFunction ) ; // returns ' function ' secrets .
secretFunction ( ) ; // Error : ' The method secretFunction can not be called . '
protect is an exciting addition to MooTools because we now get true protected methods without using complex closures .
Awesome , right ?
Protected Mutator
In MooTools 2.0 , creating protected methods will be easier .
It ’s not yet final , but it ’s highly possible that we ’ll get a protected mutator for the next major version of MooTools : var Secretive = new Class ( { ' protected secretFunction ' : function ( ) { return ' The cake is a lie . ' ; } , tellSecret : function ( ) { return this .
secretFunction ( ) ; } } ) ;
Take this with a grain of salt though : MooTools 2.0 is not yet finalized , so it may change in the span between now and the release .
Class Just Ended
This concludes this episode of the Up the Moo Herd .

The human - driven buildup of heat - trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere appears to have ended a slide , many millenniums in the making , toward cooler summer temperatures in the Arctic , the authors of a new study report .
Scientists familiar with the work , to be published Friday in the journal Science , said it provided fresh evidence that human activity is not only warming the globe , particularly the Arctic , but could also even fend off what had been presumed to be an inevitable descent into a new ice age over the next few dozen millenniums .
The reversal of the slow cooling trend in the Arctic , recorded in samples of layered lakebed mud , glacial ice and tree rings from Alaska to Siberia , has been swift and pronounced , the team writes .
Earlier studies have also shown that the Arctic , more than the planet as a whole , has seen unusual warming in recent decades .
But the new analysis provides decade - by - decade detail on temperature trends going back 2,000 years  five times further than previous work at that detailed a scale .
Digital publishing and open access policies are changing the face of academic publishing , and many of the trends that develop here are likely to make their way into the larger publishing market .
That 's what made news that broke earlier this year so striking : a leaked memo suggested that the American Chemical Society 's publishing wing was almost entirely abandoning print and would focus instead on digital publishing .
Since then , however , the ACS said that it will continue printing " condensed " versions of its journals for the time being .
To find out how this organization is approaching publishing in the digital age , we spoke with Brandon Nordin , its VP of marketing , Web strategy , and innovation .
Nordin pointed out that the ACS has a somewhat different mandate from that of a for - profit publishing house .
" Our charter is to help advance the scientific record , and advance science itself , " Nordin said .
That involves a significant amount of publishing —
" In that role , we publish 34 - plus journals , and have a century of publishing heritage " — but the focus is primarily on serving the academic community .
ACS made a move that most other publishers have been loathe to do : it unbundled print and online subscriptions .
" Libraries were no longer bound to take the print copy if they only wanted the online , " Nordin said .
" Three or four years ago that was a very novel thing ; I think more and more people are looking at it now . "
That move probably allowed ACS a clearer view of trends in publishing .
Nordin related how , a decade ago , both individual and institutional subscribers had to be enticed into accepting digital content .
Now , many publishers are looking for ways to protect their investments in print in the face of increasing demands for digital .
Once given an either - or choice of print or digital , ACS subscribers made their preference clear .
" We saw the purchasing market , starting with the institutional libraries , canceling print to such an extent that , when we got through the last renewal season , it was obvious that many of our journals have fallen below the threshold where you could practically consider printing them as a logical choice , much less an economic choice , " Nordin said .
" Some journals are printed twice a week , they 're hundreds of pages , they include four - color graphics .
The economics of print no longer worked . "
Still , some subscribers wanted to retain print , which still works well as " a browsing , serendipity format . "
( Ironically , Nordin said , " they find the articles they want to focus on , and then go and print them off a computer . " )
" We did not abandon print .
We said , ' We need to find a way to service the remaining print volume that 's out there , ' " he added .
The solution that ACS came up with was to use two - up printing , where each physical page contains two pages of text .
Graduate students were already printing digital articles out this way , but the idea of doing it to whole journals came from someone in the print production group , who pointed out that the software they used could handle two - up printing without modification .
A temporary reprieve ?
Although print was n't abandoned this time around , Nordin said that ACS would continue to track the expectations of its subscribers , and he would be surprised if things did n't change dramatically when the next round of subscription renewals takes place .
Institutional libraries are a major part of ACS 's subscriber base , and they 've been financially hammered in the past year ; private universities have seen their endowments plunge , while public institutions have been victims of shrinking state budgets .
Nordin specifically pointed to a statement released by the International Coalition Of Library Consortia , which says that libraries " expect significant and widespread cuts in budget levels ... with real and permanent reductions to base budgets . "
The statement calls for flexible pricing and creative solutions that let subscribers trade features for price .
Given the current environment , print might well be considered a feature .
Even if print survives the next subscription renewal process , it 's clear that Nordin does n't think it can continue indefinitely .
ACS 's experience has been that , given the choice , enough of its readers prefer digital that print becomes hard to maintain .
" Once you start printing less than 1,000 of anything , you really have to question your business model , " Nordin said .
The options for making print work better are also unpalatable ; " No one wanted to give up color — nobody wanted to dial the clock back — and nobody wanted to add author charges for color .
" Obviously , we 're somewhere on the road to pure digital , " Nordin concluded .
Still , even with an insider 's view , he was hesitant to predict the trajectory of the transition .
" We really do n't know where [ we are on that road ] , and we 're waiting to be guided by our customers . "
Picture this .
A completely empty room .
Now picture this .
A large pile of candy — a crapton to be exact — in the middle of the room and the door creaking open to reveal a class of hungry preschoolers , drooling over the goodies .
And , as they walk through the door , each of them are given a sippy cup full of Red Bull .
That 's basically how the electrical engineers and CAD designers were acting at the Fortune 500 hardware company where Jack works .
Since the sales guy from EE - Graphix came in touting the features of their PCB Designer Enterprise Edition 2009 — and brought with them a pile of Krispy Kreme and Starbucks — the engineers and designers were bouncing off the walls .
But it was n't just sugar and caffeine that was making them jittery ; they were experiencing a " feature high " .
As a whole , they were already relatively satisfied users of the 2005 edition of the software .
It worked and was n't a source of all that much frustration .
But the new version had bells and whistles they were salivating for .
Aero - style interface ... improved Vista compatibility ... improved sub - menu item spelling ... fewer registry conflicts ... you name it !
But all that paled in comparison to the big news : the software now had a " concurrent engineering " feature .
Who 's Got the Server ?
In a nutshell , concurrent engineering promised that multiple users could all work the same PCB project at the same time .
This meant no longer having to wait until the project was " unlocked " on the file server before another designer could add their changes .
And everyone seemed to love it : management was thrilled at the potential for gains in productivity ; users in Austin were raptured at the prospect of not having to ask the admin in Cleveland to cancel the editing lock of another user who left on vacation ; and the admin in Cleveland looked forward to not being bugged all the time .
Once the big install day came , everybody marveled that whole teams could be working on aspects of the same project .
It was wall - to - wall sunshine and candy canes throughout the whole day .
Everyone was content ... that is , until the early bird users left for the day .
It turned out that the first user who would open a PCB project from the share drive become the " server " .
Anyone else who subsequently opened the project became the " client " .
Because this was transparent , no one even noticed — that is , until the " server " undocked his laptop to leave for the day .
All the " clients " who were in the midst of making changes were then greeted with an cryptic " ERR - 83105 : CANNOT COMMUNICATE WITH SERVER PROCESS ON \ \LPTOP4454 " .
And the double whammy that , unless the designer wanted to discard their uncommitted work , they could n't edit any projects until the next day when whoever owned " LPTOP4454 " came into the office and fired up their PCB Designer Enterprise Edition 2009 .
The icing on the cake ?
The software offered no hint or suggestion as to whether it's in " server " or " client " mode .
Now , one might think that this would raise a firestorm of complaints , but with the users being such fans of their shiny new software , they were willing to put up with the ' workaround ' that the vendor supplied : Start up Windows Task Manager , look for a process named PCBDsgnSrver , and if you have it , send an email / shout aloud / build a small signal fire to let everyone know that you are the server .
This bliss continued for a time ... until the fateful day when the Seattle office was added to list of users .
The Magic Cookie
Jack 's company had several major design centers across the U.S. and sometimes , they would reuse portions of each other PCB projects between the sites or use the files for training purposes .
To accomplish this without stepping on each other ’s toes , the infrastructure group set the privileges on the CAD file servers to be read - only .
As a result , designers could copy the file to their hard drive and play with it to their heart 's content without fear of disrupting a production PCB project in another office .
As it turns out though , if someone at the remote site were to copy a PCB project directly from the server while a user at another site was working on it , rather than open it via the normal channels , a magic cookie file would get copied too .
This cookie file is created by the first user to open the project so that everyone else who opens the file afterwards knows that a ) they are clients to the server and b ) where the server is .
When the local copy is opened , the designer tool will find the cookie , configure itself as a " client " , and send edits directly to the " server ” .
The whole read - only security thing gets thrown by the wayside and any haphazard edits made on the " local " copy will appear as part of the remote project .
You can imagine Jack 's frustration in explaining to the CAD designers that they are actually editing a production copy of the PCB project at a remote site , even though ( 1 ) the CAD designer copied it to their local C - drive , ( 2 ) the CAD designer started the CAD tool by double - clicking a file on their local C - drive , and ( 3 ) the CAD designer does not have write privileges to the remote server .
Now that 's concurrent engineering .

Functional programming is easy for programmers to understand : it is , after all , a subset of imperative ( normal ) programming .
It is also easy to understand the benefits of functional programming .
But try to explain why meta - programming is great — or even what it is , and eyes glaze over and the idea does not stick .
I 'm going to make an attempt to explain it with the help of a tasty analogy here .
First off , by meta - programming I mean writing a program to generate ( part of ) another program .
In the Ruby world , some people use the term for introspection or meddling with the object system .
That is not what I am talking about .
Programming is unambiguously specifying a process to be carried out by a computer .
Meta - programming is programming where the output of the process is itself a program .
For a real - world example which might be familiar , writing a parser generator like yacc is meta- programming .
Let 's compare programming to having a meal .
In imperative programming , you cook the meal , set the table , sit down at the table , share the meal with the other diners , and then do the washing up .
Functional programming would be like everybody getting a microwave ready meal or an army MRE — no worries about washing up and no worries about sharing out the food .
This brings out the benefits and downsides of functional programming ( programming without side - effects ) .
It is much simpler to figure out who is going to eat what , and when there are many diners they do n't conflict .
The justification for functional programming is that it is more elegant and can scale to larger problems without an explosion of complexity .
However , microwave pizza is often eaten by people who are too lazy to do the washing up .
The packaging is inefficient and bad for the environment and the ingredients could equally have been used to make a fresh pizza ( why not use your computing resources to their full potential ? ) .
In cases where there are multiple implementations of a program for a similar task : for example compilers , image processors or database systems , the best are written in a non-functional style in languages like C or C ++.
There are plenty of programmers who can handle sharp chopping knives ( pointers ) without cutting themselves .
If you 're too clumsy to do that , then your side - effect free programs will also be incorrect ( spilling the greasy pizza all over your t- shirt ) .
That 's easy to explain , but what is meta- programming ?
In this analogy , I would say meta - programming is about modifying your kitchen to suit your cooking .
A normal cook might install a dish - washer ( a programmer switching to another language ) but a meta - cook would DIY - assemble a rack and high - pressure hose arrangement for the particular plates used in the kitchen , and then perhaps end up building a machine for building these custom dish - washers .
I think this analogy of making your own dish - washer for your particular plates is quite apposite : meta - programming is rarely done except in large projects .
McDonald 's can design custom fryer baskets , but a small kebab shop is going to use whatever old one they can get their hands on .
This means that the sort of person who might readily appreciate the convenience of functional programming ( microwave pizza ) is unlikely to have any experience developing the sort of serious project that uses meta-programming .
Secondly , many uses of meta - programming in small projects are completely unnecessary and when a C project builds up complex macro systems they 're probably doing that instead of working on whatever the project should achieve ( jury rigging an awesome mop instead of actually cleaning the kitchen ) .
But all big projects do end up using code - generation ( meta- programming ) .
Always .
For doing RPC , parsing , error reporting , generating code for calculations , etc .
So it should be easy to give some examples where meta - programming is really used in practice .
Unfortunately , again by analogy with the dishwasher business , these examples tend to be complex and specific to the task at hand .
As an alternative , to demonstrate that meta - programming can be easily used without necessarily being a huge undertaking , I shall give a few examples from teepeedee2 project , using Common Lisp .
This comes to the heart of what I have failed to convey to my peers from my student days who use C and C++ to write first - class programs ( some use python to write reasonable programs ) .
If you have a cheap 3D printer , then maybe making your own plates is n't such a big deal , and it might be cheaper and easier than going out and buying them .
But cheap meta - programming is n't science fiction .
For example , to define the XML DTD for the Atom syndication format I use this code :
( define - dtd :teepeedee2.ml.atom ( : nicknames #:tpd2.ml.atom ) ;;
Arbitrary subset defined by hand ( feed : attributes ( xmlns ) : children ( #'identity title subtitle link author id entry updated ) ) ( title : children ( #'identity ) ) ( subtitle : children ( #'identity ) ) ( link :attributes ( href rel ) : children ( ) ) ( updated : children ( #'identity ) ) ( author : children ( name email ) ) ( name : children ( #'identity ) ) ( email : children ( #'identity ) ) ( id : children ( #'identity ) ) ( summary : children ( #'identity ) ) ( content : children ( #'identity ) : attributes ( type ) ) ( entry : children ( title link id updated summary content ) ) )
This generates macros called < feed , < title etc . so I can write ( < link : href " / " ) to generate < link href= " / " ></ link >.
In fact , these macros will check that I spelled the attributes correctly and warn me at compile time if not , and additionally check at compile time that , for example , a < link does not occur in the middle of an < updated tag ( which would be against the DTD and probably indicates a typo ) .
Some languages like Scala have XML built in .
Lisp does not , but using meta - programming one can add it along with whatever features one wants .
Here , in fact there are several layers of macros , so that constant tags can all be concatenated into a fixed string at compile time .
How about a simpler example ?
If someone posts the same comment twice on this blog , I only want it to show up once .
But what does the same comment mean ?
The comment class has a time posted slot , which will probably be different , so comparing two comment instances in a simple way is not enough .
I decided that two comments are the same if they are on the same blog entry , have the same text and are by the same person .
( defun comment - similar - p ( a b ) ( macrolet ( ( cmp - fields ( &rest fields ) `( and , @( loop for field in fields for accessor = ( concat - sym ' comment - field ) collect `( equalp ( , accessor a ) ( , accessor b ) ) ) ) ) ) ( cmp - fields author text entry - index - name ) ) )
Normally , one might have to write out the boring boilerplate ( and ( equalp ( comment - field0 a ) ( comment - field0 b ) ) ( equalp ( comment - field1 a ) ( comment - field1 b ) ) ( equalp ( comment - field2 a ) ( comment - field3 b ) ) ...) etc .
But I wrote a little program in the macrolet that generates this for me .
( Spot the typo in the handwritten version ? )
Making the DSL to implement the body of the function was n't hardly more trouble than writing the function .
I use cl-cont to implement userspace threading .
In the games on mopoko.com , like Scissors , Paper , Stone all the players need to be asked the same question at the same time , then once they have all answered , we decide who wins .
This macro creates a macrolet called spawn / cc which creates a new thread .
When all the threads have returned , the continuation ( k ) is run .
( defmacro with - join - spawn / cc ( ( &optional ( name ( gensym " join " ) ) ) & body body ) ( with - unique - names ( k ) `( call / cc ( lambda ( , k ) ( let ( ( , name 1 ) ) ( flet ( ( , name ( ) ( assert ( plusp , name ) ( , name ) " spawn / cc returned too much " ) ( decf , name ) ( when ( zerop , name ) ( funcall , k ) ) ) ) ( macrolet ( ( spawn / cc ( ( &optional ( name ' , name ) ) & body body ) `( progn ( incf , name ) ( with - call / cc , @body ( , name ) ) ) ) ) , @body ) ( , name ) ) ) ) ) ) )
So I can use it like this ( a paraphrasing of part of roshambo.lisp ) :
( with - join - spawn / cc ( ) ( loop for p in ( my players ) do ( let ( ( p p ) ) ( spawn / cc ( ) ( setf ( its choice p ) ( my secret - move : select p ` ( :one rock paper scissors ) ) ) ) ) ) )
And there 's no need for hand - rolled thread counting for each move in every game .
All the dangerous if wrong boilerplate is moved into one place : the with - join - spawn / cc macro .
Having lightweight meta- programming available means that you can quickly automate any drudgery .
It 's a paradigm shift and opens up new opportunities .
Meta - programming as a heavy - weight mechanism , complicating up your build - systems and so on is best used for really important tasks .
There 's no need to design your own dishwasher factory when you are warming something up after a hard days work .
Disposable plates might be a good idea .
Imagine being able to quickly make a robot that would chop the onions , and a robot to set the table .
And imagine that making such a robot was only slightly more effort than laying the table yourself — but you only have to do it once .
Suddenly having a decent meal every day is n't much work , and you wonder why people are still gobbling down tasteless pizza .
It 's science fact , and it 's been on planet earth for decades .

Guess I should choose some better ones and rewrite it again . . .
An anonymous reader points out a story in Wired introducing us to the Doomsday Machine built by the Soviet Union in the 1980s — and that remains active to this day .
It was called " Perimeter . "
The article explains why the device was built , and why the Soviets considered it to be something that kept the peace , even though they never told the US about it .
Somali piracy has become a major international issue About 40 Egyptian fishermen have escaped from their Somali pirate captors near the northern town of Las Qorey , reports from the region say .
A wounded pirate , found on a beach with machete wounds , said the crew attacked him and his colleagues with tools and then seized their weapons .
He said that at least two pirates died before the crew sailed towards waters patrolled by international navies .
The two fishing vessels were captured four months ago .
They were taken along with an Italian tug boat , which was recently freed after a ransom was paid .
See map of how piracy is affecting the region and countries around the world Said Jama Hussein , a businessman in Las Qorey , said there were now no more vessels in the area .
Correspondents say police in the region are investigating .
Somalia has been without a functioning central government since 1991 , allowing pirates to operate in one of the world 's busiest shipping lanes .
Earlier in June the European Union , which co-operates with Nato in the region , agreed to extend its anti-piracy operation there until the end of 2010 .
Two dozen ships from European Union nations , including Britain , France , Germany and Italy , patrol an area of about two million square miles .
When first loaded , the map 's focus falls on Somalia where most of the pirates are based .

Here 's the website .
and the Facebook page .
I am currently working on this film .
There are three things in this world that nobody has hard evidence for : Â God , why Ryan Seacrest is a star , and the logic used for pay raises .
Â
The first I will take on faith , and the second I will accept as the burden I pay for the gift of free will .
Â
But the third ?
Â
Well , I accept it as well because who complains when getting a raise ?
Why is President Czar so angry at “ Churchies ? ” Â
We ’ll probably get letters about that one .
Statement by the OLC ( Organization of Libertarian Communists of Chile ) trans .
by machine , then cleaned up by LG .
Our organization 's position on the military coup in Honduras : ----
1..- Once again the bourgeoisie allied with the armed forces engaged in a coup against a constitutionally elected president in the institutional framework of their own class .
It is strange in the eyes of the world an action of this magnitude , even more so when those same national bourgeoisie gabbled about with " Never Again " and other polished phrases after white washing their sponsored dictatorships and waves of coups that ravaged the continent during the second half of the twentieth century .
2 . Our organization rejects the oligarchs arguments on the illegitimacy of the " Popular Consultation " convened by a non-binding vote as a motive for the Gorilla Golpe against Manuel Zelay .
This would ignore the long history of attacks on people 's gains by the bourgeois parties , including the Liberal organization ( the organization which was elected Zelaya ) , the ultimate expression was the law banning holding consultations 180 days before an election , an argument put forward by the bourgeoisie , their parties and their FFAA to make the referendum illegitimate , accusing Zelaya of unconstitutional practice and thus to execute the coup .
3 .- We note clearly that the CIA and the Government of the United States have learned from the failed coup in Venezuela against President Chavez .
This time the White House openly rejected the coup in Honduras , which is consistent with the urgent laundering U.S. image in the region in light of its loss of influence and the need to gain ground lost in a continent boiling with popular revolt , while still supporting the old doctrine of national security , graduating senior officers in Latin America 's infamous School of the Americas , where the same putschist Honduran officials , graduated with honors including chief of staff Romeo Vasquez Velasquez and Head of Air Force Luis Javier Suazo Prince .
4 .- Our organization openly recognized the government of Manuel Zelaya , as expression of decades of popular aspirations , which in terms of foreign policy is mirrored in alignment with the governments that support the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas ( ALBA ) , which have been formed in the last 15 years in our continent .
We firmly believe that this attitude of the government of Zelaya , placed next to the working people , poor , indigenous and marginalized from Honduras and the governments of Venezuela , Nicaragua , Bolivia , Ecuador , El Salvador , has been the trigger for the establishment of the dictatorship in Honduras .
5 .- Located on the State of Chile there must be action against against the coup beyond mere declarations of good will .
In our view , the minimum action that should be undertaken at the height of the decent people of Honduras , is totally breaking diplomatic and trade relations with the civilian - military dictatorship .
6 .- The resistance that has developed with its indigenous people , community , civil society , tradeunions , in the streets of Honduras is a demonstration that Zelaya 's government is backed by the people .
In parliament , while the president has no allies , the people in the streets are demanding his return via the demand for a General Strike .
We hold that the military coup will not drown all hope of the Honduran people , on the contrary , this event will allow an exponential leap in the development of their political and social organizations , with regard to the maturation of a collective society and the definition of a road beyond the scope of mere democratic reforms .
The overthrow of the government of Zelaya , has allowed not only a demonstration of the lack of social support for the bourgeois imperialist project , but has allowed millions to open their eyes not only in Honduras but also in Latin America and the world showing the limits of the bourgeois democratic framework .
7 .- The Libertarian Communist Organization of Chile rejects gorilla coup in Honduras , and is aligned with the honorable people of Central America in the rejection of the puppet government of Roberto Micheletti .
We know , and history gives us the reason that dictatorships are not exceptional events in the life of nations , but a recurring weapon of the imperialist bourgeoisie .
Today the Honduran people claim in the street what they have chosen at the polls , but we know that tomorrow , the same people in the same streets will build popular power and their liberation .
¡ Arriba los y las que luchan !!!
¡¡¡ Venceremos !!!

( CNN ) --
Thieves using a helicopter and explosives staged an elaborately planned , early - morning raid on a cash depot in Stockholm , Sweden , making off with bags filled with money , police said Wednesday .
The police search was delayed by a bag marked " bomb " which was left outside the police heliport .
A helicopter landed on the roof of the G4S cash depot in Vastberga , in the southern part of Stockholm , shortly after 5 a.m. ( 11 p.m. ET ) , Swedish police said .
Witness Bjorn Lockstrom first heard three loud bangs as the thieves used explosives to get into the building , he told Swedish CNN affiliate TV4 .
" Then I saw two men hoisting themselves down into the building , " Lockstrom said .
" Just minutes later , I saw how they hoisted bags of money up to the helicopter on the roof . "
The burglary happened only days before the 25th , the day every month when Swedes receive their monthly salary , so the depot was rife with cash .
The cash depot serves automatic teller machines all across Stockholm , TV4 reported .
Sources told TV4 the thieves could have gotten their hands on several hundreds of millions of kronors , the equivalent of tens of millions of U.S. dollars .
TV images from the scene showed a gray helicopter circling the building and then flying away .
The thieves flew south after they had loaded the helicopter with the bags , according to a statement from police .
One person was taken into custody later in the day , a spokesman for the Stockholm Police told a news conference Wednesday afternoon .
" The individual was arrested by police in a Stockholm suburb today , " he said .
The person is currently being questioned .
Police would not go into details of the individual 's role in the drama , according to TV4 .
Nor have they disclosed how much cash they believe was taken .
The helicopter was a Bell 206 Jet Ranger and had been stolen earlier during the night .
Swedish police could n't pursue the thieves because a bag marked " bomb " had been placed outside the police heliport , and officers had to deal with the bag before they could enter the heliport .
It is unclear whether the bag contained a bomb .
The thieves also had blocked the roads around the cash depot with metal rods , TV4 reported .
No one was hurt during the burglary , police said .
The area around the building was sealed off as authorities interviewed witnesses .
" A substantial reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible and recovery of the stolen money , " Alison Flynn , media relations manager for G4S , told CNN .
CNN 's Abbi Tatton contributed to this report .
All About Sweden
For the first time in more than two decades a Queensland couple will appear in court on abortion charges .
Tegan Leach , 19 , was charged with procuring a miscarriage after police searched her Cairns home in February on an unrelated matter .
Her 21 - year - old partner , Sergie Brennan , was charged with supplying drugs or instruments to procure an abortion .
The prosecution had relied mostly on statements and interviews with the couple after their home was searched in February .
During the search , police found two blister packets that were empty and two empty sachets that had contained powder .
Those items were labelled as mifolian and misoprostol , which are both known abortion drugs , but both those sets of packets were empty so the items could not be tested .
In police interviews and statements the couple admitted Brennan had arranged for his sister to send two sets of drugs from Russia .
The couple admitted that Leach had taken those drugs and had experienced side - effects associated with a miscarriage after taking them .
The defence relied on a number of arguments .
Lawyers for the pair said there was no way of proving that the drugs Leach had taken were actually abortion drugs because no tests had been done on them .
The defence also argued that it could not in fact be proved that those drugs had caused a miscarriage , and that they could have had a placebo effect .
Magistrate Sandra Pearson said on the basis of the evidence before the court she thought there was sufficient evidence to commit both to stand trial , particularly on the evidence they had given to police .
Leach began to cry when told the couple would be committed to stand trial .
The couple declined to comment outside of the courthouse .
Pro-choice campaigners have issued a statement calling on the Queensland Government to change the state 's abortion laws .
Meanwhile , Cairns obstetrician Dr Caroline de Costa says the committal is unfortunate for the couple who have already been through an ordeal .
" I think it is very , very unfortunate for them that their ordeal is going to continue , " she said .
" They have been the subject of national and international attention for five months now and I feel very strongly for them and their families about what they still have to go through . "

A KEY number in the struggle to tackle global warming is flawed .
The cost of adapting to the effects of climate change is two to three times the figure quoted by the UN climate change convention , a new study claims .
The UN has estimated that meeting health needs , adapting farming and infrastructure , and so on will cost $ 70 to 100 billion a year by 2030 .
Now Martin Parry of Imperial College London says this “ back of a metro ticket calculation ” ignores major sectors , including energy generation and manufacturing , as well as the costs of protecting people from inland flooding and …
A few weeks ago , LA 's KCRW set the gold standard for radio station apps : a streaming client with access to a huge back catalog of on - demand station content .
Public Radio Player 2.0 does the same thing — for everyone .
Advertisement
Since the start , Public Radio Player has listed a sizable number of NPR stations across the country , all of which are listenable via live streaming .
Given the countless other radio app available for the iPhone , the only real advantage to using version 1.0 was that , if you spent the time to look , you could find just about any NPR or PRI show you wanted playing somewhere .

Version 2.0 provides comprehensive station schedules to make program - hunting easier , but more importantly , provides access to the often generous back catalogs from various stations , meaning that you can get any public radio programming you want on demand , for free .
It 's a fairly incredible deal for NPR addicts , who 'll now be able to fine - tune their daily feed of dulcet , strangely androgynous news and lifestyle coverage to perfection . [ Ars ]
Sadequee was born in Virginia and has family in the Atlanta area A US court has found a man guilty of aiding terrorist groups by video - taping Washington landmarks and sending the tapes abroad .
Prosecutors said Ehsanul Islam Sadequee went to Bangladesh to meet terrorist cells and tried to help a Pakistani group linked to terror attacks .
At his trial in Atlanta , the 23 - year - old denied any involvement in terrorist activity .
Sadequee , who was born and raised in the US , faces up to 60 years in jail .
At the trial - at which Sadequee represented himself - he acknowledged that he had spent time discussing jihad in online forums , but said it was empty talk .
" We were immature young guys who had imaginations running wild , " he told jurors , the AP news agency reported .
" But I was not then , and am not now , a terrorist . "
Terror ties Prosecutors said he and a friend - Syed Haris Ahmed , who was convicted in June on similar charges - drove around Washington and filmed 62 clips of various sites including the US Capitol , a fuel depot and a Masonic temple .
They said he then sent at least two video clips disguised as " jimmy 's 13th birthday party " and " volleyball contest " to an overseas contact .
US officials also established that Sadequee had communicated with Mirsad Bektasevic , a Balkan - born Swede convicted in 2007 of plotting to blow up a European target to force the pullout of foreign troops from Iraq and Afghanistan .
But Sadequee 's family said the case was an example of over - zealous prosecution in the wake of the 11 September attacks .
" Even though [ US President Barack ]
Obama has communicated there 's going to be a shift , it has n't really gone down to the general understanding of the community and social attitudes , " his sister , Sonali Sadequee told AP .
Sentencing is set for 15 October .

From Democracy Now -- ACORN Head Bertha Lewis Vows Action on Employee Misconduct , But Warns Group Targeted by “ Modern - Day McCarthyism ” .
The Lou Dobbs , Glenn Becks and other right wing screechers of the world should be so proud .
We need a few more Amy Goodmans and a few less of them to cut through the propoganda attacking one of the only groups out there advocating for poor people and minorities that do n't have much of a voice in our society .
AMY GOODMAN : The anti-poverty group ACORN is coming under a firestorm of criticism after the group ’s workers were caught on camera appearing to offer advice to a pimp and prostitute .
The video was a major strike for conservatives , who for years have accused ACORN of voter registration fraud during presidential elections .
Republicans are calling for a complete cutoff of all federal funding to the group , which helps poor people fight foreclosures , fix tax problems , and register to vote .
We speak with ACORN chief executive Bertha Lewis .
[....]
AMY GOODMAN : Yet the video came out , and you had some of your biggest supporters in Congress actually voting against ACORN , saying you should n’t get funding , because they were appalled by what they saw .
How do you put —
BERTHA LEWIS : Right .
AMY GOODMAN : — these two together ?
BERTHA LEWIS :
Well , first of all , we are suffering from a modern - day type of McCarthyism .
You know , have you now or have you ever been associated with ACORN ?
This has been repeated in the right - wing Republican echo chamber , that somehow or another we are to be discredited .
We are the largest membership - based community organization of low - and moderate - income people of color , black and brown folks , in this country .
We have been around for forty years .
We ’ve saved thousands of homes .
We ’ve helped raise the wages of tens of thousands and now hundreds of thousands of people .
And also , we have been able to make sure that millions of disenfranchised black and brown folks in this country actually vote and they are actually counted .
So , for us , we know that there is a race element to trying to stop us .
I mean , look at what ’s happened with Van Jones and Eric Holder and Judge Sotomayor .
We know that we have been used as a surrogate to attack President Obama .
The teabaggers have had signs with ACORN at teabag parties , and we never even were around or there .
And it ’s not going to stop .
We understand that .
And our work is not going to stop .
So , the relative ten percent of our entire funding that would come through the government , sure , we are going to fight back against this , because we know that this is an unfair attack .
And it ’s been going on from the Republican side and the right - wing side .
However , our core work will never stop .
And we know that — being the largest organization of black and brown folks , people of color , in this country , we know that we are a target .
But we meet that challenge .
And if you were to hear the racist , sexist , just horrible vitriol that are visited on our offices and on the phone , in emails , threats left at our door , hate mail letters sent , you know , it is very clear that people on the right , and Republicans in particular , are very upset that ACORN is effective and that it ’s been around for forty years and that we are a powerful organization .

Some articles are fairly subtle in their Islamophobia , others less so .
Judy Bachrach ’s article “ Twice Branded : Western Women , Muslim Lands , ” starts off badly and then to proceeds to elicit gasps with its sheer awfulness .
It even cites Not Without My Daughter as an accurate depiction of life for most Muslim women .
Yes , really .
The title itself states how difficult it is to be a white woman in a Muslim ( read : non-white ) place .
Grab an onion , folks , it ’s time to cry for the poor white women !
Before we get to that part , Bachrach makes it clear that we must also pity the Muslim women , who she only reads about when they are being harmed by evil Muslim men .
No one cares about Muslim women like she does .
Apparently Western journalists and politicians never write about them , or at least when they do , they do n’t write what she thinks they should .
Except for Mona Eltahawy .
Bachrach quotes Eltahawy extensively , because Muslim women are such a homogeneous globule of victimhood that one journalist can speak for us all .
Apparently Eltahawy was sexually harassed while living in Egypt and Saudi Arabia , which means that her experience automatically transfers to the rest of the female population in “ Muslim lands . ”
As we know , bad things only happen to women in Muslim countries ; the rest of the planet is a misogyny - free paradise .
Just in case we ’re not yet sure why these bad things happen , Bachrach states at length that it the fault of Muslim men , as “ this is the way they prefer things to be ” .
That ’s some serious finger - pointing !
However , she wishes to focus on Muslim women in “ their home countries ” .
That ’s not the West , by the way .
Muslim women obviously are n’t at home there .
She begins her focus by citing an Egyptian survey stating that 62 % of Egyptian men had admitted to harassing women .
However , she admits that the survey only questioned 2,000 men .
As the population of Egypt is some 76.8 million ( UN , 2008 ) , this is n’t quite the damning statistic she thinks it is .
Having used a person of color as a mouthpiece and quoted some spurious statistics , Bachrach now moves onto her personal experience of Egypt .
She considered herself to have a “ double deficit ” : being both female and foreign .
At this point , the reader may wonder if the “ branding ” Bachrach speaks of is actually the marks left by the heavy straps of her invisible knapsack , but I digress .
Her harassment was a daily occurrence , made worse by the “ entire city of Cairo ” being avid watchers of Dallas :
When I lived in Egypt , everyone in Cairo avidly watched the television series Dallas , and as a result became expert on the sexual habits of American women .
And not simply expert , but unrepentantly predatory .
After all , these were women whose husbands and brothers would not reflexively massacre those who insulted them .
For it was n’t the shoulder - pad - clad bed - hopping of its cast that made American women in Cairo seem like easy targets , it was the realization that “ these were women whose husbands and brothers would not reflexively massacre those who insulted them . ”
Reflexively massacre ?
This must be because Muslim men are such barbarians .
Unlike civilized Western men of course , who are lovely to all women , all the time .
Back to how special and wonderful white women are .
Local women in Cairo are of “ neglible importance ” , as if they do n’t face any harassment at all .
Whereas the exotic foreign woman lacks a “ murderous uncle by her side ” and is hassled from all sides .
The article then takes a brief detour through the “ Married to Muslim Man Misery Memoir ” , just in case you have n’t realized yet just how wicked Muslim men are .
Bachrach uses “ experts ” whose reputations precede them : he chats with Phyllis Chesler , a notorious Islamophobe , about why any sane Western woman would marry a Muslim man and move to a predominantly Muslim country .
Chesler ’s choice quote : “ You will live but wish you were dead ” .
Having spoken to Islamic scholar Hussein Rashid about Qur’anic interpretation and finding him far too positive about his religion , she then turns to that beacon of Islamic learning , Ayaan Hirsi Ali .
Bachrach goes back to playing the role of statistician , reeling off statistics about domestic violence , honor killings and force feedings .
Of course none of those are issues that affect Muslims alone , but Bachrach does n’t let that hold her back .
Following this is much hand - wringing about Muslim women suffering in the West .
Apparently , cultural / religious respect is nothing more than post - colonial guilt :
One of the least savory consequences of a colonial past is guilt : an insidious remorse that transmutes itself into a persistent reluctance to criticize publicly those who have now themselves taken on the role of oppressor — even against those who happen to oppress , openly and without shame , within the borders of liberal nations .
“ You hear people talking about the need to ‘ respect ’ other cultures .
You want me to respect this awful behavior ? ”
Eltahawy says .
The sad part about this is that Judy Bachrach truly believes that she cares about Muslim women .
After all , she has visited “ Muslim lands ” and she speaks to Muslim women .
Why then , does this article seem so laden with grotesque stereotyping ?
It animalizes Muslim men and infantalizes Muslim women .
This article is not about helping Muslim women , but the author claiming that she knows better , for in her privilege - blinded mind , she is better .
She is not saving anyone , just asserting how superior she feels she is .
As a speaker of Arabic , I ’m sure she ’ll understand me when I say :
La , shukran ( No , thank you ) .

Republicans Denounce Pelosi for Warning Against ' Incitement '
By Paul Kane
The House Republicans ' top campaign chief strongly denounced Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's comments that appeared to question whether today 's angry conservative protests were similar to anti-gay rallies in the late 1970s that preceded the assassination of two San Francisco political leaders .
Rep. Pete Sessions ( Texas ) , chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee , said Pelosi crossed the line when she related the rhetoric of anti-gay protesters in San Francisco in 1978 -- the year Harvey Milk , the first openly gay member of the city 's board of supervisors , and his political ally , Mayor George Moscone , were killed by former supervisor Dan White -- to that of contemporary conservatives while answering a question about the protests against President Obama 's health - care proposals .
" The Speaker is now likening genuine opposition to assassination .
Such insulting rhetoric not only undermines the credibility of her office , but it underscores the desperate attempt by her party to divert attention away from a failing agenda , " Sessions said in a statement .
" During one of the most important policy debates of our time , the American people have been completely abandoned by those elected representatives under her control .
Voters are justifiably frustrated with Washington , and the Speaker 's verbal assault on voters accomplishes nothing other than furthering her reputation for being wildly out of touch with the American people . "
Unsure of who 's right in this debate ?
Decide for yourself .
Here is the full question and answer at Pelosi 's weekly press briefing , held every Thursday morning :
Q : Madam Speaker , in terms of the political tone , the tone of the debate , Hoyer said earlier this week he thought it was the most vitriolic since ' 93 -'94 .
And around that time we also saw acts of domestic violence , domestic terrorism .
How concerned are you about the tone of the political debate , in terms of people talking about anti-government rhetoric and so on and the possibility of violence ?
Speaker Pelosi :
Well , I think we all have to take responsibility for our actions and our words .
We are a free country , and this balance between freedom and safety is one that we have to carefully balance .
I have concerns about some of the language that is being used because I saw this , myself , in the late ' 70s in San Francisco .
This kind of rhetoric was very frightening , and it created a climate in which violence took place .
So I wish that we would all , again , curb our enthusiasm in some of the statements that are made , so that understanding that some of the people -- the ears that it is falling on are not as balanced as the person making the statement might assume .
But , again , our country is great because people can say what they think and they believe .
But I also think that they have to take responsibility for any incitement that they may cause .
The Reality of Fictitious Jobs
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 467,000 jobs were lost in June , bringing total non-farm employment down to 140.2 million , which , although bad , could have been worse , as I personally have n’t been fired yet , which is the only good news in the whole thing , as far as I can see .
The Bureau reports that , officially , “ The number of unemployed persons ( 14.7 million ) and the unemployment rate ( 9.5 % ) were little changed in June , ” which was helped by the fact that the labor force actually went down by the 358,000 people who stopped looking for work .
The tally so far is that “ Since the start of the recession in December 2007 , the number of unemployed persons has increased by 7.2 million , and the unemployment rate has risen by 4.6 percentage points ” , essentially doubling .
Bloomberg.com put it as “ The world ’s largest economy has lost about 6.5 million jobs since the recession began in December 2007 .
That ’s the biggest drop in any post - World War II economic slump . ”
Continuing the bad news , the Bureau goes on “ The number of long - term unemployed ( those jobless for 27 weeks or more ) increased by 433,000 over the month to 4.4 million ” , which does n’t even mention how shadowstats.com calculates unemployment at over 20 % the old - fashioned way like everybody did for the last zillion years or so before the loathsome Alan Greenspan and the equally odious Michael Boskin came up with new “ ways ” of measuring unemployment ( “ He ’s too stupid to get a job , so he does n’t count as unemployed ! ” ) , just as they did with “ hedonic indexing ” so as to disguise inflation ( “ You got fancy hubcaps on that car , so even though you paid a lot more than you did last year , the car is actually cheaper ! ” ) .
The reason for this is so that Alan Greenspan and his absurd Federal Reserve could raise their fat , worthless butts out of their chairs , point at the new low unemployment figure and low inflation figures , and then use the mostly - discredited Phillips Curve ( the theoretical tradeoff between inflation and unemployment ) to say , “ Unemployment and inflation are low !
We can now create more and more money and credit without anything happening to us , even though all the previous tons and tons of new money and credit that we already created have produced roaring bubbles in stocks , bonds , houses , derivatives and size of governments ! ”
The report , as part of a national conspiracy to silence the Message Of The Mogambo ( MOTM ) , did not make any mention whatsoever of my Disrespectful Mogambo Broadside ( DMB ) at these two despicable people and the result they had on unemployment statistics , but the report noted that the average work week fell to 33 hours ( down from 33.1 hours in May ) , which is the lowest average hours worked per week on record since records began in 1964 , which unsurprisingly reduced average weekly earnings down to $ 611.49 from $ 613.34 a week .
Fortunately , workers ’ average hourly wages were $ 18.53 , the same as last month , and which were nominally 2.7 % higher than June 2008 .
It was the smallest gain in quite a few years , but you probably did not notice that “ smallest gain in quite a few years ” remark since you were fixated on the fact that I said that average hourly wages were “ nominally ” higher , and now you are dispirited because you know that this means that I am going to go off on some loud , hysterical tangent about inflation and if you deflate that piddly 2.7 % gain in paychecks by the rate of inflation in the last year , you will doubtlessly notice that people ’s real , inflation - adjusted incomes have been going downhill , and for a long , long time , because wages have not kept pace with the increase in prices , which probably explains why so many people are so angry because they can’t afford to buy anything and I wo n’t loan them any more money .
Zerohedge.blogspot.com expands on that , and says , “ Over the past two months , it has become obvious that while continuing claims have doubled ( up 124 % to be precise from March 2007 ) , another , potentially more troubling observation is that Monthly Unemployment Payments have doubled the rate of increase in jobless claims ( 234 % from March 2007 based on the Treasury Daily Statement ) . ”
And all these unemployment checks are getting pretty expensive , as Zero says , “ In summary , over the past two years , while unemployment claims have climbed from 2,688 million in March 2007 to 6,157 in May 2009 , monthly unemployment payments have skyrocketed from $ 3,238 million to $ 10,807 million over the same time period ” and that the trend is that we will soon set a new record “ for unemployment benefits , at $ 12,354 million . ”
It was probably the blank look on my face that betrayed my utter confusion as how in the hell this is possible that prompted them to try and explain “ What all this means is that the Average Monthly Unemployment ‘ Paycheck ’ has exploded from on average $ 1,000 to $ 1,800 in recent months ( and over $ 2,000 for June ) . ”
And , again , the “ official ” unemployment figures were goosed by the government ’s CES Birth / Death Model , which estimates the number of jobs added by new business and those deleted by defunct companies that are all too new to be added to official statistics and they somehow divined that 185,000 jobs were somehow , somewhere , created .
Anthony Cherniawski of thepracticalinvestor.com says it ’s worse than that , and he wonders “ what the true unemployment numbers really are , since the CES model has added 879,000 fictitious jobs since February . ”
Fictitious jobs !
Perfect !
Fictitious jobs , fictitious competence in government , education and journalism , fictitious wealth in stocks , bonds , houses and derivatives , all made with fictitious money made of paper and bits of computer memory !
One can only be thankful ( “ Thank you ! ” ) for gold and silver , which have maintained their values for over 4,500 years when paper money , and most of the assets denominated in it , have all gone to zero value , a fact that should make you squeal with delight , “ Whee !
This investing stuff is easy ! ”
Wiley Drake , pastor of First Southern Baptist Church in Buena Park , California , has been asking his followers to pray for Barack Obama ’s death and was given the chance to discuss this with Alan Colmes :
Colmes : … you then said , I asked for whom else are you praying in that fashion and you said President Obama .
Are you praying for his death ?
Drake : Yes .
Colmes :
So you ’re praying for the death of the president of the United States ?
Drake : Yes .
Are you concerned that by saying that you might find yourself on some secret service call or FBI most wanted list .
Do you think it ’s appropriate to say something like that or even pray for something like that ?
Drake : I think it ’s appropriate to pray for the will of God .
I ’m not saying anything , what I ’m doing is repeating what God is saying , if that puts me on somebodies list then I ’ll just have to be on their list .
Colmes :
You would like for the president of the United States to die ?
Drake :
If he does not turn to God and does not turn his life around I am asking God to enforce in imprecatory prayers throughout the scripture that would cause him death , that ’s correct .
Trains and buses in New Jersey are failing to follow jobs and people to the historically rural counties that have seen the most population and employment growth , a transit advocacy group said .
The Tri-State Transportation Campaign report found that many of those areas lack convenient access to bus and rail service , which means more people driving to work .
The report , released Wednesday and first reported by the Asbury Park Press , covers a 10 - year period beginning in 1997 .
" Some of the counties experiencing the fastest population and employment growth in the state , such as Somerset , Ocean and Warren , have the least transit service , " the report said .
The group said the findings make the case that lawmakers need to find new revenue sources to support the state Transportation Trust Fund , which finances projects to expand transit service but could run out of cash in 2011 .
Ocean County saw the largest population growth between 1997 and 2007 , followed by Somerset and Gloucester counties , the report said .
Ocean County saw a 44 percent increase in vehicle miles traveled between 1999 , when data collection began on vehicle miles , and 2007 .
The rates for other counties over the same period were 28 percent in Hunterdon , 22 percent in Monmouth , 20 percent in Somerset and 16 percent in Morris .
But the figures reflect traffic trends before gasoline prices rose to record levels and before the recession , and the report notes that people have cut down on driving over the last two years .
The report finds an increase in mass transit ridership over the 10 - year period , although that form of travel , too , has leveled off .
Ridership on NJ Transit trains was down 2.6 percent during the first quarter of 2009 , agency spokesman Dan Stessel said today .
Stessel said the agency 's capital program has focused on expanding reach and improving connectivity between rail lines .
Park - and - ride lots have opened in Montclair , Mount Arlington , Ramsey and Wayne .
He said the agency expects the new Hudson River rail tunnel , scheduled for completion in 2017 , to expand the number of trains that can travel to and from Manhattan and open doors for additional service in the future .
NJ Transit is getting $ 424 million from the federal stimulus program that will fund 15 projects to improve the commute for riders and expand service to new customers , Stessel said .
The projects include a new parking lot in Edison and connecting the Atlantic City rail line with the River Line that serves Camden .

Transportation study ranks N.J. last in road conditions
More than seven years ago a group of Americans traveled to Siberia to buy a pair of Russian Mi-17 helicopters for the CIA 's post - 9/11 clandestine operations in Afghanistan .
As with many " black " programs , the contract had elements of craziness : Contracting officials paid the multimillion - dollar contract on a credit card at a local El Paso bar and then used the credit card rebate to redecorate their office ; the team traveled under the guise of being private contractors ; and the charter crew transporting the group abandoned the team in Russia in the middle of the night .
Ultimately , a five - year investigation into the mission led to the conviction of the Army official in charge and the contractor who bought the helicopters on charges of corruption .
The two men , currently in federal prison , are appealing their convictions .
At first glance , it 's a simple case : A few days after returning from Russia , the contractor paid off the second mortgage of the Army official in charge of the mission .
Prosecutors argued that the contractor , Maverick Aviation , was unprepared for the mission , and the Army official helped cover up the problems in exchange for a payoff .
The defendants at trial were barred from mentioning the CIA , Afghanistan or even 9/11 .
In an article for The New York Post , this author looks at what really happened in Siberia based on over two dozen interviews with people involved in the mission and trial .
It 's a story , that in some respects , is very different than the portrait painted by the government at trial .
One interesting comparison not mentioned in the article is worth noting in light of recent purchases of Russian helicopters :
In 2001 , Maverick Aviation was paid $ 5 million for two freshly overhauled Mi-17s and spare parts , as well as travel and logistics for team of Army / CIA personnel , and got the helicopters out of Russia in under 30 days .
In 2008 , ARINC , a major U.S. defense contractor , was paid $ 322 million dollars to buy 22 Russian helicopters under a U.S. foreign military sales contract .
Guess how many helicopters ARINC has delivered to Iraq after 18 months ?
Zero .

Sure , we should all give “ two ( very qualified ) cheers “  for Irving Kristol ( 1920 - 2009 ) , the tireless writer , political eminence grise , and longtime editor at Commentary , Encounter , The Public Interest , and The National Interest , who left this world last Friday .
Kristol was , on many levels , emblematic of a whole generation of American Jewish intellectuals .
His journey , recounted in histories and his own “ autobiographical “  writings , began in the legendary “  Alcove 1 ″  at the City College of New York , whose Trotskyist inhabitants engaged in rancorous dialectics with the Stalinists of Alcove 2 .
This City College dynamic informed Kristol ’s first decisive public stand after the war , as Kristol , and the rest of Alcove 1 , denounced the “ socialist perversion ”  of Stalin ’s USSR and firmly backed NATO as well as a vigorous , interventionist variation on “ containment . ” 
And when it came to the prevailing Zeitgeist , post - Trotskyism , or whatever it was exactly that Kristol advocated , was somehow it : Alcove 1 ’s stalwarts , Daniel Bell , Nathan Glazer , Seymour Martin Lipset , and Kristol among them , went on to fame and fortune ; Alcove 2 , which included Julius Rosenberg , was sent to the proverbial dustbin .
“ Cold War Liberalism ”  pretty much sums up Kristol ’s political philosophy throughout his entire adult life ; the “ neoconservative ”  moniker never indicated an actual conversion or apostasy so much as it served as a reminder that Kristol , and many others from Alcove 1 , had begun voting Republican by the early “ 80s .
The dissident Left had become the pragmatic center and eventually lionized and demonized as the ultra right - wing ” a development that reveals far more about the political trajectory of the American nation than it does about Irving Kristol ’s personal travails .
In his history of “  the rise of the neocons , ”  Jacob Heilbrunn recounts a moment ( a happy one , from my perspective ) in 1990 when the ultra neocon “  Committee for the Free World , ”  whose leadership included Kristol and his wife , Gertrude Himmelfarb , met and seriously considered that their movement might have just been rendered defunct by the collapse of the Evil Empire .
The conference ’s mood was reflected by its title , “  Does the “   West ”   Still Exist ? ”  ( the “  West , ”  of course , being defined by the Pentagon ’s latest strategy memo and the tastes and mores of Manhattan ’s Upper East Side ) .
The ultimate outcome was much more ironic : the conservative movement and neoconservatism absorbed one another to the point that the two are today practically indistinguishable .
The neocons ”  “ death ”  marked their greatest triumph , as Norman Podhoretz would observe at the close of the decade .
This aside , Kristol was one of the only neocons around who always called himself a neocon .
And for this , he should be praised ( the younger generation usually dismisses the term as either an insult or as anti-Semitic code . )
Kristol also did dissident conservatives a great service by explicitly defining neoconservatism as a leftish dogma foisted upon the Right when it was least expecting it ; in turn , the neocon ascendancy in the GOP and conservative movement was , in Kristol ’s treatment , something on the lines of a high - jacking :
[ T ]he historical task and political purpose of neoconservatism would seem to be this : to convert the Republican party , and American conservatism in general , against their respective wills , into a new kind of conservative politics suitable to governing a modern democracy .
Is neoconservativism conservative or right - wing ?
Probably not .
Is it American , Yes ( and here I think Kristol speaks the truth ) .
That this new conservative politics is distinctly American is beyond doubt .
There is nothing like neoconservatism in Europe , and most European conservatives are highly skeptical of its legitimacy . [… ]
Kristol ’s discussion of neocon governance is also quite revealing , especially when it comes to what we ” ve seen of the GOP and movement in and out of power :
Neocons do not like the concentration of services in the welfare state and are happy to study alternative ways of delivering these services .
But they are impatient with the Hayekian notion that we are on “ the road to serfdom . ”
Neocons do not feel that kind of alarm or anxiety about the growth of the state in the past century , seeing it as natural , indeed inevitable .
…
People have always preferred strong government to weak government , although they certainly have no liking for anything that smacks of overly intrusive government .
Neocons feel at home in today ’s America to a degree that more traditional conservatives do not .
Instead of defining specific functions for government , Kristol instead theorizes much like Goldilocks ”  the state should be “ strong ”   but not “ intrusive , ”  juuust riiight .
It ’s no coincidence that contemporary neocons , and their conservative underlings , have been rendered intellectually incapacitated when it comes to opposing the growth of the state .
This is a long - running trend , exemplified by Bill Kristol ’s call in late September of “ 08 for economic genius John McCain to return to Washington and “ save the economy ”  with more bailouts , and , as Grant Havers points out , Irving Kristol ’s critique of the “  New Class ”  of sociologists and managers within the Great Society that left the New Deal expansion of government untouched .
( Kristol fils , it ’s worth noting , backed FDR and LBJ all the way , as he divulged to E.J. Dionne in Commonweal a decade ago . )
And Irving Kristol wasn ” t just the godfather of George W. Bush ’s “ compassion ”   but of a long - term neocon power strategy .
While many conservatives and movement types might have , at one point , genuinely wanted to cut government programs and departments , the neocons only wanted to place other neocons in positions of power .
This elect , which understood the “ unintended consequences ”  and valued patriotic ( “ hard ”  ) military spending over liberal ( “ soft ”  ) welfare , was well suited to high posts in the Pentagon and the Reagan and Bush administrations .
Robert Nisbet understood this well in 1986 ( even though one must ignore his inaccurate labeling of the neocons as the “   Far Right ”  ) :
The Far Right is less interested in Burkean immunities from government power than it is in putting a maximum of government power in the hands of those who can not be trusted .
It is control of power , rather than diminution of power that ranks high .
Thus when Reagan was elected , conservatives hoped for the abolition of such government “ monstrosities ”  as the Department of Energy , the Department of Education , and the two National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities , all creations of the political Left .
The Far Right in the Reagan phenomenon saw it differently , however ; they saw it as an opportunity for retaining and enjoying the powers .
And the Far Right prevailed .
How the neocons ”  strategy would dovetail with GOP politics is obvious ( and is treated definitively by Paul Gottfried in his two books on the movement ( the latter of which includes the paragraph quoted above . ) )
Kristol is also worth remembering for the many pertinent questions his career brings up about culture , propaganda , and state power ” and “ unintended consequences , ”  those things the neocons made their careers studying at the Public Interest
As it was revealed in the mid-“ 60s , throughout the 25 years following the Second World War , the CIA was engaged in funding a variety of artistic and journalistic movements , all under the strained rationale of fighting the Soviets “ on the cultural front . ” 
Perhaps the most unusual of these schemes was the CIA ’s sponsorship of abstract art , and Abstract Expressionism in particular , as , somehow , America ’s alternative to Soviet art ( which at the time was associated with Socialist Realism and not , of course , the abstract and expressionist avant - garde that dominated Bolshevik / Soviet painting and sculpture up until the mid-“  30s . )
Nelson Rockefeller , who funneled a great deal of the CIA money through his Foundation , told his clueless comrades in Langley that Abstract Expressionism was “ free - enterprise ”  art ”  and thus must be funded by the state !
( Rockefeller ’s side interests in the United Nations and the “  No Growth , ”  population - reduction advocacy Club of Rome “ not to mention his back - room dealings with the CIA ” might lead one to question his devotion to “ free - enterprise . ”  )
The CIA ’s gift to world journalism was the “ anti-Soviet Left ”  : committed progressives , often times former Communists , who , for whatever reason , turned against Stalin and were likely to support a NATO presence in Western Europe and defend America against gauchiste critics — as Bill Kauffman described them , the kind of people who ” d demand that America wage war against The God That Failed .
The CIA ’s “ Council on Cultural Freedom ”  didn ” t fund only hacks ; Hannah Arendt , Arthur Koestler , George Orwell , and Isaiah Berlin all received funds .
Also getting laundered moolah was Daniel Bell and Irving Kristol , then the editors of the Pax Americana - lauding Encounter magazine .
The episode proves , among other things , that the CIA wasn ” t exactly the hotbed of natavist reaction and Anglo - Saxon elitism depicted in films like The Good Shepherd ( remember , “   [ WASPs own ] the United States of America .
The rest of you are just visiting . ”  ) .
As Frances Stonor Saunders recounts , “  Back at CIA headquarters in Washington , Encounter was regarded proudly as a “ flagship , ”  an effective vehicle for advancing the arguments for a pax Americana . ”
It even became a calling card for CIA agents .
Arranging a meeting with Ben Sonnenberg , a rich young wanderer who worked for the CIA in the mid-1950s , an agent told him , “ I ’ll be carrying a copy of Encounter , so you ’ll know who I am . ”
Josselson , the CIA agent who headed the Congress for Cultural Freedom , referred to it as “ our greatest asset ” .
In agency - speak an “ asset ” was “ any resource at the disposition of the agency for use in an operational or support role . ”

These polite James Bonds of the liberal Left thought they were funding the minds who ” d convert the acolytes of Sartre and Merleau - Ponty to “  Americanism ”  ; the unintended consequence was crucial early support for those who ” d 40 years on be known as the “  Far Right ”  of the Republican Party and who , in alliance with Southern evangelical Christians , would advocate for aggressive wars across the planet .
In looking back on all this , it ” d be nifty to say that the neocons are like LSD ” invented by CIA ( the difference being that Kristol and Co. have proven far more culturally damaging . )
But sadly , such an argument would be wrong .
The CIA funding was probably indispensable in the early years ; however , the idea that the neocons wouldn ” t have risen to dominance within American conservatism on their own is highly dubious
When in the 1980s , Pat Buchanan wrote about how the conservative “ dog ”  must shake off the neoconservative “ fleas ”  ( who had concluded they were steering the beast ) , he was sadly mistaken .
Pat underestimated the neocons ”  access to funding , their spiritedness in banding together in mutual defense and promotion , and , most of all , the utter spinelessness of movement conservatives .
Pat also underestimated the uniquely “ American ”  quality of neoconservatism , which Kristol described in his famous essay on his “ persuasion . ” 
Neocons were always well suited to flourish in a postwar America that , after subjecting Western and Central Europe to military and dollar hegemony , could prop up a consumer lifestyle as a kind of unalienable right .
Personal prosperity became equated ( somehow ) with America having military bases all over the world .
It ’s rather easy to see how in such a situation Americans would fall in love with conservatives who told them that they represented the zenith of “ freedom , ”  “ democracy , ”  and general goodness .
More difficult to articulate , though none the less important , is a certain American Puritan foundation myth ( which the neocons have consciously latched onto of late ) of the American people as “ chosen , ”  their land as a Second Jerusalem , and their task that of spreading this Good News across the world .
The urbane and mostly Jewish neocons ”  alliance with evangelical “ Christian Zionist ”  is a grotesque spectacle , to be sure , but it certainly couldn ” t have lasted as long as it has without a strong theological foundation .
Put simply , Americans might have been tempted to invent the neocons , if the CIA hadn ” t done so already .
Irving Kristol conceived of his country ’s identity as “ ideological , like the Soviet Union of yesteryear , ”  and argued that the U.S. would thus “ inevitably have ideological interests in addition to more material concerns . ” 
One wonders whether at the end Kristol grasped that his beloved Superpower was quickly going the way of the Evil Empire of old .
Dan Slater " argues that there are too many places at too many law schools " :
As firms begin an industrywide overhaul , which has entailed slashing jobs and reconsidering hidebound inefficiencies like the lockstep salary , students will compete for half as many $ 160,000 - a- year jobs this year as they did last .
According to the National Association for Legal Career Professionals , the 2008 recruiting season marked “ what is likely to be the beginning of a weaker legal employment market that may last for a number of years . ”
Meanwhile , as job opportunities abate , law school matriculation rates rise unchecked .
Each year , the number of students who enroll at one of 200 law schools approved by the American Bar Association inches closer to 50,000 .
I wrote about this problem a while back , arguing that law was a mature business whose long term demand for new lawyers was likely to have stabilized at a level below that of the ever - increasing supply of lawyers .
The post - war expansion of the regulatory state , the opening of the courthouse doors to new claims during the warren Court era , and the litigation explosion provided an exogenous shock that caused demand for lawyers to rise rapidly .
Following a fairly standard s- curve model , the demand for lawyers grew faster than the population and economic expansion would have predicted , driven by the aftermath of those shocks .
Over the last couple of decades , however , the market for lawyers has adapted to those shocks .
Because there have been no comparable major exogenous shocks affecting the demand for lawyers , the market has matured .
We would therefore predict that growth in the demand for lawyers would slow until it reaches a level that can be sustained by population and economic growth .
...
If law in fact is a mature industry , we face a problem of systemic oversupply .
The rate at which demand for new lawyers grows has permanently leveled off .
Economic recovery will help , but it will not change the fundamental structural changes in the market for lawyers .
Unfortunately , the growth in the number of law schools and size of entering classes at many law schools was premised on the assumption that the demand for lawyers would continue to rise at the high rate characteristic of the period , say , 1960 - 1990 .
Because that growth rate was artificially high due to the exogenous shocks of the preceding decades , the number of law schools and large law school class sizes no longer make sense .
Indeed , if law schools continue to grow in number and size at their current rate , the gap between demand for new lawyers and the number of new lawyers will continue to rise every year .
The solution is obvious , although how we can find the ability and the will to do it is not .
We have to reduce the number of law schools .
Just like GM has to close plants because of over - capacity , we in the law have to close some of our " factories . "
I have no idea who would lead this charge or how they would accomplish it .
No individual school would be willing to fall on its sword for the good of the whole .
Nor is there any collective law czar with the power or will to do anything .
Certainly , the American Bar Association is n't going to help , as Slater observes :
The American Bar Association , which continues to approve law schools with impunity and with no end in sight , bears complicity in creating this mess .
Yet a spokeswoman , citing antitrust concerns , says the A.B.A. takes no position on the optimal number of lawyers or law schools .
I guess we 'll have to trust the market .
Once word filters out to pre-law students about the state of the job market , maybe they 'll start looking elsewhere .
If admission applicants drop enough , maybe some of the bottom tier of schools will have to close for lack of qualified applicants .
( Or maybe they 'll just admit unqualified applicants . )
Do n't get me wrong .
Society still needs lawyers and we still need law schools .
We just do n't need as many as the American legal academy now produces .
Until the problem is fixed , students -- especially at the bottom tier schools -- are going to struggle to find jobs .
Worse yet , as they look for work , we might see an uptick in frivolous litigation .
As Ezra Klein observed
If we 're overproducing lawyers , though , there 's going to be a pernicious Say 's Law effect , wherein the oversupply of lawyers begins creating its own demand ( of lawsuits ) .
So everybody has an interest in finding a solution .
In response to a petition , the prime minister has apologised for the " appalling " treatment of computer scientist and code - breaker Alan Turing , who was given experimental chemical castration for being gay .
He committed suicide two years later , at the age of 41 .
Gordon Brown 's statement , published on the official Number10.gov.uk website , concludes : " on behalf of the British government , and all those who live freely thanks to Alan 's work I am very proud to say : we 're sorry , you deserved so much better . "
Turing made a significant contribution to computer science with his 1936 paper , On Computable Numbers , and came up with the concept of what we still call the Turing Test for intelligent machines .
However , he is best known for his code - breaking work at Bletchley Park during the second world war , where he helped to develop the Bombe that deciphered messages encoded using Enigma machines .
The prime minister 's apology says : " It is no exaggeration to say that , without his outstanding contribution , the history of World War Two could well have been very different .
He truly was one of those individuals we can point to whose unique contribution helped to turn the tide of war .
The debt of gratitude he is owed makes it all the more horrifying , therefore , that he was treated so inhumanely . "
The apology was prompted by an E - Petition at the Number10.gov site , which attracted more than 30,000 signatures .
The petition was launched by John Graham - Cumming , a computer scientist , blogger , and author of The Geek Atlas .
In early August , he wrote that : " If 500 people sign it there will eventually be a response from the government " .
It reached a much bigger audience with the backing of supporters such as Ian McEwan , Richard Dawkins , and gay - rights campaigner Peter Tatchell .
But as Graham - Cumming commented later : " You do n't have to be gay to think that prosecuting a man for a private consensual sex act who just seven years before had been hailed as a hero of the Second World War was simply wrong .
You simply have to be human . "
Even middle schoolers are protected from unreasonable search and seizure when it comes to the contents of their cell phones , according to the American Civil Liberties Union .
The organization has filed a lawsuit on behalf of a Mississippi middle - school honor student , alleging that a 2008 cell phone search and the sixth - grader 's subsequent expulsion were not only unnecessary , but also unconstitutional .
Southaven Middle School in Southaven , Mississippi has a policy against cell phone use during school hours , as many schools do nowadays .
In August of 2008 , 12 - year - old Richard Wade was discovered to be in violation of that policy after he received a text message from his father ( who was traveling out of state ) during " football class . "
That 's when his cell phone was confiscated by his football coaches and then searched by the principal , as well as the Southaven Police Department .
At that time , authorities found what they considered to be extremely scandalous , " gang - related activity " — that is , photos of Wade and a friend dancing in the bathroom at Wade 's home .
The friend held a BB gun across his chest while he danced .
Wade was suspended and then eventually expelled for having " gang signs " stored on his phone .
That 's when the ACLU got involved — the organization says that the football coaches , principal , and police violated Wade 's constitutional rights and even acted outside of the school 's policy of merely confiscating phones during school hours .
In its complaint , the ACLU quotes directly from the school district 's policy book that says students using cell phones in class will " have them taken by the teacher and turned into the office " for pickup by parents after school .
The book also has a policy saying that the first violation could result in a one - to three - day suspension as the maximum punishment ( Wade 's SMS incident was his first offense ) .
The ACLU says that authorities had no reason to suspect Wade of being a danger to the school and that they not only overextended their authority by searching the cell phone , school officials also overreacted by expelling Wade .
" As a result of this incident , R.W. has suffered and continues to suffer ongoing harm , including , but not limited to , missed school , a permanent negative report on his school record , and emotional distress , " reads the complaint .
The school has defended its decision by claiming officials reserve the right to look through confiscated phones to see if students were cheating on tests or conducting illegal activities , according to the Memphis Commercial Appeal .
However , this does n't appear to be stated in the district 's handbook , making it seem more like an unofficial policy .
The ACLU , of course , insists that students retain the right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure , even after walking through schoolhouse doors .
" The entire incident was a gross violation of Richard 's constitutional rights , including his right to freedom of speech .
Like most of us , Richard carries personal and private data on his cell phone , including photos that are for his own viewing , " ACLU staff attorney Kristy Bennett said .
There have been numerous lawsuits in recent years over students ' rights , and the number appears to be on the rise thanks to the proliferation of cell phones and the ubiquity of the Internet .
Even activities that appear to have taken place off of school grounds , such as questionable blog postings made from home , have become a subject of debate .
The ACLU has argued in the past that schools cannot restrict a student 's speech " anywhere it is uttered " simply because it 's vulgar and targets school officials , though the courts have not always agreed .

The only REAL VAMPIRE that has ever come public ( and proved himself ) is here :

He wrote a book about being a vampire and being alive for a really long time .
I can't remember how long he said but it was like a thousand years or something .
The cool part is that he answers peoples questions .
Picture the scene : you ’ve been trekking hard all day in the great outdoors , enjoying everything nature has to offer .
You ’ve set up camp and your canned cheeseburgers are bubbling gently on the fire .
As you watch the sun sink slowly behind the mountains the only thing missing is a cold beer .
Well … ( beer aficionados , you may want to stop reading now ) Katadyn , the Swiss - based company behind the Trek ’n ’ Eat canned cheeseburger and other high - tech , freeze - dried foods , has developed a world first – powdered beer – to wash it all down with .
Not a beer as such , the beverage powder will have a beer flavor and is non-alcoholic ( though we understand that an alcoholic brew is on the way next year ) .
If you really ca n’t do without the alcohol content you may wish to try Trek ’n Eat ’s red wine ( there is also a mulled wine for cold winter evenings ) , which has an alcoholic content of 8.2 % , similar to a light bottled wine .
Both the wine and the forthcoming beer powder work along the same lines as the company 's other products - just add water and enjoy .
The high - selling wine , however , has apparently been angering Italian winemakers who say the company has been copying their Chianti .
German newspaper Spiegel Online today published a story claiming a Tuscan farmers association said the product was a ' terrible copy ' and that wine - from - powder kits ' risk fooling less expert consumers on the real contents of the product on sale and damages the image of Italian and European production ' .
A representative of Katadyn ’s general management , Stefanie Dietrich , told Speigel , ' We are well aware that we 're not even permitted to call the product wine .
No grapes were used in its production , it 's simply a product that is flavored to taste like wine . '
The product has been on the market for eight years , however Deitrich said the company will take its wine powder off the market next year when it introduces the beer powder .
Trek 'n
Eat offer a range of products that can be enjoyed with wine or beer , so mountaineering gourmands wo n't have to go hungry or thirsty .
Towels would seem to be such a utilitarian object that they could never need any sort of optimization .
As your towels age however , their absorbency decreases .
Boost them back to their glory days with this simple hack .

If you 're in the habit of using the amount of detergent recommended on the bottle , which is almost always way more than you need , and then hitting towels with fabric softener or dryer sheets you 're setting yourself up for towels that lose their absorbency and can even begin to stink .

That 's right , most of the time stinky towels are n't a result of failing to wash your towels enough but using too much detergent and fabric softener .
The short of it is this : more is n't better and over time soap residue can accumulate within the fibers of the towels ensuring that not only do they fail to absorb as much water as they can but they also do n't dry as effectively as they should .
When your towels seem to get a funky smell immediately upon getting wet again , failure to dry completely thanks to soap residue is usually the culprit .
What can you do ?
Saving your towels is as simple as running them through two hot loads .
Skip the detergent on both loads , run them through once with hot water and a cup of vinegar and then again with hot water and a half cup of baking soda .
Your goal , whether washing brand new towels or old towels , is to strip the softener and detergent reside from the fibers of the towel and get them as absorbent as possible .

How to Make New Towels More Absorbent [ WikiHow ]
Washington ’s Blog

President Obama said yesterday :
the quality of journalism in the mainstream media has eroded considerably , and news has been corporatized , politicized , and trivialized .
Rather also pointed out that “ roughly 80 percent ” of the media is controlled by no more than six , and possibly as few as four , corporations .
As I wrote in July :
This is only newsworthy because Rather said it .
This fact has been documented for years , as shown by the following must - see charts prepared by : Media Channel The Nation Free Press
And check out this list of interlocking directorates of big media companies from Fairness and Accuracy in Media , and this resource from the Columbia Journalism Review to research a particular company .
This image gives a sense of the decline in diversity in media ownership over the last couple of decades :
As I have also documented , there are four major problems with the mainstream reporting :
Widespread self - censorship by journalists
Censorship from editors and producers
Pro-war bias
Government censorship
( Oh , and also moolah )
Moreover , as I wrote in March :
The whole debate about blogs versus mainstream media is nonsense .
In fact , many of the world ’s top PhD economics professors and financial advisors have their own blogs …
The same is true in every other field : politics , science , history , international relations , etc .
So what is “ news ” ?
What the largest newspapers choose to cover ?
Or what various leading experts are saying – and oftentimes heatedly debating one against the other ?
As blogger Michael Rivero pointed out years ago , mainstream newspapers are n’t losing readers because of the Internet as an abstract new medium .
They are losing readers because they have become nothing but official stenographers for the powers - that - be , and people have lost all faith in them .
Indeed , only 5 % of the pundits discussing various government bailout plans on cable news shows are real economists .
Why not hear what real economists and financial experts say ?
To the extent that blogs offer actual news and the mainstream media does not , the latter will continue to lose eyeballs and ad revenues to the former .
In reality , the best blogs offer far more fact - checking and context then the mainstream media .
I am concerned that if the direction of the news is all blogosphere , all opinions , with no serious fact - checking , no serious attempts to put stories in context , that what you will end up getting is people shouting at each other across the void but not a lot of mutual understanding .

Comment on this article
In July 1978 , at the age of thirteen , Brooke Shields made front page news in Photo Magazine .
The young American film prodigy was promoting the film Pretty Baby directed by Louis Malle .
In the magazine , a ten - year old Brooke is shown wearing makeup , her glistening body posed naked in a bathtub .
The picture comes from a series taken by Garry Gross , an advertising photographer from New York who was regularly employed by Brooke ’s mother to photograph her daughter , then a model with the Ford agency .
At the time , Gross was working on a project for publication entitled The Woman in the Child , in which he wanted to reveal the femininity of prepubescent girls by comparing them to adult women .
Brooke Shields posed for him both as a normal young girl and in the nude , her body heavily made up and oiled , receiving a fee of $ 450 from Playboy Press , Gross ’s partner in the project .
Her mother signed a contract giving Gross full rights to exploit the images of her daughter .
The series was first published in Little Women , and then in Sugar and Spice , a Playboy Press publication .
Large prints were also exhibited by Charles Jourdan on 5th Avenue in New York .
In 1981 , however , Brooke Shields wanted to prevent further use of these pictures and tried unsuccessfully to buy back the negatives .
A legal battle then began between Shields and Gross with Gross being sued for a million dollars .
Brooke Shields claimed that her mother had agreed to give up her rights for one publication only and that the photographs caused her embarrassment .
In addition , they had been published , and would probably be published again , in revues of dubious morality .
Her lawyers immediately obtained a provisional measure forbidding the use of the pictures until the end of the trial .
The case was won by Gross with the court considering the contract signed by Brooke Shields ’ mother to be valid and binding on her daughter .
Brooke Shields appealed and once again obtained a provisional ban on the use of the photographs .
Finally , after a procedure lasting for two years , the appeal court confirmed that Brooke could not invoke her right to annul the contract and that she was legally bound by her mother ’s signature .
The court once again reaffirmed Gross ’s right to freely exploit the use of the pictures other than in a pornographic context .
After the failure of their arguments concerning the validity of the contract , Brooke ’s lawyers decided on a new strategy , attacking Gross for violation of Brooke Shields ’ privacy .
The actress claimed that the publication of the images caused her distress and embarrassment .
Brooke Shields ’ acting career , however , weakened the credibility of this argument since it had clearly been built by projecting an explicitly sexual image of herself .
Whatever the case , the court considered that “ these photographs are not sexually suggestive , provocative or pornographic , nor do they imply sexual promiscuity .
They are pictures of a prepubescent girl posing innocently in her bath ” .
The court rejected all Brooke Shields ’ claims and decided in Gross ’s favour .
The trial however , had ruined him financially and had tarnished his reputation .
In addition , a change in attitudes towards the “ politically correct ” had sullied the photographs .
The story , nevertheless , had an unexpected development .
In 1992 , a contemporary artist called Richard Prince approached Gross about buying the rights to use and reproduce the image of Brooke Shields .
In his artistic work , Prince appropriates pictures by rephotographing them , recontextualizing them and giving them a title .
The picture of Brooke Shields , for example , is entitled Spiritual America .
Gross was willing to retrocede his rights to Prince for a series of ten prints .
Prince became a star of the contemporary art scene and his picture was sold at Christies in 1999 for $ 151,000 .

For about the last 10 years the United States has been experimenting with consumer driven health care plans .
CDH plans typically combine a high - deductible insurance policy with a health savings account or health reimbursement account .
CDH plans now cover well over 8 million individuals , up considerably from 4.5 million in 2007 and these types of plans continue to grow rapidly .
So what have been the results ?
The American Academy of Actuaries has recently produced a review of high quality research on these plans .
Here are their conclusions :
The primary indications are that properly designed CDH plans can produce significant ( even substantial ) savings without adversely affecting member health status .
To the knowledge of the work group , no data - based study has emerged that presents a contrary view .
Cost - savings in the first year of instituting a CDH plan relative to a traditional plan ranged from 12 % to 21 % , remarkably large figures .
Moreover , costs appear to grow more slowly under CDH plans than under traditional plans .
The knock on CDH plans has always been that they could cause people to avoid preventative case .
Not only does this appear to be false it ’s the opposite of the truth :
Generally , all of the studies indicated that cost savings did not result from avoidance of inappropriate care and that necessary care was received in equal or greater degree relative to traditional plans .
All of the studies reported a signficant increase in preventative services for CDH participants .
Especially interesting is that some of the studies found that CDH plans resulted in better compliance with evidence - based care .
Note that these results come from CDH plans instituted within the current system .
One would expect that the general equilibrium effects of consumer driven health plans would be even larger than the partial equilibrium effects , see Singapore for evidence ( but consider Tyler ’s remarks ) .
The American Academy of Actuaries is a credible organization but I would like to see more of the underlying data .
All of the studies the AAA reviewed used credible methodologies , controlled for selection and were based on substantial data but the major studies so far have been industry funded .
It ’s remarkable that in the current debate over how to control health care costs so little attention is being given to the important results of our 10 - year experiment with consumer driven health plans .
Everything Joel Salatin Does is Illegal
Joel Salatin
The problems associated with the way we ’ve chosen to feed our population include food borne pathogens from robust strains of antibiotic resistant pathogens , diabetes , obesity , water pollution , increased green house gasses , and a general disconnect between ourselves and real food .
We wander the grocery store , reaching for whatever processed corn product we feel most suits our appetite .
The source of our meals is more often the factory than the farm .
Still , we idealize the pastoral .
We imagine the farmer on his beat - up tractor , or smiling happily as he feeds his livestock , or walking through his golden fields of waving grain .
But anymore , the small farm is rarity .
We may not see it in Portland , where we can find a farmers market ever single day of the week for most of the year .
We may take it for granted that we ’ve been able to develop a regional system of small farms supported by a healthy community .
This is truly an agricultural Shangri-la .
The majority of America is not so lucky .
Enter Joel Salatin and Polyface Farms .
Salatin is an outspoken agriculture revolutionary with designs to redeem our food system .
His farm has become a symbol for a new way of growing food .
Well , not actually a new way .
Salatin has discovered that the best way to farm the land and feed the community is to do exactly what nature has been doing for millions of years .
His remarkable agricultural philosophy has been featured in Michael Pollan ’s The Omnivore 's Dilemma , and most recently the foodie horror film , Food , Inc .
An author himself , Salatin also has a large body of work with several titles under his belt , including Everything I Do Is Illegal : War Stories from the Local Food Front and Holy Cows & Hog Heaven : the Food Buyer ’s Guide to Farm Friendly Food .
He speaks Thursday , August 13th , in a benefit for the Hollywood Farmers Market , at the Friendship Masonic Center [ 5626 NE Alameda ] , 7 pm . Tickets are $ 25 available by calling 709-7403 or by emailing tickets@hollywoodfarmersmarket.org .
I spoke with Salatin yesterday about his farm , the future of food , and how we can help change the system .
Interview After The Jump !
Cows , Drugs , Politics !
Joel ’s parents William and Lucille Salatin purchased what would become Polyface Farms in 1961 .
The land had been occupied and used by numerous intermittent tenant farmers for decades , and over that time had been essentially ruined .
William had learned about growing food in an environmentally sensitive and chemical free way from his father , a prolific gardener and charter subscriber to Rodale ’s Organic Gardening and Farming Magazine when the term organic was invented in the 1940’s .
The tactics of ecological stewardship led William on his quest to rehabilitate the land .
A generation later and without the use of chemicals , Joel Salatin presides over a vibrant farm barely recognizable from its gullied past ; an interdependent cyclical system that keeps the livestock healthy and vital , and the land fertile .
How did you come up with these farming practices ?
Was it just trial and error ?
There ’s always trial and error .
But there were several bedrock principles that drove the ideas .
As soon as you have a bedrock value then you have to figure out how to make it work .
We did n’t want to use chemicals .
If we ’re not going to use chemicals then how are you going to fertilize ?
How are you going to deal with bugs ?
How do you deal with thistles and weeds ?
All of those questions force you into creativity mode rather than dropping back and punting with chemicals .
Another foundation was that we were only going to use soil building principles and not soil depleting principles .
We wanted to see more earthworms and deeper soil and not thinner soil and fewer earth worms .
So you look at that and ask , “ How do you do that ? ”
How does nature do that ?
You start to realize that nature is based on perennials not annuals , and so very early on there was this grass based idea ; this perennial grass base , where we would not be a farm that practiced tillage , but rather a farm that ran primarily on perennial forages .
So we did n’t have a plow , or a disk , or any of those kinds of typical farming implements .
When I speak to folks I was tell them , “ Get your philosophy squared away because your philosophy will drive your innovation and not the other way around . ”
You do n’t start with a namby - pamby philosophy and then innovate and stumble into a wonderful philosophy .
Was all of this apparent form the outset ?
You have to understand that as poor as the fertility was on the farm , it ’s just like anything in healing .
If you skin your finger , for example , the first couple days it does n’t look like there ’s anything going on , then there ’s a biological speed - up in healing .
The first part is pretty slow going .
And that ’s the way it was for us .
We did n’t see much progress for the first couple of years — for several years in fact .
But we kept chopping thistles .
We kept composting .
We kept moving the cows around , and you know , really huge differences started happening about year 12 to 15 .
Once we started moving the cows everyday , and everything became refined — tweaked , more tightly controlled , tighter biomimicry — then that leverage created a synergistic explosion of healing .
In just ten years we went from a farm that could scarcely support 20 cows to one that supported 100 cows with ease
Tell me more about biomimicry .
One of our bedrock values is that we ’re trying to use nature as a template in a commercial domestic production model .
Look , for example , at herbivores .
They do n’t eat fermented forage , like silage , they do n’t eat grain , and they certainly do n’t eat chicken manure , dead chickens or dead cows [ all common food in Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations ] .
So , if we ’re going to raise herbivores , we ’re going to not feed those kinds of things to them .
We ’re also going to look at herds of herbivores in nature and determine how they live , what they eat , and what they do .
What we noticed is they do n’t spread out over a pasture ; they ’re mobbed up for predator protection .
They move every day to a new spot , and new grass , and away from yesterdays toilet area .
They mow .
They ’re not eating grain like in a feed lot .
So when you start taking those principles , like a pattern or a template , and start laying them down on domestic production then that pushes us .
How can we get them in a mob ?
We use electric fencing and we move them everyday to a new spot .
All that this is is simply trying to duplicate what buffalo , wolves , fire , and Native Americans were doing for a millennia before Europeans came .
That ’s all it is .
That model , that technique , is what built the fertile prairies that we ’re still exploiting in the grain basket of America .
Why do you think this idea of biomimicry is not more widely espoused ?
Hubris .
I think it ’s just our human arrogance and pride that we think we can outfox nature .
We ’ve gotta understand that in our western culture we are a product of fragmentation , compartmentalization , systemization , disconnectedness , and individualism .
All of that essentially says there ’s no moral or ethical parameter on what I can innovate .
So we ’ve innovated things that we cannot physically , spiritually , or emotionally metabolize .
We ’ve innovated chemicals that make three legged salamanders and unfertile frogs .
Some of us in our culture realize it ’s probably not a good future for our children where the salamanders have three legs and the frogs are sterile .
To most in our culture , they do n’t realize it , or they do n’t care because it does n’t show up on a balance sheet , business plan , or tax statement .
So the most important thing , intuitively , in our hearts , never makes an empirical impression in our business plans and management .
It ’s the ultimate segregation .
The obvious extension of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations is a new generation of antibiotics that are hopefully one step ahead of the pathogens genetic progression .
And I do n’t know about you , but I ’m not willing to bet that human cleverness will be able to do that indefinitely .
Yet , that ’s exactly what our culture is betting on : irradiation , pharmaceuticals , vaccines , and all sorts of cleverness to stay one step ahead of the adaption of pathogens .
I think more and more Americans are realizing that ’s not a winnable bet .
Tell me a bit about the food safety bill [ H.R. 875 , currently in consideration in the US Senate ] .
It wo n’t lead to any safer food .
It ’s an industrial attempt to demonize , marginalize , and criminalize the true antidote , which is pasture based , diversified , locally commerced food .
That is absolutely the antidote for the food safety issues that we ’re seeing .
Yet this bill absolutely will , if not destroy , then certainly maim the local food system .
What are the biggest barriers this bill presents for farmers ?
The biggest one , in my opinion , is a provision to give the FDA unprecedented power to make warrantless searches on any American farm to determine if practices are “ science based . ”
“ Science based ” is a very subjective term .
I think that what we do is science based but the USDA , [he pronounces it U.S. “ duh ” ] does not believe that what we do is science based .
When they say “ science based ” they ’re talking about drugs , and vaccines , and pharmaceuticals , and cloning , and a host of other things .
That ’s science based .
Again , this is a perfect example of the pushback as our system gains credibility and acceptance in the marketplace .
This is an example of our industrial food system manipulating our lawmakers and the USDA to keep us on the fringes — to basically put this heritage food “ in the teepees , ” if you will , so it ca n’t continue to erode market share .
It ’s not about food safety , it ’s about controlling market access .
How do you combat this kind of thing ?
Do n’t feed the beast .
Do n’t eat industrial food .
Easier said than done .
The best way to not eat industrial food is to buy local , unprocessed , and process it in your own kitchen by freezing , drying , cooking , sautéing , pureeing , and all the other domestic culinary skills we ’ve developed over the years .
What you ’ll find is not only does it make better tasting food , and not feed the industrial beast , but also it ’s cheaper .
Processed food is extremely expensive .
Compare the ten cent per pound Idaho baking potato to the five dollar per pound potato chip .
We need to be eating as close to the source as possible and discovering our kitchens — relearning domestic culinary skills .
The point I ’m trying to make is that so many people think there ’s nothing they can do until there ’s some law , or that we need legislation .
No .
We do n’t need laws , we just need to quit patronizing the industrial beast and it will die of attrition .
Collectively , you and me , and your readers , one forkful at a time , one meal at a time , can choose which system is going to gain ascendency and which one is going to be malnourished .
Is there a place for politics , though ?
It ’s great to contact your senators .
It ’s great to be opposed to this particular bill .
The alternative legislation would be what I call a “ Freedom of Choice ” bill , which would allow every American to purchase whatever kind of food they want .
Right now , if you want to purchase a glass of raw milk you ca n’t purchase it .
We need to bring freedom of choice back into the marketplace .
What ’s interesting to me , is that in order to have consistent political philosophy on this , then we need to stop our War on Drugs .
It ’s not reasonable to say , “ Give me the freedom to drink raw milk , ” when all of the public health experts say that it ’s not a safe thing , and then tell them , “ I do n’t want people to be able to take cocaine or marijuana if they want to take it . ”
And I ’m a pretty conservative religious - righter .
Boy it ’s an amazing thing when I tell my buddies that they have to give up the War on Drugs .
But if we give it up and gain food freedom , it would be a great trade - off .
The fact is , when the government gets between my mouth and my stomach , that ’s a pretty intrusive government .
The only reason our founding fathers did not give us the right to food freedom , is because they could not have foreseen the day when a neighbor could not get a t - bone steak or a glass of raw milk from a neighbor .
Will we ever be able to overcome our desire for convenience ?
I ’m not saying we should outlaw industrial food .
What I am saying is that we should have a freedom of choice option for those who want to opt out .
If you want to live on Fritos and coca - cola , that suits me just fine .
But all you who are doing that , and driving up healthcare costs with diabetes and obesity , do n’t outlaw a healthy alternative for me .
Right now in the food system we ’re at Wounded Knee .
By the time of Wounded Knee , the thought of the Native American population uprising and taking over the Unites States was a ludicrous idea .
There was no threat to the culture from the Native Americans , and yet it was the thinking among our culture at that “ this barbaric people needed to be extinguished and annihilated . ”
That ’s the problem of this food issue today .
If Monsanto wants to make some sort of pseudo , food - extracted , cloned , genetically - modified something - or - other - material and label it food , that ’s fine with me .
The problem is that the Monsantos and Tysons view me as a threat .
They say my non-science based chickens will destroy the entire worlds food system because of my lack of appreciation for science based food practices .
The industrial food system is not willing to live in peace with a healthful alternative .
Let ’s assume that raw milk was deadly .
If I want to drink it , that ’s my prerogative .
It ’s just that the people who have sold their souls to the industrial food system are not willing to live with an alternative , they want to destroy it .
People are looking to their own land to help remove themselves from the industrial food complex .
Is your method of biomimicry scalable to any plot of land ?
That ’s one of the beauties of our system .
It ’s scalable up and down because the capital is not in infrastructure but in knowledge .
Whenever you have a knowledge based infrastructure it ’s not scale dependant .
It can be done anywhere .
It can be done with three chickens .
You shut down your garbage disposal , feed your scraps to the chickens , the chickens give you two eggs a day and when their done you have chicken meat .
To me it just makes all sorts of sense .
There ’s a tremendous amount of good food security there .
Also , there is about 18 million acres of lawn in the US , and you could almost feed the entire US on the lawns of America .
The system we have now is totally abnormal and unique in all of human history .
It ’s important to realize that in the continuum of history we are a veritable blip of experimentation .
If you ’re gonna bet on what tomorrow will look like , the chances are tomorrow will look much more like the recent past than what we have going on today .
The best bet is that we will not continue to thrive on food that sat for a month in the belly of a Chinese freighter .
No civilization in history , as its heritage based food system began crumbling , survived for long .
That ’s pretty bleak .
It ’s only bleak if you ’re unwilling to embrace a time tested “ normal ” existence .
If your whole world revolves around Paris Hilton and the next Blockbuster Video release then its bleak indeed , because the thought of donning an apron , and canning some tomatoes , and learning how to use some of that kitchen gadgetry is daunting .
But I can assure you that there are thousands and thousands of young people connecting to the ecological umbilical that attaches us to this nest .
So what kind of advice do you have for people who need help to navigate a world without industrial food ?
I take a very pragmatic view .
1 ) You do n’t have to change it all in a day .
Change a little bit at a time .
2 ) The change has to occur in your heart .
As you change , you will begin to adapt .
One of those adaptations will be simply to become hypersensitive and aware of things that you never were before .
3 ) You ’ve heard the phrase “ If it ’s worth doing , it ’s worth doing right . ”
I ’ll free you from that by giving you the real statement : “ If it ’s worth doing , it ’s worth doing poorly . ”
No -one does it right the first time .
Who ever tells their kid learning to walk , “ Look , kid , if you ca n’t stand up and walk then do n’t even try . ” ?
From my perspective , if it ’s worth doing , it ’s worth doing poorly first because that ’s the way all things are done early - on .
You do n’t have to worry about that first pound cake looking like aunt Matilde ’s because that ’s the way you remember it from childhood .
You start into it and you just enjoy doing it poorly .
As you begin visiting farms , or visiting the farmers market , or joining a CSA — you read , you talk , and your interest will guide your knowledge base .
You ’ll move forward by default .
Farmers markets are a great place to start .
Also , Eatwild.com is a national directory of pasture based livestock producers .
Take the money you were saving up for vacation and invest it in a treasure hunt to find what ’s available in your community .
Every single community has great farms .
Many of them are desperately struggling for sales and for patrons .
Eaters need to unplug themselves from all the fluff and fuzziness of life , and at least devote one year to treasure hunting their communities , to find this gold buried in their backyard .
Not only will it be an exciting discovery time , putting on your Indiana Jones hat , but it will also give you some stories that are every bit as good as a trip to Disneyland .
When Whole Foods arrived in the UK two years ago it was hailed as a mecca for those determined to follow a healthy diet .
But today the struggling US store 's chief executive will probably want to eat his words after admitting that , alongside the organic carrots and bags of granola , the shops " sell a bunch of junk " .
The comments came in an interview in which John Mackey was attempting to outline plans for the store to put more emphasis on healthy eating – amid suggestions that it has recently indulged consumer cravings for more indulgent offerings .
He went on to say that Whole Foods was going to launch a healthy eating education initiative to encourage customers and employees to reduce obesity .
But Mackey told the Wall Street Journal : " Basically , we used to think it was enough just to sell healthy food , but we know it is not enough .
We sell all kinds of candy .
We sell a bunch of junk . "
He said the store would now attempt to educate in the ways of healthy eating : " There will be someone in a kiosk to answer questions , they 'll have cookbooks and health books , there will be some cooking classes .
It will be about how to select food , because people do n't know . "
His comments come as Whole Foods reels from bad news .
Jeff Turnas , who was parachuted in to take charge of the group 's faltering UK operation last month , said Mackey 's words " had been lost in translation " , saying that what his boss meant was that eating too many crisps or cakes even if they are organic is not the best way to keep healthy .
The main Whole Foods store is in Kensington , west London , and it runs a handful of convenience stores , formerly trading as Fresh & Wild in parts of London .
But its British foray has been an unhappy one .
The group made an operating loss for the year to 30 September 2008 of £ 36 m , widening from a £ 9.9 m shortfall for the previous 12 months .
Its parent company , Whole Foods Market Inc , has been forced to write off almost £ 50 m as part of the effort to establish a foothold in the UK .
Mackey said Whole Foods would attempt to rid its stores of unhealthy food , starting with a campaign to get its employees healthier , and would be going back to its roots in selling healthy food .
" Right now , if you work for the company you get a 20 % discount card , " Mackey said .
" We 're going to create incentives for our team members to get healthier . "
Mackey said Whole Foods is going back to its roots of selling healthy food .
" Healthy eating went on at Whole Foods from at least about 1980 to 1995 .
Now we 've had a 15 year run for the foodie philosophy .
We are launching a reversal now .
We will be moving into food as health . "
ATLANTA | Angel Haro - Perez certainly did n’t look like a drug lord .
Police and federal agents arrested him in December 2007 in a rented house in a lower - middle - class neighborhood about a half - hour ’s drive from downtown Atlanta .
The raised ranch is tucked off the interstate , where billboards advertise $ 69.99 motel rooms and secondary highways are dotted with strip malls and commercial shipping centers .
Inside , agents found air mattresses on the floor , a few changes of clothes , a laptop computer .
And $ 750,000 in cash stuffed in closets .
“ You ’d see this guy on a street corner and you ’d say , ‘ He could barely rub two nickels together , ’ ” said Rodney Benson , special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration ’s Atlanta Field Division , “ never mind he ’s here directly taking orders from representatives in Mexico . ”
Authorities say Mr. Haro - Perez was the Atlanta head of the Gulf Cartel , one of Mexico ’s most powerful drug - trafficking organizations , in charge of distributing drugs , collecting proceeds and keeping the books for the entire operation .
Mr. Haro - Perez ’s lawyer , Thomas Wooldridge , says his client is an American citizen who has no connection to Mexican drug cartels and was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time .
He faces life in prison and is scheduled for trial later this month .
Authorities say Mr. Haro - Perez is typical of cartel members and associates working in the U.S. :
They keep a low profile , avoid violence and work quietly to traffic tons of drugs — cocaine , heroin , marijuana and methamphetamine — into the U.S. while smuggling billions of dollars back across the border .
And they do it while remaining virtually invisible to the community and general public .
While brutal violence among drug - trafficking groups in Mexico , especially along the U.S. border , has drawn unprecedented attention from politicians , the media and the American public , among U.S. law enforcement officials , the cartels are old news .
They ’ve been seeping into American cities for more than a decade ; a 2008 report noted the presence of distribution networks linked to them in 203 cities throughout the U.S .
In that time , the metropolitan Atlanta region has emerged as one of the nation ’s richest drug - distribution hubs , which authorities say supplies most of the eastern U.S.
In 2008 , DEA agents in the Atlanta region led the U.S. with $ 70 million in drug - related seizures .
A perfectly placed hub
The Atlanta region has always been perfect for the shipping industry .
On a map , the city appears to have spokes with highways jutting out in all directions .
Drug traffickers have taken advantage of this .
“ This is a place where I ’d expect a business model like UPS to start up , ” said Jack Kilorin , head of Atlanta ’s federal High - Intensity Drug Trafficking Area , which analyzes drug intelligence and helps coordinate law enforcement response .
The cartels “ have exploited a highway and communications and transportation hub .
They ’re thugs , but they are not entirely stupid . ”
TWT RELATED STORY :
• Mexican cartels fill voids in drug trade
Trucks leaving the region can reach more than 80 percent of the U.S. population within two days , according to the Atlanta Metro Chamber of Commerce .
“ There ’s all kinds of warehouses , ” the DEA ’s Mr. Benson said .
“ So there ’s all kinds of ability to rent a warehouse one day and use it for three or four months and switch over and the ease of coming off a truck stop and parking with a load of cocaine concealed in , say , a load of produce . ”
The drugs and , later , money — sometimes as much as $ 10 million in heat - sealed , tamper - proof containers — frequently are packaged on trucks shipping all manner of legitimate goods .
Sometimes the drivers are in on it , authorities say ; sometimes not .
U.S. Attorney David Nahmias , whose district includes metro Atlanta , likes to tell the story of the time agents found $ 1 million hidden in barrels of pig parts being shipped to Mexico .
“ I remember it because the agents still talk about having to throw away their clothes after diving into these barrels , ” he said .
“ But that ’s a good example of how sophisticated and how hard these things are to find . ”
The Atlanta region ’s changing demographics also have allowed it to take its place among the nation ’s traditional drug hubs , which include border towns like Laredo , Texas , and port cities like Miami .
“ The thing we always say which seems most stunning to people is we now ship more drugs from Atlanta to Florida than we get we from Florida , including occasionally shipping cocaine to Miami , which is remarkable , ” Mr. Nahmias said .
Just northeast of Atlanta , Gwinnett County , where Mr. Haro - Perez was arrested , has become a ground zero of sorts for Mexican drug cartels , according to authorities .
The county ’s population has more than doubled since 1990 , and authorities say the Hispanic , particularly Mexican , population has exploded with a mixture of both legal and illegal immigrants .
According to U.S. Census data , Hispanics made up less than 2.5 percent of Gwinnett County ’s population in 1990 , a number that increased to 11 percent in 2000 and was up to 16 percent by 2007 .
“ We emphasize that the vast majority of those people have nothing to do with drug dealing , but what they do is they allow the Mexican cartels , almost all of whose operatives are Mexican , to hide in plain sight , ” Mr. Nahmias said .
Fifteen years ago , he said , four young Hispanic men coming in and out of a house at all hours of the night might make neighbors suspicious .
Now they could be painters or construction workers , and there could be 10 other households like theirs on a street .
And so , he says , “ It ’s much harder to tell that one of them is a drug stash house where there are 100 kilos of cocaine or $ 10 million . ”
Kidnappings and killings
In the world of drug trafficking , there are no arbitrators or high - priced lawyers to settle business disputes .
Violence is conflict resolution .
The oft - repeated number of more than 10,000 killed during the past two years in Mexico ’s drug war , which includes assassinations and beheadings , has sparked outrage and driven interest .
Drug cartels operating in America have n’t engaged in nearly that level of violence , though authorities remain fearful , especially about the safety of law enforcement officers as raid after raid has revealed the cartels to be extremely well - armed .
They ’ve carried out kidnappings and killings near the border in places such as Phoenix and even as far from the border as Alabama .
In a well - publicized case near Birmingham , four men were tortured and killed and their throats slit in retaliation over an apparent drug debt .
The Atlanta region had its own well - publicized kidnapping .
In July , Oscar Reynoso , a 31 - year - old Dominican national , was lured from Rhode Island to the Atlanta area under the guise of bringing a car title to a man identified only as Tio in court documents .
The DEA describes him as an upper - management level member of the Gulf Cartel .
Mr. Reynoso also owed a $ 300,000 drug debt to Tio , who authorities say has links to both Atlanta and Dallas .
Tio met Mr. Reynoso outside a Waffle House restaurant and drove him in a Jeep Wrangler to a stately Colonial in a nearby neighborhood of cul - de- sacs in Lilburn , about seven miles from Mr. Haro - Perez ’s working - class neighborhood .
They drove onto a street called East Fork Shady Drive , past signs warning of running children and over speed bumps that help enforce the 20 mph speed limit .
When Tio pulled the Jeep into the garage , Mr. Reynoso told authorities , seven men with guns lay in wait .
He was beaten and dragged into the basement beneath handsome hardwood floors .
His captors bound him to a metal chair with chains around his ankles and zip ties around his wrists .
They covered his mouth with black tape .
He was held hostage for the better part of a week before he was rescued by DEA agents who learned of the kidnapping from a wiretap .
Agents arrested three Mexican nationals who had entered the U.S. illegally after being summoned specifically to take part in the kidnapping .
They have since pleaded guilty .
Gwinnett County District Attorney Danny Porter , whose jurisdiction includes Lilburn and Norcross , where Mr. Haro - Perez was arrested , says authorities made arrests in about five similar kidnappings last year .
Still , authorities consider the violence here relatively minimal .
They say the Mexican cartels , which have included not only the Gulf Cartel , but also the powerful Sinaloa Cartel and others , seem content to operate as major distributors and stay away from street - level dealing , the source of most drug - related violence in the U.S .
Mr. Porter calls the cartels an example of capitalism in its purest form :
They took control of the markets with an abundance of products and the lowest prices .
“ We ’re not seeing shootouts in the streets , ” Mr. Porter said .
“ In fact , they ’re doing their best not to draw attention to themselves . ”
Violence , after all , brings police attention , and that can be very bad for business .
A low - key lifestyle
Since 1986 , James Boltz has lived in a house , shadowed by towering power lines , across the street from where Mr. Haro - Perez was arrested .
The neighborhood has changed drastically over the past two decades , he says , and is now predominantly Mexican .
He has no recollection of Mr. Haro - Perez and “ never knew ” a sophisticated drug operation was apparently run out of the house across the street .
“ We ’ve had so many people living in that house , ” said Mr. Boltz , a production manager for a window company .
It ’s a neighborhood of modest houses with drab , peeling paint , and every fifth or sixth home appears vacant , with foreclosure notices posted on doors or front windows .
On a recent weekday afternoon , children on bicycles roamed the streets and a pair of boys on dirt bikes zipped around the neighborhood , always on the lookout for police .
Teenagers huddled around mailboxes or on porches .
Law enforcement officials say it ’s exactly the type of neighborhood the drug cartels favor .
“ You would see Miami in the ‘ 80s , the jewelry and all that , ” said the DEA ’s Mr. Benson . “ [ Now ] I see cars that are very nondescript .
I think there ’s a conscious effort to be nondescript , low on the radar screen . ”
Mr. Nahmias agrees the cartel workers , whose numbers authorities cannot be sure of , do not share the ostentatious lifestyles of many street - level dealers .
The U.S. attorney notes the irony in the case of the Black Mafia Family , a violent street gang .
“ They would live large and have limos and stuff , but they were getting their drugs from the Mexican cartel , ” Mr. Nahmias said .
“ Probably the guy that was selling them 20 kilos was living in some little house , sleeping on a mattress on the floor . ”
Federal authorities say Mexican drug cartels bring in as much as $ 38 billion annually , but little of that money stays in the U.S .
Smuggling cash back across the border is as important to the cartels as sneaking drugs in .
The two sides of the operation are often kept separate for security reasons , and the overall sophistication of the cartels requires law enforcement to employ equally intricate investigative techniques .
It was a sprawling investigation using wiretaps that eventually led authorities to Mr. Haro - Perez .
On transcripts included in court documents , the man authorities say is Mr. Haro - Perez is called “ Ace ” and appears to be very much in charge .
But Mr. Wooldridge , the defense attorney , says that man is not his client and disputes the government ’s identification of his client as “ Ace . ”
He said the government had no one else to blame , so prosecutors decided to accuse Mr. Haro - Perez of running the operation .
“ The government thinks he is someone who he is not , ” he said .
“ There was nothing illegal at all , probably made some bad choices about where he slept that night , that ’s probably the worst thing he did . ”
Mr. Wooldridge was reluctant to speak about the case in great detail but said his client was new to town and simply sleeping at the home in Norcross when he was arrested .
Fernando Herrera , who lives next door to the house where Mr. Haro - Perez was arrested , remembers waking up for work the morning Mr. Haro - Perez was arrested and seeing “ a lot of police outside . ”
Mr. Herrera said that was the first time he had any notion his neighbors could be trouble .
“ I never seen nothing over there , ” he said .
“ I do n’t know too much about those people . ”

Throwing turtles in the toilets WON'T allow you to fly like superman !
Rodney Lass figured his days as a homeowner were over when he was hit with a foreclosure judgment more than a year ago .
He stopped rehabbing his two - story Bay View home and moved on .
But what Lass did n't realize until recently is that the house remains in his name today .
He 's still responsible for the taxes , upkeep of the property and the mortgage , leaving Lass perplexed .
" Why would I pay for something that I do n't own anymore ? "
Lass said .
The foreclosure , however , failed to go through after the California - based lender decided it did n't want the gutted house .
Lass said he found out for certain that he still owned it from the Journal Sentinel .
Today , the house at 703 E. Lincoln Ave. sits condemned , holes in its roof , a blight on the working - class neighborhood .
The home represents a growing phenomenon known as walkaways - properties for which lenders sue for foreclosure but never take the title .
For years , lenders complained about debtors who left the keys on the kitchen table and skipped town , leaving it to the bank to file for foreclosure and eventually take title by buying it at a sheriff 's sale .
The latest twist :
Now it 's the lenders who are doing the walking , often without telling the borrowers , who may believe erroneously they have already lost title .
" This is just the meanest and nastiest thing ( lenders ) could do , " said Catherine Doyle , chief staff attorney at the Milwaukee Legal Aid Society .
" Even more profound is the terrible damage to the community .
All of us are going to have to bail them out . "
City officials , lawyers and community activists say they 've seen an increase in lender walkaways , although they can't estimate how large the problem is .
The Journal Sentinel found more than $ 400,000 in back taxes , fees and demolition costs owed on nearly three dozen properties that lenders foreclosed on in the past two years but did n't complete the process .
Three more have been condemned and are scheduled to be bulldozed at an estimated cost of up to $ 15,000 each .
" I do n't like hearing about money owed to the city at a time when the city is strapped financially , " Mayor Tom Barrett said .
" That 's a concern .
That 's a huge concern . "
' This is just madness '
Cities throughout the country are seeing an increasing number of walkaway properties , said Kathleen Day of the Center for Responsible Lending .
She said she knew of no other attempt to quantify the extent of the problem or its impact on a city .
" We hear about it anecdotally all the time here - all the time , " Day said .
" This is just madness .
There has got to be some better way . "
The seeds for the growth in orphaned properties were planted in the years before the housing bubble burst - back when buyers , sellers and lenders all acted as if prices could only go up .
Mortgages were readily available to all .
Subprime loans were doled out to borrowers with questionable financial track records or those who could not , or would not , document their income .
The mortgages were packaged as securities and sold to investors across the globe .
In 2007 , Americans owed $ 1.3 trillion in subprime mortgages - a nearly 300 % increase over just four years earlier .
As many as half of all subprime loans were given to borrowers with no more than limited documentation of their income , according to the Center for Responsible Lending .
At the end of March this year , a record 12 % of all U.S. mortgages were delinquent or in foreclosure , according to a Mortgage Bankers Association survey .
Nearly 9 % of the mortgages in Wisconsin were in foreclosure or delinquent .
Matters can get particularly complex if a borrower dies and heirs do not want the house .
" It 's just out there ; nobody owns it , " said Janet Resnick , a probate lawyer with 21 years of experience .
Case in point : the vacant , boarded - up two - story house at 2721 N. 26th St. , which for years had been owned and rented out by Rosella Chambers .
In 2006 , Chambers refinanced the 100 - year - old frame house for the second time in four years .
She received a $ 68,800 adjustable - rate mortgage through BWM Mortgage , a now - defunct Wauwatosa mortgage banker .
The loan was for nearly $ 30,000 more than the property 's assessed value .
On May 20 , 2008 , Minneapolis - based U.S. Bank sued her for foreclosure .
The bank had no interest in the mortgage - it was merely the trustee for an investor group that owned the mortgage .
U.S. Bank had been instructed to sue by Pennsylvania - based GMAC Financial Services , which serviced the mortgage for the investor group .
GMAC services about 2.7 million mortgages with a balance of $ 386.3 billion .
A foreclosure judgment was issued in Milwaukee County Circuit Court in August but vacated , at the lender 's request , on Oct. 22 - less than two weeks after Chambers died following a long illness .
Chambers ' daughter , Dianna Myles , said she was offered the property but did not want it .
Myles said the house needed work even while her mother was alive , and since her death it had been stripped of all valuables and vandalized .
The city boarded up the house this year and began its own foreclosure proceedings for back taxes .
" There is no property owner , " Myles said .
There are , however , unpaid bills owed to the city .
Unpaid property taxes and fees total $ 15,280 .
An additional $ 995 is owed for board - up costs and to clean up litter around the property .
Decision - makers far away
Typically , the decision on whether to continue a foreclosure action is made by the out - of - state loan servicing company hired to manage billions of dollars worth of mortgages .
" There 's still this stereotype that we 're dealing with the banker from ' It 's a Wonderful Life , ' " Barrett said .
" We 're not . "
Local housing officials and real estate agents who deal with foreclosed and abandoned properties say out - of - state lenders do n't know the condition of a property when the foreclosure process starts .
By the time their representative checks out the property , it already may have sat vacant for months , making it a target to vandals , squatters and Wisconsin 's harsh winters .
" The pipes will burst and the city fines my clients and it's a real freakin ' mess and nobody is sure who has what rights , " said Michael Watton , a bankruptcy lawyer who said he tells his clients to stay in a house until the legal processes are concluded .
Loan - servicing companies argue they have a fiduciary duty to the investors who bought the mortgage , not to the neighborhood where the home is located .
" We do the cost - benefit analysis ( for ) the investor , " said Jeannine Bruin , GMAC 's executive director of mortgage communication .
" Is he going to recoup any money for us to go through the whole process of foreclosing , fixing the property up , marketing it , selling it ?
Is anything coming back to that investor ?
If not , it 's best to just let the borrower keep ownership of the home . "
But by then , the borrower may think he or she has lost the title and has left .
In that scenario , the neighborhoods and taxpayers may lose , say city officials and neighborhood activists .
" The debtor is gone , the lender is gone and here , Mr. Mayor , you 've got this attractive nuisance in your neighborhood , " Barrett said .
" Then I get a call from my fire department , and they 're telling me we 've got too many homes that are attractive nuisances , as they say , for arson or prostitution or drug trafficking .
The current situation is a lose , lose , lose situation . "
Unless the mortgage debt is discharged in court , the debtor may still be on the hook for the loan even though the property is vacant .
" We have a responsibility to make every effort to hold these borrowers responsible for any payments they agree to make , " said Joyce Biearman , communications manager at Home Loan Services Inc. , a Bank of America subsidiary .
John Pawasaret , director of University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee 's Employment & Training Institute , said lenders should shoulder some responsibility since many loans , especially subprime mortgages written on central - city properties , were based on inflated valuations .
Many of the loans were known as " liar 's loans " because borrowers were not required to document their income on loan applications .
The loan values often " had no relationship to the actual value of the house because of all these liar loans , " said Pawasaret , who has studied the impact of foreclosures on Milwaukee neighborhoods .
Bruin , however , said many of the loans in foreclosure today were prime loans written to borrowers who have since hit hard times and saw the values of their properties decline with the overall housing market .
She said GMAC may be willing to renegotiate loans with borrowers when they hit troubles .
" It 's a sticky situation , no doubt about it , " Bruin said .
" But I would n't go on record saying the lender is responsible for all of these properties in limbo . "
' They took everything '
Left to deal with the fallout are individuals like Alton Lewis .
Lewis and his wife , Theresa , raised seven children in the modest home on W. Clarke St. where they 've lived since 1967 .
Today , their house sits next to a large green monstrosity at 2013 W. Clarke St . The front porch is sagging ; there are gaping holes in the roof ; every second - and third - floor window is shattered or missing ; and the siding on much of the back of the house is gone , leaving the wood frame exposed .
Their son James said he witnessed vandals stealing from the property in broad daylight .
" They took everything , " James Lewis said .
" I saw guys walking out with sinks and pipes . "
Squatters lived in the house for much of the two years that it 's been vacant , said Alton Lewis .
" Not only is it an eyesore , but it 's dangerous , " said Lewis , 72 , whose 69 - year - old wife is bedridden .
" If that house catches fire at night . . .
I ca n't get her out of ( here ) myself .
We both could burn in there .
It 's bad , it 's just unreal . "
Some of the siding on the west side of Lewis ' home is melted from a fire at the abandoned house on Feb. 23 , 2008 .
There was also a small fire in his neighbor 's garbage - strewn backyard in September 2007 .
Although a demolition order was issued last year , the building is still standing .
It is one of about 80 houses waiting for funding so they could be razed .
Lewis has urged city officials to bulldoze the house and to tell him who owns it .
" They keep telling me some lady , " Lewis said .
" They say some lady owns it , and they can't get in touch with her . "
County records show Latoya Wesley bought the house in 2006 with a subprime mortgage loan .
It was one of five properties the Milwaukee woman bought around that time .
Wesley has been hit with repeated foreclosure suits and was on the way to losing title to the Clarke St. property when a foreclosure judgment was issued on Feb. 26 , 2007 .
The property was never sold at a sheriff 's sale , however .
Just last month , the foreclosure judgment was dismissed .
Wesley said she is n't the owner .
" It was foreclosed on , " she said .
" The bank owns it . "
Today , taxpayers are footing the costs for the house , which is being foreclosed on by the city .
Wesley owes more than $ 18,000 in back taxes and fees , city records state .
The taxpayer 's tab is expected to increase by about $ 10,000 to $ 15,000 when the condemned house is demolished .
Living with an eyesore
In Bay View , Linda Yancey and Alan Wood expressed their frustrations with living less than an arm 's length from a boarded - up eyesore - the house Lass owns .
Yancey and Wood originally thought of Lass as a good neighbor intent on improving a house that had a history of problems .
Today , sitting in their neatly landscaped backyard , sipping a couple of cans of Milwaukee 's Best beer , they look at the house with a measure of disgust .
" I 've paid taxes here for 6 1 / 2 years .
It 's ridiculous that I have to live next to that , " Yancey said , motioning to the boarded - up house that has been home to squatters and scores of animals .
" Nobody knows what goes into that building . "
Like Lewis , Yancey said she has called City Hall to get the building torn down or to at least find out if Lass is still the owner .
" When you call , it 's like there 's no answer , " she said .
" Is it the mortgage company or is it a ' somebody ' who owns it ? "
The 39 - year - old Lass bought the Lincoln Ave. house in June 2006 - about a year and a half after his release from prison , where he had spent about a dozen years for drug dealing .
Lass financed the purchase with a $ 112,500 loan from subprime lending giant Argent Mortgage Co. , of California .
The mortgage carried an adjustable interest rate between 10.05 % and 16.05 % .
The house quickly became a money pit .
It sprung a gas leak so severe the odor could be smelled throughout the neighborhood .
A broken water pipe severely damaged the interior .
Tenants were n't paying rent .
In March 2008 , German - based Deutsche Bank sued Lass for foreclosure .
The bank was acting as a trustee for investors who bought the mortgage .
Judge Timothy Dugan issued the foreclosure judgment in May 2008 , the same month the city opened a condemnation file on the property .
" I did n't even go to the ( foreclosure ) hearing , " Lass said .
" I was like , ' You know what , take the house . '
I felt terrible . "
In September , the house was auctioned off at a sheriff 's sale , with the lender making the highest bid of $ 108,000 .
It is common for lenders to buy properties at sheriff 's auction .
But the sheriff 's deed was never brought back to Dugan for confirmation , meaning Lass remained on the title .
" They own it right up to the time the judge signs the order confirming the sheriff 's sale , " Dugan said .
Lass said he received a letter from Dugan two months ago telling him the lender was seeking to dismiss the March 2008 foreclosure order .
That was Lass ' first clue that he was still a homeowner .
Even then , he said , he was n't convinced the house was his .
The foreclosure action has not been completed because repossessing and selling the property " would have not provided enough money to repay any of the outstanding loans and would have only deepened losses , " according to a statement from Citigroup Inc. , which had serviced Lass ' loan .
City records show Lass ' delinquent tab to the city : $ 4,388 for 2008 taxes plus $ 865 in board - up costs .
There is a raze order on the property .
Dugan said the letter to Lass was probably the first time he notified a borrower that a lender was seeking to vacate a foreclosure order .
Doyle of Legal Aid has been urging judges to have borrowers notified before a foreclosure order is dropped and to insist that lenders state a reason when they ask for a dismissal .
Several judges say they are doing so , but they point out that they can't force a lender to complete a foreclosure because it may be in the best interest of the community .
Dugan recently denied the motion to dismiss the foreclosure in Lass ' case , but that does n't take Lass ' name off the title .
" I do n't deal with the moral obligations , " Dugan said .
" I 'm on the legal side . "
Officials acknowledge they can do little to stop lenders and homeowners from abandoning properties .
City officials hope a new ordinance requiring lenders to regularly inspect properties in foreclosure and to notify the city when one becomes abandoned will help them keep tabs on walkaways .
Lass and Wesley are not the only property owners who say they did not know they still held titles .
Building inspectors , bankruptcy lawyers and other officials say they frequently hear the claim .
" It 's a common thing for people to say , ' I 'm being foreclosed on - goodbye , ' " said Jay Unora , an assistant city attorney who prosecutes building - code violations .
" These people are winding up with a lot of headaches . "
Ben Poston of the Journal Sentinel staff contributed to this report .
Large U.S. - based technology companies and Indian IT outsourcing firms are paying close attention to proposed legislation aimed at tightening restrictions on and increasing oversight of the non-immigrant professional visas they use to place foreign professionals in roles stateside .
But while the H - 1B and L - 1 Visa Reform Act , introduced by Senators Chuck Grassley ( R- IA ) and Dick Durbin ( D - IL ) , remains in congressional committee , U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services ( USCIS ) , the agency that administers the H - 1B and L - 1 visa programs , has been increasing its anti-fraud enforcement efforts in response to reported abuse of the temporary worker programs .
Recently , the USCIS has begun making " surprise visits " to the U.S. work sites of companies that sponsor H - 1B and L - 1 visa holders , including some large U.S. - based financial services companies , says Elizabeth Espin Stern , a partner in the Washington , D.C. office of law firm Baker and McKenzie .
USCIS assessors come with a checklist of questions designed to confirm the identity of the employer who petitioned for the visa and the visa beneficiary and to verify that both are in compliance with the terms and conditions of the visa .
USCIS spokesperson David Santos confirmed that the agency has begun conducting random on - site inspections as part of the expansion of its Administrative Site Visit and Verification Program , launched at the beginning of this fiscal year .
Prior to beefing up the verification process , only religious organizations were subject to mandatory site inspections and compliance reviews .
Today any non-immigrant petition could be subject to workplace audits after approval and prior to any potential adjudication .
The objective of the unannounced on - site visits is clear : to detect fraud and abuses of the visa program .
A study conducted last year by the Office of Fraud Detection and National Security estimated that 21 percent of H - 1B visa petitions violate H - 1B program rules .
The offenses range from technical violations to outright fraud .
The most common violation was not paying a prevailing wage to the H - 1B beneficiary .
Those who have voiced concerns about the propensity for H - 1B fraud in the past say the impromptu inspections are a step in the right direction .
" Remember the H - 1B grants a license — a privilege — to a firm to circumvent the U.S. labor market , " says Ron Hira , associate professor of public policy at Rochester Institute of Technology and co-author of the book Outsourcing America .
" With this privilege must come responsibilities .
A random auditing process seems like the most sensible way to ensure this integrity . "
But USCIS investigation tactics often exceed what is necessary and reasonable to obtain H - 1B application verification information , according to Stern * .
Unlike the Department of Labor , which has the statutory authority to investigate an employer 's compliance with visa obligations but rarely conducts audits unless there are complaints , the USCIS has no statutory or regulatory authority to enter the workplace of H - 1B and L - 1 visa holders .
And investigators do not arrive with search warrants or subpoenas , says Stern .
What 's more , USCIS has hired contract workers , who complete a USCIS training course , to conduct the site visits .
But many of the contractors lack expertise about how companies maintain employment records or demonstrate employment terms , adds Stern .
USCIS spokesperson Santos confirms that compliance with the investigation is voluntary .
However , employers taken off guard by an unplanned visit may not be aware of that fact .

Editors Note :
In a previous version of this story , CIO.com erroneously identified Elizabeth Espin Stern as " Stein . "
We regret the error .
The Protocol for an H - 1B Visa Audit
Investigators request to interview the petitioner , review documents that support the visa application , and enter the workplace to confirm visually that the visa recipient is employed according to the terms and conditions of the H - 1B visa .
Stern advises her clients to designate a leader from the general counsel 's office or human resources to guide those who could be involved in a potential USCIS site visit .
Although a cooperative and courteous attitude is advisable , company representatives may reasonably request more time to provide documents or other information .
" Employers are not obligated to submit to disruptive or unreasonable requests for access to company employees or company property , " Stern says .
Companies who sponsor foreign professionals for visas should always prepare for potential visits or audits in advance by identifying what documents they are willing to share with inspectors and who will provide the records .
Proving compliance with the H - 1B program is the tricky part .
" The H - 1B labor process is complicated , " says Allen Erenbaum , a partner in the Los Angeles office of law firm Mayer Brown .
For one , employers must prove that they determined the prevailing wage for the occupation in the metropolitan area and that the H - 1B salary exceeds both that market wage and the actual wage it pays to other employees in similar roles .
The company must also show that it prepared a memo describing the factors — experience , qualifications , education , job responsibilities — considered in determining the wage , posted a public notice of the H - 1B employee 's job and salary in two locations for ten days , and maintains a public access file containing all information relevant to the H - 1B , which can be reviewed by any member of the public at any time .
" In addition , " says Erenbaum , " the employer should maintain additional information which will be helpful in the event of an investigation , including payroll records showing the wage rates for the position , any data used to establish the actual wage for the position , and a copy of documents given to employees describing employee benefits . "
Employers also should ensure that visa petitions are kept up to date , says Stern .
If wages or work location for an H - 1B holder changes , companies must move to amend the original visa petition .
" If an employer gets audited , " says Erenbaum , " it 's too late to begin to get ready . "
The CIA staged a mock execution and brandished weapons , including a gun and a power drill , during interrogation sessions with detainees , according to a long - secret internal CIA report expected to be released Monday .
The episodes are part of a catalog of alleged abuses -- a 2004 report by the CIA ’s inspector general -- that has prompted Atty .
Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. to consider appointing a criminal prosecutor to investigate cases in which the CIA strayed beyond its authorities .
The prisoner confronted with the gun and drill was identified by current and former U.S. officials as Abd al Rahim al Nashiri , the alleged plotter of the attack on the U.S. destroyer Cole .
Nashiri was also one of three prisoners who was subjected to waterboarding , the simulated drowning method .
The inspector general ’s report also describes at least one instance in which the CIA fired a gun in a room next door to a detainee in an apparent effort to convince the prisoner that another terrorism suspect had been executed , officials said .

Some of the allegations , including the presence of a gun in an interrogation room , have been previously reported .
But some of the details disclosed this weekend , including the name of the detainee , are new .
The CIA officer who brandished the gun was removed from the program and reprimanded .
The cases are among the most extreme examples in which CIA interrogators sought to improvise methods not mentioned in the legal memos the agency procured from the Justice Department authorizing the so - called enhanced interrogation program .
“ Some of the things that were done were almost in juvenile detective mode , ” said a former U.S. official familiar with the report , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the issue ’s sensitivity .
Advertisement
Even so , the report focused most of its strongest criticism on alleged abuses of interrogation methods that the agency had been explicitly authorized to use .
In particular , the report raised troubling questions about the frequency with which certain prisoners were being waterboarded .
Segments of the report that were declassified this year indicate that two senior Al Qaeda prisoners , Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and Abu Zubaydah , were waterboarded a total of 266 times between them , far more than had been envisioned in Justice Department memos that gave the CIA permission to use the method .
The CIA declined to discuss specifics in the report .
But CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano said that the Justice Department has had the report since 2004 and that prosecutors have carefully reviewed it for legal accountability .
He said the CIA “ in no way condoned behavior -- no matter how infrequent -- that went beyond formal guidance . ”

“ This has all been looked at , ” he added .
“ Professionals in the Department of Justice decided if and when to pursue prosecution .
That ’s how the system was supposed to work and that ’s how it did work . ”
Still , Holder is said to be moving closer to appointing a prosecutor to examine allegations of CIA abuses .
The disclosure of fresh details from the report this weekend was seen by some in Washington as a sign that Holder may be setting the stage for such an announcement .
The details on the mock execution and the use of the drill were first reported online Friday by Newsweek .
The CIA ’s use of a gun in the booth with a prisoner was first disclosed in The Times this month .

I thought about sending it to the local news .
Once again , Q hits it dead on .
Fantastic idea .
When Laure Cuccarolo went into early labor on a recent Sunday night in a village in southern France , her only choice was to ask the local fire brigade to whisk her to a hospital 30 miles away .
A closer one had been shuttered by cost cuts in France 's universal health system .
Ms. Cuccarolo's little girl was born in a firetruck .
France claims ...
Brazil today announced that it had selected the French - built Rafale fighter over Sweden 's Gripen and the U.S. Super Hornet , a landmark decision likely to impact the international market for fighters .
The plan to buy 36 aircraft could be worth up to $ 7 billion .
With billions of dollars on the line , competitions to buy advanced fighter are rarely about just who has the best aircraft .
Countries muster all their diplomatic and economic persuasion skills to influence the potential buyer , and in that respect , the French came out on top .
" The [ French ] government launched a massive effort to become more supportive of industry , " Robert Wall writes on Aviaton Week 's Ares blog .
" And , French president Nicolas Sarkozy has been aggressive – some may say shameless – in acting as the chief salesman for the country ’s aerospace and defense industry . "
Sarkozy visited Brazil and personally lobbied for the French jet .
That sort of high - level political attention is harder for U.S. manufacturers to match .
In the case of Brazil , the government also pushed very hard to ensure the winner would enhance Brazil 's aerospace industry .
There , again , France had the advantage .
The United States has traditionally been more resistant to transfer technology , and the Swedish - built Gripen , which includes American technology , it also subject to U.S. technology controls .
The technology factor was likely critical .
" What 's important for us is to have access to the technology to make this plane in Brazil , " said Brazil 's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , according to AFP .
" That 's what we 're currently negotiating . "
Update :
Just hours after announcing plans to move forward with negotiations with the French , the government has backtracked a bit and it looks like the multi-billion competition is n't quite settled .
Flightglobal 's DEW Line blog and Aviation Week 's Ares blog both report that Brazil 's president may have jumped the gun .
It turns out the air force had n't submitted their technical review of the competing aircraft and is claiming that no decision has been made .

Bright House Networks employees will watch for “ suspicious behavior , ” which according to law enforcement and DHS guidelines includes being politically active , displaying bumper stickers , or disagreeing with the government
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Thursday , July 23 , 2009
One of the largest cable TV companies in the United States is training its employees to look for suspicious behavior and report it to police under the guise of a neighborhood watch initiative .
Since according to law enforcement and Homeland Security guidelines , suspicious behavior includes owning guns , being politically active , and having bumper stickers on your car , the cable guy ’s next visit to your house may turn out to have more interesting consequences than you originally anticipated .
“ Operation Bright Eyes is designed to maximize the eyes and ears of Bright House Networks field service representatives and other employees to easily identify suspicious behavior and to quickly report criminal activities to police , ” according to a Fox 35 report .
All current and new Bright House employees will receive training to help them use the ‘ resources at their disposal ’ to “ become familiar with residents and activities in neighborhoods ” and report anything they deem unusual to the authorities in order to “ keep our neighborhoods safe ” .
Since when was it the job of the cable guy to run around pretending to be an undercover cop ?
This program is ripe for abuse and another advancement in the tattle - tale stasi society being created in order to make the sheeple self - police their behavior , constantly aware that they are being watched by secret police and living in fear that big brother will catch any minor indiscretion .
The legacy of training Americans to spy on each other in the name of “ safety ” has its origins in Operation TIPS , which was supposedly nixed by Congress , a DOJ , FBI , DHS and FEMA coordinated program that would have recruited one in twenty - four Americans as domestic informants , a higher percentage than was used by the Stasi in Communist East Germany .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Government funding was cut after an outcry but private funding continues and the same program was introduced under a number of sub- divisions including AmeriCorps , SecureCorps and the Highway Watch program .
More recently , ABC News reported that “ The FBI is taking cues from the CIA to recruit thousands of covert informants in the United States as part of a sprawling effort ….. to aid with criminal investigations . ”
In July last year we reported on how hundreds of police , firefighters , paramedics and utility workers have been trained and recently dispatched as “ Terrorism Liaison Officers ” in Colorado , Arizona and California to watch for “ suspicious activity ” which is later fed into a secret government database .
Also last year , a New York Times feature article heartily celebrated the fact that an increasing number of Americans are becoming informants and turning in their neighbors and family members to the authorities in return for cash rewards .
In a piece about a new program run by Southwest Florida Crime Stoppers , citing gas prices , foreclosure rates and runaway food price inflation , The Times lauds the fact that citizens are reporting on each other , ensuring “ a substantial increase in Crime Stopper - related arrests and recovered property , as callers turn in neighbors , grandchildren or former boyfriends in exchange for a little cash . ”
Forget Orwell ’s 1984 , this purebred tyranny is about as sophisticated as the wacky dictatorship portrayed in Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s 1987 movie The Running Man , where citizens are reminded by huge TV screens placed on street corners that they can “ earn a double bonus for reporting on a family member ! ”
Bright House Networks has 2.4 million customers and covers “ several large cities including Tampa Bay and Orlando , Florida ; Bakersfield , California ; Indianapolis , Indiana ; Detroit , Michigan ; and Birmingham , Alabama ; along with several other smaller regions in Alabama and the Florida Panhandle . ”
Perhaps that 2.4 million figure will begin to dwindle once customers find out that the cable guy is eyeing them up for suspicious activity .
What constitutes suspicious activity is n’t listed , but if it ’s in line with law enforcement and Homeland Security guidelines – watch out .
As we have previously documented , people displaying suspicious behavior as defined by law enforcement authorities in documents such as the MAIC report , along with Homeland Security lexicon files , include Ron Paul supporters , libertarians , people who display bumper stickers , people who own gold , or even people who fly a U.S. flag .
Homeland Security even equates people who express disagreement with the government with domestic extremists and terrorists .
So if the cable guy sees an Alex Jones DVD in your TV cabinet , will that mandate a call to the cops ?
There seems little need for President Obama to even create his promised “ domestic security force , ” and such a move would merely represent a centralization of what is already underway , since a plethora od programs that train Americans to report on each other are already firmly in place across the country .

Comment on this article
( The following was inspired by a question asked in response to The Mythology of Intellectual Property . )
There are innumerable ways to make money without copyright — and , in many cases , people are already doing so and may not even realize it .
For instance , for the most part signed bands use record sales solely to pay off debt incurred as part of their record deals for purposes of getting initial record publishing and distribution done ; they get their actual living wages ( on the rare occasion when they can make a living from music ) by playing live gigs and selling merchandise .
They may not actually realize it in many cases , but for most professional musicians the real financial benefit they get from record sales — the one part of the profession that requires copyright — is advertising .
The record labels get profits directly from record sales , while the musicians just get well enough known to be able to make money at their live shows .
News flash ; it ’s a lot cheaper to distribute yourself over the Internet , and let people burn your CDs if they want to , than to pay out the nose to have some suited schmucks at Sony / BMG make money off you and only advertise for you incidentally .
For other examples of how people can make money without jealously guarding their intellectual monopolies , look at Cory Doctorow ( he keeps making his books and short stories available for free online ) ; Radiohead , Nine Inch Nails , and Harvey Danger ( made more net profits off records they basically gave away than on albums distributed through the usual channels ) ; and Websites that use movies and other video productions to drive traffic to them so they can make money through secondary effects ( such as on - site advertising , merchandising , and so on ) .
There are also services such as fundable that provide an easy framework for getting people to pledge money toward the eventual free release of something .
You create something , ask for a particular target value in contributions and , once you get the money , release it to the world ; voila , you ’ve been paid .
A number of writers have used this to finance authorship of books , and a number of musicians have done the same for production of album - length collections of music .
I make money by writing ( both articles in English and software source code ) , in fact — far more than the piddly quantities I get from advertising on this obscure site — and I would love for copyright to go away .
It ’s not like I ’m working in manufacturing and advocating for someone else ’s industry to change all its rules .
I ’m talking about what I want to happen with the very fields of endeavor where I make money .
This is why , every time I can reasonably do so , I attach a copyfree license to everything I create — usually the Open Works License .
The real answer to the question , though , is much simpler than all of the above :
It ’s not my fault your business model sucks .
I ’ve said it before ( more than once in fact ) and , given half a chance , I ’ll say it again .
Some sources claim that Glenn Beck may be responsible for the rape and murder of a girl in 1990 .
Classic Glenn
Beck style reasoning suggests that he is responsible for clearing his name of these atrocious acts .
A new site “ exists to probe the vicious rumour that Glenn Beck raped and murdered a young girl in 1990 . ”
Note :
This is satire / parody , but a valid example of the fallacious reasoning Beck is known for .
Here is some of the evidence :
Why have n’t we had an official response to the rumor that Glenn Beck raped and murdered a girl in 1990 ? ( source )
Some say he ate her remains in a drug - filled pagan ceremony .
Some say .

“ R ” is for radical “ A ” is for astronaut “ P ” is for paper “ S ” is for super - douche “ T ” well , I do n’t have that yet , but if I did , this would spell “ rapist ” ( source )

Beck deny rape allegations ?

Omg I cant find a single entry / item / article ANYWHERE that says Mr. Beck is not a rapist .
( source )
He has exposed himself as a guy over and over again who has a deep seeded [ sic ] hatred for consensual sex or the “ No Means No ” culture , I do n’t know what it is .
I ’m not saying he does n’t like consensual sex , I ’m saying he has a problem .

One day after Dustin Vogel went to Chula Vista city hall and submitted an application to open a medical marijuana collective ( where patients go to purchase marijuana from growers at no profit to the business ) , an employee from the city ’s planning department contacted him with news that his application had been declined .
With no clear explanation for the denial , Vogel waited to hear more from the City .
Three weeks later , Vogel said the Chula Vista city attorney ’s office contacted him with an explanation of why his business license was refused .
“ One of their lawyers said [ the City ] is going to use a city code that prohibits them from issuing licenses to businesses that violate federal law , ” wrote Vogel in a July 15 email .
“ This is the same logic that was used in San Diego vs. NORML , which the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed all of two months ago , ” added Vogel , a lifelong resident of Chula Vista .
“ We 're baffled that the City seemingly wants to waste time and resources on an issue that has already been decided , especially when they have had to fire staff and institute work furloughs . ”
According to city attorney Bart Miesfeld , at the July 21 city council meeting , councilmembers will consider imposing a 45 - day moratorium on new medical marijuana cooperatives opening within city limits .
“ It ’s an interesting issue right now , ” says Miesfeld .
“ Some people are trying to figure out the status of the law and what each jurisdiction wants to do with it . ”
“ Our politicians are interested in it , and because of the Compassionate Use Act [ Proposition 215 ] and the will of the people , it is something we want to look at closely , ” adds the city attorney .
“ I think [ the Chula Vista City Council is ] as eager as I am to do some research and figure out the state of the law and what the people would like to do . ”
If passed , Chula Vista will join other cities throughout San Diego County that prohibit new medical marijuana dispensaries from opening .
Last month , the City of Oceanside placed a ten - month ban on marijuana dispensaries , and a few weeks later the Escondido City Council passed a 45 - day moratorium .
“ We 're organizing support right now , ” writes Vogel .
“ We would love for the City to collect our tax dollars , so we are quite upset at the way they have approached this . ”
In order for the U.S. economy to go roaring right back to the 3 % - 4 % long - term growth the bulls are looking for , consumer spending will have to rebound .
Consumer spending is still 70 % + of the economy , and it's hard to get a supertanker cruising along at top speed if 70 % of its power is removed .
In order for consumer spending to come roaring back , however , one critical thing has to happen :
Consumers have to be employed
If consumers do n't have jobs , they do n't have much disposable income .
They also can't borrow as easily ( because , at least temporarily , banks have decided not to be stupid ) .
And if consumers are n't employed , companies that sell to them can't grow as quickly , which affects the other 30 % of the economy .
And how is consumer employment going ?
Badly .
The unemployment rate is now nearing the post - war peak of just over 10 % .
Yes , the unemployment rate is a lagging indicator -- in part because it does n't count unemployed people who have given up looking for a job .
( As a recovery begins , these folks start looking for jobs , so the ranks of " unemployed " as defined by the BLS suddenly swells ) .
But the rate is high enough that , unless it drops sharply , it 's hard to see where the disposable income necessary to drive strong consumer spending growth ( and borrowing capacity ) is going to come from .
In the recession of the early 1980s , the unemployment rate dropped quickly in the beginning of the recovery .
In the two more recent recessions , however , it did not .
The bulls say we 'll have a sharp recovery this time because the rate of jobs recovery matches the rate of decline : Panicked employers cut too many jobs and now they 'll have to hire them back .
Anything is possible , but this bullish argument does not explain how the job market will rapidly absorb the huge amount of slack that is not reflected in the unemployment rate .
It also does not explain how companies will rapidly increase their payrolls when they 're selling to consumers that are hunkering down and trying to rebuild savings .
Specifically :
A record - low work - week suggests that employers have a lot of room to ramp production without hiring new employees ( or old ones back ) .
David Rosenberg estimates that just increasing the work - week back to normal levels will be the same as creating 3 million jobs .
Consumers still have debt coming out of their ears ( consumers are customers of most of the companies that need to start hiring )
Consumers ' wealth has been clobbered , so they need to start saving instead of spending again ( ditto )
Approximately 4 million jobs in finance , construction , and real - estate are gone for good ( or at least a while )
Getting the unemployment rate back to 5 % in 5 years would require average monthly job creation of 250,000 .
The average for the major boom of the 1990s was 150,000 .
The average for the past 30 years has been about 50,000 .
The number of job openings to unemployed job - seekers has now hit a record high of 1 - to - 6 .
So it will be a long time before we get back to normal on this ratio , let alone create a job - seekers ' market .
Peter Goodman of the New York Times takes a close look at the latter problem .
His conclusions are presented quickly in the chart at right .
Click here to see a bigger version and read the whole article .
During the last recession , in 2001 , the number of jobless people reached little more than double the number of full - time job openings , according to the Labor Department data .
By the beginning of this year , job seekers outnumbered jobs four - to - one , with the ratio growing ever more lopsided in recent months .
[ It 's now 6 - to - 1 ]
Though layoffs have been both severe and prominent , the greatest source of distress is a predilection against hiring by many American businesses ...
Shrinking job opportunities have assailed virtually every industry this year .
Since the end of 2008 , job openings have diminished 47 percent in manufacturing , 37 percent in construction and 22 percent in retail .
Even in education and health services — faster - growing areas in which many unemployed people have trained for new careers — job openings have dropped 21 percent this year .
Despite the passage of a stimulus spending package aimed at shoring up state and local coffers , government job openings have diminished 17 percent this year .
( Read the whole thing >)
To understand why it 's unlikely that employment will come roaring right back , it also helps to dig into the unemployment statistics .
In his weekly email letter , John Mauldin dissects the job numbers to show what is really going on .
John calculates the number of jobs we 'll need to get back to a 5 % unemployment rate ( 15 million ) and asks where those jobs are going to come from .
He also observes that , to get to 5 % unemployment in 5 years , we 'll need to average 250,000 new jobs every month .
The average has never been this high , even in a strong economy .
The average job creation over the past 30 years is 50,000 jobs a month .
The average job creation from 1991 to 2000 ( a major boom ) was 150,000 jobs a month .
The average in 2006 , the best year in the recent boom , was 232,000 .
You can read John 's whole letter , email it to others , and sign up for free delivery here .
We 've included an excerpt below .
John starts with a look back at the recent recessions .
[ T ]he unemployment rate is now officially at 9.7 % .
We are approaching the official high we last saw at the end of the double - dip1982 recession .
In the chart below , notice that unemployment rose throughout 1980 and then began to decline , before rising rapidly as the economy entered the second recession within two years .
Also notice the rapid drop in unemployment following that recession , as opposed to the recessions of 1991 - 92 and 2001 - 02 , which have been characterized as jobless recoveries .
Unemployment was as low as 3.8 % in 2000 and saw a cycle low of 4.4 % in early 2007 ...
This headline unemployment number ( 9.7 % ) is what we see when we read the paper .
What we typically do n't see is the real number of unemployed .
For instance , if you have not actively looked for a job in the last four weeks , even if you would like one , you are not counted as unemployed .
You are called a " marginally attached " or " discouraged " worker .
Often there are very good reasons for this .
You could be sick , dealing with a family emergency , going back to school , or not have transportation .
Right now , about one - third of marginally attached workers actively want jobs but have not bothered to look because they believe there are no jobs in their area , at least not for them .
If you add that extra 758,000 to the unemployment data , you get what is called U - 4 unemployment , which today is 10.2 % .
If you count all marginally attached workers the unemployment number is 11 % ( U - 5 unemployment ) .
And if you add those who are employed part - time for economic reasons ( i.e. , they can't get full - time jobs ) the unemployment number rises to 16.8 % .
( That is called U - 6 unemployment . )
Now , stay with me for the next two tables taken directly from the BLS website .
The first is the total number of people in the US civilian work force .
Notice how each year the number of potential workers rises .
In fact , the number of workers has risen by about 15 million over the last ten years .
This is from population growth and from immigration .
Also notice that the normal rise did not happen last year .
That is because the number of discouraged workers has risen rapidly and , as noted above , they are not counted .
We will revisit this point later .
But for now , there are 154,577,000 people in the available work force .
Next we look at the tables for the actual level of employment .
Here we note that we are down almost 8 million jobs sincd the onset of this recession , and that there are almost 15 million people unemployed .
Going back to the part - time workers , there are roughly 9 million people who are working part - time because of business conditions , or those are the only jobs they could find .
The average work week is at an all - time low of 33 hours .
The chart below is from my friend David Rosenberg .
David wrote in a special report today :
" What does all this mean ?
It means that when the economy does begin to recover , when we finally get to the other side of the mountain , companies are going to raise their labour input first by lifting the workweek from its record low .
Just to get back to the pre-recession level of 33.8 hours would be equivalent to hiring three million workers .
And , the record number of people working part - time against their will are going to be pushed back into full - time , which will be great news for them , but not so great news for the 125,000 - 150,000 new entrants into the labour market every month .
They wo n't have it so easy because employers are going to tap their existing under - utilized resources first since that is common sense .
Also keep in mind that there are at least four million jobs in retail , financial , construction and manufacturing jobs lost this cycle that are likely not coming back .
In fact , the number of unemployed who were let go for permanent reasons as opposed to temporary layoff rose by more than five million this cycle .
This compares to the 1.2 million increase in the 2001 tech - led recession and in the 1990 - 91 housing - led recession ( when Ross Perot talked about the sucking sound of jobs into Mexico ) . "
Then there is the matter of average weekly earnings .
If you adjust for inflation , workers are making roughly what they did in 1980 .
The chart is straight from the BLS website .
And What We Don't See
Those are the facts .
Now it 's time to look at what we do n't see , and what you do n't read or hear from the mainstream media .
We saw above that we are adding about 1.5 million workers to the workplace every year .
That means over the next five years we are going to need 7.5 million jobs just to maintain that growth , or about 125,000 a month .
That is on the low side of what economists normally estimate , which is around 150,000 per month .
If we used the 150,000 estimate , it would mean we need 9 million jobs .
There are at least 1 million ( and probably more like 2 million ) discouraged workers who would take jobs if the economy got better .
You can derive that number by going back to early 2007 and seeing the level of discouraged workers .
That means , by the end of 2014 we are going to have 163 million people in the work force ( see table above ) .
Today we have 139.6 million jobs , and that number is likely to slip at least another half million ( last month the economy lost 216,000 jobs , with a very suspicious birth - death ratio accounting for a lot of job creation ) .
So let 's call it 139 million current jobs .
Let 's assume that we would like to get back to a 5 % unemployment rate .
That would not be stellar , but it would certainly be better than where we are today .
Five percent unemployment in late 2014 will mean 8.1 million unemployed .
To get to 5 % unemployment we will have to create 14 million jobs in the five years from 2010 - 2014 .
( 163 million in labor pool minus 8 million unemployed is 155 million jobs .
We now have 139 million jobs , so the difference is roughly 15 million . )
Plus the equivalent of 3 million jobs that Rosenberg estimates , just to get back to an average work week .
And maybe the extra 1.5 million a year I mentioned above .
But let 's ignore those latter jobs and round it off to 15 million .
Let 's hope that by the beginning of next year we stop losing jobs .
That means that to get back to 5 % unemployment within five years we need to see , on average , the creation of 250,000 jobs per month .
As an AVERAGE !!!!!
Look at the table below .
It is the number of jobs added or lost for the last ten years .
Do you see a year that averaged 250,000 ?
No .
If you take the best year , which was 2006 , you get an average monthly growth of 232,000 .
If you average the ten years from 1999 , you get average monthly job growth of 50,000 .
If you take the average job growth from 1989 until now , you get an average of 91,000 a month .
If you take the best ten years I could find , which would be 1991 - 2000 , the average is still only 150,000 .
That is a long way from 250,000 .
Want to get back to 4 % ?
Add another 25,000 jobs a month to 2006 .
Let 's jump forward to next September .
We will need at least 1.5 million jobs to take into account growth in the population .
Plus another half million jobs that we are likely to lose before we start to grow again .
What is the likelihood of average job growth of 160,000 a month ?
Anyone want to take the " overs " bet ?
Go back to 2003 , the year after the end of the last recession .
A few hundred thousand jobs were created .
Why so slow ?
Because employers gave more time to those who were already employed and to part - time workers .
Because of the near - certain loss of jobs for the next few months and the slow recovery , it is a very real possibility that unemployment will still be well over 10 % a year from now .
Even with robust growth of 200,000 jobs a month thereafter for the next two years , unemployment will still be close to or over 9 % .
That would only be an additional 1.8 million jobs ( making the most optimistic assumptions ) over the new jobs needed for population growth .

In 2008 , the median household income in the United States plummeted 3.6 % from the year before , and the percentage of people living in poverty soared to an 11 - year high , recently released U.S. Census data reveal .
Economists say the bleak news -- which they blame on the slew of layoffs that have accompanied the economic downturn -- is significant , if not entirely surprising .
“ The current recession has eliminated the gains that have been made in the last 10 years or so , ” said Lee Ohanian , an economics professor at UCLA .
But , he said , “ this is the pattern you typically see in a recession . ”
The statistics do n’t surprise people like Aura Lopez either .

“ It is very difficult to get by always , but it is especially difficult now , ” said Lopez , 28 , a Guatemalan immigrant in Los Angeles who is unemployed .
She said she used to send $ 450 every month to her two young daughters in Guatemala , but these days , she sends nothing .
The census data , culled earlier this year from the Current Population Survey , represent the Census Bureau ’s most current findings and reflect the impact of the early part of the recession , which economists say started in December 2007 .
The data show the devastation of the recession through various economic indicators , such as the real median household income .
In 2007 it was $ 52,163 .
A year later it dropped to $ 50,303 , the lowest level since 1997 .
The nation ’s poverty rate , meanwhile , rose to 13.2 % , the highest level since 1997 .

The new data also cast a spotlight on the recession ’s principal victims : children , minorities and those who were n’t born in the United States .
The number of children younger than 18 living in poverty increased from 13.3 million in 2007 to 14.1 million in 2008 , the census says , with minority children more likely to be poor .
Last year , 34.7 % of black children and 30.6 % of Latino children lived below the poverty line , compared with 10.6 % of white children .
Foreign - born people living in the United States were also more likely to live in poverty than American - born citizens , with 17.8 % of people born outside the country living beneath the poverty line , compared with 12.6 % of native - born Americans .

The data also suggest that Latinos have suffered economically more than other groups in the last year .
Between 2007 and 2008 , the median income for Latino households declined 5.6 % , to $ 37,913 .
At the same time , the median income for non-Latinos fell 2.6 % , to $ 55,530 .
Ohanian , who studies recessions , says minorities and people born outside the country often suffer disproportionately during recessions , in part because they often have less advanced education .
“ Job loss tends to be concentrated most highly among those with the least amount of education and formal training , ” he said .
William H. Frey , a demographer at the Brookings Institution , said those at the bottom of the income ladder suffer because their jobs are often among the first to be cut .
Advertisement
“ They ’ve been hit hard because they ’ve had a lot of the low - paying jobs which have been jettisoned easily , ” Frey said .
The census data indicate that although the recession has hit some groups harder than others , it has affected almost all Americans .
In Arvada , Colo. , a suburb northwest of Denver , the Arvada Community Food Bank has experienced a dramatic increase in the number of families seeking help over the last year , executive director Ernest Giron said .
In summer 2008 , an average of 28 families per day came in for food ; by fall , that number had jumped by 35 % .
Advertisement
“ We had a tremendous spike , ” Giron said .
“ A lot were newly laid off , or their hours were being reduced significantly .
They were n’t working 40 hours a week anymore .
Some were getting pink slips and having to come to the food bank for the first time in their adult life . ”
A year later , the food bank is serving as many as 54 families per day , Giron said .
Several weeks ago , he encountered one well - dressed man waiting for his wife to pick out their food .
“ He said , ‘ I know you think I ’m dressed pretty good for a food bank , but I ’ve been laid off for eight months , and from here , I ’m going to an interview .
Before , we were able to give to the food bank .
Now I have to come because our kids have to have food , ’ ” Giron recalled .

In Los Angeles , Lopez has also had trouble paying for basics , such as food and rent for her room in Koreatown .
“ We used to be able to go shopping and buy things that were not absolutely necessities , like clothes and toys , ” she said .
“ Those things I can no longer do .
We cannot afford to go to the doctor , so we try hard not to get sick . ”

Most Pirate
Bay users were genuinely upset when they found out that their favorite torrent site would be acquired by Global Gaming Factory ( GGF ) at the end of August .
For a small subset of these fans , this move is more than an inked deal , as the coolness and even the credibility of their tattoos is in jeopardy .
Two weeks from now The Pirate Bay as we know it will cease to exist .
To gain access to the site users of the new Pirate Bay will be charged a monthly fee , and even then it remains to be seen what files they will have access to .
Although GGF has promised only minor changes to the design and functionality of the site , the free for all spirit that defined what TPB stands for now , will be gone for good .
Instead of mocking the copyright holders , the site ’s new owners are actively negotiating with MPAA and RIAA members to work out distribution deals .
For those fans dedicated enough to have acquired a Pirate Bay tattoo , the upcoming TPB sale and these distribution deals might be causing sleepless nights .
It is of course needless to say that few of the current Pirate Bay fans would like to have the logo of a Hollywood approved operation tattooed on their arm , chest or forehead .
One of The Pirate Bay ’s original crew members told TorrentFreak that they considered this potential embarrassment to their most visibly dedicated fans and therefore asked GGF to come up with a new logo to replace the existing one .
In a recent blog post they confirm this .
“ When TPB changes owner in the near future it has been agreed that the new owners will change the logo and some graphical details .
We just want to inform the people that are upset about their t- shirts , tattoos or similar , ” the TPB crew writes .
One of the people who actually has the infamous pirate ship logo tattooed on his arm is a user who goes by the name ‘ maxpcuser ’ .
He posted an image of the artwork at the site ’s forums roughly a year ago but luckily , he was n’t too upset when the Pirate Bay announced that it would sell the site .
“ I am an American who had embraced the Pirate Bay so much as to tattoo their logo onto my arm to promote thepiratebay.org even though the bay will never be the same .
Our Mantra will be the same , to continue to allow the free flow of information at any cost , ” maxpcuser responded when he heard his favorite site was being acquired , adding “ the Bay may be dead , it may not , only time will tell . ”
What the new logo will look like is still a mystery , but one that will be solved on August 27 .
We hope for ‘ maxpcuser ’s sake it will be significantly different from the current one , or GGF should at least offer him a free lifetime membership .

Male free - tailed bats sing intricate and complex " love songs " to woo prospective female mates , new research has found .
A detailed analysis of the structure of the bats ' song has found they use a defined syntax and order of syllables .
That makes the bats ' songs more similar to those produced by birds than by other mammals such as mice .
Among mammals , only whales may produce more complex songs , scientists report in the journal PLoS One .
In 2008 , a team of researchers including Dr Kirsten Bohn of Texas A&M University in College Station , Texas , US discovered that Brazilian free - tailed bats ( Tadarida brasiliensis ) sang songs that appeared to contain defined phrases and syllables .
Within the broad rules , the bats are quite versatile
Dr Kirsten Bohn
" But we only had songs from a few individuals in a captive colony , " says Dr Bohn .
Now Bohn and her colleagues have examined over 400 songs produced by 33 individual free - tailed bats living in different colonies in two different regions .
The researchers found that all the bats produce songs with a common hierarchical structure .
" All are constructed from the same four types of syllables and all syllables are combined in the same way to form three types of phrases , " says Dr Bohn .
These phrases can be either chirps , trills or buzzes .
" This type of hierarchically structured vocalisation is extremely rare in mammals , " she adds .
Songs of attraction The Brazilian free - tailed bat is common from California to Mexico .
During the mating season , the males establish territories , which they vigorously and aggressively defend against other encroaching males .
But males do let females enter , and the males ' love songs are thought to both attract these females and deter rival males .
Free - tailed bats listen out for each others ' tunes
As well as finding that all the males structured their songs similarly , the scientists discovered that individual males also add their own particular flourishes .
" Even though these songs are highly structured and follow specific rules , they are also quite variable both for any particular bat and across bats , " Dr Bohn explains .
At various times , individual males changed the number of syllables they combined into each of the three phrases , and they also varied the number of times a phrase was repeated within any one song .
" Within the broad rules , the bats are quite versatile , " says Dr Bohn .
She suspects that males may vary their songs to generate different meanings , or make themselves more attractive to females , ideas that she now hopes to test .
Other mammals such as mice have in the past few years been shown to produce songs , whilst one other bat species , the Greater sac - winged bat ( Saccopteryx bilineata ) is also known to sing , though it sings quite differently and evolved this ability independently .
A captive free - tailed bat takes flight
But the hierarchy and complexity of the free - tailed bats love songs make them stand out among mammals .
Only birds and among mammals , the whales , can compare , says Dr Bohn .
" Bird and whale songs have units , syllables or notes , that are combined into specific phrases , or themes , that are combined to form songs , " she says .
" In most other mammals , including mouse songs , sequences are produced non-randomly .
But there is no evidence as yet for specific syntactical rules and hierarchical structure . "

NASA 's Cassini spacecraft has discovered a new object in Saturn 's rings .
By capitalizing on the angle of sunlight cast on the rings as the planet nears its August 11 equinox , Cassini captured the 25 - mile long shadow cast on Saturn 's B ring by a tiny moonlet that is probably around 1,300 feet in diameter .
It 's no coincidence that the spacecraft 's rendezvous with the planet coincides with its equinox , which occurs twice a Saturn year , or every 15 Earth years .
The mission was planned to take advantage of the 27 months during which the sun is directly over the planet 's equator at noon .
This positioning causes any three - dimensional object in the plane of the rings to cast a long shadow and stand out .
Because Saturn 's main rings , A , B , C and D , are a scant 30 feet thick , Cassini 's cameras can't even see them edge on , which makes it tough to spot anything sticking out from them .
The equinox is the only time these objects will be plainly visible .

There are lots of reasons you might prefer not to have every website you visit and email you send logged and recorded for years to come .
I can't think of any why you would .
In many countries , however , internet providers are required by law to do just that .
According to the London Telegraph , from April 2009 that now includes all European Union countries .
For the tech - minded , here are the gory details .
You can be sure it is being done elsewhere , legally or otherwise .
For a global overview with " heat map , " you can check out last year 's " Electronic Police State " international rankings here .
Surveillance is even more intense in large corporate or government environments , where you may also have trouble visiting certain " unapproved " sites .
At the other end of your internet connection , the same thing may be happening .
Browsing and emailing , for example , usually discloses an " IP address " — the equivalent of your internet telephone number — which can be traced to you through your internet provider .
Many sites , such as Google , also build up a profile of your activity based upon your IP address , " cookies " ( data stored from earlier visits ) , search requests and other factors , which can be retained indefinitely .
Forums and blogs will often record your IP address along with your comments and retain them for years .
This was underlined to me some time ago , when I had a problem with a Google search .
In order to proceed , they required verification by typing in random letters , partially obscured in an image .
After a couple of failed tries , on the third attempt Google presented me with a word consisting of my name complete with a spelling mistake peculiar to details held by my internet provider ( a large multinational ) .
At that moment , I was not using any privacy techniques .
Nevertheless , I now have a new provider and often use the powerful , private Ixquick alongside Google .
Individual hackers can be a danger when they identify your IP address : A 17 - year - old boy was recently jailed for what is known as " Swatting " his online - gaming opponents .
According to The Register , on multiple occasions , he obtained their IP addresses and hacked their internet provider for their personal details .
He then called in armed SWAT teams to their houses by faking ( " spoofing " ) their telephone numbers in emergency calls .
You should note the low to non-existent standards of evidence under which the State will dispatch violent military force against the innocent .
In fact , not only did the State effectively assist him , he was much less guilty when compared to the confiscation , tasering , torturing and killing of governments everywhere against their own opponents .
This highlights by far the biggest privacy concern : Accumulated profiling by Big Brother in order to identify dissenters , protesters , whistleblowers , tax escapees and political opponents .
But , there are fairly easy ways to keep " two sets of books " with your internet provider and also to " anonymize " your site visits , posts , chat , voice , video and email .
It all starts with a clean computer :
Practical Privacy — Stage 1
Many PCs are riddled with viruses , spyware , toolbars , " helpers " and weighed down with bloated " security " suites .
If you have a PC , then do what I have done for many hundreds of customers in recent years :
First , get rid of Norton / Mcafee or similar bloat - ware and restart .
Next run " msconfig " as in this tutorial ( Vista users just type " msconfig " in the Search box ) .
Restart .
The best and leanest antivirus is currently the free Avira Antivir .
You will also need weekly or monthly manual scans with Spybot ( un - tick all options except Desktop Icon on install ) .
Do a scan with both and that 's it .
In case of a stubborn problem try a Malwarebytes one - off scan .
If problems persist , then a backup and system reinstall is needed .
Note that you do n't need a complicated firewall because your router acts as a double hardware firewall , plus there is an adequate built - in Windows firewall anyway .
With a clean , fast computer the first and easiest privacy step is to clear it of data retained from previous activity .
This can be available through the internet to others via things like cookies and add - ons like Java or Flash .
You can clear it in this way :
On a PC , get the free CCleaner .
Un - tick everything except Desktop and Start menu shortcuts on install .
Ideally , run CCleaner just before and just after any private browsing is required .
The standard settings are fine  except be sure everything is un-ticked under Options > Advanced .
Expect the first run to take a while and to be surprised how much junk there was .
After that it will usually be instant .
For an equivalent , Mac users can use free programs like " Onyx " or " MacJanitor . "
With this security setup and a little care about what you click on , you can have years of trouble - free computing , with the basics in place for some privacy .
Practical privacy  Stage 2
The next step is to obscure your activity from your internet provider , and to obscure your identity at sites you visit .
There are several ways of doing this  most requiring technical knowledge of things like " proxies " and " shell accounts . "
But there are easier ways :
In an emergency , one obvious way is to drive around with a laptop and find a public or open internet connection .
This would normally only reveal your general geographic location .
If you are not doing anything to attract , for example , SWAT teams and are not hogging a lot of bandwidth , then you are harming no one .
Long - range wireless is also an option .
One other way would be to use the TOR anonymous internet system .
The only problem here is the unreliable browsing speed .
It is quite easy to install and try , though .
For a permanent , reliable solution you need access to a Virtual Private Network or " VPN " service .
VPNs are often used by businesses to securely log in to office networks from home .
A VPN privacy service can completely obscure your IP address from sites you visit , while obscuring and encrypting the content , sites and servers you visit from your internet provider .
Basically , it will tunnel everything you do to another computer in another part of the world of your choice .
It does mean trusting the VPN provider to some degree ( the best keep no logs ) and it does mean paying a subscription .
But you will get fast or even full internet speeds  in my own case , reliable enough to do chart - based day - trading .
Both Mac and Windows users can easily connect using the basic VPN software already built in .
Or , there is a better solution called " OpenVPN . "
Versions of this on the Mac include " Viscosity " and Tunnelblick .
The service provider will supply instructions .
One VPN service I use is Perfect - Privacy , with multiple servers around the world .
I also like the very low - cost SwissVPN in Zurich .
Bear in mind that lag will increase the further away you are from the VPN server .
There are many others ( metropipe , cryptohippie , xerobank , secretsline etc. ) .
One technical warning about " DNS leaks " :
These can bypass your VPN so that although actual content is secure , the names of sites visited could be visible and therefore logged .
The fix does require extra steps but is reasonably easy : full instructions and a test here .

Email Privacy
With a VPN setup , you can be less concerned about trusting email providers and using encryption .
Just get a free web - based email address in another country and always use the VPN to access it .
However , be careful not to include identifiable personal info in the email content .
In addition , for moderately sensitive email content , both sender and recipient could use temporary Hushmail accounts .
Or , learn to use highly secure PGP encryption with any email provider .
Other free options include Mailvault ( with easy PGP built in ) the secure ( but US - based ) Cryptomail , Privatdemail .
Subscription options include Neomailbox and GeneralMail .
However , unless you encrypt your own email , remember you are placing trust in an unknown service provider .
Rumors abound , for example , that the popular Safe - Mail is a Mossad " honeypot "  though I have seen no real evidence of this .
Voice and Chat Privacy
Because a VPN connection is a secure tunnel ( at least , from you to the VPN server ) there can be less concern also with voice , video and chat services .
However , here are some extra security steps :
For extra Instant Messaging security , try OTR .
For voice and video content there is ZPhone ( at both ends ) in conjunction with Yahoo messenger or Apple iChat .
Skype will conceal content from casual eavesdroppers , but many suspect a " backdoor " and your activity is logged by their software .
Gizmo5 may be an alternative with its internal encryption , plus it will work with Zphone .
SIP Communicator is a one - stop secure video / IM / chat solution with encryption ( including ZPhone ) built in .
But do be aware that unless you use a VPN , voice and email encryption only prevents wiretapping of content and does not prevent tracking who you are and who your contacts are .
Phone Privacy
For interaction with regular telephones you really need a " SIP " account — which is a bit like an email address for voice / video .
These can also be assigned a regular phone number .
Get a free SIP account from IPTel , AntiSIP , SIP2SIP or PBXes .
VoipUser will also give you a free incoming and outgoing UK telephone number .
You can get a free US incoming number from IPKall .
An incoming local number could be forwarded and used in conjunction with an " offshore " outgoing provider ( e.g. , Link2 Voip , Switzernet , Peoplefone , Voipgate ) for call records privacy .
Note that " IAX " is a better but less common alternative to the SIP standard ( see IAXterminator , EuroIAX , Les.net , Voipgate ) .
ASUS Eee PC 1000HE 10 .... Check Amazon for Pricing .
The popular but US - based CallWithUs offers calls ( only ) via their own OpenVPN connection , as do Brujula .
Link2 Voip offer " IPSec " VPN access for calls , useable with some dedicated routers , from computer desktops , with the iPhone / iPod Touch , and with most Windows CE smart - phones and PDAs ( IPaq , HTC etc ) .
If you do not have an incoming phone number for your SIP account , with some providers you can still be called using the free SipBroker service .
This service has local numbers in many countries and you are contactable via an " extension " number after the local number has been dialed .
Making calls through a VPN does reduce the need for call encryption .
But , on top of that , free software like Qutecom and MiniSIP have end - to - end encryption built in .
SIP Communicator includes encryption not only for SIP calls , but also secure video / IM / chat .
XLite does not include encryption , but is very popular and will work with Zphone .
Also see Zoiper for both IAX and SIP .
In practical use , there is no need to be bound to computer speakers and microphone : you can easily use USB , wireless " Bluetooth " ( inc. mobile phones ) and other headsets or handsets .
A SIP account will also work without the need for a computer via special standalone " IP phones " or with regular telephones via SIP adapters .
These plug in to your home broadband router .
But if you want them to go through a VPN , there are then two options :
You could set up " Internet Connection Sharing " on a dedicated computer with a VPN connection .
Or ( for the tech - minded only ) here is the setup for a specially modified home router .
For offices , the Draytek 2820 looks like a one - stop broadband / VPN / SIP solution .
Mobile Call Privacy
When on the move , Wi-Fi and SIP capable mobile phones , PDAs , or netbooks can offer more privacy than a regular landline or mobile call , even without a VPN connection .
But it is possible to use a VPN through public wireless networks from many smart mobiles :
The iPhone and the iPod Touch offer an easy solution by including VPN software .
The Apple app store offers SipPhone to make calls .
Third - party offerings like Fring and Gizmo5 also work , but with less privacy and more lag ( search for Youtube tutorials ) .
You will need a microphone or hands - free set for the iPod Touch .
" Jailbreaking " the iPhone / iPod Touch opens up other options , including Siphon  obtainable through the alternative " Cydia " download source .
2G iPod Touch models can easily be set free in less than 5 minutes , older models in less than a minute .
You can be sure of a solution from the same sources after new updates .
The IPaq and other " Windows Mobile " phones and PDAs include VPN connection software .
OpenVPN is also available for some .
For making SIP phone calls , SJPhone is popular , PortSip is another .
Nokia or other " Symbian " models need SymVPN  also check that particular models have a SIP dialer inbuilt ( e.g. , Nokia E51 ) .
But overall , a tiny netbook could be the stylish , all - in - one privacy option for home , office and on the move .
For voice calls , it might be most convenient when used with a handset , or linked via Bluetooth ( wireless ) to a headset or mobile phone .
You might consider the excellent Asus EeePC 1000HE with 9.5 - hour battery life , or the popular Samsung NC10 .

Payment Privacy
Of course , one big problem  and partly the reason I have suggested many free services  is a lack of internet payment privacy .
This has strengthened the now pervasive custom of demanding personal , private information with every transaction .
Here are some solutions to look at :
In the US , you could check out the various over - the - counter Mall Cards available .
While in the UK and Europe , Paysafecard ( e.g. , for Amazon vouchers ) , UKash , and the Prime Card or Payzone prepaid debit cards are the nearest equivalents to cash online I have found .
UnLinq is a worldwide ( US - based ) card option .
There are also " virtual card " resellers with varying degrees of privacy .
Debitcards4all currently have a good reputation at the talkgold forum , where you can also find other available options .
For sending and receiving small payments , consider ePayarea .
You could also look at gold - or fiat - backed e-currencies .
However , stability is a concern as is the intrusive information demanded by most exchangers  even if you pay in cash .
Of all e-currencies , the soundest may be Pecunix .
The most widely accepted  since the fall of e-gold — is probably the fiat - based Liberty Reserve .
For lightweight privacy , note that in many countries you can add an additional cardholder name to an existing card account .
Identity Privacy

Under the present system , if you want to avoid identity theft , hacker attacks , profiling and more , you need to be cautious about giving out personal information :
Wherever possible , refuse , confuse or completely separate your name , address , date of birth and any other identifying numbers .
Understand that you do not have a moral obligation to help a stranger track you against your will .
Legally , at least in common law countries , you can call yourself whatever you like .
I also do not recommend you supply , for example , your actual date of birth  just to open a free email account .
Some online privacy suggestions :
Always " enhance " your date of birth ;
If you must supply your name or , for a delivery , your home address , then not both together ;
Make use of junk email services like Mailinator or Dodgeit ;
If possible , do n't register  use logins from bugmenot .
Create throw - away email addresses for minor online registration / confirmation ; Maintain separate , completely isolated email addresses for important functions ;
Use aliases or alternate spellings of your surname and make use of your middle name /s ; Google multiple occupancy or serviced office addresses when a verifiable address is demanded ;
Make sure any supplied address matches the VPN country you are using ; Consider setting up a mail - drop  near and / or far ; Develop alternate signatures for forms , packages etc. and compartmentalize their use ;
Incorporating an LLC or using a business name can have privacy advantages ;
Make special efforts regarding the personal details held by your ISP and / or Telco ; Consider posting well - wrapped cash or money orders for purchases .
Whenever supplying information online , assume it will be incorporated into a database forever .
Assume that this will then be incorporated into a bigger search engine that merges multiple databases with all information about you .
Assume that this will be available instantly to friend or foe , for free or a small fee .

Special steps are needed for storing and transporting data privately , including through customs checkpoints , where your laptop could be seized :
Tiny micro SD cards are currently available up to at least 16 Gb .
These can be tucked into a lapel , collar , hair clip etc .
Or , an ideal , discreet and radiation proof solution would be inside a covert coin .
Another option is to encrypt your data and upload it to the very useful , free Stashbox service , which will immediately return a web address to download it from later .
Of course , there is always the old , " send it as an email attachment to yourself " method for smaller data backups .
Conclusion
Some might argue that actual criminals or terrorists could use these techniques to hide themselves .
Possibly , but more likely they have other ways  like hacking in and controlling other people 's computers , using other people 's credit cards , and letting someone else take the blame .
Either way , why should we all go into slavery , just to be " protected " from them ?
Remember that governments are not omnipotent , though they would like to be .
In reality , they are relatively few in number and there are many practical , economic and technological limitations .
Also keep in mind sheer information overload  there can only be so many watchers .
But there is a real threat , particularly if you are targeted .
In these perilous times I hope these privacy techniques will encourage you to speak out more freely and help you maintain more financial and personal security .

The Best of Paul Green
At least some of Germany 's " recovery " may have been achieved at the expense of peripheral eurozone nations such as Italy , Ireland and Spain .
In characteristically disciplined manner , Germany has used the downturn to make its industries more competitive , with real reductions in wages .
Prior to the introduction of the euro , this enhanced competitiveness would have been countered by a stronger currency , but today there is no such relief mechanism .
Germany has been free - riding on the back of a system of fixed exchange rates , which makes its own economy ever more competitive against its enfeebled , debt - fuelled neighbours .
These tensions are by no means specific to the eurozone – they are symbolic of a wider divide between surplus and deficit nations underpinned by currency pegs .
The trade and capital imbalances this generates are a root cause of the present crisis , yet little attempt is being made to correct them .
Late - night military helicopter flights over downtown Los Angeles this week are part of training exercises to familiarize military personnel with urban settings and prepare them for future assignments overseas , authorities said .
The Black Hawk helicopters , which have appeared nightly for almost a week , have attracted the attention of residents as they hovered over downtown landmarks like City Hall , or maneuvered quickly between office skyscrapers on Bunker Hill .
Though many residents speculated that the diving and climbing helicopters were part of a movie shoot , authorities confirmed Wednesday that they were part of a joint exercise .
A brief notice saying the Los Angeles Police Department would be supporting an urban military exercise was posted on the department ’s official blog .
The notice says the exercises started June 15 and are scheduled to end Saturday , and that they will occur throughout Los Angeles .

Authorities said training sites and times have been selected so they do not disrupt the daily routines of businesses and residents .
Safety precautions have also been taken to protect the public and military personnel .

It 's a spring Silvery - cheeked Hornbill chick !

Fast tracked shots contain toxic ingredients mercury and squalene

Monday , Sept 28 , 2009
Children as young as six months are being used in tests beginning today on two “ fast tracked ” and unlicensed flu vaccines containing ingredients that are known to cause neurological disorders and nerve diseases .
Over the next two weeks 1,000 children aged six months to 12 years are being recruited in Oxford , Bristol , Southampton , Exeter and London , to determine which vaccine “ has fewer side - effects ” , reports the BBC .
“ The idea is that everyone will be given this medicine to stop them from catching swine flu . ” the BBC states on it ’s children ’s news website Newsround .
The trials mirror those carried out on children in the U.S. in the Summer .
One of the vaccines is GlaxoSmithKilne ’s Pandemrix , which is actually a pre-pandemic influenza vaccine for the H5N1 virus , or Bird flu .
The other shot is Baxter International ’s H1N1 vaccine .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Neither of the vaccines have been licensed , while the Baxter vaccine has n’t even been approved for use by the European Medicines Agency .
Pandemrix contains both the novel adjuvant squalene , which has been linked to Gulf War Syndrome , and thimerosal , the mercury based preservative that some scientists have said is a cause of autism .
In addition , the EMEA states on its pandemic website that there is “ no clinical experience in the elderly , in children or in adolescents ” with Pandemrix .
“ There is currently very limited clinical experience with an investigational formulation of Pandemrix ( H1N1 ) containing a higher amount of antigen ( see section 5.1 ) in healthy adults aged 18 - 60 years and no clinical experience in the elderly , in children or in adolescents . ” the site notes .
Authorisation was fast tracked for the vaccine based on research using “ mock up ” bird flu vaccines dating from 2007 and 2008 , according to the EMEA .
The vaccine has been rushed through safety procedures while the government has provided pharmaceutical companies with blanket immunity from lawsuits arriving out of the vaccine causing deaths and injuries .
The UK Government has intimate links with the makers of the Pandemrix vaccine , given that one its top advisors on swine flu also happens to be a sitting board member of GlaxoSmithKline .
The pharmaceutical company is currently facing fierce backlash regarding it ’s cervical cancer vaccine Cervarix , after a 14 - year - old British girl died soon after getting the shot at school earlier this week .
We have previously reported on the controversial appointment of Baxter to manufacture H1N1 vaccine after the company was involved in shipping out vaccines containing live bird flu virus last year .
In related news , the package insert of the Novartis H1N1 vaccine ( based on an earlier vaccine product known as Fluvirin ) lists known side effects as guillain - barre syndrome , vasculitis , anaphylactic shock and even death .

There were signs comparing President Barack Obama to a Nazi and showing him with an Adolf Hitler - style mustache , but federal officials believe another sign referencing the president and his family went too far .
A man who was holding a sign reading " Death to Obama " Wednesday outside a town hall meeting on health care reform in Hagerstown , Md. , has been turned over to the Secret Service .
Washington County Sheriff 's Capt .
Peter Lazich said the sign also read , " Death to Michelle and her two stupid kids . "
Lazich said U.S. Secret Service agents took the unidentified 51 - year - old man into custody Wednesday afternoon after deputies detained him near the entrance to Hagerstown Community College .
Obama was not at the meeting held Wednesday by Maryland Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin .
Barbara Golden , special agent in charge of the agency 's Baltimore field office , said Thursday that an investigation is ongoing but declined further comment .
A spokesman at the agency 's Washington headquarters also declined to discuss the investigation .
Police said there were no other arrests among the nearly 1,000 people , some carrying protest signs , who came to the college for
the meeting or demonstrated off - campus .
Cardin 's national communications director , Sue Walitsky , called the incident " unfortunate . "
She said she was unaware of it until
Thursday morning .
I just received the following from Pat Lombardo , Sargento Consumer Affairs Department :
We deeply appreciate your reaching out to us and sharing your comments and concerns about Sargento ads appearing during “ The Glenn Beck Show . ”
We sat down with the marketing department to talk about it and I learned that we buy time periods not specific programs .
But in any event , they ’ve made the decision to exclude that program from our future ad rotation .
Simply stated , Sargento ads wo n’t be airing during that show .
Again , thanks for contacting us .
So if you were wondering if we were having an effect on Glenn Beck 's bottom line , I 'd say we were .
And hopefully it wo n't be too long before Murdoch takes notice and ditches the loon .
Microsoft apologized Wednesday after a Polish version of the company 's ad had a black man 's head replaced with the head of a white man .
News of the image alteration in the picture was making the rounds on forums last night .
Microsoft pulled the picture today from the Web site hosting the image .
( See related story : 10 More Tech Company Photoshop Disasters )
The edit of the Microsoft ad for its Polish division was crude .
The U.S. ad depicted three people at a conference table : an Asian man , a black man , and a white woman .
When localizing the marketing image for Poland , Microsoft replaced the black man 's with that of a white man .
The photos are basically identical ( as pictured above ) .
However , in the picture , only the black man 's head was replaced -- the hands noticeably a different color .
Originally many thought this was originally a joke , but Microsoft 's public apology set the record straight .
Microsoft told Cnet it was " looking into the details of this situation . "
A couple of other details are peculiar about Microsoft's ( even unedited ) image .
First of all , the laptop in front of the black man is an Apple MacBook ( yes , another Apple product in a Microsoft ad with the logo covered ) and the computer monitor in front of the woman is not plugged into anything , even though the keyboard is .
Perhaps Microsoft should either look twice before buying stock photography or just hire a local photographer when they want to localize some marketing images .

Young women are being warned they will face the same sentences as men
Young women are being warned not to hide guns for their boyfriends , brothers or male friends in a new campaign by the Metropolitan police .
It is aimed at the growing number of teenage girls in London who , the Met says , are being persuaded to store weapons for male gang members .
Police are primarily targeting black girls aged between 15 and 19 .
People caught hiding a gun for someone else can expect to receive a five - year prison sentence .
The series of radio , cinema and billboard adverts with the message : " Hide his gun and you help commit the crime " is being launched by Trident , the Metropolitan Police 's anti-shooting unit .
' Fatal consequences ' Claudia Webb from the Trident Independent Advisory Group says vulnerable young women are sometimes pressured into storing or transporting weapons by the men they know .
" We are deeply concerned however , that this involvement seems to be increasing and those who are involved seem to be younger and younger , " she added .
The number of women charged with firearms offences in London has increased six - fold in the past year - 12 women have been charged since January .
Seven of the women were teenagers , including a 16 - year - old arrested after a 9 mm Browning self - loading pistol was found in her bedroom .
The head of Trident , Det Ch Supt Helen Ball , says people who store and carry guns for others are partly responsible for crimes committed with them .
" The consequences for them , their families and their friends are not worth thinking about , " she warns .
The campaign is targeting Trident 's six priority London boroughs : Brent , Hackney , Haringey , Lambeth , Lewisham and Southwark .
Officers will visit nail salons and hairdressers with the message that women carrying or storing firearms will face the same sentences as men .
Boris Johnson , Mayor of London , says gun crime has blighted the lives of people in the capital for too long .
" Anyone who carries or conceals a firearm needs to realise that this is not something to be taken lightly , because the consequences can be fatal , " he said .
Police in Manchester and Birmingham say they are also dealing with these sorts of cases , but not in enough numbers to warrant a specific campaign .

US President Barack Obama surprised a reporter on her 89th birthday by walking into a press briefing carrying cupcakes and singing Happy Birthday .
Mr Obama shares the same birth date as veteran White House correspondent Helen Thomas , who turned 89 on Tuesday .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- The U.S. Treasury announced it has changed its regulations to lift restrictions on the ability of Cuban Americans to visit relatives in Cuba and send them money .
A Treasury Department statement on Thursday said the Office of Foreign Assets Control amended the Cuban Assets Control Regulations to implement President Barack Obama 's April 13 initiative .
The change was made to " reach out to the Cuban people in support of their desire to freely determine their country 's future , promote greater contact between separated family members in the United States and Cuba , and increase the flow of remittances and information to the Cuban people , " the statement said .
Obama 's move was considered a significant shift in a U.S. policy that had remained largely unchanged for nearly half a century .
According to Thursday 's Treasury statement , U.S. travelers may now make unlimited visits to " close relatives , " including aunts , uncles , cousins and second cousins in Cuba who are Cuban nationals .
In addition , Americans may send unlimited amounts of money to close relatives in Cuba who are Cuban nationals , the statement said .
It noted that a separate ban on sending money to prohibited government officials and Cuban Communist Party members remains in effect .
The changes allow telephone communications with people to Cuba but only through non-Cuban providers , according to the statement .
Several key components of America 's embargo on the island nation remain unchanged , including restrictions on travel to Cuba by Americans of non-Cuban descent .
In April , critics of the move blasted the administration for unilaterally changing what had been a long - settled U.S. policy .
The Castro " dictatorship is one of the most brutal in the world .
The U.S. economic embargo must remain in place until tyranny gives way to freedom and democracy , " Rep. Connie Mack , R - Florida , said then in a written statement .
Before he was elected president , Obama promised to lower some of the barriers in Cuban - American relations .

( CNN ) --
The pilot of a helicopter that went missing near a mountain in New Mexico talked to dispatchers just after the craft struck a mountainside , a state official told CNN .
Members of a rescue team gather at a command center early Wednesday in the hunt for the missing copter .
" Are you 10 - 4 ? " a dispatcher asked the pilot , inquiring if he was OK .
" Not really , " the pilot replied .
After this brief communication , the pilot and dispatchers lost touch .
Rescuers were trekking across a mountain Wednesday in search of the missing state police helicopter .
Peter Olson , a spokesman for the New Mexico Department of Public Safety , said searchers could be a mile away from the aircraft .
A team of about 25 volunteers endured bitter cold , heavy snowfall and poor visibility as they scoured the wilderness for the helicopter -- missing Tuesday night shortly after picking up a lost hiker in the Santa Fe National Forest , Olson said .
At one point , searchers thought they were within a half - mile of a transponder signal .
Olson said searchers now believe the signal from the craft indicates it could be a mile away from them .
" We will get there eventually , " he said .
Fresh teams were taking the place of the searchers who worked overnight .
The National Guard was deploying to set up a base camp and will set up tents for rescuers so they can warm up in the below - freezing , 12,000 - foot - high area .
Authorities are unable to dispatch aircraft to help in the search because of the poor visibility and the dangers of icing .
Officials said they hope the precipitation will lift around midday , enabling them to send two Civil Air Patrol planes and two National Guard Black Hawk helicopters out to search for the chopper .
" Right now it 's impossible , " Olson said of deploying air resources in the search .
The chopper had been dispatched to pick up the lost hiker Tuesday night , Olson said .
A pilot and a spotter were on board the helicopter .
It had picked up a woman in the mountainous Santa Fe Ski area and was lifting off when it dropped off from radio contact about 9:30 p.m. local time , Olson said .

The Sci-Fi channel is remaking 80s television series Alien Nation .
The original series ( which was loosely based on the movie of the same name ) aired on Fox for one season in 1988 - 89 before being cut due to funding issues .
The series was popular though , and a number of made for television specials were produced during the 1990’s .
Fox 21 head Chris Carlisle ( Fox is producing the show ) told Variety that he believed Alien Nation could be the next big franchise revival for Sci Fi .
“ It ’s absolute perfect timing for this type of show , ” Carlisle said .
“ They ’re looking for more grounded sci- fi and close - ended episodes , and at the heart of ‘ Alien Nation , ’ it ’s a cop movie .
It ’s grounded .
And it has a tremendous amount of dramatic possibilities and humor . ”

“ It is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves . ”
– William Shakespeare
I have been thinking lately about actively wasting versus passively wasting life .
How often do you end a day , a meeting , or perhaps just glance up at the clock and wonder – “ where did the time go ? ”
Or perhaps on your birthday or as you celebrate the new year you realize how much time in your life has passed .
None of us want to waste time – but if you do n’t actively , intentionally take control , time will leak away from you , in small increments throughout the day .
And today , I ’m going to show you six ways to actively take control – and own that time .
“ This is your life and it ’s ending one minute at a time ”
– Chuck Palahniuk
Break “ Default ” Habits
One of the biggest reasons I waste time online is because sitting down at my computer when I have a few moments is a default activity of mine .
For many people , watching TV fills a similar role .
They come home from work , sit down – and turn on their TV , Netflix , Hulu , Youtube , etc just to see what ’s on .
Rather than defaulting to doing these things because they are easy ways to pass the time , I try to actively consider what is on my todo list , and actively choose what I want to do with each moment .
If you do need a default activity – make it productive .
For example , some of my new default activities are working out , texting my friends to see if they want to get together , and practicing guitar .
I do n’t need to be fully productive during that time – I just need a default activity that does n’t lead to hours being wasted .
In The Action Solution , I break down exactly how I begin and end each day , the habits I ’ve built up over the years .
There is a bonus course , The Energy Solution , where I lay out my daily rituals as well .
Time As Toothpaste
Are you actively owning your time – or is it just passing you by ?
Very often the imagery of time we see is sand falling through an hourglass , or a stream running .
In each of these cases , each moment only comes once and passes us by .
If I think of time as a tube of toothpaste however , it changes my perspective to a more active role .
Unlike a stream running or sand falling in an hourglass , toothpaste does not simply come out of a tube on its own – we force it out and use it up .
When I view my life this way , it forces me to take responsibility for each moment .
One Small Step Every Day
Many of the major goals in our lives ( physical health , financial security , etc ) are items that cannot be completed in a single day .
In fact , I ’m sure most of my large goals are things I will work on for the rest of my life .
I do n’t have to accomplish them all at once – I just have to stay in control and take one step every day .
As long as I am making steady progress towards them , I know that I am actively taking control of my life – rather than letting the days pass me by .
Take Back Your Attention
Do you feel as if you have too much to do ?
Always racing against the clock , rushing through one thing to get to the next thing , or being pulled in different directions .
If so , it ’s time to take back your attention .
Rather than trying to do everything , instead focus on doing just a few things well .
For me , that includes cutting back on my commitments .
When I am driven by outside commitments , I no longer have control of my own time .
When I am instead driven by my internal drive and goals , that ’s when I control my time – and my life .
Choose To Begin Each Day
Similar to viewing time as a tube of toothpaste , giving the day permission to begin is a trick I use to change my perspective towards time and my day .
I imagine that each day when I fall asleep , time moves for much more than 8 hours , and when I wake up and turn off my alarm clock it ’s not that it is now 6 a.m. – I imagine that I have been asleep for a very long time , and that it has been at 6 a .m. for days or weeks .
I tell myself that today is my day , time moves when I say it moves – and as I pushing the button to turn off my alarm , I am now letting the world go forward , and allowing time to move on to 6:01 , 6:02 and beyond .
Pay Yourself First
I advocate paying yourself first with your time .
It ’s a simple concept – but from experience working with clients , I know it can be extremely challenging to do .
If you are n’t in control of your own time , there is a very good chance you are paying yourself last every day .
Read my advice , and starting tomorrow , at least a little bit – pay yourself first with your time .
Your time is valuable , and so is your life .
What you do with your life , and what you do with your time matters .
Take control , and make it count .

Argentina and Mexico have taken significant steps towards decriminalising drugs amid a growing Latin American backlash against the US - sponsored " war on drugs " .
Argentina 's supreme court has ruled it unconstitutional to punish people for using marijuana for personal consumption , an eagerly awaited judgment that gave the government the green light to push for further liberalisation .
It followed Mexico 's decision to stop prosecuting people for possession of relatively small quantities of marijuana , cocaine , heroin and other drugs .
Instead , they will be referred to clinics and treated as patients , not criminals .
Brazil and Ecuador are also considering partial decriminalisation as part of a regional swing away from a decades - old policy of crackdowns still favoured by Washington .
" The tide is clearly turning .
The ' war on drugs ' strategy has failed , " Fernando Henrique Cardoso , a former Brazilian president , told the Guardian .
Earlier this year , he and two former presidents of Colombia and Mexico published a landmark report calling for a new departure .
" The report of the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy has certainly helped to open up the debate about more humane and efficient policies .
But , most of all , the facts are speaking by themselves , " said Cardoso .
Reform campaigners have long argued that criminalisation enriched drug cartels , fuelled savage turf wars , corrupted state institutions and filled prisons with addicts who presented no real threat to society .
The US used its considerable influence to keep Latin America and the UN wedded to hardline policies which kept the focus on interdictions and jail sentences for consumers as well as dealers .
The " war " was first declared by the Nixon administration .
The economic and social cost , plus European moves towards liberalisation , have emboldened some Latin American states to try new approaches .
Argentina 's supreme court , presented with a case about youths arrested with a few joints , ruled last week that such behaviour did not violate the constitution .
" Each adult is free to make lifestyle decisions without the intervention of the state , " it said .
The government , which favours decriminalisation , is expected to amend laws in light of the ruling .
The court stressed , however , that it was not approving complete decriminalisation , a move that would be fiercely resisted by the Catholic church and other groups .
The previous week the government of Mexico , which has endured horrific drug - related violence , made it no longer an offence to possess 0.5g of cocaine ( the equivalent of about four lines ) , 5g of marijuana ( about four joints ) , 50 mg of heroin and 40mg of methamphetamine .
Three years ago , Mexico backtracked on similar legislation after the initiative triggered howls of outrage in the US and predictions that Cancún and other resorts would become world centres of narcotics tourism .
Now , however , the authorities quietly say they need to free up resources and jail space for a military - led war on the drug cartels , even while publicly justifying that offensive to the Mexican public with the slogan " to stop the drugs reaching your children " .
They also argue corrupt police officers will be deterred from extorting money from drug users .
Washington did not protest against the announcement , which was kept deliberately low key .
" They made no fanfare so as not to arouse the ire of the US , " said Walter McKay , of the Mexico City - based Institute for Security and Democracy .
" I predict that when the US sees its nightmare has not come true and that there is no narco - tourist boom it will come under more pressure to legalise or decriminalise . "
Some US states have decriminalised the possession of small amounts of marijuana and the Obama administration has emphasised public health solutions to drug abuse , giving Latin America more breathing room , said Kasia Malinowska - Sempruch , director of the Global Drug Policy Programme .
" My hope is that Latin America will be the next region , after most of Europe , where evidence and science will be the basis for policy - making . "
Argentina and Mexico's moves may encourage other governments to follow suit .
A new law has been mooted in Ecuador , where President Rafael Correa last year pardoned 1,500 " mules " who had been sentenced to jail .
His late father was a convicted mule .
Brazil 's supreme court , as well as elements in Congress and the justice ministry , favour decriminalising possession of small quantities of drugs , said Maria Lúcia Karam , a former judge who has joined the advocacy group Law Enforcement Against Prohibition .
She welcomed the moves towards decriminalisation but said repression remained a cornerstone of drug policy .
" Unfortunately the ' war on drugs ' mentality is still the dominant policy approach in Latin America .
The only way to reduce violence in Mexico , Brazil or anywhere else is to legalise the production , supply and consumption of all drugs . "
Democratic strategists say the Obama administration ’s evolving , abstract arguments for healthcare reform are backfiring and contributing to a decline in public support for the legislation .
The strategists , many of whom saw healthcare reform fail in the Clinton administration , contend that President Obama has advanced too many rationales for his plan , leaving people confused .
For example , Obama has argued that a new healthcare system is necessary to spur an economic recovery .
He also has offered up healthcare as an antidote to rising deficits .
Earlier this week in a conference call with religious leaders , Obama laid out a “ moral ” imperative for revamping the nation ’s healthcare system .
At other points , Obama has portrayed “ meddling ” insurers as a reason for scrapping the existing system .

“ One of the difficulties has been that the explanation has changed , ” said Howard Paster , a legislative liaison in the Clinton administration .
“ Originally it was keyed very much to the economy .
More recently , emphasis has been placed on issues of fairness and equity .
We need to have a consistent set of reasons for doing this . ”
Conservative opponents of the overhaul increasingly use a simple , understandable message : Government - forced cost reductions will restrict treatments , imperiling the ill and elderly .
To counter that , the case needs to be made in personal terms , some Democrats have advised .
Rather than talk about healthcare ’s relation to fiscal policy , the White House should demonstrate how specific constituencies -- like the elderly -- stand to gain under the plan Obama has championed .
“ They have not excelled in that area , ” said Chris Jennings , a senior healthcare advisor in the Clinton administration .

Jennings added that the Obama administration must emphasize that “ the consequences of inaction are severe , and failure to act is a policy choice that will hurt real people .
And the benefits of reform will help key targeted populations .
You never want to get to a point in the healthcare debate where people are more comfortable doing nothing than doing something . ”
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters Friday that when Obama returns from vacation Aug. 30 , he will reengage in the healthcare fight with a compelling message .
The president , Gibbs said , will “ continue to tell people about why healthcare reform is important , why we ca n’t afford to do nothing , the stakes that are involved , and to try to push back on the mistruths and misrepresentations that we all know are still out there about healthcare reform . ”
On his final workday before leaving for Camp David and Martha ’s Vineyard , Obama talked healthcare strategy with former Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle .
Advertisement
In a statement about the meeting , the White House said that the president and Daschle “ agreed that substantive reform that lowers costs , reforms the insurance industry , and expands coverage is too important to wait another year or another administration . ”
Another distraction for Obama has been uncertainty over his stance on the so - called public option , a government - run program that would serve as an alternative to private health insurance .
The White House contends that its stance is unchanged :
The president favors it and wants to sign it into law .
But recently , Obama and other officials also have signaled that the public option is negotiable .
Advertisement
On a TV talk show last weekend , Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said that a public plan was not “ the essential element ” of Obama ’s healthcare proposal .
Howard Dean , former Democratic National Committee chairman , said : “ They ’re not all saying the same thing , and that ’s one of the problems . ”
Others said the administration might be seeking maneuvering room in its dealings with Congress .
Previous presidents who racked up significant legislative victories did n’t always spout a consistent message , said Bob Shrum , a longtime Democratic consultant .
“ A little bit of zig - zag is probably essential to a successful presidency , ” Shrum said .
Advertisement
But if Obama winds up jettisoning the public option , he risks antagonizing labor leaders and liberal supporters who helped him win the presidency .
Asked about Sebelius ’ comment , Andrew Stern , president of the Service Employees International Union , said in an interview : “ I ’ll let her speak for herself .
I think it ’s pretty essential . ”

For the past several years , China has been practising the one - child norm .
In his inaugural address at the state legislature session on Wednesday , Yeddyurappa said the issue could be taken up for discussion in the House .
“ Will adopting the two - child norm and cutting government facilities to those who have more than two children help the State in any way ? ” the chief minister asked in the course of his speech .
Development strategy
Evidently impressed by the Chinese strategy to contain population growth , he said China ’s model was a part of a development strategy .
In his hour - long speech , Yeddyurappa said he was open to ideas to improve the condition of villages and farmers .
The suggestions would be even incorporated while finalising the budget next year , he said .
Reminiscing on his recent visit to China , the chief minister said rural life in that country was more comfortable and disciplined .
The villagers were healthier and happier than their counterparts in India .
Hitting back at the Opposition who had criticised his China trip , Yeddyurappa said : “ You had stated whether I had “ jnanodaya ” ( enlightenment ) in China .
The answer is yes .
I had ! ” .

Technology correspondent , BBC News
The BBC's iPlayer made its public debut in 2007 Britain 's biggest broadband supplier has been accused of limiting download speeds on its cheapest package without giving users a clear warning .
BT Broadband cuts the speed users can watch video services like the BBC iPlayer and YouTube at peak times .
A customer who has signed on to an up to 8 megabit per second ( MBPS ) package can have speed cut to below 1 M bps .
A BT spokesman said the firm managed bandwidth " in order to optimise the experience for all customers " .
The BBC said it was concerned the throttling of download speeds was affecting the viewing experience for some users .
Customers who opt for BT's Option 1 broadband deal will find that the speed at which they can watch streaming video is throttled back to under 1 M bps between 1700 and midnight .
Broadband download speeds explained The BBC iPlayer works at three different speeds , 500 Kbps , 800 Kbps , and 1.5 Mbps , depending on the speed of a user 's connection .
There is also a high definition service which requires 3.2 Mbps .
Sources at the BBC said the effect of BT 's policy was to force viewers down on to the 500 Kbps service , which can make the viewing experience less satisfactory .
Andrew Griffiths , a BT customer in south London , said he had noticed a drastic slowdown in the speed of his BT internet connection in the evenings .
We believe there is a real issue that content owners like the BBC need to address
BT statement
Dotlife blog on BT v BBC
He said : " From about 1730 onwards something like BBC iPlayer becomes impossible .
It 's fine during the day but come the evening , it 's a no go . "
Mr Griffiths explained he was on the basic package , and was promised a connection of between 5 M bps and 8 M bps .
" We get nowhere near that .
We 've tried to contact them numerous times to complain but without success . "
In a statement , the BBC said : " While customers listening to audio and lower quality video streams would be unaffected , we are concerned that at peak times some customers ' higher quality video streams may be interrupted by buffering before falling back to a lower - quality version .
" This would suggest that traffic identified as BBC iPlayer traffic is being throttled back , thereby limiting the bandwidth used up by the service on slower connections . "
BT has said its speed limit is explained on its website , on a page describing its Total Broadband Fair Usage policy .
The clause in question says : " We do limit the speed of all video streaming to 896 Kbps on our Option 1 product , during peak times only . "
Steve Weller , from price comparison site USwitch.com , said BT was not alone in having fair use policies that were difficult to find .
' Hide terms '
He said : " Companies operating a traffic management policy usually hide their terms deep in the terms and conditions , making it difficult for customers wanting to get out of a contract . "
The BBC launched a HD iPlayer earlier this year Sources at the BBC said their data showed that speeds for BT's iPlayer users was reduced to around 700 kbps at peak times .
The policy is not explained in the terms and conditions users see when they sign up to BT Broadband .
The BT website describes the Option 1 package as best for " high - speed broadband at home " .
There is a download cap of 10 gigabytes a month , but the advertising promises up to 8 M bps , and BT says " we 'll offer the best speed available on your line " .
But in a statement BT said it was not capping speeds down to 700 kbps on iPlayer .
The firm said : " Where we manage bandwidth , we do so in order to optimise the experience for all customers , whatever they want to do online .
" We believe there is a real issue that content owners like the BBC need to address and we are currently in discussions with the BBC executive to ensure that our customers get the best possible experience in the future . "
A number of major broadband suppliers limit speeds at peak times for some users , adopting what are known as traffic shaping policies .
Last year the regulator Ofcom brought in a voluntary code of practice on broadband speeds , which calls on Internet Service Providers to provide clear information about speeds when users sign up .
Ofcom said the code did not ask providers to make fair usage policies clear at point of sale , but they must be made clear on their websites .
Mr Weller , from uSwitch.com , said BT was not the only internet service provider trying to cope with growing demand by throttling back speeds .

Humanitarian aid worker Walt Staton , who was convicted of “ knowingly littering ” in a U.S. District court by a jury in Tucson for leaving sealed , gallon jugs of water along migrant trails on the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge , received his sentencing on Tuesday .
Federal Magistrate Jennifer Guerin ordered Staton to complete 300 hours of trash pickup on public lands within a year while he will also be on unsupervised probation .
In addition , he was banned from entering the BANWR during that time .
Volunteers with organizations that put water along the trails , like the Samaritans and No More Deaths , are fond of saying that much of the garbage that litters the beautiful Sonoran desert belongs to the government , not the migrants or humanitarian workers .
It is puzzling to try to understand the government ’s use of resources in prosecuting and demonizing people like Staton .
It is not uncommon to hear from law enforcement officials that the humanitarian organizations are well - meaning , but their efforts to place water in the desert is misguided and contributing to illegal immigration .
But the reality is that it is failed border and immigration policy that forces people into the deserts , not gallons of water along the trails .
Online Learning in Clojure
Online Learning is a relatively old branch of machine learning that has recently regained favour for two reasons .
Firstly , online learning algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent work extremely well on very large data sets which have become increasingly prevalent ( and increasingly large ! ) .
Secondly , there has been a lot of important theoretical steps made recently in understand the convergence behaviour of these algorithms and their relationship to traditional Empirical Risk Minimisation ( ERM ) algorithms such as Support Vector Machines ( SVMs ) .
In order to understand these algorithms better , I implemented a recent one ( Pegasos , described below ) in Clojure .
This had the added advantage of seeing how well Clojure ’s performance held up when doing some serious number - crunching .
Online Learning
One very appealing property of online learning algorithms is that they are extremely simple .
Here ’s what a general supervised online learning algorithm looks like .
Given a loss function \ ( L\ ) and a stream of examples \ ( S\ ) of the form \ ( ( x , y ) \ ) , do the following :
Initialise a starting model w
While there are more examples in S Get the next feature vector x Predict the label y' for x using the model w
Get the true label y for x and incur a penaly L(y , y ' ) Update the model w if y ≠ y '
Models are usually represented as vectors of weights for the features used to represent the examples .
For binary classification problems predictions involve looking at the sign of the innner product \( \langle w , x \rangle\ ) and the update step in line 2.3 modifies the current model by moving \ ( w\ ) in the direction that most reduces the loss of the incorrect prediction : that is , in the direction given by the negative gradient of the loss .
Pegasos
One recent online algorithm ( and the one I ’ve chosen to implement ) is Pegasos : Primal Estimated sub - GrAdient SOlver for SVM ( PDF ) introduced by Shai Shalev - Shwartz , Yoram Singer and Nathan Srebro at ICML 2007 .
As this is my programming blog ( not my research blog ) I ’ll just give enough of the detail of Pegasos so you can follow the implementation .
Pegasos solves the same optimisation problem as support vector machines .
That is , it minimises the empirical hinge loss with \ ( \ell_2 \ ) regularisation : \[ L( w,S ) = \ frac{\lambda}{2}\|w\| ^2 + \ frac {1}{m} \ sum_{( x , y ) \in S} h( w ; ( x , y ) ) \ ] where \ ( S\ ) is a set of training examples , \( \|\cdot \|\ ) the \ ( \ell_2\ ) norm , \( \lambda\ ) the regularisation constant and \ ( h ( w ; ( x , y ) ) = \ max\{0 , 1 - y\langle w , x \rangle\}\ ) is the hinge loss .
The neat observation that allows optimisation problems like this to be cast as online learning problems is that the above loss can be computed using example - by - example updates rather than as a large sum .
With a little care about how these updates are made fast convergence guarantees can be established .
In the case of Pegasos , if \( w_t\ ) is the model after having seen \ ( t\ ) examples and \ (( x , y ) \ ) is an incorrectly predicted example , the ( unnormalised ) updated model is : \[ w_{t+1} = ( 1 - t^{ - 1} ) w_t + \ frac {1} {\lambda t} yx. \]
If the new model is outside a ball of radius \ ( 1/\sqrt{\lambda}\ ) it is projected back onto this ball .
Implementing it in Clojure
Once I understood what it was doing , Pegasos struck me as a very simple algorithm so I was itching to implement it .
As mentioned earler , I was also curious as to Clojure ’s performance on number - crunching tasks like this , especially when the canonical data set for online learning has over 700,000 examples and over 45,000 features .
Represented as 45 k entry feature vectors , the examples and models would quickly become unwieldy so the first order of business was to implement some sparse vector operations .
Here I chose to represent vectors as hash maps where non-zero elements of a vector are stored with their index as a key and the value of the entry as value .
( defn add " Returns the sparse sum of two sparse vectors x y " [x y ] ( merge - with + x y ) ) ( defn inner " Computes the inner product of the sparse vectors ( hashes ) x and y " [x y ] ( reduce + ( map #(* ( get x % 0 ) ( get y % 0 ) ) ( keys y ) ) ) ) ( defn norm " Returns the l_2 norm of the ( sparse ) vector v " [ v ] ( Math / sqrt ( inner v v ) ) ) ( defn scale " Returns the scalar product of the sparse vector v by the scalar a " [ a v ] ( zipmap ( keys v ) ( map * ( vals v ) ( repeat a ) ) ) ) ( defn project " Returns the projection of a parameter vector w onto the ball of radius r " [ w r ] ( scale ( min (/ r ( norm w ) ) 1 ) w ) )
The only slightly tricky thing here is the use of zipmap to scale a sparse vector by mapping all the keys in the original vector to their values times a scalar multiple a .
The other bit of framework code I required was to parse the training data .
The format is a simple version of that used by SVMlight .
Each line of the text file containing the training data is of the form :
y k_1:v_1 k_2:v_2 ...
k_n:v_n
where y is the label ( either 1 or - 1 ) , each k_i is an integer key representing a feature index , and each v_i is a floating point value .
The Clojure code to parse this format is a pretty straight - forward application of regular expressions :
( defn parse - feature [ string ] ( let [ [ _ key val ] ( re-matches # " ( \d+ ) : (.* ) " string ) ] [ ( Integer / parseInt key ) ( Float / parseFloat val ) ] ) ) ( defn parse - features [ string ] ( into {} ( map parse - feature ( re-seq # " [ ^\s ] + " string ) ) ) ) ( defn parse " Returns a map {:y label , :x sparse - feature - vector} parsed from given line " [ line ] ( let [ [ _ label features ] ( re-matches # " ^(-?\d+ ) (. * ) $ " line ) ] {:y ( Float / parseFloat label ) , :x ( parse - features features ) } ) )
The main parsing function parse takes a whole line in this format as input and returns a hash map with key :y giving the label of the example and :x giving a hash map representing the feature vector .
Finally , the code to perform a single update step for a model given an example is built using some helper functions .
The loss is computed by hinge - loss , the function correct performs a single gradient descent step , and report is just for diagnostics and prints some simple statistics about the model and its performance .
( defn hinge - loss " Returns the hinge loss of the weight vector w on the given example " [ w example ] ( max 0 (- 1 (* ( :y example ) ( inner w ( :x example ) ) ) ) ) ) ( defn correct " Returns a corrected version of the weight vector w " [ w example t lambda ] ( let [x ( :x example ) y ( :y example ) w1 ( scale (- 1 ( / 1 t ) ) w ) eta (/ 1 (* lambda t ) ) r (/ 1 ( Math / sqrt lambda ) ) ] ( project ( add w1 ( scale (* eta y ) x ) ) r ) ) ) ( defn report " Prints some statistics about the given model at the specified interval " [ model interval ] ( if ( zero ? ( mod ( : step model ) interval ) ) ( let [t ( : step model ) size ( count ( keys ( :w model ) ) ) errors ( : errors model ) ] ( println " Step : " t " \t Features in w = " size " \t Errors = " errors " \t Accuracy = " ( / ( float errors ) t ) ) ) ) ) ( defn update " Returns an updated model by taking the last model , the next training and applying the Pegasos update step " [ model example ] ( let [ lambda ( : lambda model ) t ( : step model ) w ( :w model ) errors ( : errors model ) error (> ( hinge - loss w example ) 0 ) ] ( do ( report model 100 ) { :w ( if error ( correct w example t lambda ) w ) , : lambda lambda , : step ( inc t ) , : errors ( if error ( inc errors ) errors ) } ) ) )
As you can see , this function returns a new , updated model as a hash that contains the feature weights :w as well as several other useful bits of information including the culmulative number of errors ( in : errors ) and the total number of update steps ( in : steps ) .
The parameter \( \lambda\ ) which controls the amount of regularisation is also passed along in the model ( in : lambda ) for convenience .
A brief aside :
If I have one criticism of Clojure as a language it ’s that implementing numerical procedures is a real pain .
Prefix notation ( while neatly side - stepping problems of operator precedence ) is just a lot harder to read than the infix notation that many non-Lisp languages use .
{:. quiet }
Now the update step is implemented , training a model online from a sequence of examples is a simple application of reduce .
The following code repeated calls ( update model example ) where each example is taken from the sequence examples and the model output by the last call to update is used as input for the next .
( defn train " Returns a model trained from the initial model on the given examples " [ initial examples ] ( reduce update initial examples ) )
All that ’s needed now is a main method to read examples from the standard input , parse them into vectors and train a model from some starting point :
( defn main " Trains a model from the examples and prints out its weights " [ ] ( let [ start {:lambda 0.0001 , : step 1 , :w {} , : errors 0} examples ( map parse ( -> * in* BufferedReader. line - seq ) ) model ( train start examples ) ] ( println ( map #( str ( key % ) " : " ( val % ) ) ( :w model ) ) ) ) )
When finished the main function prints the weights for the final trained model to the command line in a format similar to the input data .
The training starts with an empty model and a regularisation constant of 0.0001 ( as was used in the paper describing Pegasos ) .
The full version of the code is available at GitHub .
Running It
To see whether the algorithms ( or at least my implementation of it ) performs as advertised I ran it on the aforementioned RCV1 data set .
This is a big data set .
The gzipped version of the full data set weighs in at 423 Mb .
Understandably , I ’m not going to host a file that size so to get the full data set it you will have to follow the instructions at Léon Bottou ’s SGD page and make it yourself .
However , for the purposes of this blog post I ’ve created a 2,000 example version called train2000.dat.gz that is checked into the repository .
With the training data in hand I ran my implementation of Pegasos ( in the file sgd.clj ) like so :
$ zless train2000.dat.gz | clj sgd.clj > output.txt Step : 100 Features in w = 2145 Errors = 64 Accuracy = 0.64 Step : 200 Features in w = 3333 Errors = 123 Accuracy = 0.615 Step : 300 Features in w = 4051 Errors = 175 Accuracy = 0.5833333 Step : 400 Features in w = 4755 Errors = 229 Accuracy = 0.5725 Step : 500 Features in w = 5236 Errors = 276 Accuracy = 0.552 Step : 600 Features in w = 5576 Errors = 318 Accuracy = 0.53 Step : 700 Features in w = 5870 Errors = 356 Accuracy = 0.50857145 Step : 800 Features in w = 6050 Errors = 388 Accuracy = 0.485 Step : 900 Features in w = 6325 Errors = 418 Accuracy = 0.46444446 Step : 1000 Features in w = 6578 Errors = 444 Accuracy = 0.444 Step : 1100 Features in w = 6747 Errors = 471 Accuracy = 0.42818183 Step : 1200 Features in w = 6934 Errors = 502 Accuracy = 0.41833332 Step : 1300 Features in w = 7109 Errors = 526 Accuracy = 0.40461537 Step : 1400 Features in w = 7300 Errors = 555 Accuracy = 0.39642859 Step : 1500 Features in w = 7515 Errors = 592 Accuracy = 0.39466667 Step : 1600 Features in w = 7655 Errors = 615 Accuracy = 0.384375 Step : 1700 Features in w = 7836 Errors = 644 Accuracy = 0.37882352 Step : 1800 Features in w = 8040 Errors = 672 Accuracy = 0.37333333 Step : 1900 Features in w = 8239 Errors = 697 Accuracy = 0.3668421 Step : 2000 Features in w = 8425 Errors = 718 Accuracy = 0.359
As you can see the algorithm slowly adds more and more features to the weight vector and , as a result , slowly improves the accuracy .
The reported accuracy is simply the cumulative total number of errors divided by the number of steps .
This is a fairly pessimistic take on how the later models are performing .
In the last 100 examples the models made a combined total of only 19 mistakes so the final model accuracy is probably closer to 20 % than 35 % .
Performance
My biggest issue with my implementation of online learning in Clojure is that it is too slow .
The 2,000 example test described above took about 40 seconds to complete .
These algorithms are meant to be ridiculously fast .
Léon Bottou reports training times for his C++ stochastic gradient descent algorithm on the full 780 k example RCV1 data set of 1.4 seconds !
Granted I was timing both the parsing and training of the data but on the other hand I ’m using less than 0.3 % of the data .
Indeed , a quick test shows that just parsing the 2,000 examples takes less than 2 seconds so just training on the 2,000 examples takes 35 seconds or more .
Firing up the JVisualVM to see where my code is spending most of its time reveals that a lot of time is spent getting variable values and looking up values in maps .
The performance culprit then is very likely my hastily thrown together sparse vector “ library ” built from hash maps .
Although hash maps are fast there is still a lot of overhead in packing float and integer values in and out of Java Objects and I suspect this is where most of the time is wasted .
If I have time to write a next version , I ’ll make use of the sparse vector data structures in the Java Parallel Colt library .
Conclusions
Despite its lack of speed , I was impressed with how easy it was to implement an online algorithm in Clojure .
Minus the comments , the whole thing — vector operations , reporting , data parsing and training — weighs in at less than 100 lines of code .
Given Clojure ’s ability to call high - performance Java libraries such as Parallel Colt , I ’m optimistic that I can keep the terseness and transparency of the code and get performance comparable to the C++ implementations .
I would also like to experiment with exploiting Clojure ’s concurrency features to chunk and parallelise the main training algorithm .
I suspect that this will be relatively straight - forward and , with a bit of tuning I should get good performance on a multi-core machine .
News that a taekwondo athlete in New Zealand is attempting to fund his bid for 2012 Olympic glory by opening a brothel in Auckland has been greeted glumly by local sports chiefs , seen his business partner get thrown out of his parents ' home and resulted in his deselection from this year 's world championships .
But anyone who thinks that linking the Olympics with sex might in some way harm its image is being naïve – the two are already active bedfellows , entangled as firmly as any copulating couple .
Before we get on to the behaviour of athletes who do make it to the event , Logan Campbell is not the first – not even the first New Zealander – to use sex as a means of reaching it .
Ten years ago , in the same city , the cyclist Nicole Tasker was lap - dancing her way to Sydney .
In 1992 , Kiwi swimmer Toni Jeffs ' journey to Barcelona was sponsored by the owner of a strip club .
It is a bit late for the nation 's sporting authorities to start playing the prude .
Campbell , who should probably be more embarrassed about the fact that his sporting career was entirely inspired by the hit movie The Karate Kid , estimates that he needs to raise £ 120,000 in two years if he is to successfully compete in London and can't think of any better ways of doing it .
" Some people on the team will not think highly of me for doing this , " he says .
" If they saw this place and how it 's operated , they 'd change their mind . "
At anything up to NZ$ 2500 ( £ 970 ) a night , Campbell and his partner are not precisely patrolling the seedy end of the vice business .
They employ only " smart , attractive " girls , and " do n't treat them like pieces of meat " .
Having finished 16th in Beijing , after losing in the first round to the eventual bronze medallist , Campbell has experienced life in the Olympic village .
It appears that the main differences between it and his brothel is that the latter has only 14 rooms and their use is not free .
In Sydney , athletes famously used the 70,000 free condoms organisers had distributed so quickly that another 20,000 had to be ordered – and they had all gone three days before the party ended .
There were 10,651 athletes there .
On one occasion three prostitutes were found in the village itself , guests of a " major American television network " .
In Athens 10,568 athletes got through 130,000 condoms .
At the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City local Mormons took to the streets when news broke of the 250,000 condoms that were being trucked into town .
As that event progressed , vending machines were being restocked every two hours .
This is what happens when thousands of young , single , beautiful people spend lots of time together with nothing much to do and lots of free parties to attend .
Marco Buechel , a skier who competed for Liechtenstein in Salt Lake City , described one relationship he enjoyed there .
" You can contact any athlete , even if you do n't know them at all , " he reported .
" They give you a list when you get there .
Everybody uses it .
I saw this beautiful ski racer , from Greece of all places .
She had the most beautiful eyes I had ever seen .
I sent her an email , in English .
Her reply was very short : ' Not good English .
Want meet you . '
We tried to talk , which was n't very successful , and then we started to drink , which was much more successful . "
The result ?
" It was very beautiful , " he said .
" A beautiful international incident . "
This is n't the place for a debate about the morality of prostitution .
Some might commend Campbell 's entrepreneurial vim , some might find the whole business repugnant , but if anyone at the IOC thinks this kind of thing reflects badly on their event , they will probably find their sheets were n't so clean in the first place .
For this week 's Photoshop Contest , I asked you to design some unlikely gaming peripherals .
And a lot of these , as ludicrous as they are , are n't that much crazier than some of the Wii crap currently for sale .

The Internets are abuzz lately with talk about inclusiveness and diversity in Science Fiction / Fantasy / Speculative Fiction .
There ’s the whole dustup with SFWA ( Science Fiction Writers of America ) which NKJ touched on in this post .
There ’s the Hugo nomination list that includes only one female writer and about two or three writers of color .
There ’s this insane argument pertaining to that .
And then there ’s the issue of diversity in fiction markets and the slush pile * .
That last issue came up several times in the last few weeks both in public ( see Mike Resnick ’s comments here ) and in private conversation regarding Fantasy magazine .
( Yes , again … it never ends . )
In both instances , two editors who differ in age , experience , and probably ethnic or religious background said nearly exactly the same thing to me .
To wit : ” I did n’t know ( or care ) if [ the people who submitted to my markets ] were black , white , purple , or polka - dot ” ( Resnick ) or “ I do n’t choose stories based on race or culture or gender , I just choose the best stories ” ( an editor friend ) .
I really , really hate this excuse – for several reasons .
The first of which is that it gives the appearance of being reasonable , thereby shutting down further discussion or debate .
In writing , only the story should matter , not the writer !
It also assumes that the submission pile represents an adequate and accurate cross-section of writers and stories .
Therefore , by picking the best , the editor is automatically being fair .
The appearance of fairness , though , is false .
That ’s not readily apparent .
Thus , anyone who disagrees seems , to the casual listener , unreasonable and strident .
I submit that I am neither unreasonable nor strident ( at the moment ) .
I hope that means people will hear me out .
The problem with the argument is several - fold .
First , any given slushpile at any given magazine ( with few exceptions ) is not balanced .
There will likely be far more male authors .
There will certainly be a high percentage of white authors .
Most of these authors will be of the same class , the same or similar cultures , and from the same country .
Given that there will be so few stories from women , ethnic minorities , people of different classes , cultures , and countries , and given that very few stories in any given submission pile will be accepted , the chance for diversity is very small .
Why is n’t the slushpile more diverse ?
There are several factors , some of which have nothing to do with the magazine or editor .
Writing requires free time , some measure of economic stability , money , and a supportive environment .
There are some writers who , despite all of these drawbacks , were able to make sales and become famous , but they represent a small minority .
Beyond those factors , there is some fault that lies with the markets themselves .
How do markets choose to advertise that they ’re looking for submissions ?
In the old days ( a whole 7 years ago ) most markets listed themselves in the Writer ’s Market or the Literary Marketplace and probably called it a day .
This pretty much ensured that mostly well - off white men submitted because they had more access to the knowledge that such books existed and the time to pore over it .
Nowadays , there are more options .
Most markets in the SF field have a website and their guidelines are listed there .
We also have sites that collect market information and keep the list updated with news , warnings , etc .
So now the information is more widely available .
But , again , this is usually the end of an editor or publisher ’s efforts to reach writers .
As I mentioned in this post , not all authors gather in the same places and know about the same stuff .
In our genre , many writers and fans of color specifically do n’t get involved in the wider fandom because they do not feel welcome there .
( And if I hear any crap from assholes out there about how people of color need to get over themselves about this , I will smack you – that ’s not a valid argument . )
This is n’t as true about female SF writers as it used to be , but the perception of SF as an old boys club has n’t disappeared completely .
If a market is serious about promoting diversity in the slush pile — and therefore upping the chances of diversity in the magazine — the editor / publisher needs to seek out non-normal venues to alert people about submission guidelines .
This does n’t mean taking out a full page ad in Jet or Ebony , but it does mean doing some investigative work and maybe talking to people who might know about these ‘ secret ’ enclaves .
Even this is not enough .
The next component is the magazine itself .
An editor can shout from the rooftops all he or she wants that they would love to see more stories by women , or by minorities , with female and minority characters .
However , writers will not believe them if they look at the magazine and see nothing but Blandy McWhitey White in Blandy McNeighborhood in America or Blandy McMedieval Europe or Blandy McDefaulty Man in any setting anywhere .
As a reader , I ’m not only looking for authors who are non-white or non-male , I ’m also looking for characters who are non-white , non-male , non-American - acting , non -default .
Honestly , I think about that more than the author ’s background because the story really is the important thing .
At first an editor may not get a lot of this in the fiction that comes over the transom .
So turn to the well - known writers who submit to you instead .
Encourage them to send you more stories that will help transform the image of a magazine by and for Defaulty McWhite into one that is interested in exploring a wider spectrum of ideas and viewpoints .
In order to attract stories of this type from newer writers , an editor or publisher has to work hard .
They have to advertise this fact .
There are plenty of submission guidelines that say something like , “ We do n’t see enough science fiction stories . ”
How about “ We do n’t see enough / We would like to see more stories that feature different cultures , female / ethnic minority characters , non-American settings . ”
In fact , it would work better to be even more explicit and detailed than that .
Another idea NKJ offered was for markets to pick regular themes which touch on different areas that might invite in a more diverse mix of content .
For example , a fantasy magazine might ask for works derived from a different culture each month , or based on the folktales of a different nation .
Much of the problem here is perception .
If writers do n’t perceive that markets are friendly toward them as minorities or toward stories that do n’t just feature white males , they wo n’t bother to send to those markets .
They also wo n’t bother to buy the magazines .
If editors and publishers change their attitudes and change their perceptions , writers will take a closer look .
The submission pile will , slowly , become more diverse .
There ’s still one more step : selecting submissions .
I would never suggest to an editor that they should choose a story simply because the author or main character is female or black .
However , I would suggest that editors take a harder look at the stories they like from the slush pile .
Does the story contain a heavy infusion of Blandy McDefaulty character / setting ?
How many stories have you accepted lately with these qualities ?
Have you received any stories that you love that are n’t Blandy ?
Is it worth it to maybe be really selective about the Blandy stories and try harder to find non-Blandy stories you really love ?
I ’m willing to bet that most editors do n’t think about this at all .
They just say “ Hey , I liked that story ! ” and move on .
How much thought is given to the balance of stories you ’re publishing ?
If a market just is n’t getting a lot of diverse stories , that ’s an acceptable reason .
It ’s the editor ’s job to then do everything she or he can to draw in that diversity and then be very conscious of how well they ’re implementing it .
None of this matters if a given editor does n’t care about diversifying their market .
If you just want to continue publishing the same kinds of stories by the same kinds of people because that ’s what you want to read and promote , fine .
But do n’t then tell me you ’re “ choosing the best stories ” because , as you can see , you may not be seeing the ‘ best ’ all of SF has to offer , you ’re only seeing the best of what white men have to offer .
I am well aware that when I post this there is every chance that a horde of editors and people who know editors and people who think they know what they ’re talking about will come here and tell me how wrong I am about one or more of the points I raised above .
I ’m going to head a little of this off at the pass with three points :
1. I was an editor for two small press SF magazines for five years .
I read a lot of slush .
Though the markets I worked for are not nearly as well known , high paying , or prestigious as the Big Three * * or even ‘ second tier ’*** markets , the ‘ zines did publish authors who ’d also appeared in those other arenas .
The slush piles are not identical , probably , but not so very different .
2 . If anyone disagrees that their slush piles or Table of Contents are not diverse , I invite you to post your stats in the comments .
The Male / Female author breakdown is easier to tell from names , etc. , but I understand that someone ’s ethnicity or cultural background is not readily apparent .
However , you can take note of where the submissions come from – that ’s one data point .
And you can also take note of the gender , race , class , and culture of the characters in the story .
( Here ’s a hint , if the race , class , or culture is n’t explicitly mentioned , you can usually assume white , middle class , American . )
This post will be here for a long time , so if it takes you a while to gather this data , do n’t worry .
We ’ll still be interested in a month or a year or whenever .
However , if you ca n’t back up your counter - argument with numbers , then do n’t bother claiming that you ’re absolutely right and I ’m absolutely wrong .
It does n’t work that way .
3 . Before you start to get upset that I ’m calling editors and publishers racist or sexist , please read this post on White Liberal Guilt .
The main thrust is that just because I or anyone else points out that a person is being insensitive to these issues does n’t mean we ’re calling you a bad person .
Sometimes it takes people from outside pointing out things you ca n’t see / are n’t aware of in order to bring it to your attention .
That ’s all I ’m doing here , bringing stuff to your attention .
So , to review .
To promote diversity in your slushpile and then , by extension , your market , you must :
Make sure a wide range of people know that your magazine accepts unsolicited submissions by reaching out and posting notifications in venues frequented by non-white and non-male individuals .
Put your money where your mouth is .
Publish more stories by established authors that feature non-default people and non -default settings so that newer authors ( and readers ) will see your market as open to diverse views and ideas .
Update submission guidelines to very clear statements of what the market is looking for or lacking .
Get creative with ways to attract more diverse subjects , settings , characters , and writers .
In the fiction selection process , think carefully about the stories you choose .
Publish stories that reflect a true balance ( but do n’t lower your standards to do so ) .
Agree ?
Disagree ?
Bring it on .

* Slush Pile – how editors refer to the stack of unsolicited ( i.e. non-asked for or non-agented ) submissions they get .
Going through these stories is sometimes called ‘ slushing ’ .
** Big Three - Asimov’s , F&SF , Analog
*** Second Tier – my own term for prestigious , well - paying markets that are n’t the Big Three .
This includes Realms of Fantasy , Strange Horizons , Weird Tales , Interzone , etc .

Bird strike !
The moment 200 starlings were sucked into passenger jet engine on take - off

Dwarfed by the jetliner , they look little more than a smattering of black dots .
But this flock of birds could have brought the plane crashing down in seconds .
They flew straight into the path of the Germania airlines flight to Kosovo as it took off from Dusseldorf airport with 80 on board .
Flight into danger : A flock of starlings fly straight into the path of the Boeing airliner as it lifts off at 200mph
More than 200 birds were sucked into one of the engines as one of the pilots can be seen watching what was happening .
The markings directly below him are believed to be pitot tubes which measure the speed of the aircraft as opposed to holes in the fuselage created by the birds
‘ It was like a scene from the Hitchcock movie The Birds .
One second all was clear , and the next thing you saw were these birds swarming over the plane , ’ said an onlooker .
It is thought more than 200 starlings were sucked into the right engine as the Boeing jet approached 200mph .
Others dented the fuselage but thankfully did not pierce it .
Their splattered remains could be seen on the plane later .
‘ The pitch of the engine said it all , ’ said plane - spotter Juergen Kienast , who took these dramatic pictures .
‘ It was like sticking a bit of metal pipe into a blender . ’
Once airborne , the pilot reported engine damage and circled for almost 45 minutes before landing safely .
No -one was hurt and the plane had only minor damage .
A similar bird strike brought down an Airbus in the Hudson in New York in January this year .

Furthering their long - standing opposition to people ‘ jailbreaking ’ the iPhone , Apple has made a powerful assertion that is sure to leave some people with gaping mouths .
According to them , the practice could lead to massive denial of service attacks on cell towers .
Apple ’s claim is that people tinkering with the iPhone ’s software innards could execute commands that would crash cell tower software , resulting in people being unable to make phone calls or otherwise causing havoc on local cell networks .
They draw a comparison between people jailbreaking the iPhone to someone breaking into a corporate network and damaging computers .
I give credit to Apple for the iPhone , but can they truly be making such a claim with a straight face ?
Cell phones have been broken millions of times across multiple platforms and multiple vendors .
What makes the iPhone so exceptionally dangerous that allowing people the freedom to tinker with it will result in massive service outages all over the world ?
Currently , the U.S. Copyright Office is reviewing requests backed by the EFF and others to completely legalize jailbreaking .
If enough people buy Apple ’s rhetoric regarding this , however , such efforts could be crushed .
It 's clear that the company just wants to protect their bottom line , but their latest claims are preposterous at best .
Unusually large numbers of dead pilchards have mysteriously been washing up on the beaches north of Auckland .
The disclosure from Biosecurity New Zealand comes in the wake in the wake of reports that a mystery illness has affected a large numbers of dogs , and killed two , following visits to North Shore City beaches .
The Ministry said that it had investigated several incidents of sick dogs , including four from Narrowneck Beach , one from Browns Bay and one from Waiheke Island .
The fish have been washing up on Whangaparaoa Peninsula and Martins Bay and have been sent for testing to rule out a disease with results due back next week .
" It is too soon to tell if there is any connection between the dead fish and the dog illness , but given that they occurred in different locations , they are being treated as unrelated at this time . "
The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry 's biodiversity division said it had received a large number of reports in recent weeks about dogs suffering from repeated vomiting .
While most have recovered quickly , it said some had developed seizures and died .
There was no indication so far as to what had caused the illnesses or deaths but pathology results from the dog that died yesterday are due back this week , MAF said .
" There has been nothing so far to indicate the situation is due to any form of chemical or pesticide poisoning . "
Anyone who found unusual numbers of dead fish or other marine life is urged to report this to the Ministry 's pest and disease hotline : 0800 80 99 66 .
Ivory Venus
The centrepiece of 19th - century anatomical displays was normally a female figure , which could be stripped and split into different sections by the museum proprietor .
This " Venus " was often beautiful and sexually alluring , its perfection in stark contrast to some of the more macabre exhibits .
( Image : Wellcome Library )
Male anatomical illustration
This image comes from a 1702 anatomical atlas called The anatomy of the bodies of man and woman .
The book was the first to allow its readers to perform virtual " dissections " , by lifting the flaps to reveal internal organs .

Inside someone 's head
This anatomical dissection of the head and neck is incredibly detailed .
In particular , the teeth , tongue , muscles , tendons and bone structure are accurately replicated .
For visitors to the Great Exhibition of 1851 , this would have been the next best thing to looking inside the human body .

Bearded lady
" Bearded ladies " were common exhibits in sideshows of the 19th and early 20th centuries .
Though most would have been faked , it is possible that some of these individuals were suffering from the rare but real disorder congenital generalised hypertrichosis terminalis ( CGHT ) , otherwise known as " werewolf syndrome " .

Zypries über Datenschutz und Netzsperren : " Die Piraten sind mir zu konservativ "
Justizministerin Brigitte Zypries ( SPD ) über die digitale Bürgerrechtsbewegung , den Konflikt mit Ursula von der Leyen um die Sperren im Internet und die Unwählbarkeit der Piratenpartei .
Frau Zypries , warum wählt jemand die Piratenpartei ?
Das ist mir schleierhaft .
Ich bin wirklich die Letzte , die die Bedeutung der Informationsfreiheit gering schätzt , aber ich finde es schon sehr dürftig , wenn sich das Programm einer Partei , die für den Bundestag kandidiert , im Wesentlichen auf dieses Thema beschränkt .
Antworten auf Zukunftsfragen wie Arbeitsmarkt , Chancengerechtigkeit , Wirtschafts - und Finanzkrise ?
Fehlanzeige !
Was ich bisher von der Piratenpartei mitbekommen habe , war eher bescheiden .
Ich war fast ein wenig enttäuscht von dem Niveau , auf dem da diskutiert wird .
Warum diese harschen Worte ?
Viele , mit denen ich diskutiert habe , nehmen die Tatsachen einfach nicht zur Kenntnis .
Und das regt mich wirklich auf .
Ich erlebe es zum Beispiel immer wieder auf Veranstaltungen , dass behauptet wird , bei der Vorratsdatenspeicherung würden die Inhalte der Telefonate aufgezeichnet .
Das ist schlichtweg falsch .
Wer so argumentiert , schafft kein Vertrauen in eine Partei .
Dass in der Diskussion manchmal falsche Behauptungen aufgestellt werden , mag sein .
Aber nehmen Sie die Befürchtungen ernst ?
Ja , selbstverständlich nehme ich die Sorgen der Internetgemeinde sehr ernst .
Ich habe das immer getan und auch öffentlich deutlich gemacht .
Ich befinde mich konstant im Dialog mit Vertretern der Internetgemeinde .
Dennoch haben
Sie das Gesetz über die Internetsperren mitgetragen .
Fürchten
Sie nicht , dass Sie einen
Teil der netzaffinen Wähler damit zu den Piraten treiben ?
Eine Wahlentscheidung sollte sich nicht nur auf eine spezielle Frage stützen .
Aber wenn ich etwas politisch für richtig halte , dann kann ich das nicht fallen lassen , weil eine bestimmte Gruppe der Internetnutzer droht , eine andere Partei zu wählen .
Das hätte mit konsequenter und geradliniger Politik nichts zu tun .
Man könnte auch sagen , Sie nehmen den Wählerwillen ernst .
Bei allem Respekt , die Kritiker dieses Gesetzes repräsentieren nicht den Wählerwillen , es gibt viele Menschen , die anderer Ansicht sind .
Und es ist ja nicht so , dass wir nicht mit den Kritikern der Internetsperren geredet hätten .
Ihre Argumente sind berücksichtigt worden , wir haben die Regelung eng ausgestaltet , Rechtsschutz eingebaut und das Ganze auf drei Jahre befristet .
Zur Wahrhaftigkeit im politischen Diskurs würde es gehören , das auch anzuerkennen .
Daran fehlt es aber .
Die Kritiker sehen das Gesetz als einen Präzedenzfall .
Sie glauben , dass zum ersten Mal eine Infrastruktur geschaffen wird , mit der unliebsame Inhalte aus dem Netz gefischt werden sollten .
Für sie geht es um alles oder nichts .
Das ist inhaltlich falsch und zeigt mangelnde Professionalität im politischen Geschäft .
Ich habe immer klar gesagt : Internetsperren dürfen nicht zu einem allgemeinen Überwachungsinstrument werden .
Deshalb hat die SPD dafür gesorgt , dass es ein eigenständiges Gesetz gibt - außerhalb des Telemediengesetzes - , das die Sperren strikt auf kinderpornografische Seiten beschränkt und zeitlich befristet ist .
Vor allem aber haben wir den Grundsatz „ Löschen vor Sperren “ durchgesetzt .
Das ist ein Erfolg , da haben sich auch die Internet - Aktivisten Verdienste erworben .
Schade finde ich , wenn deren einzige Reaktion ist : Jetzt reden wir nicht mehr mit euch , weil ihr das Gesetz trotz allem verabschiedet habt .
Den Lösch - Vorschlag hatten die Bürgerrechtler vor allem gemacht , um Alternativen zu den Sperren aufzuzeigen .
Das eigentliche Anliegen war , das Gesetz zu verhindern .
Wenn man in einem demokratischen Meinungsbildungsprozess Einfluss nehmen will , muss man sich entscheiden : Entweder man verfällt in eine Blockadehaltung und muss dann hinnehmen , überstimmt zu werden , wenn man keine Mehrheit für seinen Vorschlag findet .
Oder man mischt sich ein , versucht , die eigenen Positionen so weit es eben geht einzubringen und steht dann hinterher zum Ergebnis .
Und nichts tun gegen kinderpornografische Inhalte im Netz ist nun wirklich keine Option .
War es ein Fehler , das Gesetz mit den Internetsperren zu machen ?
Nein .
Das Gesetz ist notwendig geworden , weil die Kollegin von der Leyen angefangen hat , Verträge mit den Providern über diese Sperren zu schließen .
Ich habe gleich zu Beginn der Debatte deutlich gemacht , dass eine solche Vertragslösung nicht mit unserer Verfassung vereinbar ist .
Zugangssperren sind ein Eingriff in Grundrechte und bedürfen deshalb von Verfassungs wegen eines Gesetzes .
Um so wenig Rechte wie möglich zu beschränken , hat die SPD im Gesetzgebungsverfahren den Grundsatz „ Löschen vor Sperren “ durchgesetzt .
Das Problem an der Debatte war , dass sie kaum sachlich zu führen war .
Wieso ?
Weil jede noch so zutreffende Kritik an der eingeschlagenen Vertragslösung vom politischen Gegner sofort darauf verkürzt wurde , dass man ja ganz offenbar nicht gegen Kinderpornografie im Internet kämpfen wolle .
Welch ein Unfug .
Und auf der anderen Seite stehen dann diejenigen , die sagen : Das ist aber Zensur .
Da kriegt man keine sachliche Ebene hin .
Sie haben bei dem Gesetz also mitgemacht , weil die Union Sie in die Enge getrieben hat ?
Nein , ich musste vielmehr zur Kenntnis nehmen , dass die Provider bereit waren , diese Verträge abzuschließen .
Und um in dieser Situation Rechtssicherheit für die Betroffenen zu schaffen , ging kein Weg an der gesetzlichen Regelung vorbei .
Wir betreten damit juristisches und technisches Neuland , deshalb die Befristung , um nach drei Jahren zu überprüfen , ob sie hält , was wir uns davon versprochen haben .
Gesetzt den Fall , Sie wären nach der Wahl Justizministerin einer Regierung ohne CDU .
Was würden Sie an dem Gesetz wieder ändern ?
Zunächst einmal nichts , denn die SPD hat ja die Befristung durchgesetzt , um die Regelung evaluieren zu können .
Ich gehe ohnehin davon aus , dass wir in der nächsten Legislaturperiode eine grundsätzliche Debatte um die Freiheit im Internet führen müssen .
Wir müssen die Freiheit aller im Netz gewährleisten , nicht nur derjenigen , die technisch besonders versiert sind .
Da schwingt wieder die Vorstellung vieler Politiker vom Internet als rechtsfreiem Raum mit , in dem sich nur die Starken und die Outlaws durchsetzen .
Dabei gelten die Gesetze doch auch für das Netz .
Warum sagen
Sie so etwas ?
Weil alle wissen , dass die Globalität und die Geschwindigkeit im Netz Rechtsdurchsetzung faktisch sehr schwer macht .
Haben
Sie mal versucht , jemanden , der im Internet strafbare Inhalte über Sie verbreitet , daran zu hindern ?
Dann gibt es also Schwierigkeiten bei der Durchsetzung des bisherigen Rechts .
Das ist doch kein Argument für neue Gesetze , oder ?
Doch , das kann ein Argument für Gesetze sein , mit denen man bestehenden Rechten zur besseren Durchsetzung verhilft .
Schauen
Sie mal ins Urheberrecht , da haben wir das gemacht und es funktioniert .
Wir sind uns doch sicher über eines einig : Wenn wir Rechte haben , sie aber nicht durchsetzen können , haben wir ein Problem .
Wie lässt sich das Ihrer Meinung nach ändern ?
Mit einer neuen Behörde ?
Zu allererst brauchen wir mal eine nüchterne Bestandsaufnahme .
Das Problem ist doch , dass die Mechanismen , die wir in der realen Welt zur Durchsetzung der rechtlichen Regeln haben , nicht ohne weiteres in die Welt des Internets übertragbar sind , denn : Das Netz ist anonym , das Recht ist personalisiert .
Das Netz ist global , das Recht gilt regional .
Das Netz ist schnell , Recht braucht Zeit .
Bis ich einen gerichtlichen Beschluss gegen jemanden im Ausland erwirkt habe , der ihn verpflichtet , bestimmte Sachen aus dem Netz zu nehmen , hat er die schon fünf Mal auf einen anderen Server verschoben .
Und da muss man sich schon überlegen , wie man mit diesem Befund umgeht .
Haben Sie eine Idee ?
Wir brauchen Lösungen , wenn legitime Interessen kollidieren , beispielsweise wenn es um die Nutzung von Ideen und die Rechte der Kreativen an ihrem geistigen Eigentum geht .
Wir müssen die Schwächeren schützen , allen voran die Kinder , aber auch die Verbraucher , die im Netz Opfer unlauterer Geschäftspraktiken werden .
Und wir müssen mit Hilfe des Rechts sicherstellen , dass alle Menschen in Deutschland von den Vorteilen des Netzes profitieren können .
International brauchen wir einen „ Gutes - Internet - Kodex “ .
Die Staaten dieser
Welt sollten sich zusammensetzen und überlegen :
Wie können wir dieses Internet einigermaßen sauber halten ?
Sollen die Justizminister der Länder über diesen Kodex beraten ?
Das müssen nicht zwingend die Justizminister sein .
Schließlich kann man das alles nicht nur rechtlich verordnen .
Wir brauchen eine gesellschaftliche Debatte in den einzelnen Staaten über dieses Thema .
In Europa könnte man eine solche Diskussion im Europarat anstoßen .
Und am Ende stünde eine Art Welthandelsorganisation für das Internet ?
Nein , ich stelle mir das eher als transnationales Werk von Verträgen vor , eine Art Kyoto - Protokoll für das Internet .
Das wäre eine Selbstverpflichtung der Staaten und Provider , bestimmte Standards im Internet einzuhalten .
Selbstverpflichtungen funktionieren allerdings selten .
Warum sollte das hier anders sein ?
Das stimmt ja nicht .
Selbstverpflichtungen sind besser als ihr Ruf !
Man muss aber auch sehen , dass es schlechterdings kaum möglich sein wird , weltweit zu einem einheitlichen Recht zu kommen .
Selbstverpflichtungen können eine gesellschaftliche Debatte über ein Thema auslösen .
Und die brauchen wir , nicht nur in Deutschland .
In Schweden haben die Piraten bei der Europawahl sieben Prozent bekommen .
Wäre das auch in Deutschland möglich ?
Das starke Wahlergebnis der Piratenpartei in Schweden erklärt sich für mich vor allem aus dem Umstand , dass die Schweden , die hierzulande immer als sehr liberal gelten , eine extrem restriktive Innenpolitik machen .
Ich gehe nicht davon aus , dass die Piraten bei der Bundestagswahl in die Nähe der Fünf - Prozent - Hürde kommen .
Die Umwelt - und Alternativbewegung und die aus ihr entstehenden Grünen wurden am Anfang auch nicht ernst genommen .
Plötzlich saßen sie in den Parlamenten .
Könnte das nicht wieder passieren ?
Es reicht nicht , wenn sich die Programmatik einer Partei darin erschöpft , einem Lebensgefühl Ausdruck zu verleihen nach dem Motto : wir sind jung , wir kennen das Netz und ihr Alten versteht davon nichts .
Was die Piratenpartei zudem von den Grünen in ihren Anfängen unterscheidet : Ihr fehlen die Galionsfiguren mit politischem Profil , wie beispielsweise Otto Schily oder Joschka Fischer .
Sie haben selbst gesagt , dass über die Zukunft des Netzes gesellschaftlich diskutiert werden muss .
Wenn das
Thema so relevant ist , spricht das doch für eine gewisse Dauerhaftigkeit einer solchen Partei , oder ?
Nein , das spricht für die Dauerhaftigkeit des Themas , aber nicht der Partei .
Die Piratenpartei greift das eigentliche
Thema ja gar nicht auf .
Wenn ich sie ernst nehmen soll , müsste sie mehr zustande bringen als nur zu sagen : Die Vorratsdatenspeicherung ist schlecht .
Die Piraten wollen nicht mehr als den Status Quo im Netz zu erhalten .
Das ist Besitzstandswahrung .
Das ist konservativ und viel zu rückwärtsgewandt .
Damit kann man keinen Blumentopf gewinnen .
Über was müssten die Piraten denn Ihrer Meinung nach diskutieren ?
Das müssen sie schon selbst wissen , ein Teil dessen , den ich für diskussionswürdig halte , habe ich ja beschrieben .
Die technische Entwicklung geht mit Rasanz voran , wer weiß , ob wir nicht in fünf Jahren eine neue Generation des Internets haben .
Vielleicht hat dann jeder Mensch eine individuelle IP - Adresse , die so unverwechselbar ist wie seine Telefonnummer ?
Was hieße das denn für die Anonymität des Netzes ?
Aber von solchen Entwicklungen wissen viele Piraten offenbar gar nichts - jedenfalls diskutieren sie nicht darüber .
Was heißt das ?
Nun , wenn sich das Internet so entwickelte , hätten wir zum Beispiel viele Probleme bei der Verfolgung von Straftaten im Internet nicht mehr , weil die IP - Adresse wie ein Fingerabdruck zum Aufspüren von Kriminellen genutzt werden könnte .
Wahrscheinlich gefällt das den Piraten nicht .
Aber man muss sich doch trotzdem der Diskussion und den Problemen stellen und dabei Konzepte für die Zukunft entwickeln .
Today I ’d like to introduce a guest blogger , Duana Welch , Ph.D. , author of Love Science , a fabulous relationship advice column that bases its advice in social science research rather than opinion .
Check out Duana ’s blog at http://www.lovesciencemedia.com/.
Sorry ; no pictures .
But you really are here for the articles …right ?
Right ?!?
And in that spirit , Wise Readers , here are two notes your cohorts sent regarding pornography and marital happiness — the first from a man , the second from a woman :
“ I think that happiness , including sexual , can be satisfied in many ways both with and without influences outside of the marital relationship .
Unfortunately , one answer to what the effects of porn are on marital well - being is , “ It depends . ”
There is such a huge dynamic involved .
Full disclosure : I have looked at boobies on the Internet .
I love my wife and in no way think that those other boobies have changed the way I feel about her . ”
– Sam
“ I am already pretty insecure about my own sexiness quotient , and I think feeling sexy to your mate is key to being able to open up and fulfill both of your sexual and emotional desires .
Knowing that my mate needs to fill his thrill with external stimulants does not make me more inclined to open up more — in fact it has the opposite effect .
On the other hand , it is probably all in the approach — light porn shared between secure partners might serve to rev the engine .
But porn found stashed on the computer or behind t- shirts in the closet is not the best way to ignite my flame .
🙂
Unless it ’s the flame behind my eyes … ”
– Gina
So who ’s right ?
Is porn a mere pastime , a marital peril , or some combination of the two ?
Certainly , the question is not an idle one ; porn outsells all other forms of media combined every year , and the National Research Council reports that in the USA , porn is a bigger money - maker than all pro sports together .
Recently , Utah ’s residents were reported to be America ’s top Internet - porn “ end users ” ( pun intended ) , with much hoopla ensuing about What It All Means .
Happily for us , for almost 30 years , well - regarded researchers such as Dr. Neil Malamuth and Dr. Ed Donnerstein have studied porn ’s effects .
Experiments abound ; conclusive , cause - based answers — no wussy mere correlations here !— exist .
And the first conclusion is : Viewing porn * causes * increased male violence against women and increased male acceptance of violence against women — IF and only if the porn viewed is violent .
In the typical rape porn script , women who are initially unwilling appear to become enthusiastic participants in their degradation , ultimately screaming out for more .
In these experiments , men are randomly assigned to view violent porn or non-violent porn or non-porn , and are then given opportunities to behave so that the researchers can compare the groups ’ resulting attitudes and behaviors .
It is now well - documented that men who experience violent porn are more accepting of such violence , believe sexual violence is not such a big deal , rate injuries real women have sustained as not being severe , recommend 50 % lighter prison sentences for real rapists , and –most compelling — they actually harm women .
For example , in one such experiment by Donnerstein , men who viewed a violent porn film gave higher shocks to a woman who made a learning error than did the men who viewed a non-violent porn or non-porn movie ( the violent - porn viewers also gave much lower shocks to a man who made a learning mistake ) .
The men were not actually administering shocks ; but they fully believed that they were .
Yet most of the porn consumed today is non-violent ; everyone in the images is portrayed as ready , willing , able , and of legal age .
So what are the effects there ?
First , the good news : Non-violent porn viewing among non-addicted observers does not cause mates to stop loving one another , nor to actively harm one another .
If a spouse is devoting a lot of time and money to porn consumption , that is taking away from the couple ’s bond–but that can be said of any activity with an inappropriate focus of time , dollars and energy .
On the other hand , you can forget this rationale : “ Honey , I actually want you more if I watch porn ! ”
Although porn can have a very temporary effect of making men want to have sex with the nearest acceptable person — such as their spouse — the longer - term impact is not positive for the marital bond .
Simply put , porn makes men less excited by and attracted to their mates .
Experiments by Dr. Douglas T. Kenrick , Dr. Dolf Zillman and others show that men who have recently viewed porn rate their own partners as substantially less desirable and attractive than men who watch non-porn material .
( To a much lesser degree , this is true of watching gorgeous creatures generally ; even men who have recently seen an episode of “ Charlie ’s [ fully - clothed ] Angels ” rate photos of a normal , unknown woman as plain … plain . )
We ’ve paid a lot of attention to men ’s perceptions ; they buy and watch the vast majority of the porn , and that ’s where most of the research has focused .
What of women ’s post - porno experience ?
In a nutshell , women are more physically turned on by porn in the moment than they admit ; women worry about their mates finding them less appealing after the women have seen porn ; women see themselves as less desirable after watching porn ; and women flatly reject the idea that they would want to be raped .
So , Sam and Gina :
You ’re both partly right .
Sam , you ’re almost certainly not less in love with your wife for having seen a few extra boobies , although unless hers are truly supreme , you may find yourself less attracted to hers than before .
And Gina , if your physique compares unfavorably to the perfect pay - per- view bodies , you ’re feeling appropriately threatened vis -à - vis your desirableness to your mate .
And both of you :
In no case is porn actually helping your marriage .
What ’s a guy or girl to do ?
Obviously , avoid the violent stuff .
As for non-violent porn , it ’s no marital happiness promoter , but it ’s not necessarily the home - wrecker it ’s been cast as , either .
Cheers ,
Duana

Thanks for visiting !
Let ’s face it :
Many people are drawn to investment banking for the money .
That ’s why investment banker salary and compensation reports like this are one of the most popular topics on this site .
I used to report every year on the latest investment banking salary trends in order to answer the popular question , “ How Much Does An Investment Banker Earn ? ”
And then I stopped .
Luckily , banks ignored me and kept paying out healthy bonuses to everyone .
I ’ll explain why I stopped publishing these annual salary reports , but rest assured : this article is about Investment Banking salary and compensation data , including the actual numbers as of 2019 , so let ’s get started :
The First Rule of Investment Banker Salaries
The “ First Rule ” of investment banker salaries is to discount most of what you read online .
If you do some Google searches , you ’ll find articles that make statements like the following :
“ An investment banking analyst should make $ 155 K , $ 180 K , and $ 205 K in years one , two and three ( plus or minus $ 5 - 10 K depending on how good or bad the bank did ) . ”
These reports are n’t necessarily “ wrong , ” but they are incomplete because :
They do n’t provide a compensation range – and different banks and groups pay different amounts .
– and different banks and groups pay different amounts .
End of year bonus amounts can very widely based on the “ performance bucket ” you ’re put into .
Most reports do n’t specify whether these amounts include just your base salary plus end - of - year bonus … or also the signing bonus … or also the stub bonus .
How Investment Banking Compensation Works
For junior bankers ( Analysts and Associates ) in investment banking careers , there are five components to compensation : Base Salaries , End - of - Year Bonuses , Signing Bonuses , Stub Bonuses , and Benefits .
Let ’s look at each one :
Base Salary – Your most reliable income stream .
You earn this regardless of whether you ’re a superstar or a complete failure – at least until you get fired .
Base salaries are $ 85 K , $ 90 K , and $ 95 K USD for 1 st , 2 nd , and 3 rd Year Analysts at mid-sized and large banks .
Some elite boutique banks may pay slightly more , while regional boutiques may pay slightly less .
Base salaries for Associates go from ~ $ 140 K to ~ $ 180 K as they move up .

Base salaries for Associates go from to as they move up .
End - of - Year Bonus –
This is a percentage of your base salary , and it ’s based on your ranking “ bucket , ” overall deal flow , and how much other banks are planning to pay .
Some banks pay this bonus to Analysts at the calendar - year end and offer a “ stub bonus ” after the first 5 - 6 months , while others pay this bonus in the summer after an entire year of work has ended .
Full - year bonuses for Analysts tend to be between 70 % and 100 % of base salaries , with numbers at or above 100 % for the top performers .
Expect higher numbers at elite boutiques and lower numbers at regional boutiques .
Top Associate bonuses are 100 % + of base salaries .

Top Associate bonuses are of base salaries .
Stub Bonus – New Analysts and Associates start working in the summer .
They used to receive their bonuses one year after that , but many banks started to pay bonuses to everyone at the same time , which created a problem :
How much of a bonus do they award to bankers who just started working 5 - 6 months ago ?
The answer is “ not much ” because Analyst stub bonuses range between $ 20 K and $ 30 K .
Associates earn more than that , but it ’s still a low percentage of the Year 1 base salary .

Associates earn more than that , but it ’s still a low percentage of the Year 1 base salary .
Signing Bonus – Compensation reports often ignore this one , but most banks pay new full - time hires a one - time signing bonus as well .
The range for Analysts is $ 5 K – $ 15 K , with smaller firms at the low end of the range and elite boutiques at the high end .
Associates should receive significantly more ( a multiple of these numbers ) .

The range for Analysts is , with smaller firms at the low end of the range and elite boutiques at the high end .
Associates should receive significantly more ( a multiple of these numbers ) .
Benefits – Finally , you receive health insurance , vacation days , and potential participation in the firm ’s profit - sharing or 401 ( k ) retirement plans .
Many people ignore these points , but receiving solid health insurance from a large company is extremely valuable in the U.S. , though it matters less in countries with healthcare systems that actually work ( Canada , Australia , Europe , etc. ) .
Beyond the Analyst and Associate levels , the stub bonus goes away because everyone works on a calendar - year basis from the start .
Stock and Deferred Compensation
Base salaries and bonuses increase substantially as you become more senior , but large portions of your bonus will be in stock and deferred compensation – at least if you work at a bulge bracket bank .
The deferred portions often vest over 3 - 5 years , so do n’t count on being able to access that full $ 1 million bonus anytime soon .
Finally , bonuses for senior investment bankers are much more closely linked to individual performance , though the “ formula ” is not always straightforward .
For example , if you generate $ 10 million in fees for the bank , what percentage of it goes to your bonus ?
It depends on the bank and deal type .
Investment Banker Salaries By Role
Investment Banking Analyst Salaries
Base salaries for 1st , 2nd , and 3rd Year Analysts at large banks are $ 85 K , $ 90 K , and $ 95 K , with year - end bonuses between 70 % and 100 % of those numbers ( lower percentages in earlier years and higher toward the end ) .
Average total compensation ranges might be $ 140 K – $ 160 K , $ 160 K – $ 180 K , and $ 180 K – $ 200 K for 1st , 2nd , and 3rd Year Analysts .
These numbers are pre-tax and exclude the stub bonus and signing bonus ; add ~ $ 10 K if you want to count the signing bonus .
The stub bonus is a negative development because it means you ’ll have to wait 1.5 years for the full Year 1 bonus , and you may never see your full Year 2 bonus .
Associate Salaries
Associates earn base salaries of $ 140 K – $ 180 K , progressing up from Year 1 through Year 4 , with bonuses of up to 100 % + of those base salaries .
Total compensation might be in the $ 250 K – $ 400 K range , with a lower number in the first full year ( $ 200 K or less ) due to the stub bonus .
Vice President to Director Salaries
Investment Banking Vice Presidents through Directors ( AKA Senior VPs ) earn base salaries ranging from $ 200 K to $ 300 K , with bonuses worth 120 % – 150 % of base salaries .
Total compensation ranges from ~ $ 450 K up to ~ $ 700 K .
Managing Director Salaries
Managing Directors earn base salaries of $ 400 K – $ 600 K , with highly variable bonuses that might be almost nothing or millions of dollars .
Average total compensation is in the high - six - figure - to - low - seven - figure range ; an MD doing decently at a large firm should earn at least $ 1 million per year .
Again , cash compensation will be far lower at bulge bracket banks because of the bonus deferral , which is one reason why elite boutiques have been on a recruiting tear .
Salaries In Other Groups , Countries , and Cities
Compensation does not vary much between different groups at the Analyst level .
Even if your group ’s deal flow is poor , you ’re not going to earn much less than Analysts in other groups because it ’s not your responsibility to close deals .
Compensation starts to vary more as you move up , and it ’s a bit lower in capital markets groups such as ECM than in industry groups or M&A groups .
London Investment Banker Salary Data
After New York , the biggest market for investment banking is London , and Arkesden publishes helpful compensation reports there .
Standard base salaries for Analysts are £ 50 K , £ 55 K , and £ 60 K for 1st , 2nd , and 3rd Year Analysts ; average bonuses are £ 30 – £ 35 K , £ 35 – £ 40 K , and £ 40 – £ 50 K .
At a 1.40x GBP / USD exchange rate , those numbers equate to lower compensation than in the U.S. : $ 115 K through $ 150 K rather than $ 140 K through $ 200 K .
That ’s so much lower that I almost doubt the numbers ;
Is Brexit to blame ?
Or is it the bonus : salary cap ?
I do n’t know .
Associates in London earn base salaries of £ 80 K – £ 120 K , while VPs earn base salaries of £ 140 K – £ 160 K .
Total compensation ranges from £ 120 K through £ 220 K for Associates and £ 250 K through £ 350 K for VPs ( also significant discounts to U.S. pay ) .
No , I do n’t have the specific salary numbers or any sources for Canada , continental European countries , Australia , Hong Kong , China , Westeros , Wakanda , etc. , but feel free to contribute if you do .
I ’m not going to delve into private equity or hedge fund compensation here because it ’s less standardized .
SumZero produces a good report each year .
Why Does Compensation Matter ?
It ’s always fun to look at compensation figures , see what everyone else is earning , and then calculate your effective hourly rate while binge - drinking ( my favorite tipple is Laphroaig , but it ’s an acquired taste ) .
But I ’m sharing these numbers and explanations to make a few other points as well :
Point # 1 : There Wo n’t Be Much Left Over Fom Your Base Salary Early in Your Career
An $ 85 K base salary is about $ 7,000 per month .
After taxes in NYC , it ’s about $ 4,900 per month .
You ’ll spend at least $ 2,000 per month on a small apartment , and more likely $ 2,500 + .
So , now you ’re down to $ 2,400 – $ 2,900 per month .
Then there are student loan payments , meals , transportation , going out occasionally to preserve your sanity , and so on .
Even if you live very frugally , you ’re unlikely to save more than $ 2,000 per month , and you might save as little as $ 1,000 .
Saving $ 12 K to $ 24 K per year is pretty good for a recent graduate , but it wo n’t make you wealthy anytime soon , and it ’s very low compared to your after - tax bonus .
That ’s why it ’s so important to earn a high year - end bonus , avoid “ investing ” your entire bonus in Bitcoin , and then to keep moving up , go to the buy - side , or start a business if your end goal is to become financially independent .
Point # 2 : Investment Banking is Not a “ Get Rich Quick ” Scheme – It ’s All About the Long Game
Let ’s assume that you need $ 10 million to feel comfortable with an “ early retirement . ”
Let ’s also be generous and say that you ’ll save 40 % of your pre-tax earnings each year ( deduct 50 % for taxes and 10 % for other expenses ) and that you ’ll need 10 years to reach the MD level .
You will also earn toward the top-end of the total compensation range each year .
After 10 years , that amounts to about $ 1.4 million in savings .
If the markets have performed well , and you ’ve invested everything you ’ve saved , perhaps you ’ll have ~ $ 3 million .
That ’s a good sum of money , but it ’s not enough to retire at age 30 - 35 in New York City .
Once you become an MD , you might be able to earn $ 1 million per year and save half of it ; that ’s $ 5 million after another 10 years .
Yes , maybe you could move up more quickly , earn more than $ 1 million , or do incredibly well with your investments .
But the basic point remains the same :
You ’re looking at retirement in your 40s , at least if you want to keep living in an expensive city .
Most people would call that a good outcome , but it ’s still far from “ get rich quick . ”
If you want to get rich more quickly , you have to start a business , become a successful investor , move up rapidly in a buy - side role , or use time travel to join Facebook in 2004 .
Point # 3 : If You Want to Make Money More Easily , Go into Tech
As finance pay has fallen , pay at tech companies , especially for engineers , has risen .
You ’ll still earn more in cash compensation as an Analyst in investment banking than you would as an entry - level engineer at most tech companies , but the difference is quite small .
And once you factor in stock , all bets are off .
Just as one example , take a look at this Google vs Facebook pay report , which pegs the average total compensation for engineers at Google at $ 191 K , compared with Facebook at $ 205 K .
And you earn those amounts with far less work : normal , 40 - 50 - hour weeks rather than 70 - 80 - hour ones .
Admittedly , smaller tech companies pay below those numbers , progression up the ladder is slower , and the pay ceiling is lower unless you move into an executive role , so there are some disadvantages as well .
But as I ’ve been saying for several years , if you want a comfortable lifestyle where you earn in the low - to - mid six figures and have free time , join a large tech company .
So , What About Those Annual Bonus Predictions and Salary Reports ?
Now , back to that point I made in the beginning .
I stopped writing annual bonus predictions and investment banker salary reports because they stopped being useful – there was no longer one standard bonus , banks started paying bonuses at different times , and pay between banks began to vary .
Also , my strategy of using the bank ’s IB revenue growth rate to determine the bonus growth rate became less predictive over time .
I have received many requests for compensation summaries , though , so I plan to keep this article updated over time .
SYDNEY , Australia  Visitors hoping to peek at Australia ’s exotic marine life usually head straight for the Great Barrier Reef .
But conservationists say that an equally remarkable , but lesser known , marine environment is under threat from the booming oil and gas exploration taking place among the reefs and atolls off Australia ’s northwest coast .
A damaged oil well in the region has been spewing thousands of gallons of crude oil into the Timor Sea since Aug. 21 , when a blowout forced the evacuation of all 69 workers on the platform .
Emergency crews have been working overtime to contain the spill , but officials say it could take about three more weeks to plug the leak .
The platform is above the Montara oil field , about 155 miles northwest of Mungalalu Truscott Airbase in the remote Kimberley region of Australia .
The leaking well head is owned by Thailand ’s national petroleum company , PTT Exploration and Production , one of many energy companies that have set up operations in western Australia to feed Asia ’s growing appetite for oil and gas .
In the first half of this year , more than 50 wells were drilled in the tropical waters off western Australia , adding to hundreds of other recent projects .
Last month , the government gave Chevron the green light to expand its exploration of the huge Gorgon gas field , a $ 40 billion project that was opposed by conservationists because of its potential environmental impact .

Before Iran's " Green " revolt , Obama 's efforts to engage made good sense .
Engagement is a euphemism for direct talks without preconditions - something the Bush White House avoided .
Direct talks would permit Washington and Tehran , at minimum , to put their demands and red lines on the table without intermediaries , reducing misunderstandings .
If talks failed , and Washington had to take tougher measures and rally the support of other nations , Obama could point out that he had tried diplomacy .
TWO UZBEKS who spent seven years in detention at Guantánamo Bay arrived in Ireland for resettlement at the weekend .
The men have not been officially identified , but The Irish Times has learned one is Oybek Jabbarov ( 31 ) and the other is Shakhrukh Hamiduva , who is in his mid-20s .
US authorities had cleared the men for release some time ago , saying they were no longer considered to pose a security threat .
The two were among dozens of detainees cleared for release but who could not return to their countries of origin due to the risk of persecution and ill treatment .
Mr Jabbarov , who has been the focus of a campaign by Amnesty International ’s Irish section , says he and his pregnant wife were living as refugees in Afghanistan in October 2001 when he accepted a lift with Northern Alliance fighters who were battling the Taliban .
He claims he was handed over to US troops in exchange for a bounty .
His family remains in a refugee camp in the region .
Mr Hamiduva says he came to Afghanistan via Tajikistan after fleeing Uzbekistan when the government there killed one of his uncles and jailed his father and other male relatives .
He says he tried to cross the border from Afghanistan after the US began bombing the country in 2001 , but was captured and sold to US forces .
The men arrived on a US military aircraft at Baldonnel on Saturday evening .
They were met by officials from the integration unit of the Department of Justice and transferred to a resettlement centre in the west of the country .
Both men will be given leave to remain , a legal status that allows them to work in Ireland and travel within the EU .
Minister for Justice Dermot
Ahern has requested that their privacy be respected .
“ The resettlement of the two individuals is a humanitarian gesture .
They should be allowed time and space to rebuild their lives , ” he said .
“ Ireland is a welcoming country and we are pleased to play our part with President Obama in assisting in the closing of this centre . ”
Welcoming the development , Amnesty International said it hoped other countries would follow suit .
“ Today the Irish Government has brought us one step closer to shutting down Guantánamo Bay , ” said Amnesty ’s Ireland programmes director Noeleen Hartigan .
“ Amnesty International strongly welcomes the announcement that two former detainees will be allowed to stay in Ireland and we hope that other countries , particularly in the EU , will follow our Government ’s courageous example , ” she added .
“ We would like to commend the political leadership shown in making this possible by Minister for Justice Dermot Ahern and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin . ”
HANFORD , Calif . 
Three years ago , a technological breakthrough gave dairy farmers the chance to bend a basic rule of nature : no longer would their cows have to give birth to equal numbers of female and male offspring .
Instead , using a high - technology method to sort the sperm of dairy bulls , they could produce mostly female calves to be raised into profitable milk producers .
Now the first cows bred with that technology , tens of thousands of them , are entering milking herds across the country  and the timing could hardly be worse .
The dairy industry is in crisis , with prices so low that farmers are selling their milk below production cost .
The industry is struggling to cut output .
And yet the wave of excess cows is about to start dumping milk into a market that does not need it .
“ It ’s real simple , ” said Tony De Groot , an early adopter of the new breeding technology , who milks 4,200 cows on a farm here in the heart of this state ’s struggling dairy region .
“ We ’ve just got too many cattle on hand and too many heifers on hand , and the supply just keeps on coming and coming . ”
Meteor Blades and others in the comments have asked me to put the shortened summary of the ten talking points at the top of this diary before the list itself .
Please note , this shorter verson is ONLY for situations where something with only a few hundred words will do , like a letter to the editor , or situations where you know for a fact you only have thirty seconds or less to speak ; if you have a bit more time to speak - even a minute in total - the Top Ten list in full is considerably more effective than the summary , and the shorter version should really only be used if absolutely necessary .
A Short Summary of The Top Ten Talking Points On Health Care
If you 've always paid your premiums on time , you 're as likely to be dropped by a private insurance company when you need life - saving care as you are to get treated ; even if you are n't dropped , they have the ability to overrule your doctor 's advice for life - saving treatment and only offer to cover something cheaper .
Private insurance companies are spending $ 1.4 M a day to kill the public option , inventing phony citizen groups , and trying to scare the elderly about euthanasia and pro-lifers with abortion ; they know the only way to kill reform is to get people of good conscience fighting each other , while they laugh all the way to the bank .
They do n't think very highly of our intelligence .
The average American family pays $ 16 K / yr on health care while the avg .
Canadian family pays less than $ 2K /yr , and businesses can no longer afford to provide insurance under the current system .
Every independent estimate says the public option will SAVE the government money , from anywhere between $ 150B ( CBO ) to $ 265B ( Commonwealth ) .
So - if you 'd rather spend more taxpayer money , bankrupt businesses , AND pay $ 16 K a year for your family 's private insurance coverage in exchange for a policy that can be dumped the second you actually need it , then the current system is great for you .
If you 'd rather spend less , have less of a chance of dying , and want to remove the corporate bureaucrat from between you and your doctor , then a public option is the way to go .
The Ten Health Care Talking Points EVERY PUBLIC OPTION SUPPORTER MUST REPEAT
When you need life - saving care , private insurance companies only profit by denying you and letting you die .
If you have paid your premiums on time all your life , you 're as likely to be dropped by your private insurance company when you need life - saving care as you are to get treated .
A public option gives you a lifeline .
Private insurance companies are spending over a million dollars a day to kill the public option by inventing phony citizen groups , and trying to scare the elderly about euthanasia and pro-lifers with abortion ; they know the only way to kill reform is to get people of good conscience fighting each other over misinformation , while they laugh all the way to the bank .
They do n't think very highly of our intelligence .
Fourteen thousand Americans lose their health insurance every day ; over forty - six million are currently uninsured .
Eighteen thousand Americans DIE each year due to lack of health care : THAT'S 50 A DAY .
Nearly two - thirds of American personal bankruptcies are related to health care costs .
Businesses - particularly small businesses - cannot afford to provide health insurance for their employees under the current employer based private insurance system , and will be forced to either drop their coverage or go out of business unless a public option is passed .
One - sixth of all our government spending is on health care , twice as much as any other country spends out of its budget .
Our nation pays $ 2.5 trillion for care costing $ 912 billion .
Every independent estimate says the public option will save us money , from saving 150 billion dollars ( CBO ) to saving 265 billion dollars ( Commonwealth ) .
The Congressional Budget Office estimates the current bill in the House would actually leave a 6 billion dollar surplus
So - if you 'd rather spend more taxpayer money , bankrupt businesses , AND pay $ 16,800 a year for your family 's private insurance coverage in exchange for a policy that can be dumped the second you actually need it , then the current system is great for you .
If you 'd rather spend less , wait less , have less of a chance of dying , and want to remove the corporate bureaucrat from between you and your doctor , then a public option is the way to go .
Right now , even if you 're lucky enough not to be dropped by your provider when you need urgent medical care , your private insurance company can overrule your doctor 's advice for life - saving treatment and only offer to cover something cheaper ; a public option would remove that middleman and leave these decisions where they belong , between the patient and doctor .
Any private citizen or elected Democrat making the case for the public option , whether going to a town meeting , speaking on the airwaves , or debating behind closed doors should know the order of these talking points in and out .
They 're quick , they 're effective , and when communicated in sequence , they 're bulletproof .
Most importantly , they kill every Republican talking point while staying consistently on the offensive .
Notes :
The numbers are purposefully lowballed / rounded down in order to avoid a subsequent conversation devolving into bickering that distracts from the main points being made .
The statistic about the average Canadian family paying less than $ 2000 / yr is based on a single Canadian paying $ 40 a month , times 12 months ( $ 480 / yr ) times a family of four ( $ 1920 / yr ) .
Rebuttal Points To The Seven Most Common Opposition Arguments At These Meetings
" Where In The Constitution Does It Say That We 're Entitled to Universal Health Care ? " - Article I , Section 8 of the Constitution says the Congress must promote the general welfare of the people ; how can the Congress say it is promoting the general welfare of the public when fifty people die a day that did n’t have to ?
Now , I know - promoting general welfare cannot be interpreted as every American is entitled to have the federal government to buy them a house , a bed , and fancy steak dinners every day ; such broad interpretations would give Congress absurd powers , just as Madison correctly argued .
General welfare does NOT mean the federal government has to provide us with all our necessities - because such a system would NOT be capitalism - there we agree .
HOWEVER , Congress ’s ability and duty to promote the general welfare under the Constitution , along with the Constitutional provision of equal protection under the law , DOES suggest that Congress has an obligation to see that people who work hard and save responsibly have an OPPORTUNITY to get those necessities ; a system that has effectively been rigged over the years so that most people are one emergency away from having their insurance policy dropped and being unable to get coverage due to pre-existing condition , and given no options but death when extensive treatment is necessary , cannot be seen as consistent with Congressional duties under the general welfare clause or equal protection clause of the Constitution .
" I Believe In The Free Market ! " - I believe that competition and more choices are good for the market .
A public option is one more choice , and more options are good for the consumer and good for the market .
The current bills being proposed let you keep your private plan if you want , and use the public option if you choose .
If the public option ends up being crap as some here think , people wo n't choose it - that 's what the marketplace is all about - and if people do n't choose the public option because private insurance is so much better , then no money in the program will be spent , and we 've lost nothing ; so this not a win or lose , but a win or break even , and you have to be pretty timid to be afraid of that .
" Government Care Sucks ; Reform What We Have First ! " - Medicare and Medicaid are government run health insurance .
They have problems , they need reform , but every poll shows that people are more unhappy with private insurance than they are with Medicare and Medicaid by double digits , and it makes sense to put out the biggest fire first .
Most Americans are n't eligible for anything but private insurance anyway , so the idea that good solutions like reforming Medicare and malpractice lawuits are enough on their own is just a slap in the face .
" Big Money Interests Are Pushing The Public Option ! " -
If you want to be cynical and vigilant as a citizen against big money influencing the government , YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THE MONEY .
On one side , there are BILLIONS of dollars at stake for the insurance companies , because they have the power to drop or deny anyone they please when they need urgent care in order to maximize their profits - of course they do n’t want to give that up .
On the other side , you have no financial motive that could even compare - who stands to make billions from the public option ?
Against the public option , you have a source of money , you have a motive , and you have planning and mass collusion by the insurance companies for decades to block any reforms , documented repeatedly by various non-partisan sources ; on the other side , what even compares ?
Being vigilant against big money interests screwing with legislation that affects the people is VITAL , and I applaud everyone here who does so - but you HAVE TO FOLLOW THE MONEY , or otherwise , for all you know , you 're fighting against the very things you think you 're fighting for .
" BOOOOO !!!! " - I 'm sure that all the people yelling and booing have been lucky , they 've never seen someone get denied life - saving treatment or be dropped altogether by their insurance company - or had it happen to themself .
It would be easy for me to say that I hope you become one of those 14 K a day who lose their health insurance so you can understand - but the truth is I hope none of you ever have to deal with that , I hope you never have to end up as one of those uninsured fifty people a day who die because they 're refused the health care they needed to live .
" A Public Option Will Put Private Insurance Companies Out of Business ! " -
No , not if you believe the Congressional Budget Office , who says private insurance companies will get MORE business when a public option is passed : http://www.dailykos.com/...
" I Am Against The Obamacare Bill ! " -
There is no Obama bill .
Obama does n't have a bill in Congress , or even a bill in Congress he said he supports , so if you oppose " the Obamacare bill " , you oppose a figment of your imagination .
My First Town Hall Experience
Now , to last Thursday night 's town hall ... this was the first one I ever attended , and I am SO GLAD that I went .
Woodstock is a very rural and sparsely populated town in the northeast corner of CT , and one of the redder parts of a fairly progressive district ; it 's a very beautiful place , as was the view in the room the packed town hall was held in ( 350 people ) .
As my fiancee and I were walking towards the building , we met a young lady who was very kind and polite ; it turned out that she was in the " against the public option " camp , arguing that people should pay for themselves .
However , she seemed open minded to my point of view , to my surprise , and when she asked me about my viewpoint and I told her about the flyers I 'd brought , she asked to take one and began to read it .
For the purposes of this diary , I will refer to her as Reasonable Conservative ( for now at least ) .
The civility that she reflected was a unique attribute among most of those at the meeting who opposed a public option .
From the first podium speaker 's mention of his first statistic ( 60 million uninsured ) , the loud barking and braying began : " THAT'S NOT TRUE " .
The speaker 's next line from his written statement , clearly anticipating some of this , went into how civil discourse is necessary - and people applauded with no booing - but just seconds the yellers continued heckling speaker after speaker at the podium , stopping them from talking for several seconds while many of us firmly turned back to them and said " quiet ! "
However , as soon as it stopped it would start again .
The last lady who spoke at the podium was just a regular citizen trying to talk about her family history on the farm , and her relatives getting sick and dying , and the problems they 'd faced under the current health care system ; she was nice , genuine , and completely apolitical in tenor - and she got the worst of it .
The yellers ate her up , saying things so insensitive ( " GET OVER IT ! " - hands down the ugliest thing of the ugly things I heard all night , given the moment it was said ) that she eventually got frazzled and lost her place , nearly beginning to cry ; I can't communicate how cruel they were with their " so what " attitude to everything she said - I felt SO bad for this poor woman .
That was enough for me .
The first comment / question the audience was allowed to pose to the Congressman , I was fortunate enough to be given the floor .
This is what I said :
" I 've been an independent voter most of my life , I 've lived in this district for most of my life , and I 've never been to a town hall before , but I 'm here because I am appalled that the private insurance companies are spending 1.4 million dollars a day to kill the public option , paying off and bussing in phony citizen groups ; the insurance companies know the only way to kill reform is to get people of good conscience fighting , while they laugh all the way to the bank .
They do n't think very highly of our intelligence .
" But I think that this year - this time - they 're wrong . "
The majority of the room erupted in applause , with only silence and no booing coming from the stunned wingnuts .
For the rest of the meeting , they still did make SOME noise and still talked back when they heard things they did n't like - but no longer loudly and abrasively enough to disrupt the meeting and interrupt anyone who spoke in favor of a public option to the point where the person had to stop talking .
Their cover was blown .
The meeting remained contentious , with the passion , drama , and - I must admit - entertainment value more reminiscient of a wrestling event than what one would picture as a local Democratic party town hall in sparsely populated area - but a contentious meeting and a dysfunctional meeting are worlds apart , and indeed at opposite ends ; one is vibrant democracy , the other is not democracy at all .
GO TO THESE TOWN HALL MEETINGS AND CALL THEM OUT , using the same type of language , particularly including the " insurance companies do n't think very highly of our intelligence " ; they are not prepared to be called out , and it throws them off their game .
There was no doubt leaving that meeting that the public option side in the room had won the debate , and that the wingers actually only represented 25 - 30 % of the room - but the perception could have easily gone the other way had the meeting continued the way it started , with the minority sounding so loud it seemed to be a majority ( something the RW has been reportedly been SUCCEEDING at when it comes to town halls that have happened since , as one attendee to the recent NY - 20 Town Hall argued in their comment about a recap of the event : " I disagree however that they outnumbered us .
I think we outnumbered them but it was close .
They are simply louder and better organized than we are at this point " - DON'T LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOU ; calling these people out changes them from a fearless amorphous blob of noise that can easily be overestimated to a group of people who stand and applaud at particular comments , revealing their true numbers to all in the room ) .
I should also add that after my comment , I asked Congressman Courtney a question .
It was about how to better address Blue Dog / conservative concerns raised about lower Medicare reimbursal rates for rural health providers and a potential expansion of this effect under a public option , perhaps by adding an amendment that specifically addresses this disparity , in order to get more Congressional votes behind the public option .
While my remark was a procedural question about how to best achieve what was ultimately quite clearly a progressive end , the fact that I was taking conservative concerns at face value and suggesting solutions for how to legitimately address them made it impossible for a single person to boo me after I was finished speaking .
The Congressman 's answer strongly suggested that he agreed such an approach was constructive , and was in fact already being discussed , to my pleasant surprise .
If I had my comments to do over , I would have added a little more on the " good conscience " point in the middle of my statement , and said that : " I 've been an independent voter most of my life , I 've lived in this district for most of my life , and I 've never been to a town hall before , but I 'm here because I am appalled that the private insurance companies are spending 1.4 million dollars a day to kill the public option , paying off and bussing in phony citizen groups ; while many people on both sides of this issue are here from the district , for and against , people who would bark and yell and prevent others from talking have been bussed in by insurance companies to town halls around the country , so we can tell right away who they are .
The insurance companies know the only way to kill the public is to get people of good conscience fighting , while they laugh all the way to the bank .
They do n't think very highly of our intelligence .
But I think that this year - this time - they 're wrong . "
That acknowledgement prevents any comeback from conservatives who ARE from the district from chipping away at the point being made ; my failure to do this made my comment an A - when it should have been an A+ , so please be careful not to make the same mistake I did .
I also have to mention that if I at all managed to disarm the RW at that meeting , I was at best the third most effective speaker in the audience : it was a rugged steel worker union guy with a patriotic populist sharpness and improvisational public speaking skills of a Jesse Ventura or a James Cornette , and especially a pro-life military family Sunday school teacher with a child she could n't insure because of pre-existing condition whose incredible comments in favor of a public option were a home run , and made it very clear which side of the debate won that meeting .
If I had to guess , I would strongly suspect that the wingnuts left that meeting fairly dejected , and that Congressman Courtney was generally quite happy with the way the meeting turned out ( all the stress and drama not withstanding ) .
By the way , if I had to describe one common factor about my statements and those of the two people I just mentioned , it was the fact that our statements were worded in a way that the winguts COULD NOT BOO US - and did n't .
That 's the real secret when it comes to scoring points in this environment ; historically , it 's conservatives who hijack patriotic language that " you just ca n't boo " to score big points , but they got way less of them in on this night than the pro-public option side .
There was also a gentleman who stood up and said at least the Democrats are trying something , and the Republicans are n't - he was a registered Republican himself ( letting us know by ending his remarks with a disgusted " by the way , I 'm a member of the party of no ! " ) .
He argued during his comment that it 's better to try and fail than not try at all , and when the usual suspects objected , he silenced them with " If my arm is bleeding , I 'm going to put a bandage around it if I do n't have stitches ; I 'm not going to sit there and bleed to death . "
There was also a point where a far RW questioner , barraging Courtney about the AMA , was followed by a doctor who introduced himself as a member of the AMA and explained why he supports the public option , causing the far RW guy to look dejected but then immediately forced to applaud the doctor 's support of tort reform ( the not applauding of which apparently results in forty lashes from Freedom Watch ) .
I would estimate that while the audience was 70 - 30 in favor of a public option , the people who stood up and commented or asked a question were closer to 60 - 40 in favor of the public option ; conservatives absolutely got their say - in other words - which is very important , but just as importantly , they were not able to effectively disrupt the meeting 's question and answer session either .
There were plenty of supportive statements from the crowd about single payer and extended applause afterwards from the majority of the crowd ; it 's funny - on a progressive site like dkos , I might be debating one of those folks about whether pushing single payer now was the right way to go , but in that room on the front lines of the battle for health care , the single payer advocates clapped for every show of support for the public option , and vice versa .
We knew instinctively in that room that this was NOT just an internal progressive dialogue about optimal strategy , and that we HAD to be on the same side against the dead - enders .
It was unspoken .
Reasonable Conservative , by the way , was waiting patiently the entire duration of the meeting with her hand up until the very end - not being rude to anyone or being among the yellers .
Some people thought the meeting was over , beginning to leave , but I quickly joined the few folks that were trying to wave every one down , and I pointed towards her direction to indicate to people that a question remained to be asked ; the fact was that she had been respectful to all the other speakers , and deserved her turn as far I was concerned , so I was going to make every effort to see that she got her chance - even though I knew I was n't going to agree with her viewpoint , even though I knew that her speaking last would have given conservative commenters at the meeting the last audienword .
She began her remarks and let me tell you , she was really effective ; she described herself as an independent voter , and was making the kind of cost - cutting arguments and efficiency arguments that many would agree with ( despite them being insufficient on their own , they 're hard to argue with ) , and still sounded reasonable enough in her points on tort reform .
Compared to the other public options opponents who had spoken , each of whom had uttered at least one absurdity that made the room groan and snicker at them ( e.g .
" We 're becoming a Communist country " , " the health care bill forces old people to kill themselves " ) , she sounded like William F. Buckley in a sea of Birchers .
Then ... all of a sudden , at the very end , her voice raised to make her last point , and she went into an UGLY rant about illegal immigration that completely ruined all her credibility in the room among everyone but the wingnuts ( offending even a Chilean - American gentleman who had been on her anti-reform side of the argument due to his personal negative associations and instinctive recoiling at anything presented as communist - his mouth gaped open at her comments ) .
As my fiancee was leaving the building , she overheard the lady formerly known as Reasonable Conservative tell someone else that she works for an insurance company in Rocky Hill .
So much for Reasonable Conservatives , sadly .
I made certain to print out a copy of the top ten talking points list for Congressman Courtney and gave it to his aide at the end of the meeting .
In addition , I printed out twenty - five copies , and aside from the one I handed out by request going in , I simply put the rest on the table if anyone wanted to grab one ; my fiancee , who was in the back of the room , saw them circulating among the crowd , so I think they may have made an impact on their own aside from my standing up and speaking .
I strongly welcome and encourage everyone to print out copies of the Word document version I provided a link for at the very top of this diary , and bring them to these town halls with you .
This is a short video of the town hall ; in an earlier incarnation of this diary , I incorrectly attributed the video to the Norwich Bulletin , but the video was actually filmed by Free Norwich , a local blog whose author and readership identify as " 2nd District Tea Party Patriots " ( which explains the spin in the first few seconds of the video ; however , I post it nonetheless because the remaining five minutes are without editing or editorialization ) .
My apologies to both Free Norwich and The Norwich Bulletin for the mistaken attribution .
The video shows both the union guy I mentioned speaking in favor of the public option , the Chilean guy speaking against ( this is before that illegal immigration rant from The Artist Formerly Known As Reasonable Conservative visibly offended him ) , and Rep. Courtney 's answer .
It 's really important to set the stage here , as this was more than halfway through a very passionate meeting , everyone was incredibly fired up , and you could cut the intensity with a knife ; Military Mom had just given the most impactful statement of the night , following a few anti-public option comments / questions in a row that made her comment especially well - timed and devastating , opening the door for union guy to bring it home with a proud and patriotic speech :
UPDATE : Some additional tools to bring with you to town halls include this great diary by NWTerriD that , like the top ten list , focuses on appealing to the needs of the person listening to the argument ; also , this image is in many ways the most effective tool I 've ever seen to advocate for a public option , and would be ideal if one were to put on a poster and bring to a town hall , as it makes it 's case with brevity and clarity through both words and images .
I also wanted to add one last thing :
Understanding Why The SEQUENCE of The Top Ten Talking Points List Is So Important
Consider , a super simplified overview of the list would be :
Do n't believe for a second that you 're immune
They must think we 're fucking idiots
You 're getting ripped off
The walls are closing in
The threat is a mortal one
People are going broke
Businesses are going broke
Our government is going broke
A public option saves everyone money
Private insurance is what 's killing the patient - doctor relationship
Steps one through three in sequence are what especially open the door for undecided citizens on the issue to listen to the remainder of the argument without glazing over at all the figures .
Voters first listen if they think something effects THEM , they resent being tricked , and they hate being robbed - in that order ; it 's the same strategy Republicans have been using successfully ( in their case , with boldface lies ) for years : it begins with fear to grab the viewer , then taking umbrage to identify with the viewer , and finally telling the viewer who is taking them to the cleaners now that the trust has been earned .
It 's not something I pursued by design , but rather something I stumbled upon by accident ; nonetheless , perhaps it 's time someone applied that strategy honestly for a change , as the genuine sense of fear , umbrage , and thievery surrounding our murder by spreadsheet health care system is thoroughly legitimate and justified , and has to be brought to the attention of the electorate for the desperately needed public option to be signed into law .
Ca n't stop us !

By using the phrase “ un- American , ” Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer are undermining the Democratic brand – threatening to bringing themselves down to the level of Sarah Palin , Karl Rove , George W. Bush , and Ann Coulter .
If you read the op - ed currently being misrepresented / hyped by Matt Drudge – “ Pelosi / Hoyer op - ed in Monday USATODAY calls townhall protesters ‘ un - American ’ … ” he says – you can see they only use the phrase “ un - American ” once .
They write :
Drowning out opposing views is simply un-American .
This statement is uncontroversial .
Yet it also is clearly designed to generate attention and it is making news because Democrats so rarely engage in this type of demagoguery – and because Drudge and his allies are trying to create an impression of a thuggish White House pushing its agenda using tactics adopted from the worst Republican politicians ( identifying opponents as “ un-American , ” compiling an “ enemies list , ” declaring things justified by “ national security ” when they are really power grabs . )
Democrats , liberals , and progressives have largely refained though from calling their opponents “ un - American ” or “ terrorists ” – even as matters grow extremely heated .
Political attacks and populism are part of politics .
Accusing the other side of representing the entrenched interests who their side ’s agenda benefits ( organized labor , environmental groups , abortion rights groups , etcetera for Democrats ; big corporations , the wealthy , pro-life groups , the NRA , etcetera for Republicans ) will always be part of the game .
But there are clear lines – and Democrats have largely respected them .
John Kerry could have accused George W. Bush of negligently being responsible for September 11 – and he would have won had he done so .
But it would have damaged the country .
Karl Rove , knowing this is what he would have done , saw this vulnerability and did what he could to counteract it – but he still saw it was Bush ’s weakness .
Democrats could have made a concerted push to demagogue every policy Bush instituted after September 11 as “ un- American ” and “ giving in to the terrorists . ”
But instead , they did not cross this line – despite the fact that Karl Rove and George W. Bush and those Republicans running against them equated the Democrats with “ therapy for terrorists ” and sympathy for the terrorists ’ aims .
Sarah Palin infamously inflamed crowds talking about Obama ’s sympathy for terrorists and asserted that there were anti-American parts of America that would n’t vote for her .
There are some who claim that these demagogic tactics are equaled by the Democrats who have claimed that Republicans are representing the rich at the expense of the poor and similar claims – but there is a clear difference between the approaches .
But as Democrats are becoming increasingly frustrated with the hardball politics of the opponents of health care reform , they are clearly tempted to try to tap into the Rovian playbook .
For example , even mild - mannered Washington Post columnist Steven Pearlstein wrote ( in what was overall an extraordinarly good column ) that :
[ Republicans have ] become political terrorists , willing to say or do anything to prevent the country from reaching a consensus on one of its most serious domestic problems .
The level of frustration on the part of the Democrats – aware that what they are actually proposing is popular – but seeing the public debate beginning to turn against their attempts to put into law these popular measures is growing exponentially .
Neither Pelosi nor Hoyer nor Pearlstein have descended to the level of Sarah Palin , Rush Limbaugh , or Ann Coulter .
But by pushing the line – they threaten to undermine the Democratic Party .
Hardball politics is one thing .
Calling your opponents “ terrorists ” or “ un - American ” is another .

David Cameron faces a revolt by his own MPs over his flagship policy to raise National Health Service spending by a level above inflation each year .
Two - thirds of Tory backbenchers oppose his plan to exempt healthcare from any spending cuts that an incoming Conservative Government would make to tackle the " black hole " in the public finances .
Mr Cameron could come under pressure to rethink his strategy if he becomes prime minister , a poll by ComRes suggests .
Asked whether the NHS should receive guaranteed spending increases in real terms during the course of the next Parliament , 29 per cent of Tory MPs agreed and 62 per cent disagreed .
Only 33 per cent believed the current NHS model , funded from general taxation and free at the point of delivery , was sustainable for the next 60 years , while 62 per cent did not .

The poll will fuel the debate within the Conservative ranks about Mr Cameron 's decision to spare health from the squeeze that other major Whitehall departments would face .
Tory MPs want him to make a stronger commitment to reforming the NHS , but he also faces pressure to reassure voters that the system would be safe in his hands , after Daniel Hannan , the outspoken Tory MEP for South - East England , described the NHS as a " 60 - year mistake " .
One Tory MP said last night : " The hope is that we would be more radical on health in office than we say now , that he [ Mr Cameron ] is anxious not to frighten the horses .
But there are concerns about cutting other areas and allowing the health budget to carry on rising regardless .
It can not be exempt from financial pressure or reform . "
Writing in The Independent today , Tim Montgomerie , the editor of the ConservativeHome website , warns that the Tory pledge to outspend Labour on the NHS will require more painful cuts in other budgets such as defence , transport and welfare .
He urges Mr Cameron to spell out where the axe would fall , saying : " Without a clear mandate there is going to be little defence against the wave of hostility that will greet the toughest of public spending settlements . "
Warning that Mr Cameron 's support is " wide but not necessarily deep " , Mr Montgomerie adds : " A clear and positive vision for getting Britain out of Labour 's mess will give him the strength of support that he will need for the very tough years that lie ahead . "
Labour will try to exploit the Tory turmoil by running an autumn campaign exposing the " two faces " it claims the Conservatives present to the public on health and other issues .
Labour sources claim the party 's private polls show that voters are wary of Mr Cameron 's promises to protect the NHS at a time when he plans to cut other budgets – a fear echoed privately by some Tory MPs .
There could be more trouble for the Tories on the issue at their party conference in October .
The right - wing Freedom Association , which has backed Mr Hannan 's controversial remarks , is staging an event that will include the Progressive Vision group , which has set up a " NoNHS " campaign .
The association has accused the Tories of trying to stifle debate on health .
Cameron allies insist it is his views , not Mr Hannan's , which will determine Tory policy and say he is confident of winning public support for his stance .
They won a boost yesterday when a separate ComRes poll for The Independent On Sunday found that 47 per cent of people disgreed with the proposition that the NHS would be safer under Labour than the Tories , while 39 per cent agreed .
The survey , conducted for BMI Hospitals , suggests that older MPs in all parties are much more attached to the NHS than the younger generation in Parliament .
Some 72 per cent of MPs born before 1950 believe the current NHS model is sustainable but only 42 per cent of those born after 1960 agree .
There is a similar generational split over the use of the private sector to treat NHS patients .
Tory MPs support the introduction of tax breaks for private healthcare fees , by a margin of 55 to 31 per cent .
But the Chancellor , Alistair Darling , said : " Tax breaks for private healthcare would take money away from the health service and undo the real progress we have made with the NHS over the last 12 years .
After a torrid two weeks , David Cameron can no longer hide the two faces of his party on the NHS – this poll shows where the heart of the Tory party lies . "
Andrew Hawkins , of ComRes , said : " These results show that Conservatives and younger MPs are more sympathetic to the role private sector companies can play in the NHS than their older , non-Tory counterparts .
" Given that we can expect a relatively high turnover of MPs at the next general election , perhaps more than a third of the House , we should expect that the direction of travel for the House is towards more support for private sector involvement in the health service . "
It ’s the start of a new Semester , and at the beginning of my Power class I spend the first lecture reviewing where I think we stand on the Energy supply to the United States .
This has changed a bit since last year and so I thought I would run through some of the changes that I made to my lecture this year , in the same way as I did last September .
Since the greatest impact is likely to come from the changing sources of supply that the US has had to go to , with the change in levels of production , I began with this slide :
It is interesting to see the relative amounts from Mexico , Saudi Arabia and Russia and the first thing to note is the decline in Mexican supply , brought about by the dramatic drop in production from Cantarell .
( H/t Nate Hagens ) .
The peak and decline of Cantarell – where Mexico got most of its oil .
That drop has already shown up as a decline in Mexican exports to the US of over 800,000 bd .
At this point I introduce them to the Export Land Model ( ELM ) of Jeffrey Brown , which basically points out that after a nation ’s economy has grown ( and oil consumption with it ) during the high production years , then as oil production declines ( as above ) it is the export market which suffers more , as the country retains more of its product for its own use .
Export Land Model ( ELM ) of Jeffrey Brown , showing the more rapid decline of exports , as production falls in a country , yet internal demand continues to rise .
While Mexico is the most dramatic example of this at the moment , it is important to consider Russia next .
We used not to get much oil from Russia , but as the table above shows , that situation is changing .
( Russia to the Rescue was the theme of a made for TV movie Oil Storm back in June of 2005 , where they sent us a couple of oil tankers which “ saved the day ” .
At the time $ 75 a barrel for crude and $ 4 per gallon for gas was considered to only happen if the US was damaged by a hurricane and the Saudi terminal at Ras Tanura was attacked . )
Well now they are sending more and regularly , but the question relative to the ELM is how long can they keep this up .
Exports from Russia dropped 5.2 % in 2008 , but have crept up some 0.2 % since January , with Russia exporting about half its production .
The big question about that , however , is that a pipeline is going in at the moment that will start shipping 300,000 bd of oil from Russia to China and to Japan .
Given that overall Russian production is expected to decline ( one of their major fields at Samotlor is now producing at 750,000 bd , when at peak it produced 3.2 mbd , and now that it is 80 % depleted the water cut is 90 % . )
A well at Samotlor ( TNK - BP )
So with increased amounts of internal consumption ( it is using about 2.8 mbd internally ) , it is becoming another example of the ELM .
Russian production , consumption and exports ( note that according to Rosstat Russia is now exporting around 5 mbd ) ( from the EIA )
With both these countries exports declining , the question is becoming who will be the next to step in and provide additional oil for us .
Saudi Arabia has dropped production to 8 mbd to keep the price up , and there are some questions about the future production – and I refer to the pictures from Satellite over the Desert that I have used before to question Saudi long term production ability .
I also note that Saudi Arabia is now consuming 2.2 mbd of oil and demand is rising .
There is , for example , this
Estimates on how much crude it is burning differ , but the kingdom's own data show it has risen in recent years , and it could be as high as 470,000 bpd of crude this year , up 62 percent from 2008 , consultancy FACTS Global Energy says .
A Saudi source familiar with the kingdom's energy sector said the maximum it could burn at power stations would be 300,000 bpd , although another 120,000 bpd could be burned to power refineries and other facilities related to upstream production .
Aramco claim to have the capability of producing 12 mbd of oil , but again I remind the class that this includes the oil from Manifa , which cannot be produced until it can be refined and that wo n’t be until 2013 at the earliest .
And thus one comes to Canada , and so there is the quote from the Wicks Report that the Alberta oil sands will provide half of North America ’s imports .
The level of those imports is shown in the first table , and the oil sands are not now predicted to get to 2.7 mbd until somewhere around 2018 , up from the current 1.3 mbd .
So with the oil sands being the increasingly major supplier of oil to Canada as the conventional reservoirs deplete , it does not look as though Mr Wicks Report will prove realistic , and we will need to look elsewhere to make up supply shortages for ourselves .
At which point it is timely to point out that the UK will be competing with us for the remaining world supplies of oil , and that China and India , with their burgeoning car sales , will also be adding an mbd or so to their demands for oil next year .
The one bright hope that I end the oil section of the lecture with is that , with ethanol production at around 750,000 bd there is a new candidate supplier of jet fuel .
The Japanese airliner that tested fuel this past winter used Camelina as the source for the jet fuel .
It seems to have more going for it than corn or cellulosic based ethanol , at this point in the evaluation .
It is nice to end the section on an optimistic note , and the message from the above is that there are going to be jobs for the students when they graduate , and it will likely remain so for the length of their careers .
If you recall , some time ago it was made clear that the popular internet website , Hulu , was no longer working on PS3 web browsers .
PS3 owners were infuriated , but Hulu refused to give a proper answer at the time .
But finally , we have an official response from the company on how this decision came about .
G4TV received a response from a customer service representative , explaining that the reason Hulu is now blocking from the PS3 is because legal issues between Hulu and owners of the video content provided on their website .
“ Everything we do is with an eye toward achieving our long - term goal of maximizing the content you can access as conveniently as possible in a way that ‘ works ’ for the content owner .
In the short - term that may require us to make some tough decisions , but we only do so when we believe it improves our long - term prospects to build a more enduring , legal solution to that same problem . ”
Despite their response , Hulu still has n’t come clean on exactly why the PS3 is being blocked , as its viewers net Hulu the same amount of revenue as PC owners .
But it ’s still better than nothing .
Stay tuned on PSLSfor more information as the situation develops .

Teabagging with Jesus ( Part 1 )
White Christian teabaggers finally beginning to realize
that the world is multi-cultural — and not liking it one bit .
( BoF reader Travis alerted me to a website run by one of the teabagging groups .
It ’s an interesting site , and I want to spend some time on it .
I came across another site that I want to briefly mention first . )
The whole teabagging movement has had racist overtones from the beginning .
Whether they admit it or not , it ’s mostly about white Americans feeling like a minority for the first time ever , and they are n’t happy about it .
The anti-tax message is merely superficial .
They ’re actually tapping into some deep - seated frustration that has been brewing for a while .
Anti-taxes is just one small part of what they ’re pissed off about .
I always like to back up my statements with facts .
That previous paragraph contains my impression of the teabaggers that I ’ve gotten from the media .
I wanted to find out if it ’s actually true .
I typed “ tea party demographics ” into Google in an effort to find out .
The first site listed is actually called Tea Party Demographics !
Heck .
Ca n’t be any easier than that !
So I went to the site .
It turns out it ’s just a tiny teabagging site , no more significant than any other .
It has a few interesting things on it , though .
One page shows the demographics of the people who have bothered to fill out their survey .
It is very unscientific , and the sample size is too small .
Nevertheless , 87 % identify themselves as Caucasian .
That same page tells us that 59 % are Republican .
I would have expected higher .
However , it also shows us how these people identify their politics relative to their party as a whole .
The majority ( 84 % overall ) , in every single party , said they “ lean right ” .
Well there ’s a freakin’ surprise !
The home page has the results of their survey on who should be their next presidential nominee .
The results are :
Nominee No. of Votes Sarah Palin 71 Mitt Romney 41 Newt Gingrich 34 Fred Thompson 17
What a wonderful , inspiring set of candidates they ’re fielding there !
I thought the teabaggers wanted America to be stronger and regain its place in the world .
They ca n’t do it with anybody on that list ( especially the one at the top ) .
Finally , I love this one statement they proudly make on the home page :
An interesting phenomena that I ’ve begun to notice in talking with organizers and event coordinators is how LITTLE trash seems to be left behind at these events .
That ’s because they all go home to their trailers .
A somewhat distressing tech story today : a female employee at the Arlington Apple Store was shot in the shoulder this morning by a man who rang the doorbell at the back of the store .
Fortunately the employee is said to be recovering in hospital .
It 's thought the motive was attempted robbery .
According to ABC7 news , the shooting happened shortly after 10 a.m. at the Apple Store located at 2700 Clarendon Blvd .
A search for the suspect is underway .
The Washington Post adds that the suspect is " a black male , between the ages of 35 and 45 , with a medium build and facial hair .
He was last seen fleeing the area on foot , wearing a light - colored , short sleeve shirt , light - colored long pants and a dark baseball cap .
He was carrying a handgun . "

The boy's " fence swings both ways , " teacher Diane Cleveland commented during a class in the 2007 - 2008 school year , according to an investigation by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights .
When the boy wrote a report on Ben Franklin , Cleveland allegedly said before the entire class that the boy had a " thing for older men . "
Another teacher , Walter Filson , said in front of other students that the boy " enjoys wearing women 's clothes . "
When the boy decided to report on Abraham Lincoln , Filson allegedly said , " Since you like your men older ... " the Human Rights report said .
The school district , which has denied it violated the Minnesota Human Rights
Act , agreed last month to pay the boy 's family $ 25,000 .
A 21 - year - old Forks Township man faces a theft charge after he allegedly got drunk , stole a women 's purse then turned himself in the next morning .
Christopher David Neve , 21 , of the 700 block of Hunter Road , was arraigned today before District Judge Gay Elwell .
About 1:30 a.m. July 13 , Elizabeth Carlson reported that while hanging out at Sette Luna at 219 Ferry St. , a man with a cut on his head stole her purse , court documents say .
The purse contained $ 300 , three credit cards , a Blackberry Storm phone and a gift card .
At 3 p.m. July 13 , Neve turned himself into police saying he had been " highly intoxicated " at Sette Luna the night before , grabbed a purse and fled , documents say .
He awoke with Carlson 's credit cards , $ 143 and the gift cards in his pockets and told police he just " did something stupid " and wanted to turn over the items , documents say .
Many of you probably do not remember when Castrol went against the all - powerful U.S. oil cartel made up of the major oil companies .
The oil companies are competitors and thus are at odds some of the time .
Thus , they use the API or American Petroleum Institute as their spokesman and watch - dog for regulating and keeping peace in the industry .
Castrol several years ago went against the API , stating that the Buick single cylinder mileage test that still used leaded fuel , ** even ten years after it had been phased out , was no longer valid **.
The API sued Castrol , as representative of the cartel , and won a judgment .
To fight Castrol all of the oil companies through in royalties off of their motor oil sales .
Not only did the API win , they amassed a war chest of some $ 240 million dollars .
This was the coming out of the API and they bought a building close to the white house in Washington D.C. to monitor and lobby anything that might hurt the large cartel .
Castrol has More than Enough Information to Justify Advertising Claims
Now Castrol , in an effort to differentiate their brand , advertised nationally that they had superior sludge protection over other motor oils .
Their ads boasted it was 57 percent better than other products and that it passed the industry ’s toughest sludge standard .
Since the API sets the standard specifications for motor oil , at least they certify all motor oils for commercial sale , this did n’t look good to the rest of the U.S. oil cartel .
Pennzoil / Quaker State the leading seller of motor oils in the United States filed a complaint with the National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus .
This was even though Castrol had performed the Mercedes - Benz M111 sludge test known in the industry as the toughest test available .
The NAD found there was n’t enough support for the claim so Castrol voluntarily pulled the entire national ad campaign .
The public does n’t realize this is another attempt by the cartel to control the industry .
If this was an additive company the FTC would be filing an order against Castrol / BP Lubricants and there would be a class action civil suit .
But no , not in this case , the big boys settled their differences and everybody is happy .
Oil Companies Snuff out Competition just as they did with Oil Additives in the 90s
I believe this is not another case of false advertising but the oil cartel stepping on Castrol in a behind the scenes regulation .
When buying a major oil companies motor oil product do not expect to be able to buy a competitive best product , as the cartel makes sure everyone ’s product is close to the same !
The oil cartel does n’t need big brother and the government regulating them as they already regulate themselves .
The industry creates the tests and all of the interests and their lobbies are involved , then when someone wants to use such tests to make claims , the oil companies say no do n’t do that !
What a shame free enterprise is controlled in this manner by the U.S. oil cartel and holds down companies not to innovate and improve on their products .
Oh well , politics as usual with the oil companies .
Looks like Mary Schapiro's attempt to curry favor with some disenfranchised people who still do n't grasp the SEC for the conflicted " regulatory " mess it has become may end up being very short sighted .
At today 's hearing Judge Jed Rakoff , whom Zero Hedge wrote about previously , is in no rush to steamroll this particular " settlement " down the throats of investors .
From Bloomberg :
The hearing , held in New York before U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff , ended with Rakoff saying he needs more information on the Aug. 3 accord between the bank and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission , which filed the suit .
The settlement wo n’t be final unless Rakoff approves it .
Rakoff said that if the SEC is right that Bank of America lied about whether to pay the bonuses then the proposed settlement is not “ remotely reasonable . ”
“ Do n’t I need to know what the truth is to make a determination ? ” Rakoff asked .
If Bank of America broke the law by not disclosing the bonuses , “ is there not something strangely askew in a fine of $ 33 million ” given the size of the deal , Rakoff said .
If BAC is right and they did n’t hide the bonus information then Rakoff said he could see how the settlement “ might be approvable ” on the theory that they want to take $ 33 million , as long as it ’s nongovernment money , to get rid of the litigation .
“ It seems to me that I need a lot more material from the parties before I can assess whether this is a fair and reasonable settlement , ” Rakoff said .
“ There are important legal issues that have been glanced at here but need to be briefed . ”
“ I would be less than candid if I did n’t express my continued misgivings about this settlement at this stage , ” Rakoff said .
“ When this settlement first came to me it seemed to me to be lacking , for lack of a better word , in transparency .
I did not know much about the facts from the complaint .
I did not know much , or really anything , about the basis for the settlement . ”
But then again , from numerous prior congressional hearings in which Ken Lewis personally has testified and used the fancy word " commingled " repeatedly , there is no way to keep track of what money is the government 's and what money is the bank's .
Rakoff demonstrated some apt cynicism with some earlier questioning , trying to determine who was responsible for the bonus payment :
“ Was it some sort of ghost ? ” Rakoff asked today .
“ Who were the people ?
Mr. Thain and Mr. Lewis would seem to be responsible , yes ? ”
“ If they would not have paid out $ 3.6 billion , they would have had a loss of $ 3.6 billion less , no ? ” the judge said , referring to Merrill .
and this
[ BofA lawyer Lewis ] Liman said of the total $ 3.6 billion in bonuses , Merrill was contractually obligated to pay $ 850 million .
The rest was paid to 39,000 employees , for an average of $ 91,000 , which was “ not a lot of money , ” Liman said .
“ I ’m glad you think $ 91,000 is not a lot of money , ” Rakoff replied .
“ I wish the average American was making anywhere near $ 91,000 . ”
Zero Hedge applauds ( for the time being ) this Judge 's seemingly earnest desire to get transparency to the surface over Mary Schapiro 's less than inspired attempt to shroud the whole matter with the pretense of settlement .
The question again is at what point will the CEO of Bank Of America finally be shown the door ?
How many such comparable gross judgments of error ( granted they were with other people 's money ) will Lewis have to perform before his board finally stop sucking at his proverbial teat .
Maybe Rakoff should make finally make a Lewis ouster as the minimum condition for any settlement , even with an organization as ineffectual and as conflicted as the SEC .
There are infinite ways to live less complicated lives more in tune with our ailing planet .

The Linux version of Chrome has been coming along fairly quickly , the latest development build of Chrome ( Chromium ) for Linux now works with Flash and has extension support .
It is also possible to configure the options ( although there are still some TODO stubs so setting a proxy is n’t possible , EDIT : Try the – proxy - server argument ) .
Tested under Ubuntu 9.04 64bit .
Update ( 05 Mar 2010 ) : Google now have a proper version of Chrome with flash , themes , greasemonkey and extensions .
Including .deb packages for Ubuntu ( And packages for Debian , Fedora and OpenSUSE ) .
Simply grab them from the the Chrome site , no other setup needed .
They will also install repositories to keep things up to date .
They are ‘ beta ’ but there more likely to be stable than grabbing the bleeding edge ones from the chromium - team repo ( there is an ‘ unstable ’ packages too ) .
I was running into issues with Chromium freezing up ( mainly Flash related ) which are not an issue with the official Google Chrome build .
There is also a fairly good Adblock extension .
It includes the same filterlists as the Firefox one .
If you need to block something extra hit ctrl + shit+k and you get a handy wizard where you can just click on whatever you want to nuke .
I also recommend giving the HTML5 version of YouTube a try .
It seems faster than the flash one and things like seeking are quick .
Full screen has a few issues .
In order to activate it you need to first popout the video using the icon up the top right of the video , although it ’s much faster to popout and Flash since it does n’t need to rebuffer the video like Flash often does .
I did have some sluggishness of the controls in full screen but the video playback works fine .
Also for some reason it goes back to the Flash player when I am logged into YouTube with a user account , but works fine without a login .

After all , I first proposed that Sgt. Crowley and I meet as early as last Monday .
If my experience leads to the lessening of the occurrence of racial profiling , then I would find that enormously gratifying .
Because , in the end , this is not about me at all ; it is about the creation of a society in which ‘ equal justice before law ’ is a lived reality . ”
A man who tried to warn authorities about vicious dogs roaming a Northern Territory town camp was told they were part of Aboriginal culture , a coronial inquest has heard .
Michael Anthony Hardy , 26 , died in July after being attacked by a pack of dogs .
Brian Lockyer , a part - time resident of the Hidden Valley town camp in Alice Springs , found the man 's body naked on the road and covered in dog bites .
Three weeks later , 48 - year old Robert Roman suffered a heart attack and was then eaten by dogs in the same town camp .
Coroner Greg Cavanagh is investigating whether there was a failure by either the Tangentyere Council or the Alice Springs Town Council in relation to dog control enforcement , and whether this may have contributed to the deaths of the two men .
Mr Lockyer told the inquest that for 10 years he had warned both the Alice Springs Town Council and Tangentyere Council about the rising population of savage dogs .
He says at times he had been laughed at and was told nothing could be done .
He says on one occasion he was told the dogs were an Aboriginal Dreaming .
Mr Lockyer told the coroner that dog numbers reduced after Mr Hardy 's death , but they are once again on the rise .
Earlier , ranger Clem Wheatley told the inquest he would raise the issue of the dogs on a daily basis , and expressed his frustration at the lack of proactive prevention .
In 2002 , Mr Wheatley wrote an email to both authorities predicting that if drastic action was not taken immediately , people would die .
The inquest continues .
Bill O'Reilly did an interesting thing last night when he reran that footage of Barney Frank castigating that woman carrying an Obama - as - Hitler sign at his town - hall meeting on health care :
He completely omitted the fact that the woman who Frank was castigating was in fact a member of the far - right Lyndon Larouche cult .
All O'Reilly could muster was to mention that the woman was " a political activist . "
But that 's like calling a Great White Shark a fish .
No , right - wingers like O'Reilly have been eagerly airbrushing out the existence of right - wing extremists from their worldview for some time now , embodied by their reaction to that DHS bulletin .
But it 's getting harder and harder to do all the time now .
Because , as we 've noted , the far - right extremists are bubbling up everywhere in supposedly mainstream conservative circles these days -- particularly at the tea parties and their associated health - care protests .
Most recently , it turns out that the guys who brought those guns to a health - care forum in Arizona in fact were longtime members of the old Arizona Vipers Militia .
These were characters who , prior to their arrests in 1996 , had stockpiled close to 2,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate and conducted field training exercises , practiced bomb - making , and trained with illegal automatic weapons .
Now , all the Fox talkers have been in heavy denial about extremists showing up for their tea - party protests , even making a regular joke out of it by asking the protesters they have on their show if they 're Klan members and the like .
But it 's becoming clearer all the time that , while not everyone at these events is an extremist , the percentages of them keep going up and up .
And with them , so does the threat to public safety .
We live in a democracy .
Supposedly , we are trying to bring our style of government to the people of Afghanistan .
We know the human cost of the War to Canadians every time we read about the death of another soldier .
But what is the financial cost ?
It must be pretty bad ... because Stephen Harper and his Conservatives will not tell Canadians how much of their money is being spent in the Afghan War .
If the Conservatives were the Opposition right now , ( and hopefully they soon will be ) , can you imagine how they would be going mental if the government of the day refused to disclose the cost of the War to taxpayers ?
Yet when they are in the government benches , they act in an arrogant , dictatorial manner .
Shame on Stephen Harper for once again , not being honest with Canadians .

There are no limits to how far some people will go to protect man 's best friend .
A South Australian man has put his freedom and financial security on the line to protect the life of his dog , a Staffordshire terrier cross named Max , media reports said on Friday .
Ronnie Gilbertson has abandoned his partner and two young children and gone into hiding since breaking Max out of an animal shelter 's " death row " last week , News Limited and the ABC reported .
Max was to be destroyed by Grant District Council , in the state 's south - east , for mauling sheep and other dogs .
Mr Gilbertson , 41 , had tried to have the SA District Court overturn the council 's decision , but failed .
The council has since launched court proceedings seeking to have Mr Gilbertson pay the costs associated with defending the failed appeal .
He could face a bill of more than $ 20,000 .
Mr Gilbertson contacted police this week indicating he was preparing to surrender but has yet to do so .

ABC Radio National ’s Bush Telegraph has a special programme on a psychoactive plant called kava that has been used ceremonially by Pacific Islanders for generations and has recently been researched as a treatment for depression and anxiety .
The effects of kava are usually compared to alcohol as it has a sedating and relaxing effect , although it produces far less thinking impairment than booze so the drinker has much more mental clarity .
The programme explores the history and traditional preparation of this tranquillising plant as well as discussing recent scientific research on its use as a psychiatric treatment .
This is particularly in light of a recent study by psychiatrist Jerome Sarris and colleagues where it performed remarkably well as both an anti-anxiety and anxidepressant drug .
In the interview , Sarris describes how kava affects the brain as well as suggesting that its ban in many countries , based on concerns about liver damage , may be due to low quality preparations of the compound which are n’t found in traditional methods .

Interesting :
Scientists looking for better ways to detect lies have found a promising one : increasing suspects ’ “ cognitive load . ”
For a host of reasons , their theory goes , lying is more mentally taxing than telling the truth .
Per­forming an extra task while lying or telling the truth should therefore affect the liars more .
To test this idea , deception researchers led by psychologist Aldert Vrij of the University of Portsmouth in England asked one group to lie convincingly and another group to tell the truth about a staged theft scenario that only the truth - tellers had experienced .
A second pair of groups had to do the same but with a crucial twist : both the liars and the truth - tellers had to maintain eye contact while telling their stories .
Later , as researchers watched videotapes of the suspects ’ accounts , they tallied verbal signs of cognitive load ( such as fewer spatial details in the suspects ’ stories ) and nonverbal ones ( such as fewer eyeblinks ) .
The eyeblinks are particularly interesting because whereas rapid blinking suggests nervousness , fewer blinks are a sign of cognitive load , Vrij explains — and contrary to what police are taught , liars tend to blink less .
Although the effect was subtle , the instruction to maintain eye contact did magnify the differences between the truth - tellers and the liars .
So do these differences actually make it easier for others to distinguish liars from truth - tellers ?
They do — but although students watching the videos had an easier time spotting a liar in the eye - contact condition , their accuracy rates were still poor .
Any group differences between liars and truth - tellers were dwarfed by differences between individual participants .
( For example , some people blink far less than others whether or not they are lying — and some are simply better able to carry a higher cognitive load . )

FBI Informant Says Agents Missed Chance to Stop 9/11 Ringleader Mohammed Atta Undercover operative ' one million % positive ' attacks could have been prevented .
Sept. 10 , 2009  --
On the eve of the eight year anniversary of the 9/11 attacks , an FBI informant who infiltrated alleged terrorist cells in the U.S. tells ABC News the FBI missed a chance to stop the al Qaeda plot because they focused more on undercover stings than on the man who would later become known as 9/11 ringleader Mohammed Atta .
In an exclusive interview to be broadcast tonight on ABC World News with Charles Gibson and Nightline , former undercover operative Elie Assaad says he spotted and became suspicious of Atta in early 2001 , when he was sent by the FBI to infiltrate a small mosque outside Miami .
Atta was there with Adnan Shukrujuman , an al Qaeda fugitive who now has a $ 5 million U.S. reward on his head .
" There was something wrong with these guys , " Assaad , a 36 - year - old Catholic native of Lebanon who pretended to be an Islamic extremist , says .
The FBI initially declined to comment but released a statement following the ABC News report , saying : " The 9/11 investigation , the most extensive ever conducted by the FBI , has been reviewed in its totality by the 9/11 Commission , Congress and others .
The claims made in the news report and the factual conclusions contained in the story are not supported by the evidence . "
The FBI did not specify which claims or conclusions it referred to .
Asaad said he told ABC News the truth and stands by his story .
Watch the undercover agent 's exclusive interview with Brian Ross tonight on World News with Charles Gibson and Nightline .
According to Assaad , Shukrujumah , whose father ran the mosque , invited the undercover FBI operative to meet him at his home , but the FBI told him to stay away .
Instead , Assad says the agency assigned him to set up and sting what he calls wannabe terrorists , ending any hope of infiltrating the real al Qaeda terrorists .
Former national security official Richard Clarke , now an ABC News consultant , said the case is " yet another example of the way the system broke down prior to 9/11 . "
" If the system had worked , " Clarke said , " we might have been able to identify these people before the attacks . "
After 9/11
Assaad , who posed as " Mohammed " – a personal representative of Osama bin Laden , says he 's a " million percent positive " the 9/11 attacks could have been stopped if the FBI had gone after Atta and Shukrujumah .
But because Atta and his men were suspicious of the FBI undercover operative , and secretive , Assaad says his FBI agent handlers sent him after the easier target – two wannabe terrorists whose cases were easy to crack and who were both eventually convicted and sent to prison .
" I was right , I was a hundred percent right , " Assaad says of his suspicions .
He says that when he learned that Atta was one of the 9/11 hijackers , when the FBI asked if he could identify any of the attackers , he was " very upset , angry " and cried .
" I curse on everybody , " Assaad says .
" I destroyed half of my furniture .
Uh , I went crazy . "
The FBI 's focus on stings , which Assaad has worked in at least 10 states and overseas since becoming an operative in 1996 , are being questioned by many counter - terrorism authorities , who wonder what the true value of the stings are .
Since 9/11 , the stings have largely targeted people that are more aspirational than operational .
" A lot of the cases after 9/11 were manufactured or enormously exaggerated and were announced with great trumpets by the attorney general and the FBI director so that we felt that they were doing something when , in fact , what they were doing was not helpful , not relevant , not needed , " said Clarke .
While Assaad 's undercover work has been called invaluable by the government in making the U.S. safer and has resulted in successful stings of alleged terrorist cells across the country , defense attorneys call him a master of entrapment against what they consider harmless targets .
After a 2006 sting , then - Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez praised Assaad – who was still unnamed at the time – for disrupting a group preparing a violent attack , resulting in the indictments of seven men on terror charges .
FBI undercover video from the case , obtained by ABC News , shows Assaad leading seven young men from Miami 's inner city in a loyalty oath to Osama bin Laden , in which he persuaded them he had been sent by al Qaeda with tens of thousands of dollars to spend on them for weapons and training .
The tape shows Assaad , who was working with the South Florida Joint Terrorism Task Force at the time , hugging his targets and welcoming them to al Qaeda .
Another video of a later meeting shows Assaad counting out $ 1000 for the leader of the Miami group .
After three trials , including two mistrials , five of the seven men were convicted .
Alleged Law Enforcement Entrapment
Defense lawyers including attorney Richard Houlihan , who represented Naudimar Herrera – one of the two men who were found not guilty , called the case a classic example of law enforcement entrapment .
" Without [ Assaad 's ] performance , none of this would have happened , " Houlihan told ABC News .
" He 's dealing with seven basically inner-city kids from Liberty City .
Poor , uneducated , looking for money . "
Herrera said he and the others played along with Assaad because of the financial incentives promised by him .
" He was like , " Oh your name here .
You say your name here . "
It was more like , it was more like a movie script , " Herrera told ABC News .
He said that anyone " blind about greed " would be " vulnerable to [ Assaad 's ] intelligence . "
Assaad said some tactics – like suggesting targets , as he did in this case with FBI offices in Miami – are necessary in undercover stings .
" Sometimes you have to see …what he 's willing to do …. what 's he 's capable of doing , " says Assaad of suspected terrorists .
" When you are working undercover , " Assaad says , " your job is to lie . "

BOSTON  Nearly everyone in Massachusetts is waiting for Joseph P. Kennedy II to make up his mind .
It is hard to imagine this state without a Kennedy in the United States Senate .
But it seems that Mr. Kennedy , 56 , an entrepreneur and a former congressman who has avoided politics for more than a decade , is the only family member seriously mulling a run for the seat his uncle , Edward M. Kennedy , held for 47 years .
For Massachusetts , with its top hospitals , universities and research centers that counted on the federal dollars that flowed from Senator Kennedy ’s influence on Capitol Hill , the stakes extend far beyond its deep emotional connection with him .
People here are starting to grapple with the big political question : how to replace their irreplaceable senator , whose decades of relationships in Washington made Massachusetts a prime beneficiary of the things he believed in .
“ With Joe , a lot of those ties would come back quickly , ” said David Gergen , a professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard who has advised both Democratic and Republican presidents .
“ There would be an army of people who worked for his uncle who would want to work for him . ”
Several people close to the family said pressure on Joe Kennedy was not coming from the family , still grieving over the loss of its patriarch , but from within Joe himself , and , they speculated , from various stakeholders in Massachusetts  mayors , labor leaders and others  who view him as the candidate most likely to inherit enough of his uncle ’s monumental legacy to take care of their needs .
Code - named " Maverick " , Pete Mitchell , the impetuous daredevil Navy - pilot ace , is accepted into Miramar 's elite Fighter School , also known as " Top Gun " .
There , as the impulsive pilot competes with the best of the best , not only will he meet Charlie , the flying school 's curvaceous astrophysics instructor , but also the brilliant and highly competitive fellow student , " Iceman " , with whom right from the start , he will engage in a reckless contest .
As Maverick is haunted by his father 's mysterious death , will he be able to suppress his wild nature to win the prestigious Top Gun Trophy ?

SOMERVILLE --
Proponents of medical marijuana plan to rally in front of the Somerset County courthouse Friday in support a multiple sclerosis patient facing trial for
growing 17 marijuana plants
behind his home last year .
The state chapter of the Coalition for Medical Marijuana expects about two dozen people to assemble in downtown Somerville on behalf of 36 - year - old John Ray Wilson , a Franklin Township man who is accused of first - degree maintaining or operating a drug- production facility , second - degree manufacturing and third - degree drug possession .
If convicted , he faces up to 20 years in prison .
Last month , Superior Court Judge Robert Reed ruled that Wilson wo n't be able to reference his medical condition at trial and he cannot assert personal use as a defense .
Advocates say the decision is a prime example of why the Legislature needs to pass the New Jersey Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act .
In his decision , Reed said the establishment of medical marijuana for personal use as a state policy or as a defense to criminal liability is a matter for the Legislature to decide and not for a court to create .
Deputy Attorney General Russell Curley said allowing Wilson to reference his condition would merely be a way to garner sympathy and could prompt the jury to acquit , believing he had a reason to break the law .
Defense lawyer James Wronko said barring the medical - use argument ties their hands unfairly .
Jurors could speculate that he was operating a commercial operation and must have done so for years .
Wilson uses the drug to help alleviate the pain and other symptoms that have plagued him since 2002 , Wronko has said .
Omitting that information means Wilson wo n't be able to defend himself , said Jim Miller , coalition president .
The rally starts at 11 a.m. and is meant to spread the word about his plight .
" Even if the jury wo n't , the general public is going to find out that this is a problem , " said Miller , whose wife , Cheryl , died of complications from multiple sclerosis .

Warré - like beekeeping in Japan Gilbert Brockmann published an article in the German beekeeping magazine ADIZ ( 1 ) which describes a hive and beekeeping method in use in Japan .
After studying the website of one of the beekeepers concerned , Syouichi Morimoto ( http://www.h6.dion.ne.jp/~kansatu/index.html), contact was made to ask more about it .
It emerged that the beekeeping system Syouichi Morimoto uses is a traditional one .
It was used in Japan during the Edo period ( A.D.1586 to A.D.1911 ) .
It is very similar to Warré's .
The bee that Syouichi Morimoto uses is Apis cerana japonica .
Compared with Apis mellifera , it is less prone to disease , forms smaller colonies and gives correspondingly less honey per colony ( 4 to 14 kg ) .
Syouichi Morimoto's hive is divisible / expandable , comprising boxes of internal dimensions 240 mm ( footprint ) by 150 mm high , i.e. 60 mm less on both dimensions compared with Warré boxes .
Syouichi Morimoto's hive ( left ) and detail of hive - body box containing spales to stabilise comb .
Above : Mesh floor unit with front opening to insert feeder Apis cerana swarms readily .
Here ( above ) a swarm is lured with a bait hive placed high up .
The plant , Cymbidium floribundum ( kinryouhen in Japanese ) , in the wire mesh cage below the hive is the swarm lure .
The hive is also rubbed with beeswax round the entrance inside and out , as is a framework ( or mesh ) inside the top of the hive on which the bees start the comb .
The swarm has settled in and is drawing natural comb ( view from below ) .
This photo illustrates the function of the spales .
In the Warré hive , top - bars take the place of spales by providing a fresh start to comb at the top of each hive - body box .
New boxes are added at the bottom , as with the Warré hive .
Likewise the honey is harvested by removing one or more boxes at the top .
Syouichi Morimoto says that he harvests in spring and autumn .
Preparing for harvest by driving the bees down with drumming on the lid .
Warré recommends smoking the bees down for harvesting from his hive .
Inserting a thin wedge to lift the honey box slightly .
Cutting through comb below the top box with piano wire .
Pfarrer J. L. Christ also recommends harvesting this way , but Warré advises easing the top box free by slight twisting .
This is possible in the Warré hive because the top - bars in it interrupt the comb and any bridges are easily sheared .
Also , if in a Warré hive the brood nest is unexpectedly near the top , there is a risk of damaging the queen by using wire .

Videos of traditional Apis cerana beekeeping in Japan A Japanese beekeeper has uploaded to Youtube under the pseudonym ' mituro36 ' ninety - three videos of beekeeping in Japan , among which are four of Warré - like beekeeping almost identical to that described above .
The videos illustrate nadiring ; covering cracks with tape ; using wire to separate boxes ; using a hair drier to clear box of bees prior to harvesting it ; design of box with steel spales , free comb and something resembling a Warré roof and quilt ; honey extraction using crushing , straining and finally pressing with an interesting looking press that looks as if it has been built for the purpose .

Begegnung mit einem Freizeitimker aus Japan .

A few days before the Sept. 2 earthquake on Java , I passed though some of the affected areas on a train ride between Bandung in the West Java highlands to Yogyakarta ( pronounced Jogja ) on the Central Java plain .
This must be one of the world ’s most interesting rail journeys .
The slow but comfortable “ Argo Wilis ” ( endearingly , Indonesian trains have names — this one a volcano the train passes on its 13 - hour journey ) snakes its way along a mostly single track around terraced hillsides and between old volcanoes , through Tasikmalaya and Banjar — the towns that recently made their tragic appearance on world news .
The train then descends onto a plain of rice paddies , some still green and glistening , others brown from recent harvests .
Looking back , it is remarkable that the earthquake , with a force of 7.1 , killed only 100 or so .
This is one of the most densely populated rural regions on the planet , a place where villages and towns form a continuum along the roads and railway , where even the steepest hillsides are terraced to grow rice in the wet season and a vast array of other crops in the dry season , where fruits of almost every sort abound along with tea , coffee and tobacco .
The red-tiled , single story houses standard throughout Java do not look ideal for resisting earthquakes .
But the record suggests otherwise , for this is an island that has experienced regular earthquakes and volcanic eruptions since Java man lived near Yogyakarta 100,000 years ago .
One evening — not long after my family moved to the old country farmhouse where my wife and I have lived for 45 years — our youngest son ( my namesake , Jim , then three - year - old Jimmy ) came into the woodshed , while I was there putting away some tools .
“ Look , ” he said proudly , cradling in his arms the largest rat I had ever seen .
Instinctively , in what no doubt would be a genetic response of any parent , I tried to grab the rat from his arms before it bit him ; but , as I reached toward it , the rat tightened its body , menacing me with its sharp teeth .
At once , I stepped back : that , too , was an instinctive response , though rational thought immediately followed it .
Was the rat rabid ?
Whether that was so or not , it was clear that the rat trusted Jimmy but not me , and yet it might bite both of us if I threatened it further .
“ Where did you find it ? ” I asked my son .
“ In the barn . ”
“ Which barn ?
The one with all the hay ? ”
“ Yes . ”
“ It was just lying there , on the hay ? ”
“ Yes , and he likes me . ”
“ I can see that it does . ”
With the possible exception of the difference in our use of pronouns ( which just now came to me without conscious intent ; could it have risen from some submerged level of my memory ? ) , that little dialogue is n’t an exact transcription — not only because it happened decades ago , but because while I was talking , my mind was elsewhere .
I was looking at the garden tools I ’d just returned to the wall behind Jimmy , thinking I might ask him to put the rat on the floor so that I could kill it with a whack of a shovel or some other implement .
But my son trusted me , just as the rat apparently trusted him ; and what kind of traumatic shock would I be visiting upon Jimmy if I smashed the skull of an animal he considered his friend ?
The woodshed is in a wing of the house connected to the kitchen , where my wife , Jean , had been preparing dinner .
She surprised me by coming quietly to my side ; apparently she had overheard our conversation through the screen door and now was offering a solution to the dilemma .
She said , “ We need to find something to put your pet in , Jimmy . ”
“ A box , ” I said .
“ Just keep holding it while I find one . ”
For I remembered at that moment a stout box I had seen while rummaging among all the agricultural items that had collected over the years in the carriage barn across the road — items that fell into disuse after the fields had been cleared , the house and barns constructed , and finally after tractors and cars had replaced horses .
Amid the jumble of old harnesses , horse - drawn plow parts , scythes , and two - man saws was a small oblong box that might have contained dynamite fuses or explosives for removing stumps .
It had been sawed and sanded from a plank about two inches thick .
Like the house itself , it was made of wood far more durable than anything available since the virgin forests were harvested , and all of its edges were covered in metal .
Though I felt guilty for leaving Jimmy and Jean with the rat , I was glad to have remembered the box I had admired for its craftsmanship , and I ran in search of it .
For the longest time , I could n’t find it and thought ( as I often did later , whenever I found myself unable to resolve a crisis besetting one of our adolescent sons ) ,
What kind of father am I ?
I was close to panic before I finally found the box , more valuable to me at that moment than our recently purchased Greek - revival farmhouse — the kind of family home I ’d long dreamed of owning .
A film of these events still runs through my mind , but I will summarize the rest of it here .
Jimmy was initially the director of this movie , with Jean and me the actors obedient to his command : that is to say , he obstinately refused to put the rat into the box until a suitable bed was made for it — old rags would n’t do , for it had to be as soft as his favorite blanket .
The rat gave him his authority , for it trusted Jean no more than it trusted me ; it remained unperturbed in his embrace for a few minutes more , while Jean searched for and then cut several sections from a tattered blanket .
Our son was satisfied with that bed , and the rat — whose trust in a three - year - old seemed infinite — seemed equally pleased , permitting Jimmy to place it on the soft strips .
As soon as we put the lid on the box , I called the county health department , only to be told that the office had closed ; I was to take in the rat first thing in the morning so that its brain could be dissected .
In response to Jean ’s immediate question , “ Did the rat bite you ? ” Jimmy said , “ No , he kissed me . ”
Could any parent have believed an answer like that ?
My response was simply to put the box outside .
Before giving our son a bath , we scrutinized every part of his body , finding no scratches anywhere on it .
During the night the rat gnawed a hole through the wood , and by dawn it had disappeared .
Forty - odd years ago , rabies vaccination involved a lengthy series of shots , each of them painful , and occasionally the process itself was fatal .
Neither the health department nor our pediatrician would tell us what to do .
Once again we searched Jimmy ’s body for the slightest scratch and again found nothing ; so we decided to withhold the vaccination — though Jean and I slept poorly for several nights .
Long after it had become apparent that our son had not contracted a fatal disease , I kept thinking — as I again do , in remembering the event — of the errors I had made , of what I should have done instead , of how helpless I had felt following my discovery that the rat had escaped .
While reading a recent biography of William James by Robert D. Richardson Jr. , I found myself recalling those suspenseful and seemingly never - ending hours .
As Richardson demonstrates , James was aware of the extent that circumstance and random events ( like the one that led my young son to a particular rat so long ago ) can alter the course of history as well as the lives of individuals , making the future unpredictable .
James , like my favorite writer , Chekhov , was trained as a medical doctor and became an author — though not of stories and plays ( his younger brother Henry was the fiction writer ) but of books and articles on philosophical , psychological , and spiritual matters .
One of the founders of American pragmatism , James rejected European reliance on Platonic absolutes or on religious and philosophical doctrines that declared the historical necessity of certain future events .
Despite his realization that much lies beyond our present and future control , James still believed in the independence of individual will , a view essential to the long - lasting but often precarious freedom underlying our democratic system .
Though my life strikes me as more stable than most — Jean and I have been married for 63 years , raising our children in a house now 176 years old — I ’m aware that circumstances and forces exterior to us have played a dominant role in our lives .
A party that Jean and I gave soon after my discharge from the Army at the conclusion of World War II brought us to this Finger Lakes farmhouse .
I had entered graduate school in English on the GI bill at Western Reserve University in Cleveland ; Jean , while taking some part - time graduate courses in chemistry there , was working as a chemist at the Standard Oil research lab at the edge of the campus .
Without that party — which angered our landlady , who lived beneath our apartment — we might have remained indefinitely in Cleveland ; instead , we began the various journeys that brought unexpected events and chance encounters with others , one of which resulted in my permanent appointment as a Cornell English literature professor .
For that matter , I never would have become an enlisted soldier in an infantry division fighting in France and Germany had it not been for the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7 , 1941 — as unexpected an attack as the destruction wrought by suicidal terrorists on September 11 , 2001 .
I can see how much I was a pawn — often a lucky one — of history .
Soon after my division landed in Normandy , I was transferred from an antitank squad to divisional headquarters — and the following day a land mine hidden in the road by the retreating Germans exploded under the truck carrying members of that squad , killing many of them .
So , instead of being a combat soldier , if I had survived that carnage , I became the editor of my division ’s newspaper as we advanced through Europe .
On a lovely April day , I was driving our Jeep in Germany in search of printing supplies for the next issue .
With me were the public relations captain and the newspaper ’s artist .
We somehow got ahead of our troops — something we did n’t realize until we came upon a recently felled tree blocking the road and heard the bullets whistling past our ears from rifles on a nearby hill .
I zigzagged the Jeep to safety and found another road .
We were surprised even more when the new road took us into two towns , once again before our troops arrived .
In each town , dozens of German soldiers raised their hands in surrender , even climbing like puppies onto the hood of the Jeep ; but how could we take prisoners ?
As evening came , I was driving too fast to see another object — odder and much smaller than the felled tree — also desperately contrived to impede the American advance : the long barrel of an antique pistol , sharpened to a point at the end , its butt replacing a half - brick on the road .
Positioned at an angle , it was designed to do precisely what it did : blow out two tires while flipping the Jeep over as it veered into a field .
The two passengers fell out , unharmed , but I was trapped by the steering wheel .
The Jeep ended up back on its wheels , leaving me conscious on the ground but unable to move .
I remember a circle of faces looking down at me — neighboring German civilians , all of them apparently sympathetic , as well as my two riders — the captain ( who showed me that strange little booby trap ) and the artist .
A German woman asked me a question in English , and I answered in her language .
But bad luck can sometimes be followed by fortunate circumstances .
Apparently we had arrived at the border of the American advance , for a medical corps Jeep soon came , and I was transferred on a back - seat litter to a forward field hospital .
In addition to a broken pelvis , various organs in my lower viscera had been punctured .
That field hospital had but a single surgeon , who had been operating for several days on wounded soldiers under the wavering lights of a portable generator .
As he shaved my pubic hair , I asked the surgeon if I ’d be impotent ; he smiled at such a conventional question and said I would n’t .
I never learned the name of that doctor — only that he was a friend of one of my college teachers , an unexpected coincidence — but his skill permitted me to live and to be the father of three sons .
After the operation , an infection took over my body , and I developed a high fever , accompanied by nightmares .
Later , I realized I ’d entered the process that leads to dying , for I was within a cone of pale light that kept vanishing toward a single point .
Just before it reached that point , I would see a head — it must have belonged to a nurse , not to my hallucinations — and soon thereafter ( or so I imagine , having then no sense of time ) the shining point always grew back to its original cone .
Luckily for me , that field hospital had received some of the first penicillin available for soldiers , and the series of injections and blood transfusions administered to me restored me to full consciousness and at last to the pain that accompanies the injured living .
Some years ago , I remembered that cone of light while experiencing an actual phenomenon much like it .
Unable to sleep , I had left the bed I shared with Jean to work at my desk .
Long after midnight , I went outdoors in my pajamas to look at the stars and found myself near the end of a narrow shaft of pale light that seemed to expand as it rose above me .
Our son Larry and his wife were visiting us , and I woke them as well as Jean to share what I had just seen .
Still half - asleep , they stumbled outdoors .
“ My God ! ” Larry cried , for that eerie radiance bathed all of us and the house and rose into the heavens .
Since a phenomenon like that requires an explanation , we decided — rightly or not — that it was caused by the tail of a distant comet , surprisingly not reported ; and we stayed outdoors until all of us became drowsy , lulled by the fragrance from the fields of newly mown hay .
Ever since , I ’ve wondered if all living creatures exist at varying positions within a cone of vital energy , made visible only through extraordinary events or by the approach of death .
Chance brings so many miracles and so much tragedy into all of our lives that it is remarkable that humans can affirm — as James does — that individual will is equally a determining factor .
And yet personal memory makes me agree with James ; Americans in general also do .
But of course most Americans , whatever our adversities , historically have been luckier than many others , and the luckiest of us include the most fervent supporters of the belief that success or failure depends wholly on the individual .
Though nothing about human nature is exempt from argumentation , it strikes me that personal will surely exists in our response to the circumstances that fate thrusts upon us .
Circumstance , for example , required Jean and me to respond , however faulty our judgments , to the rat in Jimmy ’s arms .
In Oedipus Rex , though , the protagonist ’s action in response to circumstance is equally the working out of fate , and the last words of that tragedy come from the chorus : “ Call no man happy until he carries his happiness down to the grave in peace . ”
Now that I ’m 86 , I find that my mind flits back and forth between a myriad of specific memories and abstract questions devoid of clear answers .
One such question — perhaps related , but more circumscribed than anything raised by Sophocles ’ play — often occurs to people like Jean and me long after it ’s too late to matter :
Could we have been better parents ?
Though sometimes it comes from the behavior of their adolescent children , that kind of question often follows parental inability to foresee accidents waiting to befall their offspring .
After my father ’s death , my mother , then 90 , came to live with us .
Very early on a July morning in 1975 , I was awakened by a phone call from an airline representative who told me that my brother , an airline captain , had been killed in the crash of the limousine taking him and his crew to Chicago ’s O’Hare airport .
The most painful task I ’ve ever undertaken was to tell my mother after she awoke at sunrise ( I now wake at that time , too , if not earlier ) that her older son was dead .
To do that , I lay next to her on her bed .
She could n’t comprehend the dreadful news , asking me to repeat over and over all the information I ’d been given .
Finally she said , “ Jackie , ” the name she had called him as an infant , and then told me details that must have made her feel guilty over the decades : ever since he had learned to walk , she ’d had to keep constant watch over him .
Once , while she was giving him a bath , he had slithered out of her grasp to run , naked , out the door and down the street .
Another time she had tied him to a rope attached to a tree in the front yard so she would have time to wash his diapers .
These were the things she first remembered upon learning of his death .
Larry , our oldest son , resembles Jack in physical dexterity , technical expertise , and general enthusiasms , such as piloting .
As a two - year - old , he required the same kind of watching .
Once , he managed to escape our fenced - in yard and run down the driveway into the middle of the major highway serving the small Kentucky town where we had bought our first house .
Jean ran after him , afraid that if she called his name he ’d veer from the center stripe and be hit , for cars and trucks were whizzing past in both directions , the drivers seemingly oblivious to both mother and child .
She rescued him that time ; but later , as a first - grader coming home for lunch , he was struck by a car at the marked crosswalk on the street in front of the elementary school .
No guard was present , and a car was illegally parked at the crosswalk , preventing our son from seeing any oncoming traffic .
Larry was knocked unconscious but , fortunately , was not run over .
I was leading a discussion on a novel in an adjoining building ( the elementary school had once been a training facility for college students preparing for public school careers ) when I was interrupted by a secretary who told me my son had been hit and was lying in the street .
In the short time it took me to reach the crosswalk , Larry had been taken to the office of a local doctor who told us — Jean had already arrived there — that our child had suffered a minor concussion and that he’d be fine if we made sure he stayed awake for the rest of the day .
Like all parents , Jean and I will never be able to forget events like these .
Though I was n’t even home when Jean ran after Larry on a busy highway , I sometimes still relive it , feeling both irresponsible and helpless .
That first son was followed three years later by Cris — an abbreviation of Crispin , his middle name ; Jim was born seven years after Cris .
When Larry was a teenager , a social worker and longtime friend — her husband was a colleague of mine — told Jean that we put an unusual burden on our sons by expecting them to live up to an unstated code of behavior , perhaps one similar to the relationship she had observed between Jean and me .
We seemed , that is , to assume some kind of equality among the members of our family , permitting our children to call us by our first names and never imposing specific rules upon their conduct .
Her observations were not accusatory in nature ; they may have been partially intended to show us how little we had in common with the dysfunctional family relationships of her clients .
And yet they seemed to imply — especially in that phrase “ an unusual burden ” — a difference between her own family and ours .
When Jean told me what the social worker had said , I found her comments accurate enough to be troubling .
During the years that our children remained dependent upon us , I ’d always felt a special responsibility , as the adult male , for providing security and guidance to my family .
Though Jean and I each had professional careers , we assumed , in a way typical of our generation , that mine should have precedence .
But I had never wanted to be a patriarch , that conventional figure of male authority .
Jean and I always came to major family decisions through mutual consent ; neither of us would do anything that might make the other unhappy — or our children , for that matter , after they were old enough to be consulted .
The reason for such behavior , being self - serving , is nothing to be proud of : we knew we ’d inflict misery on ourselves by pursuing personal desires that brought unhappiness to those we love .
Nobody can will that kind of love ; one reason , I guess , is that it depends on at least two people to share it .
In the attempt to save their failing marriage , one of our sons and his former wife had a series of talks with a marriage counselor .
Ultimately , the counselor told our son that his marital problems were obviously caused by his parents .
Successful marriages require the open expression of personal emotion ; if his parents never argued and fought , the reason was that they had repressed their hostility , thus victimizing him to a repetition of their fault .
Ever since Freud , repression has served some analysts as a convenient and irrefutable explanation for the problems of their patients .
For example , the indignation with which I responded when our son asked me if what the counselor had said was true might have been used by the counselor as proof of the extent to which I would go to repress my other emotions .
As our choices of professions indicate , Jean and I have differing aptitudes .
But it seems to me that our relationship over the decades reflects a mutual respect and trust that never has been corroded by resentment .
If free will has anything to do with that , it undoubtedly comes from the desire not to repeat the mistakes of our parents .
The Great Depression contributed to marital difficulties for both sets of our parents : Jean ’s father lost his job as an accountant , while my father fruitlessly kept hoping for a position commensurate with his pre-Depression expectations .
Jean ’s mother helped to support her family as a door - to - door salesperson of women ’s dresses and as a substitute public school teacher : in those days , married women were n’t allowed to be full - time teachers .
Her frustration — she was , as I know , a capable and unusually intelligent woman — probably explains her growing resentment of her husband and the strict regulations she imposed on her two daughters .
Neither of my parents was a disciplinarian .
My father , for that matter , was rarely home , for he took position after position ( I attended 15 schools before I became a high school graduate ) , most of which kept him in other cities .
It was n’t until I read The Great Gatsby as an adult that I realized how much my father resembled Fitzgerald ’s title character , possessing the same “ extraordinary gift for hope , ” the same “ romantic readiness , ” with the exception that my father ’s “ green light ” was never a woman too idealized to be mortal , but rather an equally impossible “ bracket , ” a word he often used to describe the otherwise indefinable status he felt destined to attain .
Like Gatsby , he sought spiritual goals through material ends , but nothing — neither the well - paying positions he still managed to secure nor his wife and children — came up to his dreams .
During my adolescence , he asked my mother ’s permission for a divorce , since he ’d fallen in love with another woman .
My mother granted the request , however desolate it made her , and she relied primarily on me , as her younger son , for affection during the next three years .
That bond should have made me an ideal candidate for the complex that Freud derived from the myth of Oedipus , but it did n’t .
Though my love for my mother during those difficult years may have been far deeper , I never lost my love for my father — in part , I suppose , because my mother never did , either .
That three - year period ended when financial problems caused my mother , brother , and me to separate .
My father was then running a Packard dealership on Chicago ’s South Side , living with his second wife in a high - rise apartment building a block or so from Lake Michigan .
For about half a year , I stayed with them .
That marriage , like the Packard agency , was failing ; though they had welcomed me , I realized that my presence — for my unhappiness must have been obvious — only added to the tension .
My father began to invite me to accompany him on various errands , which permitted his wife ( I never thought of her as my stepmother ) to have the apartment to herself .
Once he took me to a South Side restaurant that had a walled - in balcony with slits overlooking the floor .
When I asked him the purpose of those slits , he told me in a quiet voice that they had been built for machine guns , but that the restaurant ’s patrons were now safe from harm .
I did n’t know that he ( again , like Gatsby ) consorted with gangsters until one day we were driving through the Loop area .
While we were waiting in traffic behind a streetcar , somebody , in what seemed a single action , entered the Packard through a back door , closing it as he threw himself on the floor behind us .
I never saw the man ’s face , only heard his urgent whisper for my father to drive around the streetcar on the wrong side , and then to turn on the first side street .
The commands kept coming until I — and presumably those pursuing the fugitive — was hopelessly lost .
We were on a deserted street in a warehouse district when the man told my father to stop , and he slipped out of the car as quickly as he entered it .
I knew , without my father telling me , that I should never mention to anybody that encounter .
Until this moment of writing about it , I have n’t ; and now , having done so , it seems more like an episode from an old George Raft gangster film than a commentary on a period in my father ’s life when his Depression - era desperation to capture what lay only in his imagination led him into contact with underworld figures .
My father ’s second marriage soon ended in divorce , probably a relief to both of them ; he had exhausted much of the money his new wife had inherited .
I never discovered all the wild schemes my father dreamed up in the following year , but I do know he spent some months in a penitentiary for issuing bad checks to pay for rooms in expensive hotels in a number of cities .
Petitions from my mother and from the more influential people my father ’s abilities had once impressed , including the president of an automobile corporation and the head of a federal bureaucracy , won his release , conditional on his ability to pay his debts in monthly installments .
A few weeks after he regained his freedom , I was the best man at my parents ’ second marriage .
They had always displayed affection for each other .
Like Jean and me , they never quarreled .
The only disagreement between them that I heard as a child was over the thousands of dollars my mother would be awarded if she won a contest for submitting , along with the proper box top , the most three - letter words to be made from the name and slogan of a breakfast cereal : she wanted to send some of the money to her sister , and save the rest for my brother and me ; my father wanted it all for a new business venture .
But that little dispute ended in an amiable compromise : they would wait until my mother actually won the prize before making a decision .
Still , my father almost left my mother once again for another woman he had met on his travels , and only an action of mine — by then , I was a college sophomore — prevented it .
I found his hotel address in Indiana , and convinced my mother to drive in my old Ford ( a gift from my father after the remarriage ) to confront him there .
During that long and rainy morning and nighttime journey , I felt more like her father than her son ; but I suppose that most children , from their college days onward , consider themselves , rightly or not , better informed than their parents .
Circumstances in some cases can result in decisions that in retrospect we never regret : that particular decision — probably the foundation of my belief in free will , limited as it may be by the very chance that allows it — enabled my parents to live together in contentment far longer than they had before he left us .
But domestic tranquility for my father supported , rather than ended , his restless and optimistic questing .
Though he probably never admitted it to himself , it seems to me that the glamour my father found in women other than my mother had much to do with the greater assistance they could give him in his pursuit of his intangible goal .
In his mid-70s my father became ill for the first time in his adult life .
Cancer had spread from his pancreas to other organs , and a surgeon removed his pancreas to lessen the symptoms .
Yet he refused to admit he was dying ; while confined to bed or a nearby chair before a card table after a second operation , he made plans for a new business and even volunteered his services as part of a telephone network , offering encouragement to young people trying to overcome drug addiction and other problems .
In addition to my mother , Jean and I and one of my aunts — my father ’s younger sister — were with him as he was dying .
As blood gushed from his mouth , Jean cradled an arm around his head , lifting him so he could breathe while she stemmed the flow with a towel .
Even at the end , his hope — he never owned a mansion , but in this more fundamental way he outlasted Gatsby — never left him .
His last words were an embattled but still triumphant cry , “ I do n’t have cancer ! ”
All of us then told him we loved him ; I ’ve wanted ever since to believe they were the final words he heard and not the astonished ones spoken by his sister at the moment of his death : “ Why , how much like Dad he looks ! ”
I have sometimes wondered if the struggle of sons against their fathers reverberates onward from the dawn of history , though we have only myths to suggest that it might .
But I do know that for decades my father ’s father — the single living grandparent I ever had — either lived with , or was supported by , my parents or the family of my father ’s older sister .
During the long period of my grandfather ’s final illness , he lived with my parents , nursed by my mother and that sister .
My father never told me anything about my grandfather ’s past ; I slowly came to know about it from my father ’s two sisters .
Having inherited a handsome amount of money , my grandfather established a tobacco shop in Cleveland ; it failed when his partner stole all the stock and the money kept in the store and vanished .
Then he opened a downtown Cleveland loan agency .
“ Oh , how he loved to hand out money ! ” one of my aunts told me .
“ Without getting any security , he handed out money until he had nothing left . ”
That debacle ended his own questing ; his remaining pride — my aunt said he still considered himself a businessman , a person of considerable status — kept him from seeking factory employment , though from then on he depended upon his children , his wife having long since died .
All three of my grandfather ’s children felt compassion for him , that gentle but ineffectual dreamer who gave up too soon .
My brother ’s face carried a genetic resemblance to that of my mother and her mother , while mine continues to carry the eyes and bone structure of my father and grandfather .
But it has taken me years to realize that the bond between my father and me came from our genetic heritage and from our joint struggles to deny it .
Most parents do n’t want their children to suffer the kind of grief inflicted on them by their own parents .
By saving them from that , though , they may inflict upon their children difficulties of another kind .
I ’ve often worried — always to myself — if the burden Jean and I placed on our children proceeds less from our lack of specific rules on their conduct than from a marital relationship that for a variety of social and economic reasons later generations have found difficult to obtain , its drama and surprises not a result of misunderstandings and reconciliations after quarrels but in the discovery each day — with a poignancy that only increases with age — of how glad we are to be with each other .
It ’s folly to worry that this may be a burden on one ’s sons .
Before luckily finally finding their own enduring marriages , two of our sons suffered the emotional disturbances of marital or premarital relationships that never worked out ; our other son has never married .
One of those early young women , who still occasionally visits us , agrees with Jean ’s remark that children take credit for their own successes but blame their failures on their parents .
I lack the desire — perhaps because I also lack the talent — to write a contemporary version of Oedipus Rex .
But if I could write such a tragedy , the son would n’t kill his father because of sexual rivalry over the wife and mother — an absurdity , at least from my personal experience — but rather because of self - hatred , his motive hard to distinguish from suicide .
As for me , I ’ll never forget the long - ago moment I saw my father ’s face in the mirror while I was shaving : despite my growing admiration for him in the years after the remarriage , it was the first time that I had fully accepted the likeness , and I realized that I had also accepted myself , whatever my shortcomings .
That double acceptance involved more than the genetic connection : I was entering middle age , and the hair at my temples was turning gray , my skin losing its youthful tautness and beginning to sag below the cheeks .
That is to say , my father and I were mortal and would share the fate common to all living creatures .
I was living then with my wife and children in Paris ; our apartment was a niche in a modern and impersonal housing complex .
Maybe one has to be far from home to gain awareness like that .
After all , visiting foreign countries is said to be a broadening experience .
Crucial moments of that sort probably can be found in the lives of all humans .
Novelists , though , usually avoid them , for such moments have nothing to do with suspenseful plots and ( like an enduring love ) are beyond personal will .
From middle age on , I ’ve experienced several such life - changing moments ; like the effect of father on son , one probably helps to determine the next .
Such revelatory moments have no source that I know of ; nothing in our personal lives completely accounts for them , including the particular circumstances of their happening .
They make me aware that every human is unknowable and that fate , including death , contributes to the mystery .
Nobody realizes this better than those who , like me , have spent much of their lives in pursuit of themselves through the resources of personal memory .
Nearly every book I ’ve read by present - day neuroscientists expresses an indebtedness to William James for his prescient insights about a century ago into consciousness and memory — particularly those insights in his Principles of Psychology that have been validated by the greater information and more sophisticated research tools now available to scientists of our human minds .
As James realized , memory works by similarity of association between the past and the future .
Long before it became a recognizable mode of fiction , James used the phrase “ stream of consciousness ” to define our ongoing apprehension of ourselves and the world around us and considered the ephemeral present to be a specious part of time .
In its ability to find likenesses among seemingly disparate and sometimes antithetical mental images , my own memory seems a spiritual faculty in search of unity as well as a purely practical faculty for understanding as best I can the world within which I exist today .
( James ’s interest in this spiritual dimension resulted in his Varieties of Religious Experience and even led to his attendance at séances , one trance medium in particular winning his respect . )
Consciousness , for me , is memory ’s practical application , forever taking these different images and separating them into segments useful to us in our quest for self - preservation and for discovery ; essential to thought , consciousness provides me the abstraction I ’m now making — the division of my memory into two parts , only one of which is analytical , the other always in quest of a synthesis beyond its reach .
Some inaccessible part of memory — the part that remains a mystery — apparently gives me a premonition of this ultimate unity .
Physicists like Einstein must have sensed it , too , hoping to unveil it through the elegance of a theory based on mathematical equations .
Consciousness — that mark of life , a miracle in itself — prevents us from achieving that unity , our yearning for it possibly underlying all our desires for freedom , including the one for a will of our own .
Ever since as a young soldier I saw that pale cone of energy vanishing toward the point that would bring the end of consciousness , I ’ve had no fear of dying : those last moments of life seem to come easily , without worry or physical pain , as we slip back to our source in a natural world indifferent to distinctions and oblivious to time .
About 20 years ago , I sat on a mossy boulder near the Saranac River in the Adirondacks .
A small creek disappeared under that boulder , emerging on the other side to trickle through small stones on its way to the river .
Jean and Cris , the son who has n’t married , were on separate paths — deer or bear trails — that wandered through our fern - filled glen .
Cris , who has learned to identify mushrooms , was searching for them , interested in the shape and colors of both the edible and poisonous kinds ; Jean was simply taking pleasure in everything around her .
From the boulder , I could see them both as well as our beached canoe .
Dappled by the foliage of the trees above us , sunlight gave a soft illumination to that little glen .
My sense of well - being and happiness was so extraordinary that I ’ve wanted to recapture it ever since .
Happiness like that is beyond my understanding .
I do n’t think I would have felt it without a sense of companionship — without the affection I had for my wife and son .
Did it possibly come from something carried in my genetic memory from distant ancestors who might have had a similar feeling of well - being in some hidden spot , knowing that they and their families were safe from predators ?
The appeal of a natural environment brought Jean and me to our old house at a rural crossroads in the Finger Lakes , and then to our annual trips to the wilder regions of the Adirondacks , where we paddled a canoe — a surprise gift from Jean to me on a birthday at least 40 years ago — to campsites near rivers or on islands in ponds and lakes .
For years , those trips included only our youngest son .
After my namesake grew up and moved away , Cris — who had returned home simply because we had pasture for the herd of goats he had just bought — joined us .
In one of our barns , three canoes and a kayak are now gathering dust and swallow droppings , a testimony to the increasing number of family members who once accompanied us , sons and spouses or companions .
Difficult though it was for all three of our sons to adjust their work schedules to join us , they occasionally managed over the years to do that , Larry and Jim accompanied by wives or present companions .
Six years ago , during one of our last weeklong family outings , I became separated from the others and found myself lost in a vast Adirondack forest , wandering on a strange trail until darkness obscured even that path : the stars and even a crescent moon might have been shining , but in a forest like that , blackness seems absolute .
When our sons were younger , I sometimes felt helpless , as I ’ve recounted , to protect them from some unexpected danger ; now , as an octogenarian , I was helpless to protect myself .
Frightened as I was , I did n’t panic .
I sat down where I was , knowing I might never be found if I left the trail .
It was wholly my own fault that , in not returning with the others on the trail we ’d originally followed , I ’d not paid much attention to it then .
As elderly parents , though , Jean and I no longer were in charge : in a sense , our three adult sons were now acting as our parents , much as I once had felt myself to be my mother ’s father .
What I remember best from our extensive trek into the forest and up a small mountain for the sake of its vista was simply stopping with Jean to watch a squirrel that had found a mushroom .
It sniffed the fleshy part before peering under it , as if checking the gills for edibility .
Only then did it snip the mushroom from its stem and scamper away with that delicacy in its mouth .
Never before had we observed a squirrel behaving like a mycologist .
But now I was blind and beginning to shiver in the damp coolness of the night .
In my hand was a stout stick I had picked up to assist me over stones and up steep slopes ; every time I heard a nearby rustle , whether imagined or not , I raised it as a cudgel to ward off , say , a hungry bear or a pack of coyotes .
Under such conditions , any solitary person probably becomes the primitive creature still lurking in the human genetic makeup .
Improbable though it was at such a late hour , a group of other lost people permitted all of us to save ourselves .
I saw a flickering light in the distance and left the trail to grope my way toward it .
That faint light led me to six young men and women who apparently had never found the trail in the first place .
Burdened with an excessive amount of baggage — tents and sleeping bags , an ice chest , paper sacks of groceries , blankets , and coats intended for a winter in the Montreal they had come from — they were bewildered pilgrims in search of the campground they ’d been told was near the road .
Actually , it was at the end of the long trail I had taken by mistake .
With the aid of one of their flashlights , I was able to find the trail again .
Flashlights made all the difference from then on ; but it was midnight before we reached the campground , the trail now littered by all the objects my new companions had been too exhausted to carry any farther .
Near the campground was a ranger ’s station , its windows lit by a lantern .
I went there to report that I was no longer missing ; but the ranger had left to search for me in the woods .
However , two of my sons — Cris and Jim — were there , in case I showed up ; the rest of our party had returned to our van , hoping I might eventually find it .
It ’s odd to return from hours of mainly solitude in the dark to be reunited with two sons .
In the glow of the lantern , I was self - conscious , embarrassed that my errors had caused so many problems , but also acutely aware of the effect my sudden reappearance had on my sons .
Jean and I and Cris have lived so long together that each knows the foibles as well as the abilities of the others .
Cris seemed to expect that I ’d eventually turn up .
His eyes and gestures reflected his pleasure that I had , but he immediately became shy , as if participating in my embarrassment at demonstrating that I might no longer be a dependable parent .
Unlike Cris , our oldest and youngest sons had seen us in recent years only on these Adirondack vacations and during brief visits .
Whenever Jean and I had left from similar visits to my elderly parents , I worried that one or the other of them might not be alive for another reunion ; I imagine that Larry and Jim feel that way upon leaving us .
Here I momentarily digress :
On the white frame of the opening between our dining room and kitchen are faded dates in pencil that mark the heights of Jean and me and , over the years , those of our children as they approached and then far surpassed first her and then me .
Born so much later than the others , Jim ’s height starts out at the lowest marking , but the final one shows him inches above his brothers .
He has also become the most muscular of our sons .
But when this husky adult saw me , he began to cry .
He threw his arms around me , saying , “ I love you so much ! ”
Like my father ’s dreams , my ideal self is nothing but a desire ; for better or worse , I ’m unlike him in knowing my limitations .
I do n’t remember ever being in competition with anybody else , for my resolve comes from competition with the limits I ’ve discovered in myself and would blame , if I could , on genes I ’ve inherited .
So my son ’s response was the kind of blessing I ’d never expected — certainly not here , not yet .
As my father was dying , I was part of a chorus that told him we loved him : though the words are customary at such a crucial moment , in most cases they are truly felt , the grief reinforced by each mourner ’s awareness of her or his own inevitable end .
To my youngest son , though , it must have seemed that I had returned from the death he had imagined during the long hours of my absence .
In this exploration of my past for whatever understanding it can give me of my present self — probably my final attempt , though I ’ve believed that before — I ’ve touched upon questions beyond my competence to answer .
But the issues of chance , genetic inheritance , the relation between fathers and sons , and the debate between determinism and free will , important to human meaning as they are , fade into insignificance before the most encompassing paradox that I know : death , that great opponent of life and ultimate victor over it , is also responsible for all the values of life that we struggle to rescue from it .
Without mortality — that is , if we lived forever , uncaring of the ticking of clocks — would we have need of religion , of families with children for a new generation , of dreams for a better future ?
Would n’t scientists lose their urgency to discover , artists to create ?
Without my ever - keener awareness of Jean ’s and my mortality , I certainly would n’t be writing this account in my 87th year .
And what about love ?
As lyrical expressions , sonnets typically represent the poet ’s personal emotions .
One sonnet in particular , by Shakespeare , moves both Jean and me ; I liked it as a graduate student , but not in the way I do today .
The first - person narrator acknowledges that life , like a fire , is consumed by the source nourishing it , and tells his beloved in the concluding couplet , “ This thou perceiv’st , which makes thy love more strong , / To love that well which thou must leave ere long . ”
That ’s the best summation I ’m capable of making .

The Memoirs of a Jewish Anarchist by Z Magazine

A Review of ' Forty Years in the Struggle ; The Memoirs of a Jewish Anarchist , ' by Chaim Leib Weinberg ; English Translation by Naomi Cohen ; Edited by Robert Helms ; Litwin Books , 2008 .
Forty Years in the Struggle : The Memoirs of a Jewish Anarchist
Book Review by Hans Bennett
( Z Magazine , July / August 2009 )
The “ Old City ” neighborhood of Philadelphia is renowned for its many historic sites related to the “ founding fathers ” and the US colonial era .
Yet , very few know about this same neighborhood ’s significant anarchist history .
Since 1997 , local historian Robert Helms has led an “ Anarchist Historical Walking Tour ” that presents this history of resistance from the poor and working classes , who viewed the rhetoric about “ American Democracy ” as a fraud , and organized themselves to challenge the power of the ruling class .
Helms is the editor of the just - released English translation of Chaim Leib Weinberg ’s ( 1869-1939 ) autobiography : Forty Years in the Struggle ; The Memoirs of a Jewish Anarchist .
Weinberg ’s autobiography was originally written in Yiddish and released in 1952 .
It is written by Marcus Graham , and is based on Graham ’s four weeks of conversation with Weinberg in 1930 .
Described by fellow anarchist Emma Goldman as “ an eloquent Yiddish agitator , ” Weinberg never wrote or published a word , but gave thousands of speeches -- all in Yiddish .
Helms writes in the book ’s introduction that Weinberg “ was an incredible orator and story teller : these were the talents that set him apart from most of his contemporaries . ”
Helms notes that “ during Weinberg ’s heyday , Jews accounted for the majority of Philadelphia ’s anarchists , ” and the book “ presents a side of Philadelphia ’s Jewish life and social movements that has , until now , been unavailable in English . ”
Weinberg was born in Tshekhanovtse , Grodne Province in Russia .
He first left and moved to London when he was 18 , following his mother ’s death .
He returned several years later , but at 21 , he moved to the United States , where he struggled to support himself as a peddler and eventually returned to Russia nine months later , where his father arranged a marriage for him , but Weinberg writes that the “ matchmaking proved to be worse than my suffering in England and America . ”
Subsequently , he moved back to the US and learned cigar - making , a job he continued throughout his life .
He first worked in North Carolina , where he soon became involved in organizing a union , got a taste of public speaking , and was introduced to the writings of the German anarchist Johan Most , whose writings and speeches influenced him greatly .
Weinberg soon moved to New York City where he got a job at a union shop making cigars for $ 10 / week , but soon ended up in Philadelphia , where he continued cigar - making , and helped organize the city ’s first Jewish bakers union and the first Jewish cigar - makers union .
Weinberg became very involved in public debates and helped to form a new group founded by workers , called the “ Knights of Liberty , ” with which Weinberg writes that “ the history of the Jewish anarchist movement in Philadelphia truly began . ”
Weekly public forums were organized and speakers were brought from New York and elsewhere .
Weinberg also became involved in organizing the first Jewish cooperative organization in the US , called “ The Workers Cooperative Society ” that was a “ non-partisan workers movement , where workers from all political persuasions and directions would be able to take part . ”
They started a cooperative shoe and hat store that was so successful that they quickly opened a cooperative bank as well , but their success soon made them the target of the established storekeepers , who worked to discredit them by spreading rumors that “ gradually began to accomplish their goal . ”
Eventually these projects , as well as a cooperative bakery failed , breaking the hearts of Weinberg and others .
He also became involved in several housing cooperative experiments that eventually failed – due mostly to infighting among the participants .
Alongside editor Robert Helms ’ 205 new annotations supplementing Weinberg ’s original memoirs are several essays written by those who knew him , including one from 1939 by Samuel Polinow , who describes Weinberg ’s speaking style : “ Rather than to illustrate by scientific facts the functioning of an anarchist society as laid down by authors of anarchist philosophy , he employed a most unique and simple method to convince his listeners of its possibility .
He spoke to them as man to man .
To a group of bakers he would say ‘ Do you think a senator is as useful to society as any one of you bakers ? ’
And to the needle workers : ‘ Do you think a governor could make as good a pair of pants as you can ? ’
And to others : ‘ Do you need a policeman to tell you when to go to sleep ? ’ ”
Another supplemental essay written by Abraham Frumkin in 1940 is reprinted from In the Spring of Jewish Socialism .
In 1897 , Frumkin and other anarchist organizers brought Weinberg to London for a speaking tour that began at a large hall in “ in the middle of London ’s Jewish quarter ” that was packed with 600 people .
At first sight , Frumkin writes that the crowd was not impressed by “ his gait , his figure , and perhaps also his smooth , bald head , ” but after he “ got up from his chair and started to address the audience , all eyes were fixed on him , as if they suddenly saw another person entirely …
I sat and thought :
Here I am hearing for the first time someone who is not speaking from a book and repeating ideas gotten from newspapers , pamphlets and books . ”
The memoirs ’ conclusion spotlights Weinberg ’s philosophical side where he writes : “ I am certain that the anarchist ideology will become a reality in the very near future .
This is not because anarchism has become a dogma for me , but rather this comes from my observations of human behavior … there is an innate instinct for freedom . ”
He argues that “ government and the state arose ” to maintain “ economic inequality ” and will be unnecessary in a society with economic justice .
“ Since we know from science that nothing is permanent — from the fact , for example , that slavery ended — therefore the era of economic slavery must come to an end . ”
He argues that the anarchist movement must “ build up our whole philosophy on the voluntary uniting of workers .
This is not a utopia , because we see that tens of millions of people are organized into unions , lodges , and other associations — without prisons , soldiers , barracks , police , judges , and so forth …
The same thing can happen , in a greater measure , in all phases of social and political life , and this is my social ideal . ”
“ How do we come to the realization of anarchism ?
We must organize the worker as a producer through the unions , and as a consumer through cooperatives …
The anarchist - communist doctrine is an international doctrine .
It is not just for one race or one nation , so our message must be brought wherever oppressed people are found …
We anarchists should bring the ideology of a future anarchist society to the masses .
And these very masses , together under our influence , will initiate the worldwide social revolution and begin building the new society . ”

Hello all – this is Matt signing in .
Perhaps , like me , you ’re beginning a new semester studying Chinese , or else you ’re wondering whether or not you should start .
That ’s the easy part - go for it !
Whether you ’re living and working in China or are planning to do so at some point , learning Chinese will give you an invaluable window into this maddening , beguiling , enormous , and amazing country .
So , let ’s say you ’ve decided to learn the language .
Great !
But before you begin ( or even if you already have ) , I ’d like to impart a few suggestions on top of what Tam recently contributed .
In particular , here are a few pointers in the form of fallacies that you should avoid if you want to study Chinese successfully .
These fallacies I know well for one reason only : I used to follow them all myself .
1 . I do n’t need to learn how to read and write - I just want to learn how to speak .
Most of us figured out pretty early on that in Chinese , the oral and written languages are somewhat separate .
We also reason that because Chinese characters seem impossible to learn , it would make sense to tackle the oral language first and then worry about characters later , if at all .
Sounds reasonable , does n’t it ?
Alas , it is n’t really true .
Chinese characters really are n’t that hard to learn ( those eight year olds who shout “ hello ! ” to you on the street all can read ) and come quickly provided you practice enough .
Also , what you do n’t know when you begin studying is how the oral and written languages intersect , and how a basic understanding of Chinese characters enables you to remember words far easier than if you relied solely on memory or pinyin .
If you ’re starting school and are worried about your Japanese and Korean classmates being light years ahead of you with characters , do n’t worry – you will catch up much faster than you realized provided you do your homework !
In any case – learn characters , even if you think they ’re impossible .
You might find , as I did , that they ’re actually quite a bit of fun .
2 . Tones are n’t important - I just need to get words in the right context
Tones , dreaded tones .
Not only are you asked to remember new words that have no relation whatsoever to English , you also have to remember their tones !
For new students , tones are a major hassle and most try to pretend that they do n’t exist .
After all , every day you hear Chinese people babbling away at warp speed and they do n’t seem to be using tones !
If they do n’t need them , why do we have to learn them ?
First , no languages ( except Henry Kissingerian ) are atonal .
If you tried asking the cute girl or guy in your class out for a date in toneless English , you ’ll get ( at best ) a blank stare .
As we know , the same word spoken with a different tone of voice can have a completely different meaning .
Think of the word “ right ” , for example .
Depending on how it ’s spoken , it can mean either “ correct ” or “ you ’re pulling my leg ” .
In Chinese , tones have the challenging feature of changing the entire meaning of a word .
Get the tones wrong , and you ’ll be saying something completely different from what you intended .
Most Chinese people are clever enough to figure out what you mean based on context , but confusion still happens .
If your goal is to learn Chinese , then why not try to speak the language correctly ?
After all , in Chinese the same sounds spoken in different tones are regarded as unique words , and screwing them up means you ’re not communicating nearly as effectively as you ’d like .
Rather than trying to devise complicated methods of avoiding tones , learning them actually is much easier than you think , and after awhile saying a word with the correct tones becomes second nature .
3 . I just need to learn how to identify ## ## characters - then I can read a newspaper .
For some reason , a lot of people believe that if you can master a certain number of characters ( a few thousand or so ) then you ’ll be able to get the gist of a typical article in a Chinese newspaper .
This , alas , is a myth .
Granted , if you do know several thousand characters , you ’ll probably be able to read quite a lot - but that ’s putting the cart in front of the horse .
Let me explain .
Most Chinese words are made up of combinations of two or more individual characters , characters that have meaning in and of themselves .
For example , you might know that the word 机 means something like “ machine ” and that 会 has to do with “ ability ” , but you still might not know ( unless you ’re a genius with lateral thinking ) that 机会 means “ opportunity ” .
There are countless other examples of whole phrases or sentences comprised of simple characters that are nonetheless somewhat difficult to understand entirely .
The Chinese language is pretty logical , but learning characters in isolation wo n’t do the trick .
So while you might be looking forward to boasting about how many characters you know ( as if you could ever be sure in the first place ) , forget about it .
It ’s the words that matter , not the characters .
To sum up my advice in a few pithy words , shortcuts do n’t work .
I ’ve found that only by studying the language very methodically am I able to retain what I have learned , and while writing the same character fifty times in your notebook or reading the same sentence aloud over and over might be tedious , it really does pay off in the long run .
Good luck !
A fire that has burned more than 75,000 acres in Santa Barbara County over the last week was started in an illegal marijuana growing area operated by a Mexican drug organization , authorities said .
Authorities said they confirmed that the blaze , which is burning out of control , started in a cooking area of the pot farm .
They believe those responsible are still in the forest area trying leave the forest by foot .
" The Santa Barbara County Sheriff ’s Narcotics Unit has confirmed that the camp at the origin of the fire was an illegal marijuana operation believed to be run by a Mexican national drug organization , " according to a statement from the Los Padres National Forest .
" The Narcotics Unit has been working in the area within the last month eradicating other nearby marijuana cultivation sites . "
The location of those who ran the pot farm is n't known , but forest officials warn " not to approach anyone who looks suspicious but to instead contact the nearest law enforcement agency . "
The fire , known as the La Brea fire , is now 25 % contained .
Vicki Collins , a fire information spokeswoman at Los Padres , said that although the La Brea fire was only 10 % contained by Friday night , firefighters successfully charred some lines in front of the fire in the Tepusquet Canyon area , depriving the blaze of new fuel .
@TopHatProfessor Layton ’s first tweet on June 29 , 2009 read : “ Frankly … I ’m ashamed .
I have made myself a Twitter page and officially joined the world of technology .
Perhaps Luke may help me update . ”
And with these words , TopHatProfessor , a Nintendo DS game character became a hit on Twitter .
The TopHatProfessor would tweet about brainteasers , riddles , and even answer questions from his followers , all without breaking stride .
Many were quick to conclude that this might be a clever marketing campaign by the people at Nintendo .
In truth , though , this Twitter account was the work of Roger DiLuigi , a college student / game journalist who felt that Nintendo was n’t giving enough attention to the game ’s US release .
But wait , it does n’t stop here .
On July 1 , Luke , the apprentice of Layton , was also introduced into the Twitterverse .
And on July 6 , Don Paolo , Layton ’s known arch - nemesis , challenged him with the hardest puzzles there ever is in the story on Twitterverse .
However , this interesting Twitter story came to an end when DiLuigi revealed to himself to his followers after realizing that he might be in for some trouble as Nintendo did n’t give him permission to do this .

Football is a pastime generally enjoyed by a large part of the English population .
The industry has a turnover of billions of pounds per year and it is played by professionals and amateurs alike .
It is the most popular sport in schools and it is a great game for competition but also for learning cooperation and teamwork .
Children generally enjoy it — and aside from the sport and competition aspects , it is also a great leisure activity and promotes very high levels of fitness .
During the World Cup , or even to a lesser extent events like the FA Cup and the League Cup , there is the opportunity for bonding among fans and a greater sense of unity overall , whether gathered at the game or just watching it on a big screen down the local pub .
A lot of British people often wonder why Americans refer to the English version of football as soccer .
The funniest thing is that soccer is originally a British word .
Although it would be easy to assume that the Americans gave a different name to the game to separate it from their own gridiron football , known as American Football in the UK , this actually is reasonably close but is not the whole truth .
A little bit of the history of the games from England and their naming should be considered in order to uncover the full story .
There were originally two forms of football in England : rugby football , which is much closer but not quite the same as American football , and association football , which is the game that is usually referred to as just football .
Also in England , these two games were given slang names .
Rugby football was known colloquially as “ ruggers ” , and the slang term for association football was simply “ assoc . ” .
That later developed into “ soccer ” as this was easier to say .
These names are generally not used anymore .
When this modern form of association football moved to the US , the Americans needed to differentiate between the gridiron football they already played and the new football from England .
That ’s why they adopted the English slang name for the game and called it soccer .
The main reason for the persistent confusion is simply that in England , the term used now is just football , as rugby football is just known as rugby ( which itself is further subdivided into rugby league and rugby union ) .
Therefore , in England it ’s football , and in America it ’s soccer .
This may be confusing but the multiple names are necessary nonetheless .
These days the game is still a secondary sport in America , lagging behind the likes of baseball and NFL football .
However , the game is slowly growing with supporters and becoming more popular than it has ever been in the past .
Some big names in British football have recently moved to America to train teams and players for events like the World Cup , thus making people somewhat more enthusiastic about the game .
But obviously , it will never be able to compete with the national sports .
There ’s a lot on the line for Kobe , LeBron , Melo and Dwight Howard
Duh .
There ’s always a lot on the line in the Conference Finals .
But this year it seems like there is more at stake for the superstars still standing .
Let ’s start with …
KOBE
Kobe Bryant has made it abundantly clear that his # 1 priority is to win another title .
This focus is not unusual for players that have n’t won a ring , but Kobe has three , so why is he so determined to win a fourth ?
Simply stated , for the sake of his own legacy , he has to win a title without Shaq .
If he fails , he will be viewed by history as a great player who won a few titles as Shaq ’s sidekick .
This is not the legacy that Kobe wants to leave .
Barring a two - or three - peat , he ’s not going to be able to catch Michael Jordan , but if he is able to win a ring this year — and he ’s the first to admit that this is his best chance — then he ’ll do it as “ The Guy ” on a championship team .
There ’s no Shaq wreaking havoc in the middle , just a collection of players deemed too soft ( Pau Gasol , Lamar Odom ) or too young ( Andrew Bynum , Jordan Farmar , Trevor Ariza ) that Kobe led to the Promised Land .
And the clock is ticking .
Kevin Garnett could come back strong next season , LeBron is getting better by the year , and there are a few up - and - coming teams ( Orlando , Houston , Portland , etc. ) that are looking to knock Kobe off of his perch .
The time is now .
Kobe ’s window is closing , and he knows it .
LEBRON
By the time you read this , the Cavs might have already been eliminated from these playoffs .
If so , expect columnists to come out of the woodwork across the country to once again pose the question — will LeBron stay ?
Sorry Cavs fans , I know you thought you were in the clear , but if your team is unable to come back and win this series , it ’s a valid question .
LeBron and Co. had a great season , but it does n’t mean much if they do n’t make a Finals appearance .
While a loss to the Lakers on the biggest of stages would be disappointing , it would be understandable .
But being ousted by the Jameer Nelson - less Magic in the Conference Finals ?
This is not a scenario that LeBron saw coming .
Not until now , anyway .
It would be one thing if LeBron was having a substandard series and could realistically put the blame on his own shoulders .
If that were the case , he could convince himself that his supporting cast is strong enough to win an NBA championship .
But LeBron has had a wonderful series , averaging 42.3 points , 7.3 assists , 7.3 rebounds , while shooting almost 51 % from the field .
Sure , his turnovers have been high ( 4.5 per game , up from 3.0 during the regular season ) , but with the way his supporting cast has played , he has to carry his team .
Removing LeBron ’s hits and misses , the rest of the Cavs have shot a combined 41 % from the field .
Mo Williams , who was brought in to take the pressure off of the Cavs ’ superstar , is shooting just over 32 % in the series , and those are mostly good looks .
Delonte
West ’s three - point accuracy is down from 40 % in the regular season to 29 % in the Conference Finals .
In fact , the Cavs ’ role player numbers are down across the board .
They ’re playing like the future of the franchise depends on it .
( And it might . )
MELO
Carmelo Anthony has had kind of a funny NBA career .
He won a national championship as a freshman at Syracuse , but that ’s overlooked because it was n’t until this season that he was able to lead the Nuggets out of the first round of the playoffs , and even then more credit is given to Chauncey Billups for being “ the perfect fit ” in Denver .
It ’s easy to forget that , as a rookie , Anthony led a Nuggets team that won 17 games the previous year to a 43 - win season and a sixth - place finish in the West .
He ’s known as one of the league ’s best scorers , but people question his willingness to play defense and do the little things it takes to win .
Battling a bad back and ankle pain , Anthony has put those concerns to rest , at least for me .
Until he makes a Finals appearance , he ’s going to play in the shadow of ’03 classmates LeBron James and Dwyane Wade , who have both done more in the same amount of time in the league .
Is Anthony a “ franchise ” player deserving of a max contract ?
I had my doubts before these playoffs , but the way he competed in the first two games of this series , posting 30 + points while guarding Kobe most of the time , he sure looked like a franchise player .
There ’s no telling what kind of toll those aforementioned injuries are having on his effectiveness , though it might explain why he was unable to stop the bleeding when the Lakers went on a 23 - 5 run in Game 5 .
The jury is probably still out on Melo , but I ’d be willing to build my franchise around him .
Never underestimate a player who has something to prove .
DWIGHT HOWARD
Note :
Even though it was his nickname in high school , after a few complaints , I wo n’t call him D - Ho anymore .
This guy really needs a better nickname than “ Superman . ”
Players like Dwight Howard are a dying breed .
He ’s a true back - to - the - basket center in a league that has become more guard - and wing - oriented in recent years .
At 23 , he ’s already the second - best center ( at least ) in the NBA , and I think most GMs would take him in a heartbeat over Yao Ming given the latter ’s long injury history .
The only area where Howard suffers is in his profile around the league .
No one argues that he ’s one of the NBA ’s true superstars , yet from a notoriety standpoint , he ’s not in the same league as Kobe , LeBron or even D - Wade ( with all of those T - Mobile commercials ) .
Right now , he ’s known as a physical freak who can dunk like a madman .
These Conference Finals have put Howard front and center on a national ( basic cable ) stage , but there are still times when he disappears .
Everyone remembers his outstanding performance in the overtime of Game 4 ( 10 points and a key block on LeBron ) , but where was he in the fourth quarter when he only scored one point ?
Howard ’s issues are n’t new .
As a big man in the post , he ’s forced to rely on his teammates to give him the ball .
In crunch time , it ’s tougher for a post player to get the ball than it is for a wing due to the nature of the pass .
Defenses will usually allow Kobe or LeBron catching the ball out near midcourt , but they ’re going to fight a lot harder to keep Howard from getting the ball on the block .
The other issue is his free throw accuracy ( or lack thereof ) .
Since he shoots under 60 % from the charity stripe , teams would rather put him on the line down the stretch than let him go to work in the post .
Howard ’s game is all about power , so he ’s not able to avoid fouls like Tim Duncan can or Hakeem Olajuwon could with their finesse post up games .
Still , if Howard and the Magic can put the Cavs away and make a Finals appearance , it ’s going to be a big boost for his reputation around the league .
He will become just as valuable as Wade and start to approach Kobe and LeBron in potential impact on the league ( not to mention the positive effect it will have on his Q Score ) .
Hal Goldman , 79 , who retired 22 years ago from Sears , Roebuck & Company , echoed that sentiment .
“ What they ’re trying to do  Obama is  is take from the senior citizens and give to the poor and the illegal immigrants , ” Mr. Goldman said “ It ’s hurting the senior citizens who worked all their lives .
Because of their age , like in Canada , you ’ll have to wait six months for an M.R.I . ”
In fact , the health care bills circulating in Congress would not extend coverage to illegal immigrants , though they could reduce some of the choices that Medicare beneficiaries now enjoy .
In last year ’s election , voters 60 and older were the only age group to support Senator John McCain of Arizona , the Republican nominee .
But that was not the case here in Broward County , which was critical to the Democratic victory in Florida .
In the nine precincts that make up Sunrise Lakes , which is dominated by elderly Jewish transplants from the urban North , three of every four votes went to Mr. Obama .
That makes it particularly striking that there is such anxiety here about Democratic health care initiatives .
Although the opinion is far from universal , some Obama supporters said they were regretting , or at least reassessing , their choice .
“ I voted for President Obama , and I ’m not ashamed to say that I ’m sorry now because I do n’t trust what he ’s saying , ” said Elaine Carl , 71 , president of recreation at the development ’s Phase 4 .
“ I think they ’re going to take away from Medicare .
I really do . ”
On Tuesday night , at three poker tables set up in the clubhouse lobby , disagreements over health care temporarily interrupted the kvetching about the broken air conditioning .
Remember Howdy Jindal 's abysmal response to President Obama ?
Well , he 's back with more hackery .
You thought Bobby Jindal would have given the ACORN bashing a little more thought , but you see , he 's a Stepford Republican , so they all are programmed to give similar responses to conservative stimuli .
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal ( R ) is trying to shore up his anti-ACORN bona fides .
The New Orleans Times - Picayune reports today that Jindal issued an executive order barring state funds from going to the community organizing group .
However , there ’s one small kink in Jindal ’s plan : Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal issued an executive order to keep any state money from going to the controversy - wracked Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now , which has its national headquarters in New Orleans .
According to the state ’s Division of Administration , no state agencies have existing contracts with ACORN .
Wonkette : Bobby Jindal Also Cuts Off Non-Existent Funding To Those ACORN Blacks
Right wing websites respond in kind .
Bobby Jindal Halts Funding Of ACORN
UPDATE : Chad Bower of WWLTV.com contacted me earlier and said that two contracts were just discovered that allegedly would pay state funds to ACORN :
The Department of Social Services has identified two contracts that would allegedly have given ACORN federal and state funds under a tax assistance program , and the Governor 's Office has told the department to halt that funding .
{}
The two contracts – one for Southeast Louisiana , lead by Total Community Action , Inc. , and the other for Southwest Louisiana , lead by the United Way of Southwest Louisiana – included ACORN as a part of the two groups proposals for the 2009 – 2010 tax season , said Frank Collins , a spokesman with the Governo 's Office .
Collins said the proposals included ACORN in the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program , and the group would have received federal funds under the program .
Because the contract states that state funds would match the federal funds under the program , the program was in violation of Jindal ’s recent executive order .
Collins said the DSS will contact the two coalitions Tuesday and tell them that funding would have to be severed to ACORN because of Jindal ’s recent executive order .
I want to thank Chad for emailing me so I could update the story .
My post was based on the information that was available at the time and since new news has surfaced I 've updated the post .
He 's still not a bright bulb .
Cuba , in the grip of a serious economic crisis , is running short of toilet paper and may not get sufficient supplies until the end of the year , officials with state - run companies said .
Officials said they were lowering the prices of 24 basic goods to help Cubans get through the difficulties provoked in part by the global financial crisis and three destructive hurricanes that struck the island last year .
Cuba 's financial reserves have been depleted by increased spending for imports and reduced export income , which has forced the communist - led Government to take extraordinary measures to keep the economy afloat .
" The corporation has taken all the steps so that at the end of the year there will be an important importation of toilet paper , " an official with state conglomerate Cimex said on state - run Radio Rebelde .
The shipment will enable the state - run company " to supply this demand that today is presenting problems , " he said .
Cuba both imports toilet paper and produces its own , but does not currently have enough raw materials to make it , he said .
One of the measures taken to address the cash crunch is a 20 per cent cut in imports , which in recent days has become evident in the reduction of goods in state - run stores .
Cuba imports about 60 per cent of its food .
Despite the shortages , prices will be cut between 5 per cent and 27 per cent for some food , drugs and personal hygiene products , officials said .
A visit to a store in Havana 's Vedado neighbourhood on Friday found that prices had dropped for mayonnaise , barbecue sauce and canned squid .
One customer , who gave his name only as Pedro , complained that " it does n't look like prices have been lowered for the fundamental products " such as cooking oil .
Ana Maria Ortega , deputy director for military - run retail conglomerate TRD Caribe , said there will be no shortage of basic goods .
" The conditions are in place to maintain the supply of essential products , " she said on the same radio program .
Cubans receive a subsidised food ration from the government each month that they say meets their needs for about two weeks .
President Raul Castro told the National Assembly last week that the Government had cut its spending budget for the second time this year and has been renegotiating its debt and payments with foreign providers .
Cuba has long blamed the 47 - year - old US trade embargo against the island for many of its economic problems .
It also said that last year 's hurricanes did $ US10 billion worth of damage that forced the Government to spend heavily on imports of food and reconstruction products .
Castro , who replaced his ailing older brother Fidel Castro as president last year , also has complained that Cuba 's productivity is too low .
He has taken various steps to boost output , including putting more state - owned land in private hands and pushing for salaries to be based on productivity .

This is what chimpy was refering to when he talked about having to say things " over and over " to " catapult the propaganda . "
What he left out , however , was that he ( cheney , amdministration officials , and pundits ) actually " catapult " the propaganda by picking up the endless repetitions as " facts " , creating an echo - chamber .
For the lives of most American 's today , dismissing anything other than Oswald did it alone is a " conspiracy theory " and the media dutifully " catapults " that propaganda with an endless series of dishonest books , " experts " and now computer simulations ( animating lies ) .
The term is used to marginalize people , prevent an open dialog , and to lump the folks that believe in reptillian rulers into the same categories as those that question why thermite was found in the WTC dust .
Yet another example of the blatant lies from the mainstream media .
Acknowledging that we get an endless stream of propaganda from newpapers , TV , and radio is important , but more important are the dialogs and truth that this propaganda is meant to silence .
And even when we do have a dialog about it , ( which is extremely rare even in the self - proclaimed " liberal " / " progressive " bloggosphere , it means nothing without organized economic action .
The only vote we really can count on being counted accurately today are the dollars we spend .

In a manner reminiscent to the incineration of inconvenient data placed in " memory holes " by the fictional Winston Smith in 1984 's Ministry of Truth , the pollsters “ corrected ” the exit polls in order to reconcile them with the official results .
The original “ uncorrected ” exit poll numbers , which had been “ available on CNN.com ” but “ never broadcast on TV ” simply vanished , replaced by the “ corrected ” exit poll results .
Replace the Orwellian word " corrected " with the accurate word " changed " .
Also replace " uncorrected " with " unchanged " .

Lest this opinion piece be misconstrued , my purpose is not to advance , as fact , any of the theories that provide the basis for this editorial .
I have as much problem with self - described " truthers " who leap to a conclusion on the basis of incomplete factual data as I do with those who would shut the door on scientific inquiry of pivotal events through resort to the " conspiracy theorist " label .
It is the essence of the scientific method that all theories , including the " official " version of an event , should be subjected to objective examination ; modified or even abandoned if the results of that examination warrant an alteration of the original theory .
Where is the " scientific method " which proves the government 's official 9/11 story ?
There are hundreds of unanswered questions about the " official government " 9/11 story .
There was NOT " scientific method " used in proving the " official " story .
Where is it ?

The charge " conspiracy theorist ! " is invoked often whenever anybody begins to question orthodox , mainstream media ( MSM ) propaganda concerning major events that have significant political and economic ramifications .
There are , of course , many irresponsible and lunatic speculations supported by little , if any evidence .
These help to discredit the many responsible questioners of orthodoxy .
( I think that they are sometimes deliberately propagated to more easily discredit the more well - founded and supported conspiracy theories . )
On the other hand , there are whistleblowers and insiders who have provided substantial circumstantial , and even some direct evidence , that flies in the face of the " official " story propagated ( usually very vigorously ) by the MSM surrounding momentous social / political events , such as assassinations and provocations to war .
Anyone who is aware of the history of crime in this country knows just how complex and sophisticated conspiracies can be perpetrated upon the public , even without much assistance from the MSM .
( See investigative journalist Jonathan Kwitney 's book Vicious Circles , for instance . )
If people were more aware of these very real and proven criminal conspiracies , the conspiracy theories proposed to explain the mysterious , politically significant events would not appear so far - fetched .
The Mafia has created thriving rackets --- corrupting public officials and law enforcement in the process --- that render important sectors of our legit economy uncompetitive ( " waste management , " trucking , the meat industry come immediately to mind ) , not to mention the illicit industries of narcotics , prostitution , child pornography , gambling , etc .
In fact , there have been significant social connections among the Mafia / organized crime in this country and prominent public officials ( elected and unelected ) including law enforcement , and the executive management and major shareholders of large corporations ( especially those doing business across national borders ) .
Another investigative journalist , James Bamford , uncovered the conspiracy and false flag plans of Gen .
Lemnitzer and the our country 's top military planners working for the Joint Chiefs of Staff to create a phony pretext for an invasion of Cuba back in the early 1960's , called Operation Northwoods .
Fortunately , JFK dismissed the proposals that would have amounted to an " inside job " --- proposals that ominously echo just the sort of mysterious operations we saw on 9/11/2001 .

To Dan , and to the rest of the " truther " community : I really do n't have a problem with criticism , but I think it would be of immense value if you actually read and digested what I wrote before blasting away .
1 . The Orwellian " correction " of the 2004 exit polls did not come from me .
It came from the pollsters who performed the exit polls .
The pollsters said they " corrected " the data .
I 've added a footnote so as to clear up any misconceptions .
2 . I never suggested that I am convinced by the " official " accounts of any of these three historically pivotal events , but , especially with the " truther " thesis , I am also not satisfied that the evidence is sufficient to warrant the conclusion that 9/11 was an " inside job . "
My legal training and 31 years of legal practice have created what I believe is a healthy , scientific skepticism .
The " truther " movement has raised a great deal of , shall we say , " circumstantial " evidence which raises significant questions about that event --- questions which warrant an open , impartial and full investigation .
But it is a quantum leap to go from questions or suspicions , to a positive conclusion that 9/11 was , " in fact , " an " inside job . "
If my unwillingness to take a blind leap of faith into the realm of a potential false positive makes me a " dumbass " in your eyes ---
Well , so be it .
Sincerely , Ernest A. Canning

Ernie , I think it was most manly and lucid of you to post this , but Truthers are not quite as out there on some of this as the lawyerly experience might be telling you .
It has been established that a very fancy incendiary , not commercially available , was in the mountains of dust from the demolitions .
Before that was shown , however , we have always had the videos and the speed with which all three WTC buildings were leveled .
The laws of physics do not admit of any other conclusion but that the buildings were prepared in advance by demolition experts to perform as they did .
So there very obviously can be no realistic conclusion that does n't make it an inside job of some sort .
It may not have been * and Fudd , or even any of their buddies , but it had to be people with very high level connections to get those materials and to get clandestine access to set the cutting charges and paint on the nanothermite ... or however they applied it .
In fact , beside the awful " dancing Israelis " episode , some people feel it may have been people with high level connections in Israel , and who got access through the owner of the complex ... just in order to think of how it might plausibly be that this was not totally a self - inflicted wound .
The part that nixes that theory for me is the fact that they shot a missile into the Pentagon ... and so I 'm pretty sure if no one in DC was in on it , that could n't have happened .
It 's just not at all as outlandish as it seems if you are not conversant with the stuff that 's already been established as fact .
Yes , we want it established by the authorities , but they wo n't do that .
So it has been left to men and women of good will to do the best we can with the evidence they left us .
It would have been optimal if they did n't so swiftly destroy the crime scenes , but there has been plenty of evidence left extant anyway , and professionals are on it .
We may never be able to get it investigated and adjudicated by the " authorities " , but Truthers are not all just maniacs going off half cocked .
People are plenty steamed and used to having to get vivid to get attention , so try not to take the insults personally .
This has been more frustrating than most sane people can bear without blowing their lids ... and most of them do n't have the decades ' experience in never blowing their lids like you do .
So we may seem like wild animals , but , really , many or even most of us are just in a more natural state with the frustration management stuff than lawyers are .
Culture shock .
I know .
Yep .
I so totally know .
And thank you again for this post .

Oh , and , maybe the collapse of building seven speed has been revised up since I looked last , but I could swear that it was six point seven seconds ...?
Of course , there are slightly different times on these due to the pyroclastic flows at the bases obscuring the views for timing , and some did n't bother to take the mean on the various videos , but even the very slowest allowable computation still is very far within the range where only resistance being exploded out from under can account for the speed .
There is absolutely no way jet fuel , or the combination of jet fuel and impact weakness , could have accomplished it .

Hey , Ernie , if I remember correctly , this is a pretty good episode of Guns and Butter , from about three years ago , before the definitive proof of the " thermitic material " , but I know about this stuff because I went through all the depositions known as " oral histories " once to pull out all the testimony relating to explosions and burning metal .
That was what sucked me in so hard I could never swim back out again .
They brought me directly back into the disaster ... five years later .
But after diving in for so many uninterrupted hours , I emerged with bodies splatting on the street next to me and caked with the toxic dust and clinging to strangers for dear life and being knocked down by the hot blasts at street level .
It made it real .
Way more real than as completely real as it already felt to me .
Reading these depositions will take you there .
[ Actually , they 're better called " oral histories " because that 's what they turned into .
They started out as formal depositions , but turned into people pretty much just telling all they remembered while a court reporter was taking it down ... just being stopped for the occasional question near the juicy bits ....]
I already knew most of it , but those testimonies took me there , made me one of them .
This stuff takes hours and hours and hours and weeks and months and maybe years to look into and satisfy yourself about the facts , and so just speaking in favor of an open investigation is Truther enough for most people .
And , yet again , thank you for this post .

I would love to see someone try to prove that those 3 buildings collapsed in any other possible way except by controlled demolition .
They cant , they do n't even pretend to try because they know it would be like trying to prove the Earth is n't a sphere .
The " scientific method " HAS been used in most 9/11 truth information .
I defy anybody to name even ONE thing that has been proven about the " Official Conspiracy Theory " .
8th grade physics is all it takes to prove those 3 buildings collapsed due to high explosives & Thermate .
When I started blogging in forums about this back in January of 2002 I was shouted down and banned constantly for even mentioning the possibility that 9/11 was an inside job .
Today it is those blinded by mainstream media lies and cover ups that are the ones shouted down , the tables have completely turned .
You put up a poll on virtually any site asking the question " Do you believe the US government was involved in the events of 9/11 " ?
and it will always be over 85 % YES unless you are on some wing nut site like Free Republic or DKos.
9/11 truth represents at least 50 % of the population today and that mind you is with a total media black out of any valid information and an active propaganda campaign covering up the facts about the 9/11 .

It is therefore , an un-democratic phenomenon and needs to be attacked as such .

What I said , 99 , was that " scientific evidence which suggests that controlled demolition may provide a plausible explanation for the sudden ( 8.7 second ) collapse of WTC - 7 into its own footprint " has been " swept aside with the mere utterance of the words ' conspiracy theory . ' "
That " scientific evidence " includes the presence of thermite , the speed and manner of the sudden collapse and the " depositions " you refer to , all of which represent " circumstantial " evidence that make controlled demolition a " plausible explanation . "
Circumstantial evidence can be powerful but it must be distinguished from " direct " evidence .
If one advanced the notion that planes struck WTC - 1 & WTC - 2 or that bullets struck JFK , there are films which provide " direct " evidence that those events occurred .
But when you move on to either the question of whether the planes caused the towers to collapse or whether a bullet caused JFK 's death , additional scientific evidence is required .
In the case of JFK , that evidence came by way of an autopsy , though the actual findings remain , to this day , a matter of controversy .
The handwritten report from a physician from Parkland Memorial , which was still posted on a wall when I visited Dealy Plaza a couple of years ago , suggests an entry wound to the forehead .
For 9/11 , there was no immediate , post - event inspection by relevant experts that would have been the engineering equivalent to an autopsy .
We are left with competing theories .
It is one thing to say that either the Warren Commission report , with its pristine bullet , or the 9/11 Commission Report , which had relied upon evidence obtained by torture , were fatally flawed ; quite another to jump from that position to a conclusion that ( a ) the CIA killed JFK or ( b ) 9/11 was an " inside job . "
In the case of JFK , I do believe that Mark Lane made out a very compelling case --- a case that included the sworn testimony of Marita Lorenz .
Lorenz testified that she , Sturgis and a number of other specifically named individuals , which included Orlando Bosch * , traveled in a two - car caravan , loaded with weapons , from Miami to a Dallas motel in November 1963 where they met up with E. Howard Hunt who handed Sturgis an envelope filled with cash .
About a half hour after Hunt left , a second visitor arrived --- Jack Ruby !
Lorenz testified she did not know the details of the operation ; only that it was “ big ” and that she was to act as a decoy .
She got cold feet ; persuaded Sturgis to drive to the airport ; then flew back to Miami .
Her testimony about the Sturgis " We killed the President " statement came only when Hunt 's lawyer made the rookie mistake of asking a question without any idea of what the answer would be --- he challenged her by asking whether she spoke to Sturgis after the assassination .
Lane 's thesis was bolstered by his blistering cross-examination of Hunt , which demolished Hunt 's claim that he was in Washington DC at the time of the assassination --- a fact later confirmed by Hunt 's death bed confession .
Of course , while unlikely , it is possible that both the Lorenz testimony and the Hunt death bed confession were made up .
To my knowledge , the " truther " movement does not possess an " insider " account analogous to either the Lorenz testimony or the Hunt death bed confession .
The fact that I have yet to accept the " inside job " 9/11 " theory " as an established " fact " does not mean that I have rejected it .
The point --- the only point ---
I had intended to convey is that a summary dismissal of " any " theory as " conspiracy theory " is unscientific .

Ernie :
Well , I know what you said and what your point was , and it was great by me .
I guess my point is that the videos of the towers exploding and powderizing is in reality the same kind of evidence as the video of JFK being shot .
The unthinkableness of it seems to have paralyzed the gray matter of most of the people who can immediately recognize that and whenever the shock wore off , it seems , they found it better to stay off the subject or go into denial .
This is maybe the biggest component of the frustration level for Truthers and may have something to do with why you are being attacked , even when taking such a laudable position on this stuff .
Jeannie : Might've ... but ... probably not .
Big as Twitter is , nobody thought the explosions would be controversial at the time .
No one thought any of it would be covered up , or that the government would raze the crime scenes before full investigations and forensics were done .
All the stuff we have left of the communication is the original news coverage and if it's this ignorable , Twitter would be too ....
Or Twitter would have taken the tweets of 9/11 off their servers " out of respect for the families " or some such nonsense .
Very soon after we --- the bloggers who were investigating it --- uncovered ground zero for the swine flu pandemic , all the sites with the evidence went blank or the pertinent page links broken .
The internet is just NOT going to be good for nailing this stuff down , unless everybody can have enough memory to automatically store the content of every page we visit .
But , yes , I definitely would have gotten it , and it would have been a good adjunct to the horrors playing out on our TVs .

The weak point of disparaging 9/11 conspiracy theorists is that the official story for 9/11 is a conspiracy .
9/11 was never investigated .
If it had been , there would have been volumes of information on Marvin Bush , who actually was never even investigated .
He was part owner of a Kuwaiti company that ran security at Dulles , and he was involved at a high level with a security company for WTC7 and on the board of the insurance company for WTC1 and 2 .
If a cop was investigating a murder and did n't investigate someone with that many ties to a murder , the cop would be thrown out on the street .
That does n't mean Marvin was guilty of anything or that 9/11 was an inside job .
What it means is there was no investigation into 9/11 .
As far as the Kennedy assasination , one of the most interesting bits of footage I have ever seen involved footage of the secret service escorting Kennedy on the day he was killed , and one agent OBVIOUSLY distressed when he was told to not ride with or run close to Kennedy 's car .
He gives a giant shrug like " wtf ? ! " after being told to ' stand down ' .

One thing that 's always bothered me about the controlled - demolition theory is , why did the buildings need to fall ?
I mean , I would think a group of hijackers capturing four planes and killing all those on board , as well as crashing three of them into buildings , would have been enough to allow little Georgie to fulfill whatever war - president fantasies were percolating in his demented brain ( apart from , you know , winning a war ) .

Jon , the buildings had to come down because there were mandatory code improvements to cost billions ... way more than the entire complex was worth .
So the controlled demolition would have to have been paid for if they did n't do it this way .
Nobody would have paid to bring the WTC up to code when dropping it and starting over would be more cost - effective .
This way it was exponentially better than merely cost - effective .

Ernest ,
The one fault , at least for now and maybe you 're not consciously aware of it , that I find in your article is this :
Concerning your description of the 2004 election you " define it " by citing the excellent investigative work by Freeman , Brad and others and the scientific nature of the evidence .
YET in the case of 9/11 you " define it " by emotions and your label of the people who do n't believe the official theory as " truthers " .
I know you do n't believe the official story as you said BUT you seem to be of the mindset that it is people who have deep emotions of the day that explains the reasons for believing that 9/11 was an " inside job " .
That type of attitude seems like a dismissal of arguments contrary to the official theory even though I do n't think you 're doing it intentionally .
There are reputable and highly intelligent people who studied 9/11 and arguments for and against the official theory yet you chose to " define " the opposition to the official theory as something non-experts believe .
Why is that ?
And I 'm not saying you did it on purpose .
On the contrary I think it 's an unconscious action because thinking that it was an " inside job " is to horrible to think .
Highly intelligent and reputable people present very good arguments as to why the official theory is not correct .
I do n't know all the answers but those people ask some damn good questions and there is no one that 's defending the " official theory " that 's answering them .
I would like to see both sides provide scientific answers whether for or against official theory , aka something like " peer review " .
Here is just one example from
the Journal of 9/11 Studies
section : Letters to the Journal of 911 Studies
at http://www.journalof911studies.com/letters.html
The letter is

Konstantin : I sincerely appreciate your analysis , which is amongst the most thoughtful I have seen .
If you go back to the language from my original piece , I did say that the evidence suggesting that " controlled demolition " provides a plausible explanation for the sudden collapse of WTC - 7 was " scientific . "
It was not my intent to suggest that everyone who subscribes to the " insider " 9/11 theory does so solely on emotion or that there have not been academics with a background in structural engineering and the like --- a field and expertise that far exceeds my own --- who have offered a good deal of data and conclusions in support of the insider theory .
But there are also academics with equally impressive credentials on the other side of the equation who take an opposing position .
However , even those with the relevant scientific background must guard against an undue influence of the emotional impact of such a traumatic event in seeking to ascertain the truth --- irrespective of whether they lean towards the official or unofficial theories .
The word " truther " is not one I invented , but instead is a word of " self - description " use solely by those who are convinced that 9/11 was an " inside job . "
Like " conspiracy theorist , " the word " truther " is not an objective term .
It implies that those who do not fully agree with the core thesis ( inside job ) , and especially those academics who dispute the inside job thesis , are not concerned with truth .
You state : I would like to see both sides provide scientific answers whether for or against official theory , aka something like " peer review " .
On that , I wholeheartedly concur .

As an addendum to my last comment , Konstantin , let me add something I 'd hope had been made clear in the epilogue .
It was not my intent , by this piece , to prove any of the three " theories " ---
Did the CIA kill JFK ?
Was the 2004 Presidential Election Stolen ?
Was 9/11 an inside job ?
These three theories were included for illustrative purposes , only .
As I earlier informed 99 , The point --- the only point ---
I had intended to convey is that a summary dismissal of " any " theory as " conspiracy theory " is unscientific .
While it was not my intent to suggest that everyone who subscribes to the " insider " theory leaps to conclusions sans an adequate data base to support it , I do appreciate that imprecision on on my part with respect to the words included within the epilogue contributed to that erroneous perception .

Ernest , I understand your point and your intentions about the article .
Still I think you as well as others subconsciously dismiss theories contrary to the official 9/11 theory even though you do n't intend to or realize it and it shows by the language you use to define the contrary views .
At least that 's the impression I get and it's not meant as a personal attack at all .
For example , do n't you notice the difference in language you use when you describe the election results or the JFK assassination analysis and the language you use describing " truthers " ( I know you did n't invent the term ) .
In the case of 9/11 you use terms like " emotions " but in the case of the other two subject you use terms like " statistical analysis " and " investigative journalists " .
Again I know you did n't do it intentionally or are aware of it and physics is beyond your area of expertise and you 're not the only writer that does it .
I hope my post pointed out that the real scientific evidence about 9/11 alternatives to the official theory is not based on emotions but on science .
By the way , I think you are not approaching the 9/11 inquiry correctly .
Science has to explain the areas of contentions and differences .
This is not like a political debate where opponents score points or like a boxing match in which there is a winner and a loser neither like a police investigation where evidence is gathered and then a suspect is charged .
As they say the numbers have to add up and the scientifically valid questions asked have to be answered no matter who asks them whether for or against the official theory .
The point is not to answer whether it was an inside job or not but the point is to have a consistent theory and explanation which is scientifically valid and explanatory and plausible .

Thank you , Mr. Canning , for initiating this very useful discussion regarding the topic of conspiracy theories .
One thing that seems to be significant to note is how effectively the term ' conspiracy theorist ' has been established as a means to delegitimize anyone who brings forth criticism of official myth regarding such history - altering events .
I wonder if it would be instructive to examine the history of this development .
In my own experience , having been an early doubter regarding the official version of the Kennedy assassination , it seems that it got its start during that long effort to get a second investigation ( which , of course , was another coverup effort ) .
Ever since then , it has become easier each time for our government and media to divert public demand for examination if these events simply by crying Conspiracy Theorist .
Also , by establishing a pattern of emphasizing our need to move on from these traumatic events , we never get to the root of the patterns that might be exposed if any of these events were fully examined , and the truth fully established .
So , the next major event simply erases the previous ones from meaningful efforts to do such investigations , and cements our tendency to accept the official version .
For example , if 9/11 is never independently investigated , if a follow - up event happens ( such as a nuclear event in one of our cities ) , the official version will be even more likely to gain broad acceptance , and critics will be even easier to marginalize .
I dread to think what then might be possible regarding the squelching of all opposition to whatever responses they might choose to impose .
By the way , does anyone know if the effort to place an initiative on the ballot in NY City in November is likely to produce any results towards a new investigation ?
I see that have gathered over 70,000 signatures calling for it to be put to a vote .

Sir Patrick Cormack says he wants to restore public confidence A senior Conservative has called for MPs ' pay to be doubled - in return for scrapping their second home allowance .
Sir Patrick Cormack says MPs annual pay should increase from £ 64,766 to more than £ 130,000 .
He was condemned as " out of touch " by Labour , while Lib Dem Foreign Affairs spokesman Ed Davey said the veteran Tory " must be living on Planet Zog " .
But Sir Patrick said he was standing by the call , made in a submission to the Committee on Standards in Public Life .
The committee , chaired by Sir Christopher Kelly , is carrying out a full investigation of MPs pay and allowances and is due to report later this year .
In his submission , Sir Patrick acknowledges his proposal could be seen as " politically unacceptable " .
' Restoring confidence '
But he insisted he had " reluctantly " concluded that it was the best way to restore public confidence in Parliament .
He says : " I have reluctantly become convinced , over the last few weeks , that the most effective way of restoring public confidence in Parliament is for there to be a significant increase in Members ' salaries and an abolition of all allowances , save the allowance to pay for staff and a constituency office .
" In order to ensure that Members could perform their parliamentary and constituency duties effectively , and have , where necessary , a second home , the salary of Members would have to be doubled at least ... "
It 's outrageous and offensive for such a senior Conservative to propose doubling MPs ' pay
Ed Davey , Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman The South Staffordshire MP , who entered Parliament in 1970 , told BBC News : " I 've submitted a detailed series of proposals to Sir Christopher Kelly and I am perfectly happy that they should be published .
" I made it plain in my submission that I had reluctantly come to the conclusion that the simplest and fairest way forward would be an abolition of the allowances and a commensurate increase in salary .
" This is not a propitious time for such a change and so I made a number of detailed proposals on the allowance front which would I believe go a long way to restoring public confidence .
Foremost among these was that the second home should always be rented and generally in London . "
Sir Patrick , who has twice stood for the job of Speaker , is a former deputy leader of the Commons and current chairman of the Northern Ireland Affairs select committee .
Last week , he publicly backed Tory frontbencher Alan Duncan , who was secretly filmed complaining MPs had to live on " rations " , telling BBC Radio 4's The World at One : " We do n't want a parliament of political anoraks and rich people . "
Another Tory grandee , Douglas Hogg , whose expenses submission famously included the cost of clearing the moat at his country home , has also called for MPs to be given a six - figure salary - plus expenses .
' Outrageous '
In his evidence to the standards committee , he said the current MP 's salary was " so low in absolute and relative terms " that members of the professional and business classes would be deterred from entering Parliament .
Tory leader David Cameron has said MPs have to demonstrate they understand public anger over the expenses issue and last week suggested ministers might have to take a pay cut if his party wins the next general election .
But the opposition has seized on the latest comments by Sir Patrick and Mr Hogg , claiming the party is " out of touch " .
Chancellor Alistair Darling , who is standing in for Gordon Brown while the prime minister is on holiday , told BBC News : " At a time when everybody else is pulling in their belts , at a time when people are worried about their jobs and some people are going part - time , MPs can not be treated any differently from anyone else .
" So I do n't agree with what he has got to say about that . "
Ed Davey , for the Lib Dems , told the Evening Standard newspaper Sir Patrick " must be living on Planet Zog to think that doubling MPs ' salary would restore public faith in Parliament " .
He added : " While many people are struggling to make ends meet , it 's outrageous and offensive for such a senior Conservative to propose doubling MPs ' pay . "

The prime minister has told the United Nations that he is willing to cut the UK's fleet of Trident missile - carrying submarines from four to three .
Gordon Brown told the General Assembly the UK was proposing a " grand global bargain " as a way to halt the spread of nuclear weapons and reduce stockpiles .
The suggested cuts come as the government searches for ways to reduce the massive deficit in public finances .
However Number 10 said keeping the UK's nuclear missiles was " non-negotiable " .
At the UN , Mr Brown said nations needed to come together to achieve the long - term ambition of a nuclear - free world .
He said his proposal was a " grand global bargain between nuclear weapon and non nuclear weapons states " .
" If we are serious about the ambition of a nuclear - free world we will need statesmanship , not brinkmanship , " he said .
All nuclear weapons states must play their part in reducing nuclear weapons as part of an agreement by non nuclear states to renounce them
Gordon Brown
Q&A : Trident replacement " All nuclear weapons states must reciprocally play their part in reducing nuclear weapons as part of an agreement by non nuclear states to renounce them .
" This is exactly what the Non-Proliferation Treaty intended .
In line with maintaining our nuclear deterrent I have asked our national security committee to report to me on the potential future reduction of our nuclear weapon submarines from four to three . "
He added the UK would insist non nuclear states proved they are not developing weapons and could offer civil nuclear power to non nuclear states which were ready to renounce any plans for nuclear weapons .
But he said one of the greatest risks was that terrorists would acquire nuclear weapons .
Mr Brown also warned Iran and North Korea that the world would be even tougher on nuclear proliferation and was ready to consider further sanctions .
Nuclear warheads US President Barack Obama is chairing a Security Council meeting as part of the process of drawing up a replacement for the Non-Proliferation Treaty , designed to stop countries developing nuclear weapons .

He has said he will try to negotiate with Moscow to reduce US and Russian nuclear warheads - which make up the vast majority of the world 's total - from more than 2,000 each to 1,500 .
The UK government says it has cut its stockpile of Trident warheads from 200 to 160 but many Labour MPs would like it to scrap the weapons altogether .
Earlier , Mr Brown told BBC Radio 5 live there were " no proposals at the moment about warheads " .
The government estimates the cost of renewing Trident at about £ 20 bn but Greenpeace says it could cost £ 34bn and , once lifetime running costs are included , would cost nearly £ 100 bn in total .
Professor Ron Smith , a defence economist at Birkbeck College , told the BBC that reducing the number of submarines would probably have little effect on Britain 's nuclear capability because one was essentially " a spare " .
The four Vanguard submarines which host Trident missiles can attack targets within a range of just over 4,600 miles ( 7,400 km ) .
The example above shows this range if the sub were located in the mid-Atlantic .
Britain keeps at least one submarine armed and at sea at all times .
Normally , the remaining three - or two , should one be scrapped - will be undergoing maintenance , taking part in training exercises , or docked at port .

He added that losing one submarine would only save " a couple of billion " in about 2020 as there were a lot of fixed costs upfront and each boat cost less to build than the last one .
At - sea patrols Foreign Secretary David Miliband said : " We reject unilateral nuclear disarmament for ourselves precisely because the world cannot end up in a situation where responsible powers get rid of their weapons , but the danger of nuclear proliferation by other powers remains . "
But the former defence secretary John Hutton , in whose Barrow and Furness constituency the submarines are built , said it was " very , very important " that Britain could have " absolute confidence and the knowledge that we can maintain one of those submarines - at least one of those submarines - on continuous deterrent patrol " .
The existing Trident submarines are housed at the Faslane naval base on the Clyde , but the Scottish National Party has firmly opposed their replacement .
Shadow defence secretary Liam
Fox said reducing the number of submarines was not a new idea as it was an option set out in the government 's 2006 White Paper .
He told the BBC : " If we can maintain our nuclear deterrent and make a contribution to disarmament that 's all very well but the prime minister is not planning to reduce the number of warheads from 160 ... merely to have them in fewer submarines . "
He said it was " reasonable and sensible " to look at doing that if the technology was available to make it possible .
The Liberal Democrats say they would not seek a " like - for - like replacement " for Trident - which is due to need replacing by 2024 .
Leader Nick Clegg said it was good the prime minister had acknowledged the need for alternatives to a " like - for - like " replacement but he might have to go " a lot further " .
However the party 's foreign affairs spokesman Edward Davey told the BBC that the suggestion " looks like tinkering at the edges " of the nuclear weapons issue .
Bruce Kent , the vice - president of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament , said multilateral reductions " do n't mean anything " .
He added : " What does it matter if you have 100 nuclear weapons or 200 nuclear weapons - you could do horrendous damage , numbers do n't really matter at all .
" British nuclear weapons have no function , apart from encouraging other people to get nuclear weapons . "
All numbers are estimates because exact numbers are top secret .
Strategic nuclear warheads are designed to target cities , missile locations and military headquarters as part of a strategic plan .
Israel Israeli authorities have never confirmed or denied the country has nuclear weapons .
North Korea
The highly secretive state claims it has nuclear weapons , but there is no information in the public domain that proves this .
Iran The International Atomic Energy Agency reported in 2003 there had been covert nuclear activity to make fissile material and continues to monitor Tehran 's nuclear program .
Syria US officials have claimed it is covertly seeking nuclear weapons .

Rand Paul garnered 26 % support in a poll of likely Kentucky Republican voters in the 2010 Unites States Senate race .
While trailing the establishment candidate by 11 points in this poll , Rand Paul ’s support was very strong for a first - time candidate .
Particularly interesting was Rand Paul ’s support among younger voters , aged 18 to 34 , where he led the mainstream candidate by a wide margin of 43 % to 13 % .
This is exciting news for the Rand Paul campaign , especially considering Rand Paul announced his exploratory committee only three months ago , and has been actively campaigning for only a few weeks .
His opponent has been campaigning statewide for nearly eight years .
“ I ’m excited to have this level of support this early in the game , ” said Rand Paul .
“ This clearly shows that even people who are not career politicians have a chance to win a nomination in this great country .
We ’re excited for the future of this race and ca n’t wait to tell our story to the people of Kentucky . ”
Rand Paul ’s next big event is a planned fundraising “ Money Bomb ” where the campaign plans to raise one million dollars in one day on Thursday , August 20th .

On Monday Terry and Esteve " switched on " the alpha version of their FluidDB offering .
Congratulations guys !
I 've written about FluidDB before – I find the philosophy behind the project so interesting .
Now that I ( and you ) can get to play with it I 'm recording some quick take - aways for the sake of my memory and hopefully your education ( I 'm assuming you 're au fait with FluidDB ) . ;-)
Currently , FluidDB is in read - only mode as none of the pillaging horde that are the alpha testers have been given access to their user 's details so can't make any " writes " .
According to Terry , alpha testers will get their account details by the end of the week .
Nevertheless , we can still " read " what little is in there to get a feel of what interacting with FluidDB is like :
Example Interactions
FluidDB currently communicates with the outside world via an HTTP based API .
You could use tools like wget or curl to interact with FluidDB but simple libraries are already being written ( kudos to Sanghyeon Seo for the quick work – my fork includes fixes for Python < 2.6 ) .
I 'll use my fork in the following Python doctest like example :
Return a list of objects that have the tag " username " from the " fluiddb/users " namespace
>>> import fluiddb >>> fluiddb.call( ' GET ' , '/ objects ' , query=' has fluiddb / users / username ' ) ( 200 , { 'ids ' : [ '8b57277a-09f6-485d-9108-761b7848c913 ' , ... SNIP ... ' 62fe2cca-7ad2-4dd8-9b0a-b3909c0709e8 ' ] } )
Return an object where the tag " username " from the " fluiddb/users " namespace has the value " ntoll "
>>> fluiddb.call( ' GET ' , '/ objects ' , query='fluiddb/users / username = " ntoll " ' ) ( 200 , {'ids ' : [ '5873e7cc-2a4a-44f7-a00e-7cebf92a7332 ' ] } )
Find out about a specific object :
>>> fluiddb.call(' GET ' , '/ objects/5873e7cc-2a4a-44f7-a00e-7cebf92a7332 ' , { " showAbout " : True} ) ( 200 , {'about ' : ' Object for the user named ntoll ' , ' tagPaths ' : [ ' fluiddb/about ' , ' fluiddb/users/name ' , ' fluiddb/users/username ' ] } )
Get the value of the tag " fluiddb/users /username " from the object with the uuid " 5873e7cc-2a4a-44f7-a00e-7cebf92a7332 "
>>> fluiddb.call(' GET ' , '/ objects/5873e7cc-2a4a-44f7-a00e-7cebf92a7332/fluiddb/users/name ' ) ( 200 , ' ntoll ' )
Get the result as json ( GET and PUT responses default to raw HTML payload )
>>> fluiddb.call(' GET ' , '/ objects/5873e7cc-2a4a-44f7-a00e-7cebf92a7332/fluiddb/users/name ' , body =None , format= ' json ' ) ( 200 , {'value ' : ' ntoll'} )
So far so good …
Until we get our API keys that allow us to " write " stuff in our namespaces then this is all we 've got to play with .
I suspect that we might be able to create new objects ( I 've not tested this yet ) as these do n't " belong " to anyone – remember it 's the namespaces / tags and the associated values that make FluidDB so interesting .
Finally , you might be asking where one might find out more … the most useful pages I 've found are :
You might also want to join the #fluiddb channel on Freenode IRC or subscribe to the two Google groups .
I 'll update with more as soon as I 've worked it out / been given access … :-)

John Conyers and some allies on the House Judiciary Committee have come up with a fabulous way to get the insurance industry in line - by threatening to remove their anti-trust exemption .
Many people do n't know that the insurance industry , under the McCarran - Ferguson Act of 1945 , has a broad anti-trust exemption that facilitates regional monopolies .
The Act allows states to regulate the insurance business instead of the federal government , but also allows that , as long as the state regulates the industry , federal anti-trust laws would not apply .
As a result of this exemption , states have seen markets for health insurance where one or two companies predominate .
In the state of Maine , Wellpoint controls 71 % of the market .
In North Dakota , Blue Cross controls 90 % .
Using the Herfindahl / Hirschman Index , a metric for market concentration , a 2007 study by the AMA found almost every health insurance market in the United States is highly concentrated .
This edition of the study analyzed 313 MSAs .
This compares with 292 metropolitan areas in the 2005 study , 84 in the 2003 study , 70 in the 2002 study , and 40 in the 2001 study .
In terms of market concentration ( HHI ) , the study found the following :
In the combined HMO / PPO product market , 96 percent ( 299 ) of the MSAs are highly concentrated ( HHI > 1,800 ) , applying the 1997 Merger Guidelines .
In the HMO product market , 99 percent ( 309 ) of the MSAs are highly concentrated ( HHI > 1,800 ) , applying the 1997 Merger Guidelines .
In the PPO product market , 100 percent ( 313 ) of the MSAs are highly concentrated ( HHI > 1,800 ) , applying the 1997 Merger Guidelines .
Here 's the AMA study .
Paul Rosenberg has a lot more on this .
The point is that the concentration of the health insurance market among regional monopolies leads to higher costs for consumers , almost by definition .
What the legislation by Conyers ( D - MI ) , Hank Johnson ( D - GA ) and Diana DeGette ( D - CO ) would do is end that anti-trust exemption for health insurers , allowing for enforcement in all of these highly concentrated markets .
The Senate has companion legislation :
“ This legislation would specifically prohibit price fixing , bid rigging , and market allocation in the health insurance industry , ” said Conyers .
“ These pernicious practices are detrimental to competition and result in higher prices for consumers .
Conduct that is unlawful throughout the country should not be allowed for insurance companies under antitrust exemption .
The House Judiciary Committee held extensive hearings on the effects of the insurance industry ’s antitrust exemption throughout the 1980s and early 1990s .
It became clear then that policyholders and the economy in general would benefit from eliminating this exemption .
“ The legislation we introduced today is intended to root out unlawful activity in an industry grown complacent by decades of protection from antitrust oversight .
In doing so , we aim to make health insurance more affordable to more Americans .
I want to thank my friend Senator Leahy for his leadership on the bill and for working with the House on this joint introduction . ”
Many of the actions taken by the insurance industry over the years simply violate federal law .
Repealing their anti-trust exemption would force the industry to end their criminal ways or face punishment .
As a companion to insurance regulations designed to lower prices for consumers , but perhaps without the kind of enforcement necessary to maintain it , I could n't think of anything better .
And if nothing else , this legislation is a powerful whip to keep the industry in line as they try to extract more perks from the health care bill .
Combine this with the multiple investigations into industry practices from Dennis Kucinich , Henry Waxman and others , and you have real pressure on the industry for the first time in a while .
Good for John Conyers .
Wow , it ’s already Friday .
I ’ll feel that I ’ve short - changed you if we do n’t do some Finance Theory before I go .
Did you see this roundtable about the state of macroeconomics in The Economist ’s Free Exchange ?
Fascinating stuff ; in particular it became a bit of an odd defense of the Efficient Markets Hypthosis ( EMH ) .
A representative comment was made by William Easterly , in defense of EMH :
The most important part of the much - maligned Efficient Markets Hypothesis ( EMH ) is that nobody can systematically beat the stock market .
Which implies nobody can predict a market crash , because if you could , then you would obviously beat the market .
This applies also to other asset markets like housing prices .
This is not true , and I want us to walk through why it is n’t .
In March of 1997 , Andrei Shleifer and Robert Vishny published a paper titled The Limits of Arbitrage ( pdf ) in the Journal of Finance .
I think it ’s the most important finance paper of the past 15 years , something everyone even remotely connected to financial markets should become familiar with .
It builds on and summarizes a decade long research project , research they conducted with people such as Joseph Lakonishok and Brad Delong .
In it they say that arbitrageurs , the very smart and talented traders at hedge funds who will take prices that are out of line and bring them back into line , making a good fee and making prices reflect all available information , the very building block necessary for EMH to work , ca n’t do their job if they are time or credit constrained .
Specifically , if they are highly leveraged , and prices move against their position before they return to their fundamental value – if the market stays irrational longer than they can remain solvent – they ’ll collapse before they can do their job .
And sure enough , a year later in 1998 , Long Term Capital Management , very smart highly leveraged arbitrageurs , found themselves in a situation where prices moved away from them , and they had no capital with which to keep themselves afloat , just like Limits Of Arbitrage predicted .
( This is the standard narrative in finance research seminars ; it also appears this way , correctly , in Justin Fox ’s The Myth of the Rational Market , a very excellent book that gets these details correct . )
There ’s an argument that says “ If the market is inefficient , why are n’t you rich ? ”
This gives us the framework to understand why markets could deviate from true value but there is n’t a way to capitalize on bringing them back to true value – sometimes there is risk inherent in arbitrage , and sometimes there are situations where it is difficult to get on the other side of a trade .
And specifically , it ’s risk that is n’t compensated .
Here ’s an example of how this works .
Let ’s say something is trading at $ 5 .
You are positive it is going to reach $ 10 .
Positive .
It must .
No chance it wo n’t at some point in the future .
So you buy it , telling your boss / manager / investors you are going to make $ 10 - $ 5 = $ 5 for free .
But the price goes to $ 2.50 .
What happens ?
You should buy a lot more .
Now you are going to make $ 7.50 !
However your boss / manager / investor thinks you are insane and have lost them all kinds of money , as they now have half of what they gave you , and wants to pull your trading funds – if you sell then , you lose money , and put downward pressure on the price .
Also , depending on how you were leveraged , you may also be bankrupt .
That ’s how this works .
This gives us a guideline for figuring out how markets can get out of alignment with value – if it is difficult to attract arbitrageurs , who are necessary to keep prices in alignment , we should expect the market to have prices that are more prone to manipulation and bubbles .
What attracts arbitrageurs ?
The bond market – it is easy to calculate the value of a bond , and easy to realize the value quickly .
Foreign exchange markets – it ’s relatively easy for arbitrageurs to go after central banks attempts to maintain nonmarket exchange rates .
What does n’t attract arbitrageurs as easily ?
The stock market .
The absolute and relative value of a stock is harder to estimate , and it may take a long period of time to realize your gain .
( If you are comfortable with the terms , expected alpha does n’t increase in proportion to volatility if volatility includes fundamental risk – read the paper , it ’s excellent ! )
And though it is n’t covered in the paper , housing .
There ’s no real way to go short housing .
You can go short the bank issuing mortgages , but if the bank has two internal businesses – jumbo subprime loans and boring small business loans – might it not be sensible for them to turn down the business loan division in response to the market shorting ?
You need to be able to exert price pressure directly onto the market itself – the more intermediaries , the more likely it is your signal is converted into noise .
There ’s talk about how in the future we ’ll all trade derivatives contracts on each other ’s neighborhoods ; depending on how that ’s implemented , it would be something to say “ I want to go short Detroit and Peoria in my portfolio . ”
Is there moral hazard to drive down those prices then ?
And life would be more interesting if the investment firm of “ My Ex- Girlfriends LLC ” could take out a derivative insurance contract that pays out to them if my house burns down over the next year .
Thankfully that market is still some time away , if it ever gets here , so we can iron out the difficulties .
There ’s a lot more research to be done here , but contrary to popular belief we do have an intellectual framework to know how markets can get out of whack , one that takes the EMH are brings it to a reality where we face actual constraints over scarce resources such as time and capital .
Alonso has endured a frustrating season with Renault
By Andrew Benson
Ferrari have announced that double world champion Fernando Alonso will join them for 2010 from Renault , with Kimi Raikkonen making way .
Ferrari said the Spaniard had signed a three - year contract and that he would partner Brazilian Felipe Massa .
" Driving a single - seater for the Prancing Horse is everybody 's dream in F1 , and now I have the chance to make this dream come true , " said Alonso .
The 28 - year - old said the move had been brought forward by a year .
Alonso 's switch to Ferrari had been the worst - kept secret in F1 , and the announcement is likely to trigger a string of driver moves .
" I 'm very happy and very proud to become a Ferrari driver , " said Alonso .
I can't wait to start working with my new team
Fernando Alonso
" Above all I want to thank Ferrari chairman Luca di Montezemolo , who really wanted this three - year contract .
" We had an agreement this summer , starting in 2011 , but then over the last few days the picture changed and we decided to anticipate my arrival in Maranello by one year . "
" After this season [ which has three races remaining ]
I will put all my effort into next , " he added .
" I 'm sure , together with Felipe , we 'll offer Ferrari and the fans from all over the world some great satisfaction .
I can't wait to start working with my new team . "
Ferrari team boss Stefano Domenicali , who described Alonso as an " amazing talent " , paid tribute to Raikkonen 's contribution to the team .
" We wish to thank Kimi for everything he has done during his time with Ferrari , " he said .
" In his first year with us he managed to win the drivers ' title [ in 2007 ] , so making his contribution to Ferrari 's history , and he played a vital role in our taking of the constructors ' title in 2007 and 2008 . "
The Finn is tipped to join McLaren - Mercedes although a spokesman said the Anglo - German team had yet to make a decision on a team - mate for Lewis Hamilton .
Raikkonen added : " I am very sad to be leaving a team with whom I have spent three fantastic years .
" I have always felt at home with everyone here , and I will have many happy memories of my time with the team . "
ANDREW BENSON BLOG Fernando Alonso's move to Ferrari is the most exciting shift in the Formula 1 fabric for years
F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone gave Alonso's Ferrari switch his blessing : " It is good .
Good for Fernando , good for Formula 1 , good for Ferrari . "
As part of the cascade of driver moves that will follow Alonso 's switch , BMW Sauber 's Robert Kubica is understood to have signed a contract to replace Alonso at Renault .
Alonso 's switch to Ferrari has been an open secret in F1 for weeks and BBC Sport understands he signed his contract as long ago as July 2008 .
A Ferrari source told BBC Sport there are options to extend Alonso 's deal , and that he will be earning an annual salary in the region of 19 - 25 million euros ( £ 17.3 -£ 22.8 m ) .
Raikkonen had a contract with Ferrari until the end of 2010 , but the team have negotiated an early release .
Massa is recovering at home in Brazil after suffering a fractured skull in an accident at the Hungarian Grand Prix in July .
Ferrari's expectations that he will return fully fit in 2010 have been boosted by his progress : on Monday he tested a kart for the first time since his accident and he is flying to Italy to use Ferrari 's simulator next week .
Italian Giancarlo Fisichella , who is standing in for Massa in the final few races of the season , will be Ferrari 's test and reserve driver in 2010 .
Alonso 's move brings to an end his relationship with Renault , for whom he has driven in all but two of his eight years in F1 .
He was cleared of any involvement in the recent race - fixing scandal , in which Renault were found to have asked his team - mate Nelson Piquet Jr to crash at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix to aid Alonso 's chances of victory .
Alonso , not Raikkonen , will be wearing the red overalls of Ferrari in 2010 Alonso made his F1 debut for Minardi in 2001 , moved to Renault as their test driver in 2002 and was promoted to their race team in 2003 .
He became the youngest race - winner in F1 history when he won the 2003 Hungarian Grand Prix , and its youngest world champion in 2005 , though he has lost those marks to Sebastian Vettel and Lewis Hamilton .
Alonso went on to win a second consecutive championship in 2006 , beating Ferrari's Michael Schumacher in a straight fight , before moving to McLaren as Hamilton 's team - mate in 2007 .
However , his relationship with the team was tempestuous and he left after just one season to rejoin Renault .
On his return he won the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix and , with one of his best performances , the following race in Japan , but the team have been uncompetitive this season .

Side - effects can include headaches , blurred vision and upset stomach A cream allowing erectile dysfunction drugs to be applied directly to the skin could one day make them safer to use , say New York scientists .
Studies in rats suggest that Viagra , Levitra and Cialis could pass through the skin in tiny capsules , they say .
The research , published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine , could mean fewer side - effects , and even significantly speed up the drug 's action .
However , it could be a decade before creams are fully ready for use .
The arrival of erectile dysfunction treatments in tablet form has been one of the success stories of the modern pharmaceutical industry , with some estimates suggesting that tens of millions of men worldwide have used them .
However , although they have worked for many men , they also carry the risk of side - effects such as headaches , blurred vision or upset stomachs .
In addition , men with severe heart problems , or who have just suffered a stroke , are advised to avoid the tablets altogether or use them with extreme caution .
Less risk
For many , this could be solved by the development of the cream , with would confine more of the active ingredients of the drug to a single area of the body , rather than circulating them widely .
The response time to the nanoparticles was very short , just a few minutes , which is basically what people want in an erectile dysfunction medication
Dr Kelvin Davies
Study author
The research team at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University , in New York , used nanoparticles , each much smaller than a grain of pollen , and found a way to encapsulate particles of the drug inside .
Their early tests involved just a few rats bred to have erectile dysfunction later in life .
Of these , 11 were treated with nanoparticles containing Cialis , a newer erectile dysfunction drug called sialorphin , and nitric oxide , a chemical also needed to widen blood vessels and produce an erection , often reduced in men with diabetes .
All of the rats showed improvement , unlike seven rats given empty nanoparticles instead .
Dr Kelvin Davies , one of the researchers , said : " The response time to the nanoparticles was very short , just a few minutes , which is basically what people want in an erectile dysfunction medication .
" In both rats and humans , it can take 30 minutes to one hour for oral erectile dysfunction medications to take effect . "
The researchers found no signs of local inflammation or damage caused by the nanoparticles , and no evidence of wider side - effects .
Clinical studies in humans could begin in a few years if animal studies continued to suggest the treatment was safe , they said .
However , finally getting the drug approved for widescale use could take 10 years or more , they said .

Susan Atkins , a follower of 1960s cult leader Charles Manson who admitted stabbing actress Sharon Tate 40 years ago , has died at the age of 61 .
Atkins , who was suffering from brain cancer , died at a prison hospital in Chowchilla , Calif. , late Thursday night , said California Department of Corrections spokeswoman Terry Thornton .
Atkins had spent the last days of her life in hospice care at the hospital , Thornton said .
Earlier this month Atkins had lost her last bid for parole .
Her husband - lawyer , James Whitehouse , had pleaded for her release so she could die at home .
Atkins , who had her left leg amputated and was partially paralyzed , had slept through most of the hearing and had only roused to recite the 23rd Psalm from a gurney at the end .
Atkins was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2008 .
She was denied compassionate release in the same year after she was given just months to live .
The families of victims of the Sharon Tate - La Bianca killings urged that she be kept behind bars until she dies .
Atkins , Manson and two other cult members , Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten , were tried for the 1969 killings of Tate — who was 8 ½ months pregnant — Leno and Rosemary La Bianca , and four others .
The defendants maintained their innocence throughout the trial .
Once convicted , the women confessed to the killings during the penalty phase .
Atkins recounted her role in stabbing Tate , who pleaded for the life of her unborn baby .
Atkins claimed she was on LSD at the time but did not apologize for the crime until a parole hearing years later .

Advertisement A Labour peer turned on a BBC presenter demanding to know how much she was paid during a live interview on MP expenses .
Lord Foulkes clashed with Carrie Gracie on the BBC News Channel after she asked if MPs who had abused their expenses should pay the money back .
He accused the media of ignoring the good work MPs did and demanded to know how much she was paid .
Told it was £ 92,000 a year , he said she was being paid " nearly twice as much an MP - to come on and talk nonsense " .
He added that BBC presenters such as John Humphrys and Jeremy Paxman were paid hundreds of thousands of pounds " to come on TV and sneer at democracy and undermine democracy " .
" The vast majority of MPs are being undermined by you , " he said .
Lord Foulkes was appearing on the BBC News channel to defend Commons Speaker Michael Martin 's role in the ongoing row about MPs ' expenses .
He said there were " far more important things going on in the world " - but became agitated when Ms Gracie asked why Mr Martin had tried to block the publication of expenses .
" The intention always has been to publish this .
Perhaps one of these days you 'll do a thing about how much the BBC is being paid .
We 're paying hundreds of thousands of pounds for presenters who come on three days a week . "
Ms Gracie tried to ask another question and apologised for interrupting , prompting the Labour peer to tell her : " You 're not at all sorry to interrupt me - every time an MP comes on you constantly harass them .
How much are you being paid ? "
Lord Foulkes , a former Scotland Office minster , is the only member of the House of Lords to also sit in the Scottish Parliament .
He stood down as an MP in 2005 .

Commercials and the Armed Forces : Recipe for Disaster
A single mother sits across from her teenaged son at her kitchen table , holding a cup of coffee .
She asks him about his day , and he replies , while absent - mindedly fiddling with a stack of papers , “ It was good . ”
The mother notices that he seems to be struggling to tell her something , so she prods by saying : “ Did something happen today ? ”
He says , “ Yes , something real good happened . ”
From that point , he slowly pushes the stack of papers toward his mother and begins to tell her that he wants to join the Army .
He tells her all about how the Army will help pay for his college studies to become an engineer .
He lovingly acknowledges that his mother has been footing all of the responsibility for him .
“ I ’ll get paid to go to school while doing something I can be proud of . ” Check .
Then he says , with a heartbreaking smile — “ Besides , it ’s time for me to be the man . ” Checkmate .
Every parent fantasizes about having such a wonderfully calm and mature conversation such as this one with their grown teen .
However , this is the beginning of the snare that entraps many of the young men and women who rise from their seats in front of their television sets , kiss their loved ones goodbye , and march off with their duffel bags full of honor to war .
The snares are called “ commercials ” .
They are ten to thirty second video clips that can make or break a budget , change your mind , and in this case , change your life .
Young men and women are hypnotized by the dramatic music , the physically fit actors running hard obstacle courses , and the dramatic voice - over that says something like : “ You could be a part of history .
You can make a difference . ”
Or even more compelling , no voice , just a bunch of flashing captions after every clip showing a pilot saving an aircraft from a bad landing , a computer technician fixing the military ’s database , or some acrobat swinging from a bungee cord through a mass of trees like Tarzan .
Not one of these ads shows that many of those soldiers who piloted those planes have watched through their aircraft windshield as another plane , more likely than not carrying their friends , exploded at the hands of enemy fire .
Do the marketing teams that create these ads account for the growing trauma inflicted on the soldiers who raced off to war after falling for the joyful scenario on their televisions ?
According to a report dated on July 1 , 2004 in the NY Times , entitled “ The Reach of WarThe Soldiers ” , by Anahad O’Connor , one out of every six soldiers who fought in the Iraq war after the September 11 attack on New York City returned home displaying signs of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder .
6,000 soldiers were surveyed , divided into two groups : those who were stationed to fight in Afghanistan and those stationed to fight in Iraq .
Seventeen percent of the Iraq - stationed troops , and eleven percent of the troops stationed in Afghanistan , suffered major depression and emotional post - traumatic stress .
It ’s a damaging problem that in my opinion , the government is quick to create and even quicker to ignore .
Probably more frightening than the hypnotic effects of the Armed Forces commercials is the almost blatant disregard the soldiers seem to suffer once their services are no longer needed .
A soldier named Tyson Johnson was seriously injured by a motor blast during his tour and forced to leave the military early .
The Army billed him $ 2,700 for repayment of an enlistment bonus because he ’d only served two - thirds of his 3 - year time .
In addition , when he was unable to pay , they turned his account over to credit reporting agencies and saddled him with bad credit , and he wound up living in his car because the Army made it impossible for him to land an apartment .
He ’s just one of the hundreds of injured soldiers that have been victimized by the audacious ingratitude of the U.S. Armed Forces .
Another soldier told his story on a late night news program about having had his leg amputated due to an explosion .
He , too , was discharged early with honors , and returned home to find his disability check accompanied by an invoice for his uniform , and for artillery he had either not returned or not cleaned before leaving the tour .
That amount was deducted from his check .
The constant exposure on the battlefield to death , torture , and toxins are additional perils and inhumane risks they take to fight a war without truly understanding why the political talks between the powers that be wound up out of the board room and onto the battlefield in the first place .
Thanks , Uncle Sam .
I want to make it absolutely clear that I do not take the issue of National Security , nor the pressure on the government to maintain it , lightly .
September 11 , 2001 was a horrific event that caused senseless carnage back then , and grief , heightened paranoia and trauma that will never die .
But equally concerning is that the power of commercials is astounding , and it ’s frightening .
No longer are commercials simply trying to reach the housewife with an expensive vacuum , or the child with the expensive remote - controlled toy .
They are trying to reach the idle , insecure , and unpopular teen with the manipulated perception of the cool , hip fad of war .
Join the Army and be all you can be ; help them find their way in the Marines , and if we do n’t wise up and think before we leap on those commercials , the next one will say : Join any branch of the Armed Forces and be on your own .
Until next time , God bless you .

Scientists in the US and Denmark have made breakthroughs which will improve our ability to extract oil .
The first involves more accurate mapping of reservoirs , while the second throws a light on how oil clings to its containing rocks .
Sean Ottewell reports .
Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , with funding from Shell International Petroleum , have developed technology that can generate an accurate underground map that has the potential to significantly increase the amount of oil extracted from reservoirs .
The new technology uses the digital image compression technique of JPEG to create realistic - looking , comprehensive maps of underground oil reservoirs using measurements from scattered oil wells .
These maps would be the first to provide enough detail about an oil reservoir to guide oil recovery in the field in real time .
" Our simulation studies indicate that this innovative approach has the potential to improve current reservoir characterisation techniques and to provide better predictions of oil - reservoir production .
The hope is that better predictions ultimately lead to more efficient operations and increased oil production , " said Behnam Jafarpour , a recent MIT graduate who is now an assistant professor in petroleum engineering at Texas A&M University .
Jafarpour and Dennis McLaughlin , the HM King Bhumibol Professor of Water Resource Management at MIT , published a pair of papers describing the technique that will appear in an upcoming issue of the Society of Petroleum Engineering Journal , as well as a third paper that appeared in the June 2008 issue of Computational Geosciences .
The spatial structure in geologic formations makes it possible to compress rock property maps .
But JPEG compresses the many pixels in a detailed image down to a few essential pieces of information that require only a small amount of storage .
In the oil reservoir characterisation application developed by MIT researchers , a similar mechanism is used to provide concise descriptions of reservoir rock properties .
The new technique uses oil flow rates and pressure data from oilfield wells to create a realistic image of the subsurface reservoir .
Petroleum extraction is expensive and relatively inefficient - sometimes as little as one - third of the oil in a reservoir is actually recovered through pumping .
So engineers rely on enhanced recovery techniques such as water flooding to mobilise the oil .
To guide this work , they make real - time predictions of subsurface variables , including oil saturation and pressure , but they 're essentially working blindly .
The rock properties needed to make these predictions ( for instance fluid conductivity of rock at a particular depth ) can't be seen or measured .
Instead , engineers infer geologic properties indirectly from seismic data and measurements taken at scattered wells .
" In a typical reservoir , millions of pixels are needed to adequately describe the complex subsurface pathways that convey the oil to wells .
Unfortunately , the number of seismic and well observations available for estimating these pixel values is typically very limited .
The methods we 've developed extract more information from those limited measurements to provide better descriptions of subsurface pathways and the oil moving through them , " said McLaughlin , lead researcher on the project .
In a 36 - month simulated oil - recovery process , McLaughlin and Jarfarpour 's estimation approach accurately captured the main features and trends in fluid conductivity of a reservoir formation , demonstrating that the new technique is robust , accurate and efficient ( Fig.1 ) .
" Our next step - already in progress - is to test our idea in real oil reservoirs and evaluate its impact on oil recovery under realistic field settings , " Jafarpour said .
Meanwhile , new Danish research may have come up with an explanation as to where and how North Sea oil clings to underground rocks .
This explanation could turn out to be the first step on the way to developing improved oil production techniques with the intent of increasing oil production from Danish oil fields .
A research group at the Nano - Science Centre , part of the Institute of Chemistry at University of Copenhagen , has investigated drill cores collected from North Sea oil fields using an atomic force microscope .
Their investigations show that the spaces which contain oil have totally different surface qualities than expected from our knowledge of the minerals which make up the rock .
The rocks which contain oil in the Danish part of the North Sea are primarily chalk - the same type of rock that the cliffs of Stevns and Mons in Denmark are made of .
Assistant Professor
Tue Hassenkam led the research , whose preliminary results were published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) in June .
He says that this is the first time that investigations of this type have been carried out on chalk from an oil field in the North Sea .
" Previous investigations were carried out on the surface properties of pure mineral crystals .
But our investigation has shown that this chalk has a different and more complex structure , " says Hassenkam .
The oil bearing layers in the subsurface are reminiscent of a sponge .
The oil ' hides ' in tiny pores and gaps and only some of the oil can be pressed out of the chalk and into the borehole by injecting water into the chalk layer .
The rest is left behind as small droplets of oil surrounded by water either in small gaps in the rock or stuck to the walls of the pores .
The chalk particles ought to repel oil if they act like particles of the mineral calcite , which chalk is almost 100 per cent made up of .
However the new investigations , carried out with a particularly powerful microscope , have shown that the surfaces of the pores in the chalk are partially covered in a material which oil can stick to .
Hassenkam believes that the surprising behaviour of the material in the surface of the chalk can be explained by studying how the chalk was formed .
" Chalk is actually the casings of ancient algae .
The algae gave their cases a type of ' surface coating ' to make them resistant to water .
And it is probably this surface coating that we can see in action here , even 60 million years later . "
For two years now Maersk Oil and Gas and the Danish National Advanced Technology Foundation have been supporting a closely - related project : the Nano - Chalk Venture .

Southern elephant seals are one of the species under threat
Mammals facing extinction threat
An unacceptable number of species are still being lost forever despite world leaders pledging action to reverse the trend , a report has warned .
The International Union for the Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) says the commitment to reduce biodiversity loss by 2010 will not be met .
It warns that a third of amphibians , a quarter of mammals and one - in - eight birds are threatened with extinction .
The analysis is based on the 44,838 species on the IUCN Red List .
" The report makes for depressing reading , " said co-editor Craig Hilton Taylor , manager of the IUCN 's Red List Unit .
" It tells us that the extinction crisis is as bad , or even worse than we believed .
" But it also shows the trends these species are following and is therefore an essential part of decision - making processes . "
The main policy mechanism to tackle the loss is the Convention for Biological Diversity ( CBD ) , which came into force in 1993 with three main aims : •
To conserve biological diversity •
Use biological diversity in a sustainable fashion •
Share the benefits of biological diversity fairly and equitably Currently , 168 nations are signatories to the convention , which set the target " to achieve by 2010 a significant reduction of the current rate of biodiversity loss at the global , regional and national level " .
Demise of the devils and other mammals under threat
In pictures
Jean - Christophe Vie , deputy head of the IUCN's Species Programme , warned that the scale of " wildlife crisis " was far worse than the current global economic crisis .
" It is time to recognise that nature is the largest company on Earth working for the benefit of 100 % of humankind , " he said .
" Governments should put as much effort , if not more , into saving nature as they do saving economic and financial sectors .
" When governments take action to reduce biodiversity loss , there are some conservation successes but we are still a long way from reversing that trend . "
The assessment lists 869 species as Extinct or Extinct in the Wild .
Overall , the report categorises at least 16,928 species as being threatened with extinction .
" All of the plants and animals that make up Earth 's amazing wildlife have a specific role and contribute to essentials like food , medicine , oxygen , water , " said Mr Vie .
" We need them all , in large numbers .
We quite literally cannot afford to lose them . "

A combination of the words " sheep " and " people " meaning that the person or persons are acting as a group or to only behave based on what is trending
Look at all the sheeple flocking to get the new iPhone .
Only a sheeple would do something stupid , that he knows wo n't work Because he watched the rest of the flock do it and fail .
Simply because the other sheeple did it and said it was trending .
A cabinet minister last night raised the spectre of a return to 1930s fascism , warning of " parallels " bertween rightwing groups planning protests in Muslim neighbourhoods and Oswald Mosley 's incendiary marches through Jewish areas of east London in the 1930s .
Announcing a government drive to address issues alienating white , working - class people at risk of being " exploited " by the far - right , John Denham , the secretary of state for communities and local government , singled out protests being organised by the English Defence League .
The group , has organised a number of protests in recent months which have turned violent .
It is to hold events in Manchester , Leeds , London and Bristol in the coming weeks .
Yesterday small groups of EDL supporters gathered for a protest outside a mosque in Harrow , north - west London .
They were confronted by at least 1,000 anti-fascist protesters .
Police arrested 10 people after clashes , nine of them for allegedly possessing weapons .
No injuries were reported .
" I think the English Defence League and other organisations are not actually large numbers of people , " Denham said .
" They clearly though have among them people who know exactly what they 're doing .
If you look at the types of demonstrations they 've organised … it looks pretty clear that it 's a tactic designed to provoke and get a response , and hopefully create violence . "
He pointed to historical " parallels " with Mosley 's events .
" You could go back to the 1930s if you wanted to – Cable Street and all of those types of things .
The tactic of trying to provoke a response in the hope of causing wider violence and mayhem is long established on the far - right and among extremist groups . "
The so - called Battle of Cable Street occurred in October 1936 , when Mosley , the leader of the British Union of Fascists , attempted to lead his supporters through a Jewish area of the East End of London , leading to violent clashes .
EDL 's supporters include known far - right activists and football hooligans , filmed at recent protests chanting racist slogans and making Nazi salutes .
Next week senior police officers from across the country will meet to share intelligence on the EDL , amid fears that a volatile mix of extreme rightwing activists , and counter - protests from leftwing groups and locals , could result in serious disorder .
The National Public Order Intelligence Unit monitors extremists , and is producing an intelligence briefing on the group 's activities ahead of the meeting , to be chaired by West Midlands Police 's Assistant Chief Constable Sharon Rowe .
She policed the EDL's last two protests in Birmingham , which resulted in pitched battles with local youths and 125 arrests , and which were marked by an " escalation in criminality " .
" If the EDL come back to this city in future I 've got more of an evidence case , and intelligence to arrest them a lot earlier , to prevent a breach of the peace , " she said .
Today the EDL gathered outside the Harrow mosque to mark the anniversary of the September 11 attacks .
In the past month , the home secretary , Alan Johnson , has twice used public order legislation to restrict far - right marches .
On one occasion , in Luton , his " banning order " resulted in a three - month prohibition of all marches in the town .
Denham praised the home secretary 's action , but said there was a need for a broader strategy from government to " undercut issues that racists try to exploit " .
Ministers would in the coming weeks unveil a government - funded programme targeted at mainly white , working - class communities , he said .
" You need to be prepared to let people 's real underlying fears and concerns come out , but address them frankly and openly , " he said .
He gave the example of perceptions of unfair allocation of council housing and new jobs , and said there could be changes at street level to allow local people to " influence and shape " how resources are distributed in their area .

Someone called Joester is purporting to show us how to block out gmail ads by using magic words in email messages , such as 9/11 or " suicide . "
In other words , the ads that appear when your email is catastrophe - free :
… are gone when the email you receive contains trigger words :
But it 's not as easy as it sounds .
Putting the key words in a signature file does n't work ; the ads return .
Also , writes Joester :
If the message runs long google turns the ads back on .
However , if you add another " sensitive " word they go off again .
After extensive testing I 've discovered you need 1 catastrophic event or tragedy for every 167 words in the rest of the email .
Questions remain .
What are all the trigger words ?
How do you avoid scaring the people who receive your emails with your seemingly pointless references to incest and gang rape ?
More importantly , should n't this be more accurately described as a method for helping the people who you email who have gmail avoid ads ?

A new report from Human Rights Watch demands that the Iraqi government crack down on the executions of gay men in the country , saying that hundreds have been killed since 2004 :
" Although the scope of the problem remains unclear , hundreds of gay men
may have been killed this year in predominantly Shiite Muslim areas ,
the report 's authors said , basing their conclusion on interviews with
gay Iraqi men , hospital officials and an unnamed United Nations
official in Baghdad … Reports of slayings targeting gay men began circulating early this
spring in Sadr City , a conservative Shiite district in eastern Baghdad .
Gay men were also reportedly slain in Basra , Najaf and Diyala province ,
Human Rights
Watch said .
Gay activists said militiamen loyal to Shiite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr
had target lists containing the names of men suspected of being gay .
…
Sadr City residents opposed to homosexuality said in interviews that
the presence of gay men became overt after the Iraqi army was allowed
to move into the district in the spring of 2008 , asserting control over
a vast area formerly controlled by Sadr 's militia , the Mahdi Army .
' When the Iraqi army started coming here , this phenomenon started
coming to our area , ' said Ali Abu Kara , 23 , a mechanic who identified
himself as a member of the Mahdi Army .
' We felt very glad when those
puppies were killed , ' he added , using a pejorative term for gay men . "
The " social cleansing " appears to have slowed in recent months , the group reports , because many gays have fled cities or gone underground to escape the brutality .
My wife and I have always enjoyed watching movies and TV shows at home .
You could say we ’re movie buffs .
We ’ve got a nice finished basement in our home with a big sectional couch facing our home theater where we can lie in front of the TV and watch to our heart ’s content .
It ’s one of our favorite places to be , especially on the weekends .
We love having movie marathons or as we ’ve recently done – TV show marathons ( We ’re watching all 5 seasons of Lost in a row right now ) .
It ’s safe to say that we spend a lot of time down there .
For quite some time I ’ve wanted to upgrade our TV in our basement .
The couch is quite a ways from the TV , and while we do have a nice 37 ″ TV down there , I ’ve always wanted a big - screen TV to really make it a true home theater .
My TV of choice for our basement has been a 50 ″ Plasma TV as it ’s big enough to be of substantial viewing size , even if we ’re 10 or more feet from the TV .
It ’s also small enough that it wo n’t be a problem getting it down the tight staircase to our basement .
The only reason I have n’t pulled the trigger on a big new TV up until now is that buying a new TV is extremely expensive .
Even up until a year or so ago 50 ″ plasma
TVs could run you anywhere from $ 1000 - 2000 or more .
Being frugal in nature as I am I had no desire to spend that much money on a television .
We set a price point we wanted to pay , and saved up that cash in our online savings account so we would be ready when we did find a deal .
Finding A Deal Is n’t As Hard As You Might Think
While I did n’t want to spend more than a thousand dollars on a TV , I did n’t give up on the dream of having a big screen TV in our basement .
I just decided to get creative and see if we could find the TV we were looking for , at a discount .
It is n’t as hard to do as you might think , and you can do it too if you ’re looking to purchase a high ticket item .
It can save you a lot of money .
Here ’s the process I usually follow to save my family hundreds of dollars on our big purchases .
Research the item that you ’re looking for at many different stores :
Look around at a ton of different local and online stores to find a good price on the item you ’re looking for .
Often different stores will have the same item for vastly different prices .
The internet has made this process a whole lot easier , as well .
You can search through sites like CamelCamelCamel , froogle.com , pricewatch.com , pricegrabber.com and a ton of other helpful sites .
Keep searching until you find a good price .
Sometime this may take a while , but be patient .
( Do n’t settle for just a good price .
Check out reviews on the item you ’re buying to make sure it is worth your money ! )
Once you ’ve found a good price , see if they offer additional discounts for buying the TV online :
If you ’ve found the item you ’re looking for at a bricks and mortar store location , check out the company ’s website or online store .
Often you ’ll find that the online price is a lot lower than the in - store price .
Often buying from a website ( like amazon.com ) means you wo n’t have to pay taxes as well .
See if any manufacturers are offering mail in rebates or discounts :
Even if you ’ve found an item on sale sometimes the manufacturer or the store will have additional mail in rebates and discounts that you can take advantage of .
Search the store ’s “ rebates ” section , or do a google search to see if you ’re missing anything .
Find store coupons by searching online :
When buying online ( and sometimes even in - store ) you can find store coupons to save an additional percentage off of your purchase .
Often times the discounts are stackable on top of sale prices .
For example , when we recently bought a new home computer we saved 10 % off the price by buying a coupon code off of Ebay for $ 5 .
Using the coupon saved us $ 50 .
Find coupon codes and physical coupons through Ebay , retailmenot.com and other coupon websites .
Find other cash back discounts online : A lot of online stores , and some physical stores have cash back programs to save you extra money on your purchases .
Sites like Honey and Rakuten.com have cash back programs that will give you cash back on your purchase of anywhere from 1 % up to 10 % or more when you buy through them .
Each store has specific savings that you can receive and they vary widely .
My new favorite cash back site , however , is the bing.com cash back program .
It seems that right now their cash back percentages are extremely high for some stores .
For example shopping at sears.com you can save anywhere from 4 % - 32 % off your purchase price in cash back savings .
The one caveat with the cash back programs is that often you have to wait a while to cash out your savings , or reach a certain payout level to get cash back .
On larger purchases this usually is n’t a problem , however .
Find other non-cash discounts or incentives :
You can often find non cash rebates or incentives to buy certain items .
Gas cards , gift certificates and other incentives are frequently given out by mail in rebate .
Do some searches of the site ’s rebate section or of online rebate sites to see if there is anything available .
Pick up your item to save on shipping :
You an often pick up an item purchased online instead of having it shipped .
Sometimes this can save you a good chunk of change if you bought a large or heavy item like a TV .
As you can see , if you spend a little bit of time researching the item you ’re looking for , and finding miscellaneous discounts and rebates , you can find some great deals on a lot of things you buy .
Getting A Deal On Our New TV
It ’s easy enough for me to say that you can easily find a deal , but it ’s another thing to actually do it in practice .
So I thought I would share our experience in buying our new 50 ″ plasma TV , and how we managed to get it for a lot less than other people were paying for it .
We were searching for a 50 ″ plasma television .
We searched prices across a variety of stores and found that we would be able to get one that fit our needs for between $ 850 and $ 1000 .
Several stores were having sales reducing the prices of their TVs below $ 1000 .
After narrowing our options down to a few models we settled on one particular TV at Sears .
The TV was normally $ 999 , but was currently on sale through the weekend because of a sale on TVs 50 ″ and bigger .
So right off the bat the sale slashed the price to $ 799.99 .
Already we ’re saving $ 200 off the price .
Next we found that the TV was cut in price by an additional 10 % because there was another special sale on LG brand TVs .
The savings were stackable , so that means we saved another $ 80 off the price .
Total price before taxes was $ 719.99 , about $ 770 after taxes .
This is probably where most people stop the process and just buy the TV because $ 770 is a pretty good deal on a TV of this size .
But not me .
I want to find where else I can save .
After doing a search online for further coupon or rebate savings I found that the Bing.com search engine now has a cash back shopping tool that allows you to save money when you shop at certain stores .
I found that Sears was one of the stores and incredibly they currently had a deal where you could save an additional 16 % in cash back when you shop at sears.com through their sponsored link .
I jumped at that opportunity , which saved us an additional $ 115 in cash back rebates .
That cuts the TV price to $ 655 .
That ’s an amazing deal on this TV by any account .
But i was n’t done yet .
One last thing that i decided to try before jumping on this deal was to see if there were any special rebates being offered by LG or Sears for purchasing this TV .
I found another rebate online that gave people who purchased a 50 ″ or 60 ″ LG plasma TV a pre-paid discover gas card .
For my particular TV you could get a $ 75 gas card by mail in rebate from LG .
We buy gas anyways , so getting a $ 75 gas card is just another $ 75 in savings !
Cut that off our price and you have a final price on this TV of $ 580 .
I found that I could also save another 5 % off on this TV if I opened a Sears credit card , but I did n’t want to do that .
( Left another $ 30 - 40 in savings on the table there )
So once again , here ’s how it broke down :
$ 999.99 – Regular Price
-$ 200 50 ″ + TV sale discount
-$ 80 extra online discount for LG brand TVs
$ 719.99 final price .
( add tax and it was $ 770 ) Other “ found ” discounts
-$ 115 ( 16 % discount for buying through bing.com search engine )
-$ 75 Special LG TV buyer gas card rebate ( it ’s a discover gas card , but we buy gas anyway so we ’ll still be saving this money )
Final price after all discounts , rebates , cash back and gas cards :
$ 580 with tax included - $ 470 in discounts !
So we ’re extremely happy with the deal we got on this TV .
We ended up saving almost $ 500 off of the retail price just by doing a little bit extra leg work and internet searching .
You can do the same thing next time you buy something expensive !
Have you recently made a good purchase where you saved some extra money by doing the extra legwork ?

Half a dozen new cases of " exploding iPhones " have emerged in France , as Apple faced an official inquiry and calls to come clean over possible risks linked to its wildly popular smartphone .
An 80 - year - old pensioner from the Paris suburbs said his iPhone screen cracked up in his hands , a day after a supermarket watchman claimed he was hurt in the eye when his screen suddenly shattered this week .
Ten French consumers have now come forward saying their iPhone screens exploded or cracked without explanation , according to an AFP tally , including a first case in mid-August in which a teenager suffered an eye injury .
Apple is accused of trying to hush up 15 cases of iPod music players heating up and bursting into flames in the United States and in one similar British case , all apparently due to overheated lithium ion batteries .
None of the incidents has caused a serious injury but Apple was forced to defend the safety of its flagship smartphone before the European Union this month , insisting the exploding screen cases were " isolated incidents " .
Last year I joined the library at the University of Texas , Austin , and rediscovered a literary form I had n't encountered much since my student days : readers ' inscriptions in the margins of library books .
The conventions of the genre are simple : you state something obvious in a fragmentary / declaratory style , adding a question mark , exclamation mark or ellipsis according to the degree of confidence you have in your perceptions .
The classic example would be my discovery of the astonishing critical insight " Satan is the hero " inscribed alongside one of Lucifer 's speeches in a secondhand copy of Paradise Lost .
What motivates readers to write such unnecessary , moronic comments in the margins ?
My guess is that since most students are young and inexperienced , they find it reassuring to physically capture the first ' critical ' comment that flops into their heads as a method of coping with the fact that they are totally out of their depth .
Thanks to UT library , I have recently made several exciting discoveries in the genre .
Apocalypses by Eugen Weber is an excellent history of 2000 - plus years of End of Times thinking , but reading it would n't have been the same experience without the sarcastic remarks about dead prophets an earlier reader had scrawled throughout the book .
Next to Weber 's account of 12th - century monk Joachim of Fiore 's idea that history progresses through three stages towards an era of universal felicity , this acerbic critic had written : " Looks like old Joachim was full of beans ! "
Reading his many other crappy quips , I suspected he had checked Apocalypses out purely for the purpose of displaying his contempt for religion .
If his posturing before an unseen audience of future readers had been funny , I would have forgiven him .
Instead , it was a tedious display of ego , like being stuck in traffic behind a car covered in bumper stickers broadcasting the driver 's views on everything from Iraq to the success of his kids at high school .
I encountered a more interesting example of margin prose in an essay by historian Pauline Moffitt Watts on Christopher Columbus 's obsession with his role as harbinger of the Last Days .
It 's easy to find evidence of this in Columbus 's later life : he edited an anthology of apocalyptic texts called The Book of Prophecies , and asked his royal sponsors to support him in a new crusade for the liberation of Jerusalem prior to Christ 's imminent return .
However , in order to establish that the younger Columbus also longed for the End , Watts turned to a manuscript in his personal library , which he had used while preparing his first voyage .
Columbus had filled the sections on the apocalypse with comments and drawings , such as a big hand pointing at the ' seven signs ' of Antichrist .
Thus , by studying Columbus 's notations in the margins of another man 's book ( and combining it with other evidence ) , Watts claimed to have revealed the apocalyptic bent of his mind prior to the first voyage in 1492 , arguing that he had always hoped his discovery of a passage to the Indies was part of the drama of the Second Coming .
From a personal perspective , however , the most fascinating example of margin prose I have encountered was inside a first edition of Alone Through the Forbidden Land , by Gustav Krist , published in 1938 .
The book is an account of an Austrian adventurer 's clandestine journey through the states of Soviet Central Asia in the mid 1920s .
At first , the marginal author was quite restrained .
To Krist 's claim that the few Europeans who visited Bukhara prior to its absorption into the USSR were usually sold into slavery or executed , he responded with a simple " ? "
Soon , however , his comments took a turn for the pedantic .
He disputed Krist 's claim that the journey from Barfurush in Persia to Meshed i Sar on the Caspian Sea is a " 27 or 28 mile ride " with " ?
Why 28 ?
It is only 8 . " ( Actually , according to the Encyclopaedia Britannica it 's 15 . )
Later , when he was especially irritated , he resorted to frustrated outbursts : " Nonsense ! "
Or simply : " !!! "
And : " ??? "
But Krist 's book is a colourful , subjective memoir , written years after the events he described .
Only a fool would expect total accuracy .
This invisible dullard was misreading it so he could brag to an unseen audience : " I know better . "
And still I was sceptical .
Central Asia in the 1920s was closed even to Soviet citizens from outside the region .
Very few westerners had visited the places Krist saw before they were absorbed into the USSR , and even fewer would see them over the next seven decades .
I assumed the marginal author was critiquing Krist not from experience but from a dry overfamiliarity with other texts – until I read this passage from Krist :
" The Bukhara that I knew had been an independent state under its own Amir .
It had been forced to permit Russian soldiers in its frontier towns , but had successfully prevented the entry of any European into the Holy City itself . "
To which the phantom reader replied : " !
I have lived there as often as I wanted . "
Suddenly , I realised that he was not some petty , sniping boor but , rather , another eyewitness .
Texas is not exactly awash with English - speaking European refugees from central Asia , and it was even less so before 1991 .
Nor am I aware of any early - 20th - century memoir of Bukhara written by a rancher , oilman or even UT academic .
So who was he ?
Alas , no answer can be found in the annotations he made to Krist 's book .
Nevertheless , as I read the rest of the book , this marginal author changed from a nuisance to a haunting presence ; a shadow reader peering over my shoulder .
I experienced his notes and Krist 's text as a discussion between two experts , tinged with bitterness and jealousy on the part of the Texan , whose experience had not been preserved for posterity .
So when Krist writes , " The Bukharans had a few pieces of artillery , " and the Texan angrily snaps " Two " , I am fascinated but also frustrated .
I want to know more , but these scattered , anonymous fragments in the margins of another man 's book are all that remains of the mysterious Texan of Bukhara .
US commander ’s report paves way for military escalation in Afghanistan
By Tom Eley
2 September 2009
The commander of US and NATO forces in Afghanistan , Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal , has issued a dire assessment of the state of military operations there .
The classified report sets the stage for an expansion of US troop levels in Afghanistan by as many as 45,000 .
McChrystal ’s report , which was immediately endorsed by the chief of the US Central Command , Gen. David Petraeus , is to be handed over to President Barack Obama today .
According to press reports , McChrystal ’s review makes no specific request for additional troops .
However , according to Tuesday ’s New York Times , American officials said “ it effectively lays the groundwork for such a request in the coming weeks . ”
After sending his report to Gen. Petraeus , McChrystal issued a statement declaring , “ The situation in Afghanistan is serious , but success is achievable and demands a revised implementation strategy , commitment and resolve , and increased unity of effort . ”
An adviser to McChrystal , speaking to the McClatchy News Service on condition of anonymity , was more blunt .
“ It says that this could get much worse unless we invest ourselves in this now , ” he said .
The report , which is just over ten pages long , admits that it will take a number of years before the US can create a functional Afghan security force .
Congressional leaders are to be briefed on the report , once it is approved by Defense Secretary Robert Gates , but they will not be given copies of the document .
The Obama White House immediately signaled its inclination to approve an increase in US troop levels above the 21,000 additional troops Obama approved last February .
Robert Gibbs , the White House press secretary , said Monday , “ There ’s broad agreement that for many years our effort in Afghanistan has been under - resourced politically , militarily and economically . ”
The Times noted that Gibbs used the term “ under - resourced ” six times in the course of his daily briefing .
According to press reports , the substance of discussions within the Obama administration is whether to increase troop levels by 20,000 or 40,000 - 45,000 .
The escalation already approved by the Obama administration will bring US troops levels to 68,000 and combined NATO military forces to 100,000 by the end of this year .
There are also reports that McChrystal and Petraeus are demanding greater operational independence for military commanders in Afghanistan from civilian control .
The McClatchy article summarized the thoughts of McChrystal ’s aide , referring to a “ streamlining of the military ’s command structure [ because ] too much bureaucracy is making it difficult for commanders to make decisions on the ground . ”
In an opinion piece published Monday in the Washington Post , Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies , a leading Washington military / security think tank , wrote that McChrystal and US Ambassador to Afghanistan Karl Eikenberry ( himself a former military commander in Afghanistan ) “ can win only if they are allowed to manage both the civil and military sides of the conflict without constant micromanagement from Washington or traveling envoys . ”
The Guardian notes that officers such as McChrystal view “ the effort of the last eight years [ as ] wasted . ”
Cordesman shares this view , asserting that Washington “ never provided the forces , money or leadership necessary to win , effectively wasting more than half a decade . ”
This amounts to the demand for a carte blanche for the US military to intensify the killing in Afghanistan in order to drown popular opposition to the US - led occupation in blood .
It is also an implicit challenge to the Obama administration and Congress and to the constitutional principle of civilian control of the military .
Highlighting the growing independence of the military from civilian control , an anonymous “ senior military official ” told the McClatchy News Service that McChrystal and Petraeus have been “ pressuring ” Obama to commit additional troops .
“ The official said that retired Marine Gen. James Jones , Obama ’s national security adviser , told McChrystal last month not to ask for more troops , but that McChrystal went ahead anyway and indicated in interviews that he may need more , ” McClatchy reported .
The security situation for the US in both Afghanistan and Pakistan is indeed in a perilous state .
August was the bloodiest month for the US and NATO since the war began .
The US lost 49 soldiers in August and US and NATO forces overall suffered 77 deaths .
August ’s death toll has already made 2009 the worst year for US and NATO military casualties since the onset of the war in October of 2001 .
The Afghan war is now the second longest in US history .
Despite a US offensive against Taliban strongholds in the South of Afghanistan , press reports cite military officials who acknowledge that the Taliban is gaining strength in the North and West of the country .
There are no reliable statistics for the number of Afghans who have been killed as a result of the US - led invasion and occupation .
But civilian deaths have soared in recent months , according to the United Nations , and the death toll is undoubtedly in the tens of thousands .
Media commentators assert that the thrust of McChrystal ’s report is about “ protecting the Afghan people against the Taliban , ” as Britain ’s Guardian put it .
The New York Times wrote that “ the overriding goal of American and NATO forces would not be so much to kill Taliban insurgents as to make ordinary Afghans feel secure . ”
These are contemptible lies .
The report presages an intensification of US military violence , increasingly directed against popular opposition to the US - led colonial occupation .
Recent polls taken in Afghanistan show massive opposition to the foreign occupiers and their puppet government in Kabul .
McChrystal is associated with the “ unconventional ” methods of imperialist counterinsurgency warfare , including the use of assassinations and torture .
He was long the commander of what Newsweek called “ the most secretive force in the US military , ” the Joint Special Operations Command , whose unit in Iraq has been accused of abuse of prisoners at Camp Nama .
The unit is believed to have played a critical role in the assassination program that targeted Iraqi tribal leaders supportive of the anti-US insurgency .
McChrystal ’s report is being considered in the context of the recent Afghan election , which Obama hailed as a major “ milestone ” for the nation , but which is now widely acknowledged to be mired in vote - rigging and fraud by incumbent President Hamid Karzai .
The American press is rife with commentaries warning that the election debacle will further inflame ethnic and regional tensions and increase the power of the Taliban - led insurgency against a puppet regime seen to be illegitimate by large sections of the Afghan population .
There are mounting indications that Washington is preparing to dispense with Karzai .
The New York Times warned on Tuesday of “ Mr. Obama ’s entanglement with an Afghan government widely viewed as corrupt and illegitimate . ”
Ominously for Karzai , the Times wrote that the election farce has left the US “ with little hope for a credible partner in the war once the results are final . ”
A senior advisor to McChrystal , David Kilcullen , recently pinned the blame for the crisis confronting the occupation squarely on Karzai .
“ A government that is losing to a counter - insurgency is n’t being outfought , it is being out - governed .
And that ’s what ’s happening in Afghanistan , ” Kilcullen said in an interview with Australia ’s National Press Club .
Karzai could be jettisoned through a second round of elections , which will be held sometime later this year if no candidate is credited with winning 50 percent of the vote in the initial poll .
With just under half of the ballots tallied , Karzai has been allocated about 46 percent of the vote .
He would face Abdullah Abdullah , a former government minister under Karzai , in a runoff .
Karzai might also be sidelined by the US installing a new executive officer to oversee the day - to - day operations of the government in Kabul .
But the incumbent president , despite his pliant service to Washington since he was installed in 2002 , might meet a worse end .
Over the past several months , media commentators and figures close to the US military occupation have compared Karzai to the US stooge dictator of South Vietnam , Ngo Dinh Diem .
President John F. Kennedy approved Diem ’s removal and assassination in November of 1963 , less than three weeks before Kennedy was himself assassinated .
The CIA coup against Diem set the stage for the massive military escalation and full - scale war that was launched by Kennedy ’s successor , Lyndon B. Johnson .
Whatever Karzai ’s fate , Obama ’s Afghanistan policy is bringing his administration into conflict with the US population , which increasingly opposes the war .
A CBS News poll released Tuesday reveals a dramatic decline in public support for Obama ’s war policy .
Forty - eight percent of Americans approve of Obama ’s handling of the war , a decline from 56 percent in April .
More than four in ten Americans want to see US troops start coming home , up from only 24 percent in February .
The CBS poll substantiates findings of a Washington Post / ABC News poll released August 20 , which showed majority opposition to the war and an even larger percentage opposed to any increase in US troop levels .
Opposition to the Afghanistan war has mounted in spite of unanimous support for the war within the political establishment .
Moreover , unlike the war in Iraq , popular opposition to the Afghanistan war has mounted despite the absence of any organized opposition by the so - called “ anti- war ” groups which campaigned for Obama ’s election and continue to back his administration .
Some voices within the ruling elite fear the political implications of the emergence of an anti-war movement independent of the Democratic Party and its middle - class front groups , and entertain doubts about the feasibility of subjugating Afghanistan .
According to media accounts citing anonymous White House sources , Vice President Joseph Biden has argued against substantial troop increases in Afghanistan on these grounds .
Defense Secretary Gates expressed concerns to Bloomberg News over “ the implications of significant additional forces in terms of the foreign footprint in Afghanistan , whether the Afghans will see this as us becoming more of an occupier … ”
There can be little doubt , however , that Obama will accede to McChrystal ’s demands .
In his presidential campaign , Obama staked his entire foreign policy on expanding the US military presence in Afghanistan and defeating the anti-US insurgency .
Obama , no less than his predecessor Bush , is an instrument of the American ruling elite , which is conducting wars of aggression in Iraq and Afghanistan and intervening militarily in Pakistan in order to secure its imperialist aims in the Middle East and Central Asia .
These center on gaining control over the regions ’ vast energy resources and establishing military and geo-political dominance over these strategic areas .
The prospect of endless war , untold death and destruction for populations targeted by the US and a further tragic loss of American lives can be ended only through the independent mobilization of the working class in the US and internationally against the Obama administration and both parties of American imperialism .

IE6 is still used by nearly 20 % of users Microsoft has underlined support for its Internet Explorer 6 web browser , despite acknowledging its flaws .
The software giant said it would support IE6 until 2014 - four years beyond the original deadline .
Critics - some of which have started an online campaign - want the eight - year - old browser mothballed because they claim it slows the online experience .
" Friends do not let friends use IE6 , " said Amy Barzdukas , Microsoft 's general manager for Internet Explorer .
" If you are in my social set and I have been to your house for dinner , you are not using IE6 , " she said .
" But it is much more complicated when you move into a business setting . "
" It 's hard to be cavalier in this economy and say 'oh it 's been around for so long they need to upgrade , ' " Ms Barzdukas told journalists in San Francisco ..
Web monitoring firms estimate that 15 - 20 % of people still use IE6 to browse the web .
Enough is enough Among those speaking out against IE6 is a group of more than 70 developers who have banded together to form a project called ie6nomore .
" Enough is enough , " they implore on their website .
Justin.tv says its amazed at how the anti IE6 campaign has taken off " Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 was released in late 2001 .
For its time , it was a decent browser , but in 2009 , it is still in use by a significant portion of the web population , and its time is now up . "
" Web developers hate IE6 , " said Evan Solomon of Justin.tv , one of the backers of the campaign .
" We are passionate because we run a website and something like 10 % of our users use IE6 , but our web designers and developers have to spend a lot of time debugging for the platform .
" The other issue for us is that we have launched an API to let people build applications and while our goal is to make it as easy as possible for people to do this , IE6 is a barrier , " Mr Solomon told BBC News .
In a blog post in response to such campaigns , the software giant said that while this issue is a simple one for technology enthusiasts , " the choice to upgrade software on a PC belongs to the person responsible for the PC " .
" Many PCs do n't belong to individual enthusiasts , but to organisations .
The backdrop might be a factory floor or hospital ward or school lab or government organisation , each with its own business applications , " wrote Dean Hachamovitch , general manager for the browser group .
" Dropping support for IE6 is not an option because we committed to supporting the IE included with Windows for the lifespan of the product . "
" Best experience " Despite the renewed commitment , Microsoft said it would prefer people to move to IE8 , which it says comes with improved functionality and security .
IE8 has been downloaded roughly 250,000 times since its March release " We want people to have the best experience they can have on Microsoft software , " said Ms Barzdukas .
" If people get frustrated with that experience and they say ' Microsoft stinks and IE stinks ' and they 're basing that on technology that was designed nearly a decade ago , well yeah that is concerning . "
Industry watchers believe , that despite Microsoft 's backing , IE6's days are numbered .
" IE6 will just die away anyway , " said Harry McCracken , editor and founder of tech news site Technologizer .
" I only have around 7 % of people who visit my site using IE6 and it will just dwindle away no matter what anyone does , " he said .
Threat Microsoft 's touting of IE8 comes as browser competition intensifies .
The most immediate threat to Microsoft 's 68 % market share comes in the shape of Mozilla 's Firefox - used by 22 % of browsers .
Firefox , introduced in 2004 , recently claimed its one billionth download " The competition Microsoft has to worry about right now is Firefox .
Not just from a market share perspective but from an innovation perspective because their plug-ins work really well , " Ronald Gruia , a principal analyst with Frost & Sullivan told BBC News .
" In the future they have to look out for Google with its Chrome browser , " he said .
" The main concern there for Microsoft is the rise in cloud computing and software as a service .
Google is becoming very effective at delivering applications in the cloud and therefore poses a huge threat to Microsoft . "
" This is the best time to be a browser user because there is so much choice , " agreed Mr McCracken .
" Almost anyone on the planet who uses the web uses Google and that gives them a powerful way to market Chrome .
They started with the browser and now they have the Chrome operating system as an even more direct attack on Microsoft 's core business .
" My guess is Mozilla is what it is and that battle is , in some way , over .
Chrome does n't have a huge market share at the moment , but if I was Microsoft I would be worried about Google making Chrome really big . " said Mr McCracken .
Such issues did not seem to trouble Ms Barzdukas .
" IE is still the most broadly used browser in the world .
We are focused and we are here to play . "
" Clearly Google is a very strong technology company with a number of offerings across the internet space but beyond that , I do n't have a comment on them as a browser vendor in particular , " stated Ms Barzdukas .

Calley maintains that he was following orders from his superior
The US army officer convicted for his part in the notorious My Lai massacre during the Vietnam War has offered his first public apology , a US report says .
" There is not a day that goes by that I do not feel remorse for what happened , " Lt William Calley was quoted as saying by the Columbus Ledger - Enquirer .
He was addressing a small group at a community club in Columbus , Georgia .
Calley , 66 , was convicted on 22 counts of murder for the 1968 massacre of 500 men , women and children in Vietnam .
Cold blood " I feel remorse for the Vietnamese who were killed , for their families , for the American soldiers involved and their families .
I am very sorry , " the former US platoon commander said on Wednesday .
The My Lai massacre was a turning point in the Vietnam War He was sentenced to life in prison for his role in the killings in 1971 .
Then - US President Richard Nixon commuted his sentence to three years ' house arrest .
But Calley insisted that he was only following orders , the paper reported .
He broke his silence after accepting a friend 's invitation to speak at the weekly meeting of the Kiwanis Club , a US - based global voluntary organisation .
At the time of the killings , the US soldiers had been on a " search and destroy " mission to root out communist fighters in what was fertile Viet Cong territory .
Although the enemy was nowhere to be seen , the US soldiers of Charlie Company rounded up unarmed civilians and gunned them down .
When the story of My Lai was exposed , more than a year later , it tarnished the name of the US army and proved to be a turning point for public opinion about the Vietnam War .

An empty ground floor bedsit within a block of condemned social housing on a 1960s council estate was subjected to a dramatic toxic takeover engineered by the English artist Roger Hiorns over the summer of 2008 .
Copper sulphate powder was mixed with boiling water to make 75,000 litres of highly saturated solution .
The solution was pumped into the sealed - off flat until each room was filled right up to the ceiling .
After a month of cooling down , the liquid was siphoned off to reveal a startling transformation .
Hidden from the human eye and without any human intervention , an extraordinary sculpture had formed .
A growth of blue crystals had colonised every surface of the bedsit .
With the exception of the crystallised bath , no sign of human habitation was visible .
The transformation of the interior into a beautiful , alien world was total .
Entering the bedsit through an adjacent empty dwelling , in small groups , visitors became immersed in a mesmerising and claustrophobic cave - the crystals were sharp - edged and pointed menacingly towards the visitor .
Seizure exerted a strong magnetic pull on nearby communities and visitors from much further afield .
Initially open for a three - month period in the autumn of 2008 , Seizure re-opened the following year when Southwark Council ’s plans to demolish the block and redevelop the site were delayed .
The presumption had always been that the demolition of the site would mean the demise of the sculpture .
Hiorns eventually decided to remove Seizure in its totality from its South London site and relocate it elsewhere .
The sculpture was moved to Yorkshire Sculpture Park where , as part of the Arts Council Collection , it can now be visited inside a specially designed new structure .
The title of the work work refers both to the aggressive colonising of the site by the crystals and the sense of an arrested project .
Seizure was Hiorns 's first major project within an urban setting and marked a significant shift in scale and context from his earlier work .
It earned Hiorns a nomination for the Turner Prize in 2009 .

Quartz , like sand , is made up of oxygen and the stuff of chips : silicon
Spruce Pine , a modest , charmingly low - key town in the Blue Ridge mountains of North Carolina , is at the heart of a global billion - dollar industry .
Although this Mitchell County community calls itself the Mineral City , with just 2,000 residents one could dispute the city status .
But when it comes to minerals , Spruce Pine has definitely undersold itself .
The jewellery shops , highlighting local emeralds , sapphires and amethysts , hint at the riches .
The mountains , however , contain something far more precious than gemstones : they are a source of high - purity quartz .
This ultra - pure mineral is essential for building most of the world 's silicon chips - without which you would n't be reading this article .
Geologist Alex Glover , of Active Minerals International , drove me to a disused mine to see this quartz for myself .
Our jeep bumped across dried creek beds for miles until we reached two cathedral - like caverns of rock at Hoot Owl mine .
The rocks contain feldspar , silvery flakes of mica , flashes of garnet and smoky veins of quartz .
" Fifty years ago men were throwing away the quartz , " explained Mr Glover .
It 's the most valuable strategic square acreage on the planet
Ira Thomas
Spruce Pine Gem Mine
" But now it 's prized and quartz is the high value item .
These are the only places that this quartz is found on the planet . "
Spruce Pine quartz is considered the best in the world and can sell for up to $ 50,000 ( £ 30,000 ) a tonne .
It is made , like all quartz , of silicon and oxygen but the process of making a computer chip does not rely on its silicon ; that can be obtained from common sand .
The clue to why quartz is needed is in the process of making a silicon wafer .
These wafers are CD - sized slices of silicon upon which the chips are then etched with electronic circuitry .
Salami slicing
To make wafers , a seed crystal of silicon is heated to high temperatures in a giant mixing bowl until the molten , silvery metal can be stretched slowly upwards .
" It looks like a long cylinder , a bit like a salami , " said Bob Carland , director of the Minerals Research Laboratory at North Carolina State University .
" As it comes out of this bowl , it all has one crystal and so everything is aligned the same way .
The metal cylinder is then laid down and cut with a diamond saw into slices of salami - in this case it 's slices of silicon wafers . "
For these wafers to be made into silicon chips , the mixing bowls or crucibles must be as " clean " as possible .
Silicon wafer manufacture starts with a " seed " crystal of the element " Any slight defect on the inside of that crucible will be transmitted and get sliced up into the chips , " Mr Carland said .
" The amount of impurities in that chip is incredibly important .
People producing these wafers will then have a lot of rejects so it 's important that the chemistry of that bowl is near perfect . "
Spruce Pine 's high - purity quartz fits this requirement .
It not only gets used for crucibles , but for benches and other instruments that produce the chips .
These chips are essential for today 's modern world , but outside the industry , few people are aware of its dependence on quartz .
Unimin , one of the main mining corporations in the area , prefers to remain modest .
It politely declines any interview , unwilling to reveal how it extracts quartz from the mountains .
Seen from the air , the scale of the operation reveals itself .
The quartz mines are enormous , stretching down mountain faces in tiers of rock ending in pools of white sand .
' Serious commodity '
It 's a far cry from how the mountain folk made their living .
Sixty - eight - year - old Ira Thomas is a ninth - generation miner who used to dig up aquamarines and prospect for mica as a child .
He now runs the Spruce Pine Gem Mine , a jewellery shop near the scenic Blue Ridge Parkway , and is saddened by the loss of community among those who mine for quartz in industrial quantities .
" We have these huge corporations that have come in and bought out the little mom-and - pop operations , " he said .
" These guys were just people like me that were lucky enough to lease a property that had minable quantities of whatever was on it . "
Native Americans first mined these mountains but it was the arrival of a railroad in 1912 that gave later settlers the chance to exploit mica , feldspar and quartz on a much larger scale .
Shiny mica is chipped from rock made of feldspar and grey quartz Today , in Mitchell County , one in 15 people works within the mining industry .
" That quartz plant just two miles down the road , " he added , " is guarded like Fort Knox .
That 's a top - secret process .
So we 've got a serious commodity here . "
He 's right .
The quartz plants are protected by security guards , gates and cameras and no one from the mining companies is allowed to talk to outsiders .
Lowell Presnell , historian and author of Mines , Miners and Minerals of Western North Carolina , is n't surprised .
" With the competition in the world today , they have to be really strict , " Mr Presnell said , " because if they let their secrets out , somebody else is going to be doing this and they 'll undercut their price . "
There are also valuable jobs at stake .
Since 2000 , Mitchell County has lost a third of its manufacturing base and unemployment is at 14 % .
North Carolina may be famous for its mountain folk and bluegrass music , but the mines are the only industry it has left .
So far , it is safe .
Synthetic quartz is economically too expensive to take the place of Spruce Pine 's high - purity mineral .
" It 's the most valuable strategic square acreage on the planet , " Mr Thomas said .
" Because the world runs on computers , we all know that now .
And if we locked the gates to Mitchell County they could not make any more computers . "
Sue Nelson presents Chips with Everything on BBC Radio 4 at 9 pm on Monday 3 August .

Ten LINQ Myths
Here are ten root causes of the most common misunderstandings — distilled from many hundreds of questions on the LINQ forums .
Myth #
1
All LINQ queries must start with the ‘ var ’ keyword .
In fact , the very purpose of the ‘ var ’ keyword is to start a LINQ query !
The var keyword and LINQ queries are separate concepts .
The purpose of var is to let the compiler guess what type you want for a local variable declaration ( implicit typing ) .
For example , the following : var s = " Hello " ; is precisely equivalent to : string s = " Hello " ; because the compiler infers that s is a string .
Similarly , the following query : string [ ] people = new [ ] { " Tom " , " Dick " , " Harry " } ; var filtered People = people .
Where ( p => p. Length > 3 ) ; is precisely equivalent to : string [ ] people = new [ ] { " Tom " , " Dick " , " Harry " } ; IEnumerable < string > filtered People = people .
Where ( p => p. Length > 3 ) ; You can see here that all that we 're achieving with var is to abbreviate IEnumerable < string >.
Some people like this because it cuts clutter ; others argue that implicit typing can make it less clear what 's going on .
Now , there are times when a LINQ query necessitates the use of var .
This is when projecting an anonymous type : string [ ] people = new [ ] { " Tom " , " Dick " , " Harry " } ; var filtered People = people .
Select ( p => new { Name = p , p. Length } ) ;
Here is an example of using an anonymous type outside the context of LINQ query : var person = new { Name = " Foo " , Length=3 } ;
Myth #
2
All LINQ queries must use query syntax .
There are two kinds of syntax for queries : lambda syntax and query syntax ( or query comprehension syntax ) .
Here 's an example of lambda syntax : string [ ] people = new [ ] { " Tom " , " Dick " , " Harry " } ; var filtered People = people .
Where ( p => p. Length > 3 ) ; Here 's the same thing expressed in query syntax : string [ ] people = new [ ] { " Tom " , " Dick " , " Harry " } ; var filtered People = from p in people where p. Length > 3 select p ; Logically , the compiler translates query syntax into lambda syntax .
This means that everything that can be expressed in query syntax can also be expressed in lambda syntax .
Query syntax can be a lot simpler , though , with queries that involve more than one range variable .
( In this example , we used just a single range variable , p , so the two syntaxes were similarly simple ) .
Not all operators are supported in query syntax , so the two syntax styles are complementary .
For the best of both worlds , you can mix query styles in a single statement ( see Myth # 5 for an example ) .
Myth #
3
To retrieve all customers from the customer table , you must perform a query similar to the following :
var query = from c in db .
Customers select c ;
The expression : from c in db .
Customers select c is a frivolous query !
You can simply go : db .
Customers Similarly , the following LINQ to XML query : var xe = from e in myXDocument .
Descendants ( " phone " ) select e ; can be simplified to : var xe = myXDocument .
Descendants ( " phone " ) ;
And this : Customer customer = ( from c in db .
Customers where c.ID == 123 select c ) . Single ( ) ; can be simplified to : Customer customer = db. Customers .
Single ( c => c.ID == 123 ) ;
Myth #
4
To reproduce a SQL query in LINQ , you must make the LINQ query look as similar as possible to the SQL query .
LINQ and SQL are different languages that employ very different concepts .
Possibly the biggest barrier in becoming productive with LINQ is the " thinking in SQL " syndrome : mentally formulating your queries in SQL and then transliterating them into LINQ .
The result is that you 're constantly fighting the API !
Once you start thinking directly in LINQ , your queries will often bear little resemblance to their SQL counterparts .
In many cases , they 'll be radically simpler , too .
Myth #
5
To do joins efficiently in LINQ , you must use the join keyword .
This is true , but only when querying local collections .
When querying a database , the join keyword is completely unnecessary : all ad - hoc joins can be accomplished using multiple from clauses and subqueries .
Multiple from clauses and subqueries are more versatile too : you can also perform non-equi-joins .
Better still , in LINQ to SQL and Entity Framework , you can query association properties , alleviating the need to join altogether !
For instance , here 's how to retrieve the names and IDs of all customers who have made no purchases : from c in db .
Customers where !
c. Purchases .
Any ( ) select new { c.ID , c. Name }
Or , to retrieve customers who have made no purchases over $ 1000 : from c in db .
Customers where !c. Purchases .
Any ( p => p. Price > 1000 ) select new { c.ID , c. Name } Notice that we 're mixing fluent and query syntax .
See LINQPad for more examples on association properties , manual joins , and mixed - syntax queries .
Myth #6
Because SQL emits flat result sets , LINQ queries must be structured to emit flat result sets , too .
This is a consequence of Myth # 4 .
One of LINQ 's big benefits is that you can : Query a structured object graph through association properties ( rather than having to manually join )
Project directly into object hierarchies
The two are independent , although 1 helps 2 .
For example , if you want to retrieve the names of customers in the state of WA along with all their purchases , you can simply do the following : from c in db .
Customers where c.State == " WA " select new { c. Name , c. Purchases // An EntitySet ( collection ) }
The hierarchical result from this query is much easier to work with than a flat result set !
We can achieve the same result without association properties as follows : from c in db .
Customers where c.State == " WA " select new { c. Name , Purchases = db .
Purchases .
Where ( p => p.CustomerID == c.ID ) }
Myth #
7
To do outer joins in LINQ to SQL , you must always use DefaultIfEmpty ( ) .
This is true only if you want a flat result set .
The examples in the preceding myth , for instance , translate to a left outer join in SQL , and require no DefaultIfEmpty operator .
Myth #
8
A LINQ to SQL or EF query will be executed in one round - trip only if the query was built in a single step .
LINQ follows a lazy evaluation model , which means queries execute not when constructed , but when enumerated .
This means you can build up a query in as many steps as you like , and it wo n't actually hit the server until you eventually start consuming the results .
For instance , the following query retrieves the names of all customers whose name starts with the letter ' A ' , and who have made at least two purchases .
We build this query in three steps : var query = db.
Customers .
Where ( c => c.Name.StartsWith ( " A " ) ) ; query = query .
Where ( c => c.Purchases .Count( ) >= 2 ) ; var result = query .
Select ( c => c. Name ) ; foreach ( string name in result ) //
Only now is the query executed !
Console .
WriteLine ( name ) ;
Myth #9
A method cannot return a query , if the query ends in the ' new ' operator
The trick is to project into an ordinary named type with an object initializer : public IQueryable < NameDetails > GetCustomerNamesInState ( string state ) { return from c in Customer where c.State == state select new NameDetails { FirstName = c.FirstName , LastName = c.LastName } ; } NameDetails is a class that you 'd define as follows : public class NameDetails { public string FirstName , LastName ; }
Myth # 10
The best way to use LINQ to SQL is to instantiate a single DataContext to a static property , and use that shared instance for the life of the application .
Forty years ago , " The Population Bomb " by biological scientist Paul Ehrlich was published .
At the time , the book caused a considerable stir with its warning that overpopulation could put the future of civilization in grave doubt .
Lately , though , a " baby gap , " a " birth dearth , " a " population bust " have been popular topics .
That 's primarily an issue for Western Europe and Japan , prosperous regions where women do n't have enough babies to maintain population in the long run .
Russia , with widespread health problems and alcoholism , and relatively low life expectancy , finds its population shrinking by 700,000 people each year .
Germany 's population is falling about 100,000 a year .
In fact , the birth rate in 25 developing countries stands at or below the replacement level .
Around the world , birthrates have plunged from 6 per mother in 1972 to about 2.9 today .
Mr. Ehrlich pins this downward trend on government - ­sponsored education ( especially of women ) , new job opportunities for women , new availability of contraceptive information and material , and the higher economic cost of large families .
Some economists suggest a declining population can lead to labor shortages , a weaker tax base , fewer customers for business , and a shaky pension system .
To Ehrlich , though , such problems are far less serious than those rising from the current population " bomb . "
He would like to see the world 's population drop voluntarily over many decades to about 1.5 billion to 2 billion , a number that he reckons is sustainable .
It would allow people both to live in big cities with their cultural advantages or with nature , as they prefer .
Ehrlich 's " Bomb " book led some conservatives to worry about an increased government role in limiting family size .
A survey of 15 conservative scholars in 2005 by Human Events magazine ranked his book No. 11 on a list of the " most harmful books of the 19th and 20th centuries . "
No. 1 was " The Communist Manifesto " by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels .
Others in the Top 10 included Hitler 's " Mein Kampf , " " Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse- tung , " and Alfred Kinsey 's " The Kinsey Report . "
Today , with 2 million copies of his book sold , Ehrlich remains somewhat puzzled why some conservatives would see his book as so damaging since it did n't advocate a drastic government role .
" I do n't get it , " he says in an interview .
At the time of publication of the " Bomb , " the number of people on Earth was about 3.5 billion people .
Today there are nearly twice as many , 6.7 billion , and headed toward 9 billion by 2050 , perhaps more after that .
Already , says Ehrlich , " we have certainly passed the earth 's long - term carrying capacity . "
Global warming is often regarded as one result of too many people .
Water shortages are building not only in California , but also in many nations abroad .
Of immediate concern is evidence of a food crisis in the world .
Food shortages and high food prices have led to deadly riots in Haiti and civil unrest in Egypt .
Ehrlich estimates that 800 million to 1 billion people today do n't have a proper supply of food , many suffering from undernourishment , malnourishment , or worse .
Famine threatens , and the world continues to add 75 million a year to its total population , mostly in Africa , the Middle East , and Asia .
Last Friday , more than 140 countries observed World Population Day in various ways to highlight the role of family planning in reducing poverty , promoting development , and saving the lives of mothers and newborns .
Thoraya Obaid , executive director of the United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) , stated : " When a woman can plan her family , she can plan the rest of her life . "
A group of nongovernmental organizations were to meet in Washington to mark the day .
But a high - level representative of the Bush administration was not expected .
Both Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush imposed what opponents dub the " global gag rule . "
This is a policy that bars US family planning aid to private organizations that so much as support the concept of legal abortion .
Further , the US under Bush refuses to provide any money to the UNFPA on the basis that such funds might be used , say , for abortion in China .
Ehrlich sees a " lack of leadership " in Washington on the population issue , including both from the White House and from those on the campaign trail .
Family planning , as Ehrlich sees it , leads to both fewer abortions of unwanted children and fewer deaths of mothers lacking access to relatively safe abortions .
In his new book , " The Dominant Animal : Human Evolution and the Environment , " Ehrlich and his wife , Anne ( who actually helped write the " Bomb " ) , argue that people are creating a world that threatens " our own species . "
Many people do n't understand the power of exponential growth , he says .
After an extended absence , numerous attempts to fix it and a whole lot of annoying MikeJS , TF2 instagib has been fixed from its post - hat fuckup .
It plays exactly the same as it did before , with a few minor changes –
• Sniper rifle has been replaced with scattergun .
Valve managed to fuck up the way TF2 igib ’s class selection worked , and as such this is the only way to make it work .
The refire rate is the same , so the gameplay is not changed .
It can be changed to pistol , however , if enough people dislike the loud noises and spammyness of the scattergun ( that , and FAN is still usable and THAT DAMN NOISE IT MAKES IS SO ARGH ) .
• Added a kill - counter .
You will need to enable this with a few commands –
“ ig_frags 1 ” will enable the kill - counter .
“ ig_fragspos x y ” will allow you to position it to where you want .
It works from 0 – 1 , so for example , “ ig_fragspos 0.5 0.5 ” will put it dead central , or “ ig_fragspos 0.02 0.02 ” will put it in the top - left corner .
Add these to your autoexec .
It wo n’t change anything in your normal game .
The IP is – 85.234.148.19:27035 – and currently it is fully public .
Anyone is welcome , provided you do n’t sit and camp 24/ 7 , or I will kick you .
Spawn camping is fine , in moderation , as there is about 2s of spawn protection as you respawn , but if you sit in middle doing nothing but camp the exits , I will kick your ass .
Play for flag - caps , not for frags .
Hopefully we can get some good games going nightly , and turn this into something more than a single server full of turbine - middle camping fuckbag noobs .
Maps in current rotation ( all tried + tested for instagib ) are :

If the specter of obesity and diabetes was n’t enough to turn you off high - fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) , try this :
New research suggests that the sweetener could be tainted with mercury , putting millions of children at risk for developmental problems .
In 2004 , Renee Dufault , an environmental health researcher at the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , stumbled upon an obscure Environmental Protection Agency report on chemical plants ’ mercury emissions .
Some chemical companies , she learned , make lye by pumping salt through large vats of mercury .
Since lye is a key ingredient in making HFCS ( it ’s used to separate corn starch from the kernel ) , Dufault wondered if mercury might be getting into the ubiquitous sweetener that makes up 1 out of every 10 calories Americans eat .
Dufault sent HFCS samples from three manufacturers that used lye to labs at the University of California - Davis and the National Institute of Standards and Technology .
The labs found mercury in most of the samples .
In September 2005 , Dufault presented her findings to the FDA ’s center for food safety .
She was surprised by what happened next .
“ I was instructed not to do any more investigation , ” she recalls .
FDA spokeswoman Stephanie Kwisnek says that the agency decided against further investigation because it was n’t convinced “ that there was any evidence of a risk . ”
At first , Dufault was reluctant to pursue the matter .
But eventually , she became frustrated enough to try to publish the findings herself .
She had her 20 original samples retested ; mercury was found in nearly half of them .
In January , Dufault and her coauthors — eight scientists from various universities and medical centers — published the findings in the peer - reviewed journal Environmental Health .
Although they were n’t able to determine what type of mercury was present , they concluded that if it was organic , the most dangerous form , then based on average HFCS consumption , individuals could be ingesting as much as 200 micrograms of the neurotoxin per week — three times more than the amount the FDA deems safe for children , pregnant women , women who plan to become pregnant , and nursing mothers .
But the FDA and the Corn Refiners Association , an industry trade group , claim there ’s nothing to worry about .
The group hired ChemRisk , the consulting firm whose scientists testified on behalf of a polluting utility in the lawsuit portrayed in Erin Brockovich , to analyze Dufault ’s report .
ChemRisk criticized Dufault for not specifying the type of mercury her tests had found .
This , the consultants said , was key , since mercury poses different risks depending on its chemical form .
In its unadulterated elemental state , mercury is relatively safe to ingest — the body absorbs only about a tenth of a percent of it .
Inorganic forms of mercury , such as cinnabar , are more easily absorbed and therefore more dangerous than elemental .
Organic forms , like methylmercury , which originate from fossil - fuel emissions and build up in the fatty tissue of tuna and other kinds of fish , are the worst ; readily absorbed , they can cumulatively damage the brain and nervous system .
Though it provides no scientific evidence to back up this assertion , the FDA says that the mercury in Dufault ’s HFCS samples is elemental .
But the lab that analyzed the samples believes there ’s a good chance the mercury is organic .
The analysts “ said in so many words , ‘ It does n’t look like inorganic , ' ” says Peter Green , Dufault ’s UC - Davis colleague who coordinated with the lab .
“ They would even say it ’s more likely not the regular elemental mercury . ”
The corn -syrup industry claims that no HFCS manufacturers currently use mercury - grade lye , though it concedes some used to .
( According to the EPA , four plants still use the technology . )
It says that its own tests found no traces of mercury in HFCS samples from US manufacturers , including a number of samples from some of the same sources Dufault tested .
But hundreds of foreign plants still use mercury to make lye — which may then be used to make foods for export .
Already , 11 percent of the sweeteners and candy on the US market are imported .
At around the same time that she published her study , Dufault also learned of a report issued by the Minnesota - based Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy , which found low levels of mercury in 16 common food products , including certain brands of kid- favored foods , like grape jelly and chocolate milk .
Researchers have n’t proven that the mercury in the foods came from HFCS , but internist Jane Hightower , who coauthored the Environmental Health study , points out that it ultimately does n’t matter how it got there :
The FDA has allegedly known about the mercury - contaminated hfcs for nearly four years and “ should already have an answer for us based on science and not speculation , ” she says .
The agency says it has no plans for further testing unless additional evidence of harm emerges in outside scientific literature .
But the issue has been getting some attention in Congress — a bill proposed in April would require plants that once employed the technology to report how much mercury they used .
Dufault retired from the FDA in January 2008 , after the agency began taking her off her field projects .
“ All of a sudden , they wanted me to sit in the office , ” she says .
She moved to Hawaii , but she has n’t exactly been lounging on the beach .
She recently finished a paper , currently in the peer - review process , that explores why children and fetuses are more sensitive to mercury than adults .
She also teaches second - and third - graders with learning disabilities .
“ I worked for an organization that allowed stuff to go on that probably impacted these children , ” she says .
“ I look at this as doing penance . ”

Advertisement A British man has been appointed the new caretaker of an Australian tropical island , a six - month position described as " the best job in the world " .
Ben Southall , 34 , a charity fundraiser from Petersfield , Hampshire , emerged from a field of over 34,000 applicants .
His new job requires Mr Southall to live and report from Hamilton Island , on Queensland 's Great Barrier Reef .
The process gave a global profile to Australian tourism , which has gone into decline amid the worldwide recession .
Mr Southall was chosen from among 16 finalists competing for the A$ 150,000 ( £ 73,500 ; $ 110,000 ) position .
Island blog
He was named as the successful candidate in a reality TV - style ceremony by Tourism Queensland .
Mr Southall said : " To go away now as the island caretaker for Tourism Queensland and the Great Barrier Reef is an extreme honour .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" I hope I can fill the boots as much as everybody is expecting .
My swimming is hopefully up to standard and I look forward to all the new roles and responsibilities that the task involves . "
Mr Southall , who was congratulated by his vanquished rivals as his name was announced , will now begin the arduous task of preparing for life alone on the picture - perfect island .
As well as the salary , the post of caretaker at Hamilton Island comes with a three bedroom beach home , a swimming pool and golf cart .
The job description requires Mr Southall " to explore the islands of the Great Barrier Reef , swim , snorkel , make friends with the locals and generally enjoy the tropical Queensland climate and lifestyle " .
As a thoroughly modern caretaker , Mr Southall will also be expected to report back to Tourism Queensland and the world via blogs , a photo diary , video updates and interviews .
My swimming is hopefully up to standard and I look forward to all the new roles and responsibilities that the task involves
Ben Southall
He was chosen after the finalists spent four days on Hamilton Island undergoing a rigorous selection process involving snorkelling , barbecues and time at a spa .
The finalists also had to demonstrate their blogging abilities , take swimming tests and sit through in - person interviews .
The BBC's Nick Bryant , in Sydney , says Tourism Queensland deliberately chose to launch the campaign back in January , in the midst of the northern hemisphere winter , but did not expect anywhere near the global response .
Web users viewed the online job description from almost every country except North Korea and a few African states , our correspondent reports .

Description :
New security vulnerabilities are being discovered at a staggering rate nowadays .
In order to make sure that their softwares do not fall prey to a newly discovered vulnerability , most software vendors included an automatic update feature .
This feature checks the software 's servers periodically ( generally during every run ) for the latest updates and patches .
If updates are available , then it prompts the user to download and install it .
This mechanism is primarily designed to beat hackers to the chase and make sure that the software is patched before they can exploit it .
So what have hackers come up with to counter this ?
-
Well , they decided to hack the upgrade process itself ! - Say hello to our friend EvilGrade created by Infobyte Security Research .
Evilgrade is a modular framework that allow us to take advantage of poor upgrade implementations by injecting fake updates .
It works with modules , each module implements the structure needed to emulate a false update of specific applications / systems .
Evilgrade needs the manipulation of the victim dns traffic and uses either of DNS cache poisoning , ARP spoofing , DHCP spoofing or Internal DNS access to accomplish this .
Once EvilGrade has inserted itself as the man - in - the - middle it intercepts automatic update requests for the softwares it supports and injects the malicious payload as the " update " .
This payload can be configured to whichever binary the hacker wants .
Once the victim downloads this malicious " update " and runs it , the hacker has full control of his system .
Game Over ! :)
Currently , EvilGrade Supports the interception of the following upgrade mechanisms :- Java plugin- Winzip - Winamp - MacOS - OpenOffices - iTunes - Linkedin Toolbar - DAP [ Download Accelerator ] - notepad ++- speedbitThe interesting thing is that it is extensible and allows you to implement your own modules .
Thus a hacker can reverse engineer the entire update process of a software and create a module to intercept and inject his custom update into it .
For more details on how to use EvilGrade , write your own modules and to download it , please visit Infobyte Security Research site .
In the video below , we see a demo of how EvilGRade can be used to subvert the update process of Notepad ++.
Thanks go out to John Strand for posting this video on Vimeo .
Herschel has carried out the first test observations with all its instruments , with spectacular results .
Galaxies , star - forming regions and dying stars comprised the telescope ’s first targets .
The instruments provided spectacular data at their first attempt , finding water , carbon and revealing dozens of distant galaxies .
These observations show that Herschel ’s instruments are working beyond expectations .
They promise a mission of rich discoveries for waiting astronomers .
SPIRE surprises with power
On 24 June , Herschel ’s Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver ( SPIRE ) was trained on two galaxies for its first look at the Universe .
The galaxies showed up prominently , providing astronomers with their best images yet at these wavelengths , and revealing other more distant galaxies in the background of the images .
The pictures show galaxies M66 and M74 at a wavelength of 250 microns , longer than any previous infrared space observatory , but still the shortest SPIRE wavelength .
SPIRE is designed to look at star formation in our own Galaxy and in nearby galaxies .
It will also search for star - forming galaxies in the very distant Universe .
Because these galaxies are so far away , their light has taken a very long time to reach us , so by detecting them we are looking into the past and learning how and when galaxies like our own were formed .

Herschel ’s primary mirror is 3.5 m in diameter , nearly four times larger than any previous infrared space telescope .
These images prove that it represents a giant leap forward in our ability to study celestial objects at far infrared wavelengths .
Spitzer primarily observes shorter infrared wavelengths than Herschel , so the two telescopes complement each other .
These observations were all made on the first day that SPIRE was used .
They clearly show that the main scientific studies planned with the instrument are going to work extremely well .
Water - hunter HIFI scores at first try
Scientists used Herschel ’s Heterodyne Instrument for the Far - Infrared ( HIFI ) on 22 June to look for warm molecular gas heated by newborn massive stars in the DR21 star - forming region in Cygnus .
advertisement
HIFI provided excellent data in two different observing modes , returning information on the composition of the region with unprecedented accuracy and resolution .
It works by ‘ zooming in ’ on specific wavelengths , revealing different spectral ‘ lines ’ that represent the fingerprints of atoms and molecules and even the physical conditions of the object observed .
This makes it a powerful tool to study the role of gas and dust in the formation of stars and planets and the evolution of galaxies .
Using HIFI , scientists observed ionised carbon , carbon monoxide , and water in DR21 .
These different molecular lines add their pieces to a more complete understanding of what is happening .
The high quality of these first observations promises great new insights into the process of star formation .
PACS stares into the Cat’s Eye
The first observation with the Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer ( PACS ) instrument was carried out on 23 June .
The first target was the dying star known as the Cat's Eye Nebula .
Discovered by William Herschel in 1786 , this nebula consists of a complex shell of gas thrown off by a dying star .
Dying stars create spectacular nebulae , enriching the interstellar medium with heavy chemical elements .
But how does an initially spherical star produce such a complex nebula ?
To solve this question we need to look at the processes close to the star , where the matter is ejected .
With the PACS spectrometer it is now possible for the first time to make images in spectral lines for on the sky , and see how the wind from the star shapes the nebula in three dimensions .
The PACS spectrometer was used to look into the Cat ’s eye .
This mode records the composition and condition of celestial objects at precisely defined wavelengths .
PACS observed the nebula in two spectral lines from ionised nitrogen and oxygen .
For better orientation , the PACS photometer took a small map of the Cat ’s Eye Nebula in its 70 micron band , showing the structure of a dust ring with an opening on one side .
Following these first light images , Herschel is now in the performance verification phase , where the instruments will be further tested and calibrated .
This phase will last until the end of November , after which the mission will begin its routine science phase .
These images show that there is a lot of science to look forward to .
Concern is growing over the fate of detained opposition protesters
By Sarah Rainsford
BBC News
First the mass protests were suppressed by force , then came the mass arrests .
Three weeks after Iran 's disputed presidential election , scores - possibly hundreds - of opposition supporters and prominent reformists remain in prison .
Their families have had little or no information about their fate .
Most are too worried to speak to the press now .
They describe a climate of terror in Tehran .
But I met one woman at her university here in England who wanted to tell me what had happened to her husband .
She only asked me not to use their real names .
They do n't let my husband call me .
They do n't let me know what his future will be .
This is torture .
Zahra
Wife of detained opposition protester Ali , as I will call him , is an opposition activist who worked for the presidential candidate , Mir Hossein Mousavi , at the elections .
He was arrested in Tehran two weeks ago , and disappeared .
" It was just a terrible moment .
I could not stop crying , " Zahra told me .
" I just thought , why should he be in jail ?
What was wrong with what we did in Tehran ?
It was the basic right of all Iranians to take part in the election and we did the same . "
Solitary confinement
For nine days , Zahra had no idea where he had been taken .
Then he was able to make a brief call to his brother , saying only that he was in prison , in solitary confinement .
He has been denied access to a lawyer and to his family .
Zahra has no way of knowing how he is being treated .
" They do n't let my husband call me .
They do n't let me know what his future will be .
This is torture , " Zahra said , her eyes defiantly lined in green , the colour of Iran 's reformist opposition .
But her main concern is that Ali - and the other detainees - are being pressured into signing false confessions which could have serious consequences .
There is concern about the health of detainee Saeed Hajjarian Last week , state TV broadcast what it said were the confessions of demonstrators .
Their faces obscured , men and women claimed that the protests last month were part of a violent , Western - backed plot to topple Iran 's government .
A senior cleric has now announced that other detainees , staff at the British Embassy in Iran , have admitted they were planning a " Velvet Revolution " .
" Many of the detainees , especially the higher - ranking leaders of the opposition , are coming under a great deal of pressure to make false confessions which we fear may be used in show trials in the future , " says Tom Porteous , London director of Human Rights Watch .
" There are very long interrogation sessions .
We have heard that detainees are being beaten up .
There are real grounds for concern about their treatment . "
He calls the scale of the clampdown unprecedented .
There is particular concern about the health of one detainee , Saeed Hajjarian , who has been severely disabled since an attempt on his life in 2000 .
Iran 's chief of police announced this week that just over 1,000 people were arrested in total during the post- election unrest , but said that " most " had been released .
They were creating terror in the hearts of anyone who voted for Mousavi
Husband of Mousavi supporter
There are no official statistics , and reports from Iran say the arrests continue .
Some people , like the wife of another Iranian I spoke to here in the UK , were set free after several degrading days in custody .
The man asked me not to use their names .
His wife was arrested along with several friends at a silent street protest in Tehran to demand a re-run of the controversial election .
Now in London , she has told her husband what happened .
" They had nine to 12 people in the same cell for five days .
There was no proper light , no bathroom , no proper food .
" The entire thing has been humiliation : intimidating and terrifying them so when they come out they will not take part in any demonstrations , " he told me , describing his wife as still traumatised by her experience .
It is thought that scores of Mousavi supporters remain in jail " She told me they gave them papers to sign and they had to give a commitment they would not go to more demos .
They asked everyone , who did you vote for ?
" They were creating terror in the hearts of anyone who voted for Mousavi , " the man said .
He is convinced the more prominent detainees - still in prison - will be dealt with far more harshly than his wife .
" They wo n't be released soon .
Something very bad has happened , the authorities did n't expect this .
And now they 're taking revenge on these people .
They are going to be tough , " he said .
That is what Zahra is afraid of .
The prosecutor in charge of investigating the unrest is a known hardliner ; last week , a senior cleric called for leading protesters accused of violent protest to face the death penalty .
" I hope they do n't accuse people of very serious accusations and then execute them .
But in such a situation anything is possible .
They will do anything to keep power , " Zahra told me .
" The only way we have at this point is just to wait .
And this wait is unbearable . "

A ROW has erupted over Doctor Who ’s plans to materialise on Llandaff ’s historic Cathedral Green .
BBC bosses wrote to businesses in Llandaff telling them of plans to take over the green for a week next month , transforming it into a location for the award - winning sci- fi series .
But while aliens on distant planets may be willing to welcome the Doctor with open arms , at least one trader in the Cardiff village is not so keen on the idea of having the Time Lord at hand .
Pete Hall , who runs Halls bookshop on High Street , is concerned that the plans to block off roads surrounding the green will add to an “ already congested ” traffic system .
He accused BBC chiefs of a lack of consideration for the plight of independent businesses struggling to attract customers .
Mr Hall , 47 , said : “ We received a letter from the location manager late last week informing us that they are setting up and filming on the village green for an entire week and will be restricting parking between 8 am and 7 pm at night .
“ When I read it my heart sank .
“ As a small shop fighting for our very existence due to the difficult economic climate , the thought of all those outdoor vehicles blocking our already choked traffic system and frightening our customers away is too much to bear .
“ Traders here do their very best to create a friendly and comfortable atmosphere to entice the public to brave the traffic problems in the area and visit us , so this feels like the last straw . ”
Mr Hall ’s mother set up the business in 1979 and it is today one of only two independent bookshops outside the city centre .
He said trading was difficult enough in the face of competition from supermarkets and internet retailers , without the disruption of a large scale drama production effectively closing High Street for business .
“ It is our 30th anniversary in the book trade soon but sadly I can not see us celebrating 31 years next year .
“ I suggest that the next time the BBC makes a decision to produce a drama in a busy city area like this , they should spare a thought for self - employed and stressed shopkeepers who are working hard to serve our customers and stay in business . ”
A BBC spokesperson said : “ We regularly film on location around Wales and take great care to ensure that disruption is kept to a minimum .
“ We realise that filming sometimes causes inconvenience for people locally and we very much appreciate the support we get when we are on location . ”
WASHINGTON --
A gunman identified by authorities as a white supremacist opened fire Wednesday inside the lobby of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum , killing a security guard before being shot and captured .
Federal authorities identified the suspected shooter as James von Brunn , an 88 - year - old Annapolis , Md. , man with a record of anti-Semitic statements and writings , notably on his Web site .
He served more than five years in federal prison on a 1983 conviction for attempting to kidnap members of the Federal Reserve Board , ...
The UK government still seems unsure as to whether it's a good idea to punish those accused of illegal downloading by cutting off Internet access for entire households , saying it wants to " support " the music industry .
But now it seems a coalition of the actual British musicians , songwriters and producers behind the music do n't want " support " of this kind , and view this sort of draconian policy as " extraordinarily negative . "
Thankfully , there are some people in the UK who think this sort of draconian policy is a terrible idea , and are taking a stand against it — namely , the British music community .
The Guardian reports :
A rift has opened between music 's creators and its record labels , with a broad alliance of musicians , songwriters and producers fiercely criticising the business secretary Lord Mandelson 's plans to cut off the broadband connections of internet users who illegally download music .
In a statement seen by the Guardian , a coalition of bodies representing a range of stars including Sir Paul McCartney , Sir Elton John and Damon Albarn attacks the proposals as expensive , illogical and " extraordinarily negative " .
The Featured Artists Coalition ( FAC ) , the British Academy of Songwriters , Composers and Authors ( Basca ) and the Music Producers Guild ( MPG ) have joined forces to oppose the proposals to reintroduce the threat of disconnection for persistent file sharers , which was ruled out in the government 's Digital Britain report in June .
Aside from the obvious problem of meting out punishment to anyone accused of a crime , the decision to cut off access to the Internet is disproportionate and , in the many cases where more than one person uses a computer or IP connection , amounts to collective punishment as well .
If the government is not interested in hearing the cries of outrage from the public , perhaps they will heed the words of the many talented folks who make the culture behind the culture industry .
WASHINGTON  Peeling off his latex gloves after treating a 4 - year - old boy having a severe asthma attack , J. R. Muyleart sighed with a touch of frustration .
It was 3 a.m. and in the past 24 - hour shift , Mr. Muyleart , a firefighter , had responded to at least one emergency call per hour .
But only two of those calls were for fires ; most of the others involved heart attacks , diabetic sores , epileptic seizures and people complaining of shortness of breath .
“ I joined the force to battle blazes , not to be an emergency room doctor , ” Mr. Muyleart , 35 , said as he and the rest of Engine Company 10 drove back to their firehouse , which for most of the last 15 years has been the busiest in the country , according to industry surveys .
Among the hidden costs of the health care crisis is the burden that fire departments across the country are facing as firefighters , much like emergency room doctors , are increasingly serving as primary care providers .

Mr. Schumer said the public option would hold down costs because it would not have to generate profits , answer to shareholders or incur marketing expenses .
His proposal would have required the public plan to negotiate rates with doctors and hospitals , rather than setting prices based on Medicare reimbursement rates .
Under Mr. Rockefeller ’s plan , the payment of doctors and hospitals would have been based on Medicare rates for the first two years .
Mr. Rockefeller said the Congressional Budget Office had estimated that a government insurance plan could slice $ 50 billion from the cost of Mr. Baucus ’s bill , originally put at $ 774 billion over 10 years .
The budget office predicted that eight million people would initially enroll in the public plan  about one - third of those who would seek coverage through new markets , or insurance exchanges .
“ The public plan will be optional , ” Mr. Rockefeller insisted .
“ It will be voluntary .
It will be affordable to people who are now helpless before their insurance companies . ”
But Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa , the senior Republican on the committee , said a government insurance plan would have inherent advantages over private insurers .
“ Government is not a fair competitor , ” Mr. Grassley said .
“ It ’s a predator . ”
He predicted that “ a government plan will ultimately force private insurers out of business , ” reducing choices for consumers .
Senator John Ensign , Republican of Nevada , said he feared that a government plan would prove so popular it could never be uprooted .
“ Does anybody believe Congress would let this public plan go away once it has a constituency ? ” Mr. Ensign asked .
“ No way .
Once it ’s started , you will never get rid of it .
Congress will subsidize it more and more , allow it to grow and grow . ”
Besides Mr. Baucus , two Democrats , Senators Kent Conrad of North Dakota and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas , voted against both public option proposals .
Two other Democrats , Senators Thomas R. Carper of Delaware and Bill Nelson of Florida , voted against the first amendment , but supported the second .
Mr. Carper said he liked Mr. Schumer ’s proposal because it “ would establish a level playing field ” for competition between private insurers and the government plan .
Most home brewers get their supplies form their local home brew shop .
But how did that shop start ?
Most likely , it was a small group of brewers who shared an interest in buying in bulk to save money .
The result was offering a service to the public in order to save even more and eventually get paid to brew beer and to help others .
Now , imagine if you got a large group of people together to order your home brewing supplies .
By doing this , you could save without the middleman 's mark - up .
Now , if all of the brewers in a town got together and worked in the same shop , the combined ingenuity would benefit all .
This is a model for a brewer 's cooperative .
Pretty soon , you 'd have to start selling either the beer just because you'd be making more than you could drink .
Brewing co-ops usually have a business focus , but this does n't necessarily have to be the case .
Buying co-ops are another way to go , where the focus is on keeping the organization small and hassle - free .
For those brewing co-ops that choose to go the route of the business model , there are three types of services for which we can see successful models : Commercial Brewery , Brew Pub , and Brewing Supply .
One shining example of workers seizing the means of production by the reigns is the Pony Express line of beers .
Pony Express Gold , Pony Express Original Wheat , Pony Express Rattlesnake Pale Ale , and Pony Express Tornado Red Ale are all beers produced by the 1st Grower - Owned micro-brewery in the United States .
Pony Express is owned and operated by a cooperative of Missouri farmers called TransCon AG .
TransCon AG has helped Pony Express gain distribution in China and Taiwan ; as well has improved the profitability of both farms and the Pony Express Brewery .
With the success of Pony Express , they have even gone public and offered shares of stock on the market .
An opportunity for Co-op minded brewers is raising its head in Austin Texas as well .
The Black Star Brewing Co-op is a group of comrades that are slowly working their way towards a profitable business .
According to their Website , www.blackstar.coop, their membership is over 800 people strong without even opening up their doors !
Their goal :
" We are a co-operative business based in Austin , TX working to open world 's first cooperatively - owned and worker self - managed brewpub . "
Black Star 's concept is to start networking by throwing parties .
Their monthly beer socials generate revenue for the budding brewpub and also helps to attract new members .
Prospective members can sign up as invested members for $ 85 and start having access to the Black Star brewing equipment , and a vote in the members assembly , or just start with a $ 15 fee and slowly pay up to the $ 85 full membership fee .
After two years , the Black Star Co-op has made enough revenue that they are scouting locations for their brewpub , so they must be having a good amount of success !
Time will tell if they are able to move from beer social to brewpub .
As far as brewing supply co-ops , one profitable organization that can be found is a little warehouse in Santa Cruz , California .
Seven Bridges Brewing Cooperative started in 1997 with the plan to help home brewers to have access to organic , pesticide free beer brewing supplies .
Since then , Seven Bridges has managed to branch out successfully into the coffee market .
Seven Bridges sells organic , green , un-roasted coffee both locally and nationally through their mail order business .
Seven Bridges also sells home coffee roasting units , enabling people to roast their coffee to their own notion of perfection .
We can see that there is a lot of profit in working together to form a brewing co-op .
For information on the history of cooperatives and keys to working in a collective workplace , you can visit wikipedia at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative.
With all of the scrutiny that high - frequency trading is now under in the media and in Congress , the New York Stock Exchange is probably none too thrilled that the Wall Street Journal has uncovered fresh details of NYSE 's giant new datacenter , which the exchange is building in a former New Jersey quarry .
The new datacenter will significantly advance the amount of computer - automated trading that already dominates global markets , housing as it will " several football fields of cutting - edge computing equipment for hedge funds and other firms that engage in high - frequency trading , " according to the WSJ .
So if you were recently shocked to learn that an estimated 70 percent of stock trading is just computers trading against one another , get ready for that number to go even higher .
The NYSE is reportedly already taking orders from firms that want to lease space in the datacenter so that they can co-locate their servers with those that run the exchange in order to execute trades more quickly .
Actually building and running a datacenter of this size is new for the NYSE , which historically has rented space in others ' datacenters .
As for the impact this will have on the markets , the debate rages .
Not everyone is happy that the NYSE is poised to massively boost the already overwhelming amount of computer trading .
At issue is not the simple fact of computers trading against one another over electronic networks — it's the speed with which they appear to be squeezing the humans out of the loop , and the potential instability and fragility that may result from increased automation of global markets .
Yes , there is actually something new here
For every technique or technology that comes under the heading of HFT , you can dig up an example of how people did this same thing on a much smaller scale without computers .
Therefore , the argument goes , the relatively recent ( see below ) use of computers to do two orders of magnitude more of these activities in a given timeslice is " nothing new , " despite the fact that the computers are now doing this among themselves without human intervention .
�This kind of reasoning keeps cropping up all over the Internet in the current HFT debates , in some instances coming from very smart people .
( Tyler Cowen 's response at Margina Revolution is the best statement of this view . )
Others , however , are concerned by HFT 's rise to dominance .
Quant guru Paul Wilmott , in a widely cited NYT op - ed �this last week , says that it 's exactly the potential systemic impact of the recent acceleration of the speed and volume of HFT activity that has him worried .
" There 's nothing new in using all publicly available information to help you trade , " Wilmott acknowledges , in an initial nod to the naysayers .
But he continues : " What 's novel is the quantity of data available , the lightning speed at which it is analyzed , and the short time that positions are held ...
The problem with the sudden popularity of high - frequency trading is that it may increasingly destabilize the market . "
Michael Durbin , the man behind Citadel 's high - frequency trading desk , echoed this warning to Reuters ' Matthew Goldstein earlier this week :
" You have multiple HFT trading firms and sometimes their agendas are complementary and sometimes they 're not , " explains Durbin , director of HFT research with Blue Capital Group , a small Chicago - based options trading firm .
" There could be a time where these HFT programs unintentionally collaborate and you have a two - or three - minute period where the markets are going crazy .
Then other traders respond to it and it simply gets out of control . "
My own take on the question was summed up in a�recent note to Felix Salmon :
It 's quite remarkable to me that many of the econ and finance folks who insist that " HFT is the same thing we always did , just way faster " do n't seem to realize that frequency and amplitude matter a whole lot , and that for any given phenomenon when you suddenly increase those two factors by an order of magnitude you typically end up with something very different than what you started with .
This is true for isolated phenomena , and it 's doubly true for complex systems , where you have to deal with systemic effects like feedback loops and synchronization / resonance .
What I 've noticed anecdotally is that engineers and IT pros are more concerned about HFT than people who just handle money for a living .
These guys have a keen sense for just how fragile and unpredictable these systems - of - systems are even under the best of conditions , and how when things go wrong they do so spectacularly and at very inconvenient moments ( they get paid a lot of money to rush into the office to put out fires at 4 am ) .
There 's an analogy here with e-voting , which I did quite a bit of work on .
In the e-voting fiasco , you had people who were specialists in elections but who had little IT experience greenlighting what they thought was an elections systems rollout , but in actuality they had signed on for a large IT deployment and they had no idea what they were getting into .
To them , it was just voting , but with computers , y'know ?
They found out the hard way that networked computer systems are a force multiplier not just for human capabilities , but for human limitations , as well .
In sum , the growing concern with HFT is not that computers are doing something that people used to do ; it 's that they 're doing a whole lot of it , very rapidly , so that the market as a system - of - systems now has starkly different frequency , amplitude , and connectedness characteristics that may ( or may not ) give it a new , currently unknown set of emergent properties .
And if a fuse blows while the machines are driving the bus , we 're all traveling so fast that we may hit a wall before the humans in the vehicle have time to react .
Reaction time , or what could possibly go wrong
If something does go wrong , the market moves so quickly now that by the time the humans intervene , the damage could already be too great to keep contagion and feedback effects from kicking in and pushing things further south .
This is possible because HFT , by design , is capable of moving the markets much more rapidly than humans can possibly react to those moves .
Again , speed matters , especially in activities where human judgment plays a critical role .
An example of what could go wrong happened on September 8 , 2008 , when a six - year - old news story about United Airlines ' bankruptcy was somehow republished on Google News with a current timestamp .
A source tells me that the algo traders kicked in at some point and started dumping United 's stock , which eventually lost 75 percent of its value that day .
About $ 1 billion of United 's market cap evaporated in 12 minutes , �before the humans figured out that they were looking not at a bankruptcy , but at the type of GIGO problem ( garbage in , garbage out ) that 's well known in computer science circles .
Much of the stock 's value was restored by the next day , when the market had sorted itself out , but experts worry that something like this could happen on a much larger scale , especially in response to a genuine external shock .
A paper on the dangers of HFT by Lime Brokerage ( uncovered by Zero Hedge ) paints the following picture of just how rapidly things might go awry in the present environment :
Lime 's familiarity with high speed trading allows us to benchmark some of the fastest computer traders on the planet , and we have seen [ computerized day trading ( CDT ) ] order placement rates easily exceed 1,000 orders per second .
Should a CDT algorithm go awry , where a large amount of orders are placed erroneously or where the orders should not have passed order validation , the Sponsor will incur a substantial time - lag in addressing the issue .
From the moment the Sponsor 's representative detects the problem until the time the problematic orders can be addressed by the Sponsor , at least two mintues will have passed .
The Sponsor 's only tools to control Sponsored Access flow are to log into the Trading Center 's website ( if available ) , place a phone call to the Trading Center , or call the Sponsee to disable trading and cancel these erroneous orders — all sub-optimal processes which require human intervention .
With a two minute delay to cancel these erroneous orders , 120,000 orders could have gone into the market and been executed , even though an order validation problem was detected previously .
At 1,000 shares per order and an average price of $ 20 per share , $ 2.4 billion of improper trades could be executed in this short timeframe .
( emphasis added )
A final point : when there is a chorus of Wall Streeters and economists telling us in regard to some new , very profitable milestone in complexity and innovation , " do n't worry , and the odds of anything going wrong here are passing slim , " does this really reassure anyone in 2009 ?
I think the burden of proof should be on people like Cowen to demonstrate that long - term " buy and hold " can peacefully coexist with the degree of opaque , computer - driven hyperspeculation the markets are barreling towards .
Addendum : the landscape has changed just this year
One of the things that perhaps was n't clear enough from my previous article on high - frequency trading ( HFT ) is that , while people have been using computers to trade against one another for a decade or more , the bigger HFT picture has evolved rapidly in just the past few months .
This recent HedgeWeek article tells the typical story that you 'll find on various trading blogs , and it goes something like the following :
Algo trading trading was on the rise going into the summer of 2007 , when the correlations that the algo traders depend on suddenly began to break down .
The August 2007 " quant quake " was a shakeout that had a catastrophic impact on number of the larger funds , and statistical arbitrage strategies continued to perform very poorly throughout 2008 .
As a result of this underperformance , stat arb was generally out of favor throughout 2008 , until the strategy started working again earlier this year .
In the past few months , algo trading has enjoyed a resurgence in popularity , with current market conditions apparently very favorable to stat arbs in particular .
But the fact that , throughout the first half of this year , everyone has been piling back onto the algorithmic trading bandwagon willy - nilly is n't the only major development in HFT .
It 's also the case that the 2008 crisis had the effect of radically shrinking the competitive landscape , leaving the field to fewer out - sized players whose HFT efforts are being scaled up ; Lehman Bros. , Bear Stearns , and Merrill Lynch , all had announced major HFT plans for 2008 , and in 2009 these banks no longer exist .
Then there 's the flash order issue , which flared up this year and is right now creating a stir among the exchanges and lawmakers .
All of this together adds up to a significant shift in the high - frequency trading terrain just this year .
And this is happening to markets that are still coping with the relatively recent rise of electronic communication networks ( ECNs ) , which are largely ( in terms of trading volume ) a post -2000 phenomenon .
If we take a step back and look solely at the percentage of traditional " open outcry " trades ( i.e. , a crowd of traders , hollering and gesticulating at one another ) vs. electronic trades on the major exchanges , we can get a sense for just how fast the market has changed in the last decade .
In 2001 , some 90 percent of trading volume on the NYSE and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( CME ) was carried out by humans on the trading floor .
In 2009 , the open outcry volume is under 10 percent on both exchanges .
Stock and commodity exchanges were based on the open outcry system for over 100 years , but in just nine years the ratio of open outcry to electronic trading on these two major exchanges swapped from about 90/10 to about 10/90 .
That 's a lot of computerization in a little time ; and as the NYSE datacenter news shows , the pace of change is accelerating .
The markets are different now , and they 're getting more different more rapidly .
The post - crisis Wall Street of 2009 is , in effect , in the process of doubling down on the preceding 9 years of speed , automation , consolidation , and leverage . �

JERUSALEM ( CNN ) --
Israel started its biggest emergency drill in the nation 's history Sunday to prepare civilians , soldiers and rescue crews for the possibility of war , the defense force said in a statement .
Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak has expressed skepticism that Iran can be persuaded to abandon its nuclear ambitions .
The five - day drill , nicknamed Turning Point 3 , comes amid the nation 's rising tensions with Iran .
It will be conducted in public facilities , including schools , military bases and government offices .
Students , soldiers and other civilians will practice how to gather at protected places during an emergency .
Officials said the drill will include simulated rockets , air raids and other attacks on infrastructure and essential facilities , and use of weapons on civilians .
Everyone is expected to go to a protected place at the sound of sirens , the defense force said , adding that more instructions will be broadcast on a public channel .
" It is of great importance that every civilian , institute and workplace will seriously practice in order to improve our preparedness and national resilience , " Maj. Gen . Yair Golan of the Home Front Command said in a news statement .
The move comes amid tension between Israel and Tehran .
The Israeli government considers Iran 's nuclear program as the dominant threat facing the country .
Israel is publicly supportive of President Barack Obama administration 's outreach to the Islamic state .
Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak told Israeli Army Radio last week that he believes " that the chance the dialogue has of stopping Iran 's nuclear efforts is very low . "
Barak 's views are keeping with the majority of his countrymen .
An Israeli poll released this month found that 74 percent believe that the U.S. policy of engagement with Iran will fail and 81 percent think Iran will develop a nuclear weapon capability .
Israel has conducted emergency drills the past two years , but officials said this is the biggest so far .

Philippon has been making beer for over 20 years , but it was only after a few years trying to climb the academic job ladder that he realized his real love was n't analytic philosophy ( though he admired Wittgenstein 's Philosophical Investigations enough to use a cryptic image from the book , which depicts either a duck or a rabbit , as the basis for the brewery 's name and logo ) .
He apprenticed at a few breweries around the country , then opened Duck - Rabbit in 2004 .
I got a chance to visit Philippon during a recent road trip through North Carolina , having been tipped off by the good folks at Lagerheads .
Farmville is like a lot of small Southern towns -- laconic and a little run-down , with an above - average population of beauty salons and late - model muscle cars .
The brewery is located in a warehouse near the town limits , with enough empty land around it to accommodate several years of rapid growth .
Photo by Ken Hilton
I had called ahead to make sure they were open , but I had n't made a reservation or even given an ETA .
Nevertheless , Phillipon gave us -- I was with my wife and a friend -- the full tour .
Duck - Rabbit 's facilities are about 1/100 the size of a Coors plant , but Phillipon is a true beer nerd , and he spent the better part of an hour relating the specs on his equipment , weaving us around , over , and under hoses even as his assistant , Ryan Witter - Merithew , went about making the day 's batch .
Philippon realized early on that craft beer was a crowded business , and that if he wanted to make a viable operation he had to distinguish himself with a reputation that mixed originality with reliability .
He had always enjoyed brewing dark beers , so he settled on a short menu of heavy ales , flagshipped by a milk stout .
Still a rarity among American brewers , milk stout is brewed with lactose , which resists fermentation and thus gives the beer a sweet , smooth flavor .
Some milk stouts have strong coffee characters , while others veer toward hot chocolate .
Duck - Rabbit 's milk stout is somewhere in between , and its pleasant blend of comforting flavors and textures make it Phillipon 's best seller ( he recently released a limited run of milk stout aged in 20 - year Pappy Van Winkle barrels , to rave reviews ) .
Photo by Clay Risen
When it came time for the tasting , Phillipon ducked into a walk - in fridge at the back of the warehouse and pulled out bottles and five glasses ; at Duck - Rabbit everyone joins in on the samples , even the guys running the machines .
We sampled the amber , the porter , and the milk stout .
The amber is not particularly dark ; Phillipon says he wanted a lighter beer as a hook for skeptical drinkers .
I liked it a lot -- it is balanced and light , with nice caramel notes ( though also a little watery for me ) .
The porter was surprisingly refreshing and likewise balanced ; I respected Phillipon 's decision not to brew a coffee - and - toffee bomb , like so many craft porters these days .
Dark as these beers were , I could easily see myself cracking any one of them open after a long day sitting on the beach ( which , later that day in Wilmington , I did ) .
sickkids falls for medical luddism
A premiere pediatric hospital is being awfully friendly to anti-vaccine and homeopathic cranks and quacks .
The SickKids Foundation is a Canadian non-profit organization which runs a very highly respected pediatric hospital and funds research projects to provide cutting edge medical care to children .
So you could imagine how bewildered David Gorski , aka Orac , was when he found out that the hospital is hosting a conference on autism with a roster of speakers which reads pretty much like a who ’s who list of anti-vaccine woo and New Age quackery .
And his shock was only deepened when he confirmed that the anti-vax crowd is n’t just renting space , but has a small grant from the Foundation , which recently started exploring homeopathy .
I know , I know , the vast majority of anti-vaccine activists have nothing but good intentions and they ’re doing it not because they want to endanger children , but because they ’re sure that they ’re protecting them from even bigger dangers than common childhood diseases .
But you know the saying about good intentions .
The road to hell is paved with them .
And far from all the passionate anti-vaxers are doing it for the benefit of kids across the world .
In fact , homeopaths are using the media generated panic over vaccine safety to drum up business , going on TV to question the safety of conventional medicine and touting the benefits of their sentient liquids , which unlike real medicine , do n’t have evil compounds with big scary names .
It ’s a disingenuous argument .
Rather than compete with medical professionals on efficacy , the homeopaths talk about the lack of side - effects to their treatments .
Which of course do n’t really have side - effects since they do n’t actually treat anything .
For doctors , every medication is a balance between the potential danger and the anticipated benefit , backed by thorough , constantly ongoing studies .
For homeopaths , some pseudoscientific forces are supposed to take care of the condition and they never bother to check whether the patient really did recover from something serious .
A quick glance and the lack of complaints are enough to pronounce him or her cured , and present a sizeable bill for two atoms of flower powder in distilled water .
When a respected institution like SickKids gives grants to those who call themselves healers after neglecting all the hard work that has to come with that title , and keeps an open ear to outright quacks who ignore good science for the sake of personal satisfaction , they ’re giving undue legitimacy to people who have the potential to harm the children in their care either by doing nothing to help them and calling it treatment , or applying an untested , potentially dangerous quack cure to their conditions .
Even worse , they ’re encouraging them to keep assailing real medicine and creating controversies rather than helping to solve problems .
Let ’s keep in mind that as much as the quacks may want to help , they also want to be seen as visionaries who had the guts to stand up to the Big , Bad Scientific Establishment who were vindicated by those with an open mind , i.e. those who agree with them and can throw around some serious weight in the medical world .
Oil is the world 's most heavily traded commodity A rogue trader at a London oil broker caused his employer to lose $ 10 m ( £ 6 m ) after making unauthorised trades .
PVM Oil Futures said it was a " victim of unauthorised trading " on Tuesday , 30 June , and said it was now conducting a full investigation .
The rogue trader , believed to be Steve Perkins , has been suspended .
PVM said it had informed the Financial Services Authority and the InterContinental Exchange ( ICE ) , the location for much European oil trade .
Firms have systems to pick up oddities and anomalies ...
The question is how fast were they able to get on top of it and deal with it
Nick McGregor , Redmayne Bentley
The trades are thought to have caused a jump in the price of Brent crude oil on Tuesday .
PVM said it was now conducting business as normal .
" As a result of a series of unauthorised trades , substantial volumes of futures contracts were held by PVM .
When this was discovered , the positions were closed in an orderly fashion .
PVM suffered a loss totalling a little under $ 10 m , " the company said in a statement .
" There are a range of procedures that are followed to look at trading patterns , price movement and levels of activity , " explained David Peniket , the president of ICE Futures Europe , which trades futures and energy and commodity contracts .
" It will investigate and follow up , and where appropriate , action will be taken , " he added .
Rogue trade On Tuesday morning , the price of Brent crude rose about $ 2 a barrel in the space of an hour , hitting $ 73.50 a barrel before reversing sharply in volatile trade .
In that time , contracts for 16 million barrels of oil changed hands - 32 times the normal level - equivalent to double the daily production of Saudi Arabia .
OTHER ROGUE TRADES June 2008 - Morgan Stanley loses £ 79 m after London - based trader Matthew Piper is found to have deliberately mis-priced trades in the credit markets Feb 2008 - Unnamed employee at US trading giant MF Global loses his company more than $ 140 m ( £ 86 m ) after placing unauthorised bets on the future direction of wheat prices Jan 2008 - Jerome Kerviel costs French bank Societe Generale 4.9bn euros ( $ 6.9bn ; £ 4.2 bn ) after he makes unauthorised and incorrect bets on market movements
By the time PVM sold the futures contracts the trader had bought , the price had fallen , which is why PVM booked losses of $ 10 m , Nick McGregor at Redmayne Bentley told the BBC .
" In the very small hours , while volumes are relatively low during Asian trading because most of London is asleep , an awful lot of business went through and as it turns out it all came from the same source , " Mr McGregor said .
" This all happened within an hour at about two o'clock in the morning , and of course in a thin market at that sort of time , it does n't take an awful lot to move the price . "
With volume so thin , the trade stood out , which is why the " rogue trade " has emerged so quickly , he added .
" Firms have systems to pick up oddities and anomalies , but of course at two o'clock in the morning , I am sure it rang a little bell .
The question is how fast were they able to get on top of it and deal with it , " he said .
Oil is the world 's most heavily traded commodity , with trading centred on the ICE in London and the New York Mercantile Exchange or Nymex .
Brokerages like PVM place orders on behalf of large banks and hedge funds .
On Friday morning , Brent crude oil hovered above $ 66 a barrel in light holiday trading .

Here ’s adding to what I ’ve already said about Twitter through my previous post .
Twitter – The Social News Channel :
This is what differentiates Twitter from sites such as Facebook , wherein you set up a profile and essentially connect with people you have known in the past .
Twitter is more of a ‘ social news channel ’ where you have real time access to news from across the world which comes directly from the source , unfiltered .
One more aspect of Twitter that really appeals to me is that I get to decide who is important to me .
I choose to follow people who can influence me positively , as opposed to people tweeting about where and when they had coffee .
A recent survey showed that only 10 % Twitters actually Tweet , which goes to show that this is not a place where everybody is doing the talking .
A majority of the people on Twitter come here essentially to listen to what they find interesting , and connect and communicate with people that matter to them .
Twitter , as a social news channel , also makes you a part of the overall experience .
It is people like you and me who contribute to Twitter , and we are essentially the people who make it work .
This also goes to show that we could very well be the people that others choose to follow ( of course , this depends on what we want to Tweet about ) .
Being Followed :
Twitter helps bringing passions to the fore , wherein if you are zealous about anything , or are working on something special , you could have a following too .
Depending on what you Tweet about , you could end up being the leader of a number of followers who want to hear what you have to say .
This could include Tweets about some project that only a handful of Tweeters find relevant , or views about matters that appeal to the masses .
Besides , Twitter is not a contest ( although CNN and Ashton Kutcher would tell you otherwise ) , and it really does not matter how many followers you have as long as there is something that you do which other people could be interested in .
Partaking in the Experience :
Since Twitter is real time active media , it pertains more to today , as opposed to yesterday or the day before .
The Tweets relate to what is currently happening , and the views / opinions are based in the present .
When people Tweet about any topic that is relevant to you , you are always free to Tweet back with suggestions , ideas , or feedback .
You can also help by providing direction to people in spheres that you know of well .
Looking for Insight :
While you can share your knowledge with others , you can also look for people who would be willing to do the same .
If you are stuck in the middle of a project , or simply need ideas for new ones , you can get fellow Tweeters to help you with the same .
You can also ask Tweeters what they think about anything in particular .
All the questions that you put forth on Twitter are very likely to generate responses .
The more the questions you put forth , the more the responses that you get , and the more you connect with likeminded people .
If I were to sum it up in a couple of lines , I would describe Twitter as a place where you can share information / knowledge about matters that interest you with people who you find interesting ; and it is the resultant conversations that add to the excitement .
Cheers !
Saying I like " Mad Men " would be like saying I like beer : Polite , but not quite accurate .
Since watching Seasons 1 and 2 via Netflix , I have become obsessed with the story , the characters and the lifestyle portrayed .
On " Mad Men , " the women wear heels , pearls , chic dresses , red lipstick and sport elaborate updos .
The men wear slick suits and rock even slicker hair .
All smoke prodigiously - Luckies , mostly .
Classic American cars rule the road and no office lunch is complete without at least one stiff drink .
Season 3 premiered Sunday ( check out Alan Sepinwall 's recap and all of his coverage of the previous seasons ) , and it got me thinking about some things from " Mad Men " I wish would make a comeback .
Check my list and then add yours below :
1. Fedoras :
If you want to seal the deal like Don Draper , you 've got to dress the part , fellas .
2. Bullet bras :
When Madonna wore them , I cringed .
When Joan does , they make sense .
And who would n't want to strut around the office looking like Joan ?
Then again , the men would n't get much done .
3. Curvaceous women as hot women :
See also : Joan .
She oozes confidence and uses her full figure as a weapon in the office .
Women fear her , men want her .
I want to see more women like her on TV and in real life .
4. Liquor as an office supply : At Sterling Cooper , it runs out faster than pencils and paper clips .
Who needs budgets or fancy mock - ups to seal that new account ?
Bourbon is the best closer in the business .
Just beware of pulling a Rumson !
( Look it up . )
5. Typewriters : Remember when one mistake at 80 words a minute meant disaster ?
We want them back for office meltdown potential alone .
6 . Pitch meetings without PowerPoint : Poster board , finger sandwiches and Bloody Marys are far more inspiring , do n't you think ?
Let 's save the bullets for the bras .
7 . Two - hour lunches :
While I love scarfing down a sandwich at my desk , I could be persuaded to take leisurely lunches at the Carlysle .
That 's my " Mad Men " - inspired comeback wish list .
Post yours below .
We 'll highlight the best in The List Tuesday .
Thanks to Amy Casey and Justin Ellis for their ideas !

根据笔者30多年任教初中毕业班统考科目的经验，考试大纲是一个好东西，它规定了考试的大致命题范围、题型、样卷，教师在组织复习时可以有的放矢，“以纲为纲，以本为本”。考试大纲规定的内容就重点复习，没有规定的内容就放弃；根据样卷进行考前训练，可以精确到某一题考查哪一个知识点；有经验的教师甚至可以大致模拟出试卷的题目。考试大纲在手，教师不知道要省多少力气。于学生而言，考试大纲没有规定的内容，即使没有掌握也无关紧要，丝毫不影响考试成绩。

Super Talent 128 GB UltraDrive GX Solid State Drive Super
Talent offers a wide variety of solid state drives .
In fact , you can choose from six different categories : UltraDrive
MasterDrive
Netbook SSDs
DuraDrive
FDM ( Flash Disk Modules )
eSATA External SSDs
For most consumers , only two categories are of particular interest - the UltraDrive and MasterDrive family of SSDs which can be used to directly replace current 2.5 " mobile hard disk drives .
The MasterDrive family of mainstream SSDs are designed to offer affordable solid state drives with capacities of 16 GB to 512 GB , while the UltraDrive SSDs are designed to offer cutting - edge performance - just the right stuff for the discerning hardware enthusiast !
The Super Talent UltraDrive family of performance - grade SSDs are further divided into two different lines , based on the type of NAND flash used - SLC or MLC .
Solid state drives based on single - level cell ( SLC ) technology are faster and more reliable but they are also more expensive .
Solid state drives based on multi- level cell ( MLC ) technology , on the other hand , offer higher storage capacities at a lower price .
Today , we will be looking at the 128 GB UltraDrive GX SSD of the MLC type .
Even though it 's based on MLC NAND flash , Super Talent promised us that the drive will deliver super - high read and write speeds of 260 MB/s and 195 MB/s respectively , thanks to the inclusion of a fast 64 MB cache .
Let 's find out if the UltraDrive GX lives up to those claims !

This new system also allows you to quickly get the gist of the review without reading through it .
This can be very useful , especially in situations where you need to make a quick purchase decision .
In this new system , we start with a Product Overview whenever a company sends us a press release about their latest product .
We shift through extraneous PR - talk to create a straightforward summary of the product 's features as well as specifications .
This allows you to quickly find out all the pertinent details about the product , without reading through official press releases .
When we receive the product for review , we will quickly take photos of it and create a Pictorial Review .
The purpose of a pictorial review is to allow you , the reader , to quickly examine the product visually .
It may help you make better purchase decisions , especially if you cannot wait for the full review .
After thorough testing , we will post a Comprehensive Review of the product .
This adds on to the pictorial review with comprehensive test results and our final conclusion on the product .
But no matter whether you are reading a Pictorial Review or a Comprehensive Review , you can always read the summary of the review as well as examine the product 's specifications right on the first page .
In all our new reviews , we will maintain the first page as a Product Overview page .
If the product is listed in PriceGrabber , you can also check out the lowest price online .
We hope this new review system will make your experience a lot more enjoyable and informative !

I almost gave this recipe its first bad review , but I could n't bear to type it out after re-reading all the raves !
So I made it again and liked it much better .
Make sure to COAT that bacon with brown sugar ... the first time I was much more gentle and the taste was too subtle .
And make sure it 's really crisp .
My oven may run cold , but 8 minutes a side was not enough .
The second time I cooked the bacon at 375 for 10 minutes a side and next time I 'll go a smidge longer .
My second batch was delightfully addictive , but my first batch just seemed like I was serving cold , oddly sweet bacon .

Louis CK had a hand in this .
I give " Shazzan " ( the show this is based on ) a little bit of credit for making the titular genie do interesting things with his powers -- perhaps the only documented instance of Hanna Barbera giving a shit .
In one episode , a rival wizard imprisons Shazzan in a cage ; how does he escape ?
Does he turn into a snake ?
How about a puddle of water ?
Maybe Shazzan just shrinks ?
Nope , he turns into an entire conga line of Shazzans who march out single file between the bars .

— During the down economy , panhandling - related offenses are on the rise in Raleigh .
So far this year , police have arrested 212 people on charges , such as panhandling without a permit , loitering and pedestrian interference .
During the same time last year , 162 people had been arrested .
Martin Sansalone said he knows how to panhandle within the city ’s guidelines .
He has been asking for money on the corner of Interstate 440 and Poole Road for four years .
The 62 - year old says , for him , begging is about survival .
" I could n't pay the bills , ” he said .
Sansalone lives in a homeless campsite in the woods near the intersection .
“ We are just gambling out here right now , ” he said of life on the streets .
On a good day , Sansalone said he can make $ 20 an hour panhandling , but he must have a permit from the Raleigh Police Department .
" Oh yeah , I got a permit , ” he said Monday afternoon .
The permits last a year and without one , beggars could be arrested and fined .
Thomas Mills was charged Friday with begging without a permit , according to an arrest warrant .
The 38 - year - old homeless man was taken into custody on the corner of I - 440 and Hillsborough Street .
“ If they are going to be panhandling , begging in the city of Raleigh , they are expected to have that permit , ” said Raleigh police spokesman Jim Sughrue .
The permits are free , but a photo ID is needed to apply .
“ Once it is made certain they are not people who are wanted for anything , then a permit can be issued to them , ” Sughrue said .
The permits are designed to help police identify the panhandlers , while also pointing out guidelines .
The permit asks that there be no aggressive begging and no blocking traffic .
Panhandlers are also advised to stay away from ATM machines and to operate between the hours of 8 a.m. to 9 p.m .
Dean was an avid driver and often participated in car races .
He went racing with his Porsche 356 Speedster and came in second in the Palm Springs Road Races , third in Bakersfield and fourth in the Santa Monica Road Races .
While he was on the set of Rebel Without a Cause , he traded his Speedster for a Porsche 550 Spyder – only 90 such models were ever made .
“ You Will Be Dead Next Week … “
The car was nicknamed Little Bastard by Dean ’s stunt driving coach Bill Hickman .

Prophet is a lightweight schemaless database designed for peer to peer replication and disconnected operation .
Prophet keeps a full copy of your data and ( history ) on your laptop , desktop or server .
Prophet syncs when you want it to , so you can use Prophet - backed applications whether or not you have network .
SD ( Simple Defects ) is a peer - to - peer issue tracking system built on top of Prophet .
In addition to being a full - fledged distributed bug tracker , SD can also bidirectionally sync with your RT , Hiveminder , Trac , GitHub or Google Code issue tracker .
Today marks the public release of " Cavil " , the first versions of SD and Prophet which are ready for general use ( though we 've been using SD to keep track of its own bugs for over a year ) .
Cavil is the culmination of 16 months of work and includes contributions from at least 20 developers :
A. Christine Spang , Alec Clews , Alex Vandiver , Arjen Laarhoven , c9s , Casey West , Chia-liang Kao , Florian Ragwitz , Franck Cuny , Hans Dieter Pearcey , Kang-min Liu , Kevin Falcone , Robert Krimen , Ruslan Zakirov , Shawn Moore , Simon Wistow , sunnavy , Will Thompson , Yanick Champoux
Two contributors deserve special mention :
First , I 'd like to thank Christine Spang .
Over the past two summers , she 's done an astonishing job of making SD ( and Prophet ) friendlier and easier to use , better documented and better tested .
She successfully got us from " oh yeah , we should have a public release eventually " to today .
Thanks , Christine !
Second , I 'd like to thank my partner in crime Chia-liang Kao.
CL and I designed and wrote 8000 lines of code which formed the core of what became Prophet and SD over the course of a marathon 8 day hackathon .
Prophet and SD should be considered " beta " quality software .
They 're unlikely to lose data and we 've found that they work well for us .
Database formats are considered to be stable and we 'll go to great lengths to ensure upgradability to new released versions from today forward .
SD supports custom ticket properties , comments and attachments .
It uses Prophet 's " social " conflict resolution system to ease collaborative work and keep full change history for each and every ticket update .
SD ships with both a web interface and a scriptable CLI .
It integrates with git and Darcs .
In addition to the sync plugins mentioned above , SD ships with read - only support for Redmine .
A bidirectional Lighthouse sync plugin is forthcoming .
Prophet and SD are available from CPAN :

This week the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America , which has quite possibly the gayest logo of any religious entity , is meeting in Minneapolis to vote on whether the church will permit sexually active gays from joining the clergy .
Yes , mere human mortals will decide which type of people are permitted to get closer to god .
And as a lead - up to the vote ?
Ninety - five clergy members came out .
A booklet called One Table , Many Blessings is being distributed amongst church members to show just how many people will be affected if the vote goes against LGBTs .
The booklet includes the names of the 95 “ actively gay ” clergy members , some of whom have families .
Currently , only celibate gays can join the clergy , because they ’re less fabulous .
The head football coach at Breckinridge County High School took about 20 players on a school bus late last month to his church , where nearly half of them were baptized , school officials say .
The mother of one player said her 16 - year - old son was baptized without her knowledge and consent , and she is upset that a public school bus was used to take players to a church service — and that the school district 's superintendent was there and did not object .
" Nobody should push their faith on anybody else , " said Michelle Ammons , whose son , Robert Coffey , said Coach Scott Mooney told him and other players that the Aug. 26 outing would include only a motivational speaker and a free steak dinner .
" He said it would bring the team together , " Robert , a sophomore , said in an interview .
Two other parents , however , said in interviews that their sons told them that Mooney had said the voluntary outing to Franklin Crossroads Baptist Church in Hardin County would include a revival .
Mooney , contacted by phone , said school district officials instructed him not to comment .
But Superintendent Janet Meeks , who is a member of the church and witnessed the baptisms , said she thinks the trip was proper because attendance was not required , and another coach paid for the gas .
Meeks said parents were n't given permission slips to sign but knew the event would include a church service , if not specifically a baptism .
She said eight or nine players came forward and were baptized .
" None of the players were rewarded for going and none were punished for not going , " Meeks said .
David Friedman , general counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky , said in an interview that the trip would appear to violate Supreme Court edicts on the separation of church and state — even if it was voluntary and the school district did n't pay for the fuel .
" If players want to attend the coach 's church and get baptized , that 's great , " Friedman said .
But a coach cannot solicit player attendance at school , he said , noting , " Coaches have great power and persuasion by virtue of their position , and they have to stay neutral . "

In shocking news , water is still wet , the sky is still blue , and the National Association of Manufacturers is still predicting economic catastrophe if the United States acts against climate change .
NAM , in partnership with the American Council for Capital Formation , released a new study on Wednesday of the climate and energy bill that the House passed in June , better known as Waxman - Markey .
They predict that the “ anti-energy , anti-growth , and anti-jobs bill ” will “ destroy growth . ”
“ Higher energy costs are bad for manufacturers and the 12 million Americans who work in the manufacturing sector , ” said Jay Timmons , executive vice president of NAM , in a call with reporters .
“ After all , manufacturing uses a third of all the electricity generated in the United States . ”
Their report predicts that , under the Waxman - Markey bill , the U.S. would lose between 1.8 million and 2.4 million jobs by 2030 .
The bill would increase costs for each household between $ 118 to $ 250 by 2020 , and $ 730 to $ 1,248 by 2030 .
And it would cost the economy up to $ 3.1 trillion dollars over the period of 2012 to 2030 , with annual gross domestic product dropping between $ 419 billion and $ 571 billion by 2030 .
The study also includes state - specific data for 15 industrial and fossil - fuel - dependent states — many of which happen to be represented by senators who are considered swing votes on a climate bill this year , including Arkansas , Indiana , Michigan , Missouri , Pennsylvania , and Ohio .
The state numbers were similarly grim , predicting the loss of up to 97,500 jobs in Pennsylvania and up to 59,260 in Indiana .
NAM plans to use the figures to “ educate policy makers ” over the next few months , said Timmons .
“ We want to make sure those members of the Senate that represent states that benefit from a strong manufacturing base have a full understanding of the impacts of this bill , ” said Timmons .
Scary , eh? Problem is , the NAM / ACCF numbers do n’t gibe with the analyses of Waxman - Markey done by government agencies .
The Energy Information Administration says that the bill would increase household costs just $ 83 per year , or less than 23 cents per day .
The Environmental Protection Agency put the cost slightly higher , at between $ 88 and $ 140 per household per year , and the Congressional Budget Office estimated about $ 175 a year by 2020 — but both would make the bill cheaper than a postage stamp per day .
The NAM / ACCF report relies on some assumptions that skew the numbers .
For instance , it claims to use data from the EIA , but cherry - picks its figures .
The NAM study predicts that just 10 to 25 gigawatts of new nuclear power would be developed under the bill .
But the EIA estimates that 11 additional gigawatts of nuclear power would come online by 2030 without a cap on carbon , and up to 135 gigawatts under the Waxman - Markey bill .
There are also some dubious assumptions about offsets .
While the Waxman - Markey bill allows for up to 2 billion tons of offsets — half domestic , half international — the NAM study assumes that 95 percent of those offsets would be domestic .
Domestic offsets are far more expensive than international offsets .
Margo Thorning , senior vice president and chief economist for ACCF , indicated on the groups ’ press call today that they believed the nuclear projections were “ quite generous , ” and that they “ tried to be very transparent about what the assumptions were that were underlying these results . ”
Still , it ’s hard to tell what assumptions were plugged into their study .
In a footnote in the executive summary [ PDF ] , Science Applications International Corporation ( SAIC ) , the group commissioned to conduct the study , makes clear that the “ input assumptions , opinions and recommendations in this report are those of ACCF and NAM , and do not necessarily represent the views of SAIC . ”
NAM has been an outspoken opponent of climate change legislation , and has lobbied heavily against action for many years .
The association sponsored a similar study last year of the Lieberman - Warner Climate Security Act ; it was also skewed by cherry - picked data .
Environmental groups are already pouncing on the NAM numbers .
Even before the official release , Environmental Defense Fund issued a statement arguing that NAM ’s study is largely based on “ make - believe . ”
“ NAM ’s numbers are about as trustworthy as the forged letters sent by their allies to members of Congress , which faked opposition to the ACES bill from local community groups , ” said EDF national media director Tony Kreindler , referring to the scandal that erupted earlier this month over fake letters sent on behalf of coal interests .
Conservative anti-climate - action forces are already latching on to the report .
And NAM is co-sponsoring anti-climate - bill rallies in 20 states over the next month , where you can be sure these new numbers will be a hot topic .
A person ’s risk of cardiovascular disease , type II diabetes and hypertension is known to be linked to obesity , and now researchers have established that being overweight can also affect a person ’s brain .
In the journal Human Brain Mapping , Paul Thompson , a UCLA professor of neurology , and colleagues compared the brains of people who were obese , overweight , and of normal weight , to see if they had differences in brain structure .
They found that obese people had 8 percent less brain tissue than people with normal weight , while overweight people had 4 percent less tissue .
“ That ’s a big loss of tissue and it depletes your cognitive reserves , putting you at much greater risk of Alzheimer ’s and other diseases that attack the brain , ” noted Thompson .
“ But you can greatly reduce your risk for Alzheimer ’s , if you can eat healthily and keep your weight under control . ”
The new study used brain images from an earlier study known as the Cardiovascular Health Study Cognition Study .
The researchers converted the scans into detailed three - dimensional images using tensor - based morphometry , a neuroimaging method that offers high resolution mapping of anatomical differences in the brain .
In looking at both grey matter and white matter of the brain , the researchers found that the people defined as obese had lost brain tissue in the frontal and temporal lobes , areas of the brain critical for planning and memory , and in the anterior cingulate gyrus ( attention and executive functions ) , hippocampus ( long term memory ) and basal ganglia ( movement ) .
Overweight people showed brain loss in the basal ganglia , the corona radiata , white matter comprised of axons , and the parietal lobe ( sensory lobe ) .
“ The brains of obese people looked 16 years older than the brains of those who were lean , and in overweight people looked eight years older , ” said Thompson .
“ Along with increased risk for health problems such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease , obesity is bad for your brain : we have linked it to shrinkage of brain areas that are also targeted by Alzheimer ’s , ” added co-researcher Cyrus A. Raji .
“ But that could mean exercising , eating right and keeping weight under control can maintain brain health with aging . ”

I am delighted that you are reading this column .
I am more delighted if , to do so , you bought a real newspaper , imagining it crafted by nocturnal trolls smearing ink on dead trees in a mountain cave , delivered each morning by rose - cheeked Hovis boys on bikes .
If , on the other hand , you are reading it on screen then you are not paying for my work .
You are getting it scot - free .
Except for a dribble of advertising , you are not contributing to the Guardian 's precarious finances , or to mine .
You are also giving me the uncomfortable feeling that , if you were not reading for free , you would not bother at all .
As Johnny Cash said , " Damn your eyes " .
Rupert Murdoch has now declared the free ride over .
His titles – the Times , Sunday Times and others – will be obtainable in some shape or form online only through a credit card number .
Such charges are already levied for the nether regions of the Wall Street Journal and New York Times .
But attempts to put mainline news and comment behind a " paywall " have in the past foundered , because of the ease of circumvention and the bruised egos of writers suddenly denied the bulk of their " market " .
Murdoch 's move is comparable to his attack on union - led newspaper costs when he moved his British titles to Wapping in 1985 .
Then the rest of the industry jeered and rushed to undermine him , while privately praying for him to succeed .
When he did they rushed to imitate him .
Britain 's newspapers enjoyed two decades of prosperity and choice unparalleled in the western world .
Now Murdoch wants to transform not costs but revenues .
Getting history to repeat itself will not be easy .
The bogus idea that " news is free information " has captivated a generation of media managers .
It is like saying fruit is free food or wind is free energy .
As James Harkin , the author of Cyburbia , wrote in the Guardian last week , newspapers were " seduced by the evangelical gee- whizzery of the electro - hippies " .
Editorial machismo was boosted by multimillion " unique hits " .
The truth was that online newspapers were free - sheets for slow learners .
In theory online subscription should offer a torrent of cash , provided newspapers can bear the apparent shame of plummeting hits .
The New York Times paywall generated $ 10 m a year , while it lasted .
Even if so - called readership falls by 90 % , 250,000 devotees at , say , £ 100 a year could mean life or death to a publication .
Consultants on both sides of the Atlantic are now working round the clock on how best to design paywalls , portals , " freemiums " , micro-charges and pay - per-reads .
Lawyers are meanwhile fighting the oldest game in publishing , how to guard copyrights ( at least for 24 hours ) .
If Dickens and Kipling could crack it , I am sure they can .
But what are they really guarding ?
Trinity Mirror 's boss , Sly Bailey , reacted to Murdoch 's announcement by asking : " Why would you pay when you can get the same thing somewhere else for free ? "
The answer can only be to ensure that " the same thing " is not available elsewhere , that the product is unique , be it news and analysis , comment , gossip or sex advice .
I was once asked by a streetwise Californian what business I was in .
When I said I wrote for the Guardian , he looked glum .
" Great brand , " he said , " pity about the product . "
He regarded it as a tragedy that a popular ideology , that of world liberalism , should be tied to a dead forest .
The Guardian should not be selling newspapers , he said , it should be selling liberals .
At present the newspaper industry is like the British army retreating on Dunkirk .
As before Wapping , it asks only how many boats might there be for survivors , two titles or perhaps three ?
Erecting paywalls may delay the retreat , but I sense that as long as online news media are selling just information and comment , they will be vulnerable to Bailey 's web attrition .
The key must be to learn the lesson of the most tightly competitive medium of all : popular music .
It has cast off its enslavement to recording studios and recast itself , almost in Victorian mode , as a mass movement for live audiences .
Music online is all but free .
Live costs a fortune .
Young people will pay more for a gig in a club than for a Led Zeppelin CD .
This summer I have found myself attending four live events : the Hay Festival , Glastonbury , the CLA Game Fair and the Welsh Eisteddfod .
All were packed .
They had almost nothing in common , other than vast crowds being parted from considerable sums of money in the cause of affinity .
While television companies and online projects ailed , live was booming .
If newspapers were anywhere at these events it was , crazily , as sponsors rather than profit - takers .
They have let the torch of cultural championship pass to a new generation of promoters and impresarios .
Local newspapers are quietly dying when they should be staging everything from commercial fairs to sporting events and arts and book festivals .
There is money in all of them .
Newspapers should not be investing in fancy printing presses but in the " long - tail " economics of live enterprise , with the printed word as a mere core activity .
To my Californian friend the Guardian was a life - style , a niche , an affinity group .
Whatever the point of entry , somewhere behind a paywall was a beckoning club , privileged access not just to news and comment but to a galaxy of media brands , events , concerts , courses , seminars , conferences , tours and related discounts and dating agencies .
To pay was not to read , it was to join .
A Kansas publisher of my acquaintance claims to make more margin on seminars than he does on his magazines .
British newspapers are stunned and traumatised .
The recession has ripped the bottom from their boat .
I am sure they will refloat somehow , as they did at the end of the 19th century with the advent of rotary presses and mass readership .
There will always be rich men ( or rich foundations ) to support some of them .
Even in their printed form they remain user - friendly products for readers fed up with looking at screens every hour of the day .
But to be secure a media operation must entice an audience to enjoy what the web cannot supplant , a paid - for exclusivity and an opportunity for a unique participative experience .
Like other purveyors of culture , such as musicians , actors , writers and even church people , newspapers will have to generate new markets for their wares .
Goodbye Guardian , welcome the Guardian Experience .
Toi aussi , trouve une comparaison à la con . «
Ces gens - là , ils auraient vendu du beurre aux allemands pendant la guerre ! « , se serait exclamé mardi le président du SNEP Christophe Lameignère ( et PDG de Sony Music ) , à propos des internautes qui s’opposent à la loi Hadopi et proposent de mettre sur la place publique les noms des députés qui ont voté pour , et des artistes qui l’ont soutenu .
Doit - on dire des maisons de disques qui soutiennent la surveillance des internautes qu’ils auraient été des agents de la Stasi pendant la guerre froide ?
Mais surtout , la comparaison est outrageusement , péniblement crétine .
Elle accompagne un flot d’imbécillités qui participe à la stagnation du marché numérique en France .
Si les anti-Hadopi avaient dû choisir un camp pendant la guerre ( mais qu’on nous épargne toi et moi si possible très longtemps d’avoir à choisir un camp ) , ce serait celui des Résistants .
Car c’est bien au nom de la défense des valeurs républicaines que les anti-Hadopi se sont élevés contre le projet de loi Hadopi .
C’est bien parce que des anti-républicains ont voulu « gazer du pirate » avec des procédés qui ne respectaient pas la présomption d’innocence , le droit à la vie privée , et la liberté d’expression et de communication – entre autres , que le Conseil constitutionnel a donné raison aux résistants anti-Hadopi en censurant les dispositions les plus demandées du projet de loi .
S’il faut choisir un camp , nous choisissons celui de la Constitution avant celui des artistes .
Des artistes qui , rappelons - le à M. Lameignère , avaient été nombreux à chanter pour les allemands pendant la guerre .
Il ne s’agit bien évidemment pas de mettre tous les artistes dans le même panier , mais bien de pointer à quel point ce type de comparaison est insultante et fausse , pour tout le monde .
Slavery existed for thousands of years , in all sorts of societies and all parts of the world .
To imagine human social life without it required an extraordinary effort .
Yet , from time to time , eccentrics emerged to oppose it , most of them arguing that slavery is a moral monstrosity and therefore people should get rid of it .
Such advocates generally elicited reactions that ranged from gentle amusement to harsh scorn and violent assault .
When people bothered to give reasons for opposing the proposed abolition , they advanced many different ideas .
In the first column of the accompanying table , I list ten such ideas that I have encountered in my reading .
At one time , countless people found one or more of these reasons an adequate ground on which to oppose the abolition of slavery .
In retrospect , however , these reasons seem shabby — more rationalizations than reasons .
They now appear to nearly everyone to be , if not utterly specious , then shaky or , at best , unpersuasive , notwithstanding an occasional grain of truth .
No one now dredges up these ideas or their corollaries to support a proposal for reestablishing slavery .
Although vestiges of slavery exist in northern Africa and a few other places , the idea that slavery is a defensible social institution is defunct .
Reasons that once , not so long ago , seemed to provide compelling grounds for opposing the abolition of slavery now pack no intellectual punch .
Neither Liberty nor Sa ... Robert Higgs Best Price : $ 3.99 Buy New $ 10.00 ( as of 05:35 EST - Details )
Strange to say , however , the same ideas once trotted out to justify opposition to the abolition of slavery are now routinely trotted out to justify opposition to the abolition of government ( as we know it ) .
Libertarian anarchists bold enough to have publicly advanced their proposal for abolishing the state will have encountered many , if not all , of the arguments used for centuries to prop up slavery .
Thus , we may make a parallel list , as shown in the table ’s second column .
Resurgence of the Warf ...
Higgs , Robert Best Price : $ 1.41 Buy New $ 6.20 ( as of 11:55 EST - Details )
In the table , my repetition of the cumbersome expression “ government ( as we know it ) ” may seem odd , or even irritating , but I have chosen to tax the reader ’s patience in this way for a reason .
When the typical person encounters an advocate of anarchism , his immediate reaction is to identify a list of critical government functions — preservation of social order , maintenance of a legal system for resolving disputes and dealing with criminals , protection against foreign aggressors , enforcement of private property rights , support of the weak and defenseless , production and maintenance of economic infrastructure , and so forth .
This reaction , however , shoots at the wrong target .
Libertarian anarchists do not deny that such social functions must be carried out if a society is to function successfully .
They do deny , however , that we must have government ( as we know it ) to carry them out .
Libertarian anarchists prefer that these functions be carried out by private providers with whom the beneficiaries have agreed to deal .
When I write about government “ as we know it , ” I am referring to the monopolistic , individually nonconsensual form of government that now exists virtually everywhere on earth .
Readers may object that at least some existing governments do have the people ’s consent , but where ’s the evidence ?
Show me the properly signed and witnessed contracts .
Unless all of the responsible adults subject to a government ’s claimed authority have voluntarily and explicitly accepted its governance on specific terms , the presumption must be that the rulers have simply imposed their rule .
Propaganda statements , civics texts , opinion surveys , barroom allegations , political elections , and so forth are beside the point in this regard .
No one would think of proffering such forms of evidence to show that I have a valid contract with Virgin Mobile , which supplies me with telelphone service .
When will the governments of the United States , the state of Louisiana , and St. Tammany Parish send me the contracts wherein I may agree ( or not ) to purchase their “ services ” on mutually acceptable terms ?
The similarity of arguments against the abolition of slavery and arguments against the abolition of government ( as we know it ) should shake the faith of all Americans who still labor under the misconception that ours is a “ government of the people , by the people , for the people . ”
From where I stand , it looks distressingly like an institutional complex that rests on the same shaky intellectual foundations as slavery .
Arguments Against the Abolition of Slavery and Arguments Against the Abolition of Government ( as We Know It )
The Best of Robert Higgs
by Joseph Domino
There is perhaps no topic in America where we talk out of two sides of our mouths more than Education .
Education is in crisis at all levels , but at the college and university level it cries out and no one seems to be listening .
Everyone says education is important but our standards continue to drop and we fall behind other countries .
Faculty , the hearts and souls of universities , are being relegated to “ operating costs ” which are forever scrutinized for reduction .
The adjunct system , around a long time , provides that cost control , and it has slowly been eroding opportunities for full - time professors and the salaries and benefits that accompany that status .
When adjunct faculty handle a full - time course load plus work other part - time jobs to make ends meet it compromises the quality of their instruction which affects students .
No matter how many courses adjuncts teach , they are still considered part - timers .
It ’s drudgery and adjuncts carry about the same status as a Wal - Mart greeter or grocery bagger , and the pay is about the same .
Let ’s break it down .
Salary .
Adjuncts simply do not earn a livable wage .
When I divide my net pay by hours per week , it comes out to something like $ 11 - 12 per hour .
The only way I can afford to do this is with supplementary income from investments .
Other adjuncts are not so fortunate .
Additionally , this hardship is by no way limited to adjunct instructors .
Matthew Benjamin in Bloomberg
News recently reported , “ The number of Americans who want full - time jobs but are working part time has increased 83 percent in a year to 9 million , according to Labor Department data . ”
He went on to say , “ They are part of a broader group that includes those who want a job but have stopped looking for work and those who want full - time positions but have to settle for part - time employment .
A measure of underemployment that counts those people has almost doubled in the past two years , to 15.6 percent , providing a more complete gauge of the labor market ’s deterioration . ”
In the case of the adjunct , it is often a full - time work week at part - time pay .
As of 2004 , my local County School District ( K - 12 ) had a base starting salary for first - year teachers of approximately $ 36 K with post - graduate degrees .
A first - level regular faculty Instructor position at the college has a salary range of $ 41 - 52 K .
Although I am in the system , I have applied twice for such a position and was not even contacted .
Benefits .
There are none .
Of primary interest , of course , is health insurance .
Not even something basic like doctor visits and prescriptions .
However the college does offer a benefit which full - time employees ( faculty and non-faculty ) can purchase : pet insurance .
Locally , at any rate , this would be a public relations disaster except no one seems to know or care .
I contacted a local newspaper reporter who covers higher education in the area .
The reporter was not interested in the story .
There is a 403b retirement plan , which is mandatory .
I need every dollar and the deduction does n’t help me .
When I questioned Human Resources , I was told schools do this to avoid contributing to employees ’ Social Security – in other words , to save the college money .
Working Conditions .
On the plus side , adjuncts work mostly unsupervised , but while the Administration says we have its full backing , there has been a growing culture of viewing students as consumers and professors as “ facilitators . ”
It ’s kind of the McUniversity model .
Would you like a plus with that B ?
The widespread deficiency in basic skills and cultural literacy is shocking .
The Administration also talks a lot about “ student retention . ”
In four English Comp .
II classes , no one had ever heard of Thoreau ’s Walden , let alone having read it .
Once in a discussion of psychology and Macbeth , I mentioned Freud ’s theory of the subconscious .
Blank stares .
I asked how many had taken Psych .
101 . A few hands went up .
I said you covered Freud , right ?
No , they had not .
Many adjuncts with no other sources of income struggle to get by .
I have heard of some teaching as many as nine courses across three campuses .
( Editor ’s Note : This phenomenon is not uncommon .
I know one adjunct who taught eight courses per term at one campus , while also serving as the program director and consulting on the side . )
We do not have private offices , but instead a large shared room with computers , workspace , other equipment , lockers ( this last gives it all the charm of a bus station ) .
A new building opened recently with classrooms and offices .
Many of the regular faculty moved their offices to the new building , leaving many vacant in the old one .
A good number of them were quickly filled by instructors / consultants running a “ Small Business Development ” program .
An office , even closet - sized with no windows , is a small perk , but in the world of academic untouchables , no request is too small .
The point is that an office communicates a sense of professionalism to students and and lends a sense of ownership and belonging to the instructor .
The college has a formal commitment to “ Sustainability , ” which appears proudly on their Web site .
Areas of sustainability include the environment , economic growth , and social [ my emphasis ] responsibility .
This is embarrassing , when one considers the passive abuse inflicted on adjuncts .
In fact , it is the height of social irresponsibility .
I have heard of faculty being chastised for drinking from plastic water bottles .
I suppose the only thing we should throw away is people .
To my mind , it ’s not far removed from Orwell ’s 1984 , where any statement must be accepted as true because the State says it is .
At the very least there is a latent hypocrisy at work here .
The Lone Star College Model .
In an article entitled , “ Adjunct Inspiration , ” The Chronicle of Higher Education reported in its March 27 issue that “ officials say they are trying to improve conditions for both faculty members and students by offering a limited number of “ full - time adjunct ” positions .
These are adjuncts , typically hired for an academic year , who work a full - time teaching load — usually five classes per semester .
They receive full benefits and their pay is 70 percent of what a comparably qualified full - time faculty member would earn .
That ’s because full - time pay is based 70 percent on teaching and 30 percent on service and professional development .
Adjuncts do not have the latter two requirements . ”
Not great , but a better deal than we have presently .
It might provide a good model or basis for working toward reform .
It should not be characterized as a compromise , but as a step in the right direction .
The Larger Implications .
Tenured faculty seem often behave as though they have no stake in this situation .
They do .
They are systematically being phased out .
This should be their fight , too .
The two - thirds model ( adjunct staffing percentage ) can be viewed as analogous to the Feudal system , where the peasants and serfs constituted the majority and wealth and power were concentrated in the minority ruling class .
For the future , we would have to ask who would be inclined to become an educator in the current environment ?
Conclusion .
In an interview , Michael Moore responded to a question about whether every American was entitled to health care .
His reply , applicable here , was , “ We have to decide what kind of people we are . ”
He was referring to our national character .
Do we extend a hand to the deprived , or simply say “ every man for himself ” ?
Politically , health care , education , and livable wages are “ social ” problems .
As soon as the “ S ” word appears , many reactionaries equate this with “ social engineering , ” a stone ’s throw from the dreaded iron fist of socialism .
Institutions of higher learning should not follow the Wal - Mart business model ( e.g. , 39 - hr .
a week employees , classifying them as part - timers , who then do not qualify for benefits ) .
We are slowly but inexorably abandoning our national commitment to academics , and thus losing our vision .
In doing so we can not sustain our democratic way of life .
One of our founding fathers put it this way :
“ If a nation expects to be ignorant and free , in a state of civilization , it expects what never was and never will be . ” – Thomas Jefferson , 1816

Editor ’s Note :
The following article is reprinted from the Today @ PC World blog at PCWorld.com .
Hollywood has a problem .
It ’s red , boxy , lets you rent DVDs for $ 1 a night , and is severely threatening movie studios from making money .
The threat is Redbox self - serve DVD rental kiosks outside McDonalds and in grocery stores .
The Associated Press reports earlier this week 20th Century Fox ordered its wholesalers not to sell DVD discs to Redbox until 30 days after a movie ’s initial release to help boost retail sales .
This came a day after Redbox ’s parent company , Coinstar , reported a 110 percent revenue increase in the second quarter of this year while DVD sales fell 13.5 percent in the first half of the year .
Fox is n’t the first studio to play hardball with the kiosk company .
Last year , Universal Pictures and Redbox got in a scuffle after the studio tried to push a 45 - delay waiting period .
When Redbox objected , Universal cut off its supply .
Redbox now has to buy Universal movies at retail stores , the cost of which could significantly cut into its profit ( each disc only makes around $ 25 in rentals , according to estimates . )
Not all studios are downers on cheap rentals .
Earlier this month , Sony agreed to sell cheaper discs to Redbox .
The contract also stated that Redbox was to destroy the discs after renting them instead of selling them as previewed for $ 7 each .
The companies acknowledge their decisions will ultimately have an effect on the consumer , but without $ 15 per DVD , there is no movie industry .
My recommendation to Hollywood :
When you make a movie worth $ 15 , we ’ll pay $ 15 for it .
In the meantime , you are lucky that people are paying $ 1 a night for some of the Rotten Tomatoes you ’re putting out there .
This story , " Hollywood hates Redbox 's $ 1 DVD rentals " was originally published by PCWorld .
Betsy McCaughey is a professional liar .
She lies .
The things she writes are untrue .
They are not even " distortions . "
They are made - up .
Everyone has known this for years and yet she was still allowed to derail the nation this month .
McCaughey 's schtick , as described by James Fallows , is to pose as a disinterested , objective researcher who is just shocked and dismayed to find something insane and evil in a piece of legislation supported by a Democratic president .
And then she sits down to write a very serious and nonpartisan and concerned piece of analysis of this evil thing in the legislation that she made up .
And then some respectable outlet publishes her serious analysis .
And then , within minutes , partisan Republican columnists , talk radio hosts , politicians , and operatives are disseminating talking points taken directly from that serious piece of entirely made - up bullshit analysis .
Her first stab at derailing this year 's health care debate came with a Bloomberg column about fictitious health care rationing hidden in the stimulus bill .
In a July 24 column for the New York Post , McCaughey smeared Ezekiel Emanuel ( the nice Emanuel brother ) as a murderous " deadly doctor . "
In a radio interview with Fred Thompson , McCaughey got more explicit , wholly inventing mandatory death panel sessions American seniors would have to face every five years .
And , thus , " death panels . "
From Betsy to Rush to Sarah Palin to Chuck Grassley to your own old relatives forwarding you crazy shit , probably .
Of course , she 's been at this forever .
In 1994 , McCaughey worked for the Manhattan Institute , a right - wing think tank .
And then she wrote a piece for The New Republic about how the Clinton health care plan would not allow people to buy health care coverage outside the government - run plan .
This , obviously , was false .
George
Will picked up on it , adding nonsense about jail terms .
( Andrew Sullivan edited The New Republic from 1991 through 1996 .
In 1994 , Sullivan was on a roll , publishing both the objectively racist pseudoscience of The Bell Curve and Betsy McCaughey 's No Exit .
This was all before Ruth Shalit and Stephen Glass .
Current editor Franklin Foer apologized for the McCaughey piece shortly after assuming his position .
Sullivan never really has .
McCaughey 's story was really more the fault of owner / " editor - in- chief " Marty Peretz , of course , because he had a psychotic hatred of Bill Clinton . )
So .
After that one lying story full of lies made her famous , Al D'Amato told George Pataki to make her Lietenant Governor of New York .
She did not get along with Pataki , and she famously , weirdly , stood up for the entirety of Pataki 's 1996 State of the State address .
In 1997 , Pataki dropped her from the ticket with a nasty public letter and she decided to become a Democrat in order to run against him .
She ended up on the Liberal Party ticket , and lost , obviously , and then she moved to DC to work for the Hudson Institute , another right - wing think tank .
So she is a known liar and an elected Republican politician ( her brief and bizarre stint as a vengeful Liberal party candidate aside ) , and here she is still forcing people to argue with chimerical fantasies instead of legitimate criticisms of progressive legislation .
We are hard pressed to come up any equivalent figure on " the left , " who openly and intentionally lies in the service of her partisan arguments , and who continues to do so with relative impunity , in major publications , long after the lies are exposed .

I and many other Hollywood journalists were sufficiently outraged when , one year ago , Disney / ABC ’s movie criticism show once hosted by Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel , and then Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper , was put into the unworthy hands of Ben Lyons and Ben Mankiewicz , both of whose primary claim to fame was nepotism .
Fortunately for viewers ,
At the Movies now has jettisoned the two lightweights for two heavyweights again starting September 7th : The New York Times ‘ A.O. “ Tony ” Scott ( photo , left ) and The Chicago Tribune ‘s Michael Phillips ( photo , right ) .
“ We are thrilled that A.O. Scott and Michael Phillips will be lending their well - respected and influential voices to At the Movies , ” Daytime president Brian Frons said in a statement .
“ They are regarded by millions of people as authorities in film criticism and will take the series back to its roots of one - on - one film debate that was established when the show first began with Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel . ”
My question :
Which of them is going to plug every Disney pic ?
Or will they take turns ?

The red dust which hit vast areas of eastern Australia on Wednesday has travelled right across the Tasman .
The dust has been detected in Auckland , meaning it travelled 2,160 kilometres across the Tasman .
New Zealand
Met service forecaster Chris Noble says most of the dust fell overnight .
" It 's not very thick , " he said .
" The reports have been that people have seen it on their cars and their windscreens .
" Most of that dust has now been carried to the east of the country , as that front has moved away out into the Pacific Ocean .
" Most of the dust has fallen out of the sky and that 's probably the last of it now . "
Mr Noble says many New Zealanders reported this morning that the sunrise was more red than usual .
Today Android 1.6 NDK , release 1 is available for download from the Android developer site .
To recap , the NDK is a companion to the SDK that provides tools to generate and embed native ARM machine code within your application packages .
This native code has the same restrictions as the VM code , but can execute certain operations much more rapidly .
This is useful if you 're doing heavy computations , digital processing , or even porting existing code bases written in C or C ++.
If you already use the Android 1.5 NDK , upgrading to this release is highly recommended .
It provides the following improvements :
The ability to use OpenGL ES 1.1 headers and libraries
If your application targets Android 1.6 , your native code can now directly call OpenGL ES 1.1 functions to perform graphics rendering .
This will help those programs that need to send large amounts of vertex data to the GPU .
Note , however , that activity lifecycle and surface creation must still be performed from the VM .
This NDK contains a new sample ( " san-angeles " ) that shows exactly how to do that with a GLSurfaceView object .

This NDK contains a new sample ( " san-angeles " ) that shows exactly how to do that with a GLSurfaceView object .
The ability to target either Android 1.5 or 1.6 devices
The NDK parses your project 's properties to know which platform release it is targeting .
It will then automatically use the proper headers and libraries to generate your native code .
Any application that targets 1.5 will run on Android 1.5 , Android 1.6 and any future official system release .
Targeting 1.6 should , thus , only be done if your application requires new 1.6 features / APIs , like the ability to call OpenGL ES 1.x headers from native code .

After months of gloom about the environment and Britain 's embattled wildlife , reassurance may be on its way from a creepy and often - unloved source .
Scientists and conservationists are optimistic that an annual survey will record a bumper crop of the country 's spiders – more than 650 species which variously weave , jump , hunt and have up to six eyes .
Anecdotal reports of high numbers of spiders , from amateur enthusiasts as well as specialists , are already piling up at the campaigning charity Buglife and the British Arachnological Society ( BAS ) .
Temperate weather since the end of winter , with few very hot or cold spells , has suited the animals , which emerge at this time of the year to mate .
Monitors also expect an increase in the number of craneflies , or daddy - longlegs , which like the spiders are significant indicators of the ecosystem 's wider health .
Buglife , whose motto is " conserving the small things that run the world " , said that a rise in arachnid numbers would benefit not just spiders but their many predators .
It also has implications for good housekeeping .
" One house spider will catch and dispose of 20 or so flies for you , " said Matt Shardlow , director of Buglife .
The survey is partly designed to end the instinctive " zap it " reaction of many people confronted with a spider or a web .
It is hoped that as well as recording numbers , the exercise will increase understanding of species that still have much to teach humankind .
" If you do n't like them , just leave them alone and they will leave you alone , " said John Partridge , secretary of BAS .
" But if you can , get up close and have a look at how beautifully coloured they are .
" In between commandeering friends ' gardens today for TV photo opportunities for spiders , Shardlow said " lots of fantastic spiders " were around at the moment .
The six types of house spider , which can grow to a legspan of a couple of inches , are familiar .
Others include the jumping zebra spider , which leaps on to its prey rather than bothering to make a web , and the pink prowler , which has six eyes .
" If you move furniture around and look underneath , or poke about in the garden , you should make some good finds , " Shardlow said .
" But we 're particularly interested in numbers overall .
The BAS spider recording scheme does a very good job of marking where particular species have been found , but we need a lot more data on how many spiders of all kinds there are .
" We know that numbers have fluctuated in recent years , and almost certainly went down badly in 2007 , which was one of the worst years in living memory for butterflies and moths , which are much more widely recorded .
Recent cold and wet summers have been bad news for all bugs . "
The survey was welcomed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds , which sees the spider population from the point of view of food .
Ian Dawson of the RSPB said : " It 's debatable whether some of our resident insect - eating birds , like the wren , would be able to survive the winter without a plentiful supply of spiders in leaf litter and under shrubbery .
Let 's hope the suggestion of an increase is correct . "
Cranefly larvae also have a role in maintaining soil health and breaking down leaf litter and compost .
" They are very important for biodiversity , without which we would not last very long , Shardlow said .
" And if it were n't for spiders , we would be overrun with flies and other pests which make our life unbearable . "
Handling spiders is not recommended , partly because they probably do not enjoy it , but no one has died in Britain from the small number of bites needing treatment - about 10 a year - recorded by the Natural History Museum in London .
Dangerously venomous foreign species are occasionally found in imported fruit , usually at the docks or wholesale markets .
A deadly Black Widow is now in Bristol zoo after arriving in a hosepipe brought back from San Francisco by a family from Newport , South Wales in June .
Most spider - related injuries stem from arachnophobia .

She panicked after seeing a large but harmless spider , and fell over .
Nike will relinquish its spot on the board of directors at the Chamber of Commerce .
Nike to quit Chamber post
Nike will relinquish its spot on the board of directors at the Chamber of Commerce to protest the business lobby ’s opposition to climate - change legislation .
" We believe that on the issue of climate change the Chamber has not represented the diversity of perspective held by the board of directors , " the company says in a statement obtained by POLITICO .
" Therefore , we have decided to resign our board of directors position . "

Nike has long been a strong advocate for government action to combat global warming and has said it " fundamentally disagrees " with the Chamber 's position on the climate bill .
The company helped found Business for Innovative Climate & Energy Policy , a coalition of businesses supporting congressional action to address climate and energy legislation .
Although environmentalists have called on Nike to quit the lobbying association complete – as several high - profile corporations have recently —
Nike plans to continue its membership in the Chamber in order to " advocate for climate change legislation " from within the organization , the company says .
Still , the announcement is another blow to the business lobby , which has come under intense fire for its position on cap and trade legislation .
Over the past two weeks , three major utilities have left the group .
Environmentalists heralded the departures as a weakening of the business community 's traditional opposition to climate legislation .
On Monday , Chicago - based Exelon Corp. said it would not renew its membership in the Chamber ; last week , Pacific Gas & Electric , a major California utility , and PNM Resources , a holding company that includes a large New Mexico utility , withdrew from the group .
A large part of the campaign against Chamber membership stems from the group ’s call to launch a “ Scopes Monkey Trial of the 21st century ” about the science of climate change , referring to a 1926 trial that challenged Tennessee law mandating the teaching of the divine creation and forbidding the teaching of evolution .
“ We find it dismaying that the Chamber neglects the indisputable fact that a decisive majority of experts have said the data on global warming are compelling and point to a threat that cannot be ignored , ” wrote PG&E in a letter to the Chamber .
“ In our opinion , an intellectually honest argument over the best policy response to the challenges of climate change is one thing ; disingenuous attempts to diminish or distort the reality of these challenges are quite another . ”

Today brings a new release of the Vowpal Wabbit fast online learning software .
This time , unlike the previous release , the project itself is going open source , developing via github .
For example , the lastest and greatest can be downloaded via :
git clone git://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit.git
If you are n’t familiar with git , it ’s a distributed version control system which supports quick and easy branching , as well as reconciliation .
This version of the code is confirmed to compile without complaint on at least some flavors of OSX as well as Linux boxes .
As much of the point of this project is pushing the limits of fast and effective machine learning , let me mention a few datapoints from my experience .
The program can effectively scale up to batch - style training on sparse terafeature ( i.e. 1012 sparse feature ) size datasets .
The limiting factor is typically i/o .
I started using the the real datasets from the large - scale learning workshop as a convenient benchmark .
The largest dataset takes about 10 minutes .
( This is using the native features that the organizers intended as a starting point , yet all contestants used .
In some cases , that admittedly gives you performance nowhere near to optimal . )
After using this program for awhile , it ’s substantially altered my perception of what is a large - scale learning problem .
This causes confusion when people brag about computational performance on tiny datasets with only 105 examples 🙂
I would also like to emphasize that this is intended as an open source project rather than merely a code drop , as occurred last time .
What I think this project has to offer researchers is an infrastructure for implementing fast online algorithms .
It ’s reasonably straightforward to implant your own tweaked algorithm , automatically gaining the substantial benefits of the surrounding code that deals with file formats , file caching , buffering , etc …
In a very real sense , most of the code is this surrounding stuff , which you do n’t have to rewrite to benefit from .
For people applying machine learning , there is some obvious value in getting very fast feedback in a batch setting , as well as having an algorithm that actually works in a real online setting .
As one example of the ability to reuse the code for other purposes , an effective general purpose online implementation of the Offset Tree is included .
I have n’t seen any other implementation of an algorithm for learning in the agnostic partial label setting , so this code may be of substantial interest for people encountering these sorts of problems .
The difference between this version and the previous is a nearly total rewrite .
Some bigger changes are :
We dropped SEG for now , because of code complexity reasons .
Multicore parallelization proceeds in a different fashion — parallelization over features instead of examples .
This works better with caches .
Note that all parallelization of the core algorithm is meaningless unless you use the -q flag , because otherwise you are i/o bound .
The code is more deeply threaded , with a separate thread for parsing .
There is support for several different loss functions , and it ’s easy to add your own .
I ’m interested in any bug reports or suggestions for the code .
I have substantial confidence that this code can do interesting and useful things , but improving it is a constant and ongoing process .
Memory loss associated with marijuana use is caused by the drug ’s interference with the brain ’s natural protein synthesis machinery , according to a study published in Nature Neuroscience .
Though it has been documented that marijuana impairs memory , the precise mechanism for this memory impairment was previously unknown .
Andrés Ozaita , of the Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Spain , along with colleagues in France and Germany , focused on THC , the main psychoactive chemical compound in marijuana , which acts on a specific class of receptors known as cannabinoid receptors .
These receptors are known to affect the connection strength between neurons .
The scientists found that THC increases the activity of a pathway that promotes protein synthesis in the mouse brain .
This transient increase of protein synthesis was mediated specifically by cannabinoid receptors expressed on the brain ’s inhibitory neurons , and correlated with long - term memory deficits in mice .
Interestingly , the authors also found that inhibition of this signaling pathway by rapamycin , an immunosuppressant drug used to prevent organ rejection following transplantation , prevents THC - induced amnesia in mice .
If you could create the ideal community to raise a child in , what ingredients would you include ?
First off , you 'd probably want a low crime rate .
A strong school system would also be key .
From there , you 'd need lots of other children , expansive green spaces to play in , and plenty of nearby family events .
Toss in an abundance of artistic and recreational activities , and all of a sudden you 've got one heck of a place to grow up .
At U.S. News , we wanted to find out if any communities like that already existed — and if so , where they were located .
So we dug into our database of 2,000 different places all across the country and pinpointed the locales that met these criteria .
We then examined these communities more closely to determine which places offered the best combination of safe neighborhoods , fun activities , and top - notch educators .
Our selections appear below , in our list of America 's 10 Best Places to Grow Up :
Virginia Beach , Va. : Junior adventurers will love Virginia Beach , Va .
This community of 434,000 residents in the southeastern part of the state has a low crime rate , a solid school system , and 35 miles of majestic beaches on the Atlantic Ocean and the Chesapeake Bay .
" It 's kind of neat to be able to come home from work , make a call to my wife or son , grab a bucket of chicken or some sandwiches , and then go out on the bay and have dinner , " says Greg Ward , who works for a marketing firm that represents the Virginia Beach Convention and Visitors Bureau .
Children can explore an impressive ecosystem of threatened and endangered species — including bald eagles and loggerhead sea turtles — in the 9,000 - acre Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge .
The warm summers and mild winters provide plenty of opportunities to hike , bike , and picnic your way through the 19 miles of scenic trails over at First Landing State Park .
And after checking out the sand tiger sharks and the cow - nose rays at the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center , children can catch an educational picture in its 3 - D IMAX theater .
And in early September , the community is launching an online resource — VBparents.com — designed to keep parents plugged in to local health and school news , while ensuring that they are up - to - date on all of the community activities available to their kids .
" There are lots of great parenting resources out there .
This one is going to be specific to raising your child and your family within the city of Virginia Beach , " says Jenefer Snyder , city of Virginia Beach GrowSmart coordinator .
" We are constantly going to be connecting it back to community services , activities , events , programs , and classes . "
Madison , Ala. :
Of the roughly 43,000 residents in the friendly , churchgoing town of Madison , Ala. , about 12,000 are under 18 years old .
And this bedroom community of Huntsville , Ala. , offers no shortage of outlets to keep these young folks active .
" There is an event almost every weekend — whether it is in Madison , Huntsville , or Madison County — that families can attend , " says Paul Finley , the mayor of Madison .
Children can take advantage of the area 's expansive outdoor amenities : watching beavers plunge into Bradford Creek or rabbits dart through the 130 - acre Rainbow Mountain Trails park .
And if they behave well enough , perhaps some lucky children can even persuade their mom and dad to send them to Space Camp at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in nearby Huntsville .
San Jose , Calif . :
With 9 square miles of green spaces , 300 days of sunshine a year , and four different professional sports franchises to follow , San Jose , Calif. , has everything you need for a happy childhood .
At just over 1 million residents , San Jose considers itself the capital of Silicon Valley , but it does n't take a computer scientist to understand the city 's appeal to kids .
San Jose is the country 's safest big city , and although it 's certainly expensive — the median home price is $ 449,000 — the city offers all sorts of great activities for children .
Rather than chasing its skateboarders away , San Jose has embraced them by opening six public skateboarding parks , including Lake Cunningham Regional Skate Park , the largest one in the state .
And at the Children 's Discovery Museum of San Jose , children can experience everything from theater to gardening .
Overland Park , Kan. : Just 12 miles outside of Kansas City , Mo. , is the lovely community of Overland Park , Kan .
This family - friendly suburb in America 's heartland has a four - season climate and is opening a 12 - field , artificially turfed , fully lit soccer complex in the late summer .
" Soccer is a big sport in this community , " says Mayor Carl Gerlach .
Meanwhile , at the Deanna Rose Children 's Farmstead , kids can visit nearly 200 farm animals , toss a bobber into a fishing pond , or take a ride in a horse - drawn wagon .
The 17 - mile - long Indian Creek Trail makes for a great bike ride .
At the same time , sports fans are only a short car ride away from a Kansas City Chiefs football game or a Kansas City Royals baseball game .
In addition , " we have three different school districts in Overland Park , " Gerlach says .
" All three have been nationally ranked and won awards . "
Boston :
With an exciting history and a boatload of activities , Boston is a great option for parents looking to raise children in a big city .
Kids will marvel at the African penguins in the New England Aquarium , gawk at the humpback whales on a whale - watching tour , and erupt as the Red Sox take the field at beautiful Fenway Park .
At the same time , Boston is one of the safest large cities in the country .
Denver :
Whether they prefer snowboarding in the Rocky Mountains , biking through America 's largest city park system , or heading over to Invesco Field at Mile High for a Broncos football game , Denver is a wonderful place to be a kid .
Also among the country 's safest big cities , Denver has 300 days of annual sunshine , eight different professional sports franchises , and countless opportunities for fishing , white - water rafting , and horseback riding .
Rochester , Minn. :
With about 100,000 residents , the safe , friendly city of Rochester , Minn. , has enough activities to tire out even the most energetic youngsters : 85 miles of trails for in - line skating , 3,200 acres of public parks for touch football , and 56 different playgrounds .
" It 's a huge sports town , " says Brad Jones , executive director of the Rochester Convention and Visitors Bureau .
Fortunately , the area 's big sport — hockey — is well - suited for Rochester 's chilly winters .
" We [ also ] have two hockey complexes , one with four rinks under one roof and the other with two , " Jones says .
" We have the National Volleyball Center located here , and it 's always hopping with volleyball tournaments and trainings . "
Cedar Rapids , Iowa :
It would be tough to find a safer community than Cedar Rapids , Iowa , where the crime index is about a fifth of the national average .
And with a solid school system , plenty of fun activities , and affordable housing costs , this eastern Iowa city can keep your kids happy without emptying your wallet .
Tim Boyle , the executive director of the Cedar Rapids Area Convention and Visitors Bureau , says the city 's manageable size — it has just 123,000 residents — allows its young people to get involved in a variety of different activities .
" The thing that I like about Cedar Rapids is you could end up with a junior or senior in high school who is an offensive tackle on the football team and has the lead in the spring musical , " Boyle says .
In addition to a strong music program in its public schools , the area has more than 50 public tennis courts , more than 75 parks , 23 sand volleyball courts , and even a BMX dirt track .
During the winters , which can get extremely cold , children can remain active on three indoor soccer fields and five ice - skating rinks .
Plano , Texas :
With 7,000 faculty and staff members serving 55,000 students in this Texas community , the Plano Independent School District has achieved national recognition for its strength .
The Department of Education has handed 24 of its schools National Blue Ribbon Schools of Excellence awards , and 99 of its seniors were named semifinalists in the 2008 National Merit Scholarship Program .
" We have a wonderful park system here in our community that has always been very much focused on youth sports , whether it is soccer or baseball or basketball , " says Mayor Phil Dyer .
Meanwhile , the community 's less costly lifestyle — median home prices are just $ 213,900 — means there should be enough cash left in the budget for the 50 - minute trip to Arlington , Texas , for a Dallas Cowboys game .
Edison , N.J. : Working parents in Edison , N.J. , can take advantage of the township 's expansive after - school programs , which expose youngsters to a host of activities , including magic , piano , cooking , and arts and crafts .
More than 30 area parks have facilities for tennis , basketball , soccer , and other sports .
At the same time , this community of about 100,000 also offers organized youth leagues for everything from softball to lacrosse .
The loop stitch approach is very different from ordinary hand - sewing .
In the simplest hand stitch , a length of thread is tied to a small eye at the end of a needle .
The sewer passes the needle and the attached thread all the way through two pieces of fabric , from one side to the other and back again .
In this way , the needle runs the thread in and out of the fabric pieces , binding them together .
While this is easy enough to do by hand , it is extremely difficult to pull off with a machine .
The machine would have to release the needle on one side of the fabric just as it grabbed it again on the other side .
Then it would have to pull the entire length of loose thread through the fabric , turn the needle around and do the whole thing in reverse .
This process is way too complicated and unwieldy for a simple machine , and even by hand it only works well with short lengths of thread .

Instead , sewing machines pass the needle only part - way through the fabric .
On a machine needle , the eye is right behind the sharp point , rather than at the end .
The needle is fastened to the needle bar , which is driven up and down by the motor via a series of gears and cams ( more on this later ) .
When the point passes through the fabric , it pulls a small loop of thread from one side to the other .
A mechanism underneath the fabric grabs this loop and wraps it around either another piece of thread or another loop in the same piece of thread .
There are actually several different types of loop stitches , and they all work a little differently .
Chain Stitch
The simplest loop stitch is the chain stitch .
To sew a chain stitch , the sewing machine loops a single length of thread back on itself .
You can see how one version of this stitch works in the diagram below .
This content is not compatible on this device .
If the animation above is n't working , click here to get the Shockwave player .
The fabric , sitting on a metal plate underneath the needle , is held down by a presser foot .
At the beginning of each stitch , the needle pulls a loop of thread through the fabric .
A looper mechanism , which moves in synch with the needle , grabs the loop of thread before the needle pulls up .
Once the needle has pulled out of the fabric , the feed dog mechanism ( which we 'll examine later ) pulls the fabric forward .
When the needle pushes through the fabric again , the new loop of thread passes directly through the middle of the earlier loop .
The looper grabs the thread again and loops it around the next thread loop .
In this way , every loop of thread holds the next loop in place .
The main advantage of the chain stitch is that it can be sewn very quickly .
It is not especially sturdy , however , since the entire seam can come undone if one end of the thread is loosened .
Most sewing machines use a sturdier stitch known as the lock stitch .
You can see how the typical lock - stitch mechanism works in the animation below .
This content is not compatible on this device .
If the animation above is n't working , click here to get the Shockwave player .
The most important element of a lock - stitch mechanism is the shuttle hook and bobbin assembly .
The bobbin is just a spool of thread positioned underneath the fabric .
It sits in the middle of a shuttle , which is rotated by the machine 's motor in synch with the motion of the needle .
Just as in a chain - stitch machine , the needle pulls a loop of thread through the fabric , rises again as the feed dogs move the fabric along , and then pushes another loop in .
But instead of joining the different loops together , the stitching mechanism joins them to another length of thread that unspools from the bobbin .
When the needle pushes a loop through the thread , the rotary shuttle grips the loop with a hook .
As the shuttle rotates , it pulls the loop around the thread coming from the bobbin .
This makes for a very sturdy stitch .
In the next section , we 'll see how the sewing machine moves all of these components in synch .

In a landmark decision , Britain ’s trade unions have voted overwhelmingly to commit to build a mass boycott movement , disinvestment and sanctions on Israel for a negotiated settlement based on justice for Palestinians .
The motion was passed at the 2009 TUC Annual Congress in Liverpool today ( 17 September ) , by unions representing 6.5 million workers across the UK .
Hugh Lanning , chair of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign , said : ‘ This motion is the culmination of a wave of motions passed at union conferences this year , following outrage at Israel ’s brutal war on Gaza , and reflects the massive growth in support for Palestinian rights .
We will be working with the TUC to develop a mass campaign to boycott Israeli goods , especially agricultural products that have been produced in illegal Israeli settlements in the Palestinian West Bank .
’The motion additionally called for the TUC General Council to put pressure on the British government to end all arms trading with Israel and support moves to suspend the EU - Israel trade agreement .
Unions are also encouraged to disinvest from companies which profit from Israel ’s illegal 42 - year occupation of Gaza and the West Bank .
The motion was tabled by the Fire Brigades Union .
The biggest unions in the UK , including Unite , the public sector union , and UNISON , which represents health service workers , voted in favour of the motion .
The motion also condemned the Israeli trade union Histadrut ’s statement supporting Israel ’s war on Gaza , which killed 1,450 Palestinians in three weeks , and called for a review of the TUC ’s relationship with Histadrut .
Britain ’s trade unions join those of South Africa and Ireland in voting to use a mass boycott campaign as a tool to bring Israel into line with international law , and pressure it to comply with UN resolutions that encourage justice and equality for the Palestinian people .
In a medical emergency , the triage system is a priority system to treat the most life - threatening and severe injuries first .
It rations limited health resources to the most urgent cases , divided into three categories :
Those who are likely to live , regardless of receiving care , those likely to die , regardless of care , and those for whom immediate care might make a positive difference in outcome .
From a practical viewpoint , it is understandable for attending doctors and medical personnel to use the triage system to make such serious calls in a mass casualty situation .
Time is of the essence , and patients must be prioritized for treatment according to the limited resources at hand .
However , when the triage method is used on a national scale to determine allocation of limited health care availability for its citizens , it changes from a doctor making a first - hand professional decision in the best interests of the patients in his personal care , to an impersonal government making legal guidelines to patients unseen .
It becomes Abandon Ship !
writ large , where the executive officer on an overcrowded lifeboat must decide who stays and who goes , else they all perish en masse .
Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel is brother of Rahm Emanuel , the White House Chief of Staff .
He was called to be President Obama adviser on the health care bill .
Dr. Emanuel recently authored Principles for allocation of scarce medical interventions in the 2009 issue of the Lancet , a magazine concerned with bioethics issues .
In the article , Dr. Emanuel offers guidelines on how ( and most importantly , " to whom " ) limited health resources should be allocated on a national scale .
His solution is to redefine medical ethics to justify serving only some of the nations sick at the expense of others .
A sample of Dr. Emanuel ’s political triage philosophy :
" Although not always recognized as such , youngest - first allocation directs resources to those who have had less of something supremely valuable — life - years … .
…. Strict youngest - first allocation directs scarce resources predominantly to infants .
This approach seems incorrect .
The death of a 20 - year - old young woman is intuitively worse than that of a 2 - month - old girl , even though the baby has had less life .
The 20 - year - old has a much more developed personality than the infant , and has drawn upon the investment of others to begin as - yet - unfulfilled projects .
Youngest - first allocation also ignores prognosis , and categorically excludes older people .
Thus , youngest - first allocation seems insufficient on its own , but it could be combined with prognosis and lottery principles in a multiprinciple allocation system .
Save the most lives
One maximizing strategy involves saving the most individual lives , and it has motivated policies on allocation of influenza vaccine and responses to bioterrorism .
Since each life is valuable , this principle seems to need no special justification .
It also avoids comparing individual lives .
Other things being equal , we should always save five lives rather than one .
However , other things are rarely equal .
Some lives have been shorter than others ; 20 - year - olds have lived less than 70 - year - olds .
Similarly , some lives can be extended longer than others .
How to weigh these other relevant considerations against saving more lives — whether to save one 20 - year - old , who might live another 60 years if saved , or three 70 - year - olds who could only live for 10 years each — is unclear .
Although insufficient on its own , saving more lives should be part of a multiprinciple allocation system . "

This is only a small sample of the good doctor ’s rubric to determine who receives what quality of health - rationed care .
He claims to do so from a dispassionate objectivity , i.e. , without a suffering patient in front of him to bias his decision .
Please take the time to read his article in its entirely — it is the makings of a progressive - era eugenics manifesto .
To justify such Darwin - inspired selection of the fittest for national health care ; Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel wrote an earlier treatise in the 1996 Hastings Center report to redefine what constitutes " good " in terms of State - issued health care :
“ Thus , it seems there is a growing agreement between liberals , communitarians , and others that many political matters , including matters of justice and specifically , the just allocation of health care resources — can be addressed only by invoking a particular conception of the good .
We may go even further .
Without overstating it ( and without fully defending it ) not only is there a consensus about the need for a conception of the good , there may even be a consensus about the particular conception of the good that should inform policies on these nonconstitutional political issues . ”
Advocating a consensus to declare what is " Good " in terms of health care is nothing more than moral relativism to cloak the harshness of the selection process with a velvet curtain .
For those who do not have health coverage , any health coverage will seem " good " by his definition , even if only free band - aids and aspirin are handed out .
Dr. Emanuel ’s audacity to state that such redefinition of " good " health care on a national level need not be considered a constitutional or political issue shows his contempt for the representative system of our government and its citizens — obviously , we are not smart enough like him and his colleagues to be allowed to take part in the discussion , even though its our tax dollars and lives are at stake !
It is nothing more than the elitist wordplay that Orwell predicted would used to redefine the meanings of words for political consumption for the proles .
I can hardly wait to hear what level of medical care Dr. Emanuel defines as " double - plus good " !
Dr. Emanuel ’s proposal for national heath care distribution is nothing more than a kinder and gentler process of Josef Mengeles ’ method motioning his hand either to the right to direct Jews into work camp , or left to the gas chambers .
If David Duke had been selected to advise president LBJ on civil rights legislation in 1965 , one would rightfully question the objectively of such an advisor to such a issue .
But in the rush to the government trough for heath care coverage , many citizens have taken no thought of what they are being served , until too late they find that the only health care treatment they are being administered is the " final solution . "
The Best of Ron Shirtz
Bloomberg News editor - in- chief Matt Winkler wrote an Op - Ed in the Wall Street Journal yesterday explaining why he is after the Federal Reserve to come clean about it ’s secret lending program during the height of the financial crisis .
Bloomberg has filed a lawsuit against the Federal Reserve to force the Fed to reveal the name of the banks it lent money to in this operation , something I first blogged about last November .
Last month , Bloomberg won its case in District Court .
The Fed is now considering whether to appeal .
At issue is transparency in our financial system .
In the Op - Ed , Winkler puts it thus :
The law does n’t allow the government to get away with secrecy based on a mere claim that some sort of damage would result if it released the information in question .
To prevail , the Fed must “ provide evidence that if the requested information is disclosed , competitive harm would be ‘ imminent , ' ” Judge Preska wrote .
The Fed must show that competitors would use against a bank the fact that it received federal dollars — that running to the government trough for sustenance would become a competitive disadvantage .
That is n’t an easy test , and with hundreds of billions poured into financial institutions , it should n’t be .
What ’s more , the Fed did n’t come close to meeting this test .
All it offered in court were sworn statements from Fed employees speculating that borrowers might be labeled as losers .
They said nothing about how competing banks might use the information .
The issue at stake here is understanding the financial crisis and its aftermath .
The information Bloomberg is seeking is vital to that , and it belongs to all Americans .
Bloomberg is n’t alone in saying so .
Dow Jones , the New York Times , the Associated Press , Gannett Newspapers , Hearst , Advance Publications , and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press have all expressed support for Bloomberg ’s efforts and may join a friend - of - the - court brief if the decision is appealed .
Below is a Bloomberg News video in which Winkler discusses the case with Betty Liu .
In his opening remarks , Winkler says the Fed was taking on an unprecedented role and that this requires transparency .
I agree because the Fed has been politicized through these actions .
Its independence is now threatened because of it as the Federal Reserve Transparency
Act of 2009 attests .
Apple told the Federal Communications Commission on Friday that it did not reject an iPhone application submitted by Google and that it was still studying it , in part because of privacy concerns .
Apple was formally responding to a commission inquiry into the reason the Google Voice service , which offers users free domestic telephone calls , deeply discounted international calls and SMS messages , had not been allowed into the Apple iPhone App Store .
Apple said in a letter to the F.C.C. that Google Voice duplicated the functions of the iPhone , which uses the AT&T network in the United States , and might confuse users .
The application “ appears to alter the iPhone ’s distinctive user experience by replacing the iPhone ’s core mobile telephone functionality and Apple user interface with its own user interface for telephone calls , text messaging and voice mail , ” the letter said .
Apple also raised concerns that Google Voice copied all of the information about a user ’s contacts onto Google ’s servers .
“ We have yet to obtain any assurances from Google that this data will only be used in appropriate ways , ” the letter said .

MOSCOW 
At least 20 people were killed and dozens were wounded when a suicide bomber rammed a truck filled with explosives into a police headquarters in Russia ’s tumultuous North Caucasus region on Monday , according to government officials .
It was the latest episode in a spate of violence to hit the area in recent weeks .
The blast struck the police headquarters in Nazran , the capital of Ingushetia , about 9 a.m. local time as many police officials were arriving at work .
The attack seemed to further undermine the authority of Yunus - Bek Yevkurov , Ingushetia ’s populist president , who came to power last October vowing a softer approach in dealing with rebel violence than that of Ramzan Kadyrov , the president of neighboring Chechnya .
One of the more interesting parts of Delicious has always been its “ popular bookmarks ” section , a list of the links that have been bookmarked the most by users over a given time frame .
But similar to Digg , which is also currently trying to reinvent itself , it can take a relatively long time for these links to bubble up , especially compared to services like Twitter and the link tracking tools built on top of it .
Today , Delicious is trying to combat this issue by integrating a number of Twitter - related features .
With its new “ Fresh Bookmarks ” section on its homepage , Delicious does n’t wait for a story to get a lot of bookmarks ( typically more than 100 in the old version ) , but looks at other metrics including related links as well as tweet count .
They ’ve also included “ Related Tweets ” under each link , so you can see what people are saying about the bookmark .
Delicious explains this in a bit more detail on their blog :
“ On the previous delicious .com page ( click the Popular tab ) , you typically found links that had ~100 bookmarks - so more authoritative resources as opposed to fresh news .
Additionally , given that the most popular tag on delicious is ‘ design ’ , you probably encountered headlines like ‘ 100 + Wordpress Themes ’ on most days ( in fact , I used to make bets on this ) .
For this new Fresh homepage , our system displays recently bookmarked links and tweeted messages focused mostly on technology , web , politics , and media .
Underneath the hood , Fresh factors several features into the ranking like related bookmark and tweet counts , “ eats our own dogfood ” by leveraging BOSS to filter for high quality results , as well as stitches tweets to related articles even if the tweets do not provide matching URLs ( as ~ 81 % of tweets do not contain URLs ) . ”
Using only this morning to go on , the service 's new approach seems to be doing a fairly good job of finding the most important links ; a story about form President Bill Clinton 's visit to North Korea , which is clearly the most discussed news story of the day so far , takes the top slot .
Two Mashable stories are also under " Fresh Bookmarks , " so they must be doing something right :)
Here 's what the new homepage looks like :
Naturally , Delicious also wants its users to tweet more , which would conceivably add velocity to bookmarks on its new homepage and help it keep pace with other real - time link trackers .
As part of that effort , the service now lets you tweet during the process of saving a bookmark .
This is certainly the direction that Delicious needs to move in if it wants to remain relevant – at least from the perspective of delivering timely stories and links to its users .
It will always hold some utility as a bookmarking tool , but just how valuable that is in a world where you can search or tweet and typically find what you ’re looking for in seconds will increasingly come into question .

( CNN ) --
When the chips are down , the world may one day owe a debt of gratitude to a group of potato farmers high up in the mountains of Peru .
Not small potatoes : Preserving potato varieties in Peru is vital to global food security .
Thanks to a new $ 116 million global fund established this summer , the Quechua Indians are being paid to maintain their diverse collection of rare potatoes and ensure that they will be available to help the world adapt to future climate change .
The Quechua are one of 11 communities around the world , chosen for the important collection of crops they farm , which together are part of a major new initiative to ensure that the world has the options it might need to cope with future food crises .
Other countries involved include Cuba , where they will be focusing on maize and beans , as well as oranges in Egypt and wheat in Tanzania .
The fund , a cornerstone of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture ( ITPGRFA ) , aims to maintain a reservoir of essential species for all our major food crops .
" Agricultural biodiversity is essential , " Dr Shakeel Bhatti , Secretary of the Treaty , told CNN .
" It is really the global insurance that in the future we will be able to adapt to problems like climate change and population growth . "
Just as biodiversity is now seen as the cornerstone of the resilience of natural world , so having a broad variety of agricultural crops is essential to the resilience of agriculture .
Different species of plants are often able to cope with widely differing environmental conditions and many obscure varieties could hide vital disease resistance .
But the world 's valuable diversity is disappearing incredibly fast .
" The figures are quite disturbing , " said Dr Bhatti .
Over the millennia , humans have relied on more than 10,000 different plant species for food .
Today , we have barely 150 species under cultivation -- and of those only 12 species provide 80 percent of all of our food needs .
Four of those -- rice , wheat , maize and potatoes -- provide more than half of our energy requirements .
As global markets have grown and seed production and agriculture become more commercialized , the old system of farmers saving their own seeds - and by doing so a myriad of different crops , often closely adapted to local conditions - has almost disappeared .
As a result variety is dwindling towards a vanishing point .
China has lost 90 percent of the wheat varieties it had just 60 years ago .
In the United States more than 90 percent of fruit tree and vegetable varieties found in farmers ' fields at the beginning of the twentieth century are no longer there .
Mexico has lost 80 percent of its corn varieties .
India has lost 90 percent of its rice varieties
" They 're gone ; they 've disappeared forever , " said Dr Bhatti .
" From a food security point of view this makes the world 's farmers much more vulnerable to pests ... and increases the vulnerability of some poor countries to price shocks in global commodity markets . "
The ITPGRFA has two major aims : to prevent the loss of underused crops and ensure the full diversity of common crop species is maintained .
It has already enabled the establishment of a seed bank containing 1.1 million varieties that opened in Svalbard , Norway , in 2008 .
But now the focus is on crop varieties than cannot be stored in this way -- such as potatoes .
Historically , both the 19th century Irish Potato Famine and the Bengal Famine , in India , are hard lessons in what happens when we rely too much on a small range of species that are hit by disease .
But , according to Dr Bhatti , there are problems around the world now that offer a glimpse at what could happen in the future if we do n't maintain our vigilance .
Wheat Stem Rust is a devastating wind - born disease affecting cereals that has spread across Africa and is now in the Middle East , and migrating further eastwards .
" If it reaches South Asia and China then millions could face a major threat to food security , " says Dr Bhatti .
In southwest Australia years of drought , believed to be linked to climate change , have had a huge impact on rice production .
" It has almost wiped out the sector , " said Dr Bhatti .
Although the ITPGRFA was agreed in 2001 , and came into affect in 2004 , but for the last five years signatories have been locked in negotiations over how the scheme would be financed .
It was n't until a conference in Tunis in June 2009 that the deadlock was broken with the new $ 116 million benefit sharing fund , which will fund the 11 projects .
There are also contracts to ensure those countries that are centers of diversity -- often poorer nations -- benefit when species are used commercially by richer nations .
" That was a major step forward , " said Dr Bhatti .
" We now have tremendous confidence in the system ; the treaty is on track . "
Rich signatories , such as Norway , Spain and Italy , have agreed to provide the rest of the funds within five years , and according to Dr Bhatti the U.S. has expressed a desire to sign up after disinterest during the Bush administration .
So successful is the model established by the ITPGRFA that the World Health Organization is looking at it as a way of sharing information on viruses , including influenza ; there are also plans for a bank of animal genetic material .
" I must say I have been so delighted by the Tunis conference this year , " said Dr Bhatti .
" To a certain extent we were at a crossroads , but we completely came through .
It was a quantum leap ; a major thing .
We are moving forward . "
Breaking news today is that 6 members of Congress wrote a letter to CIA Director Leon Panetta regarding the accuracy ( or lack thereof ) of briefings received by members of Congress .
6 members of Congress say CIA chief admits deception
On June 26 , six Democrats on the committee — Anna Eshoo ( Calif . ) , John Tierney ( Mass . ) , Rush Holt ( N.J. ) , Mike Thompson ( Calif . ) , Alcee Hastings ( Fla. ) and Jan Schakowsky ( Ill. ) — wrote to Panetta , " Recently you testified that you have determined that top CIA officials have concealed significant actions from all Members of Congress , and misled Members for a number of years from 2001 to this week . "
The letter — which does n’t explain what those " significant actions " concerned — asks that Panetta " publicly correct " his May 15 statement that it is n’t CIA " policy or practice to mislead Congress . "
TWI acquired a copy of the letter , which comes after CQ reported that committee chairman Silvestre Reyes ( D - Texas ) also nebulously stated that CIA " affirmatively lied " to the committee .
Here is the text of the letter :

UPDATE : H/T to dharmafarmer for an additional link to a WSJ article
CIA deception dates back to 2001
Central Intelligence Agency Director Leon E. Panetta has told lawmakers that CIA officials misled Congress " for a number of years " since 2001 , according to a letter released Wednesday from six Democratic lawmakers .
The lawmakers say the CIA also withheld information about unspecified " significant actions . "
The letter did n't identify when Mr. Panetta made the statements or to what they referred .
Let 's recall House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's press conference where she made this allegation and how it was received .
Insert knee - jerk reactions here :
The Caucus
" Accusing the C.I.A. of criminal activity might make Nancy Pelosi popular with her San Francisco constituents , but it also makes her a liability in swing districts across the country , " Ken Spain , a spokesman for the House Republican campaign organization , said .
Sean sides with the CIA against the " San Francisco Speaker " .
Bad move .
Warning !!!:
This clip features Ann Coulter
And , of course , the leader of the Republican Party :
Countdown with Keith OlbermannLetter to Panetta
UPDATE 2 : It has been opined in the comments below that this report does not exonerate Nancy Pelosi , and I wanted to address that .
There seemed to have been two basic issues surrounding Pelosi 's accounts of her CIA briefings .
First , were the briefings accurate ?
Second , did Pelosi know about waterboarding and , if so , when ?
I 'll address the first issue because I believe the second to be irrelevant ( what could she have done as a member of the minority party during the Bush administration ? ) .
It is difficult to understate the media hysteria that surrounded this whole issue in May of this year .
Speaker Pelosi was raked across the coals as an unpatriotic liar who dared question the integrity of the Central Intelligence Agency , never mind its uh checkered past .
So , to this reader , any admission that the CIA was , in fact , not briefing members of Congress truthfully absolutely bolsters Pelosi 's case , and that of the other members who expressed doubts about the accuracy of the briefing documents that were released .
My apologies for the run-on sentence .

Luis Suarez followed up his promising debut for Atletico Madrid with a disappointing performance in his first start on Wednesday .
Three days after scoring two goals and setting up another in about 20 minutes off the bench in Atletico 's 6 - 1 win over Granada , Suarez struggled in the team 's 0 - 0 draw at promoted Huesca .
The former Barcelona player started alongside young Portugal forward Joao Felix , but the duo failed to spark the attack for Diego Simeone 's team .
Think this is scary ?
Try closing your eyes ( Image : Archive Photos / Getty Images )
Singers and guitar heroes alike have always employed what you might call the Celine Dion effect – closing your eyes to heighten the emotional impact of music .
Now , neuroscientists have discovered that a brain centre involved in sensing emotion and fear called the amygdala kicks into action when volunteers listen to scary music with eyes closed .
“ A lot of time we do like to close our eyes when we listen to music , we feel like this is a more powerful experience , ” says Talma Hendler , a neuroscientist at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center in Israel , who led the new brain imaging study .

Shutting your eyes heightens people ’s emotional responses to the outside world , suggests previous research – not to mention everyday experience .
Spooky sounds
To uncover any neural basis for this effect , Hendler ’s team scanned the brains of 15 volunteers while they listened to film scores – “ kind of Hitchcock - like movies , ” she says – and less emotive keyboard tunes with their eyes open or shut .
Hear a scary clip here and a neutral one here .
Sure enough , volunteers rated the eerie - sounding music – laced with staccato strings , ominous trombones , and weird effects – as more emotional than the “ elevator music ” - like keyboard tunes .
Under the gaze of a functional - MRI scanner , horror film scores elicited significantly more amygdala activity in the brains of volunteers who kept their eyes shut , compared to when they kept eyes open .
Participants ’ brains responded no differently to the neutral music whether their eyes were closed or open .
Threat response
Furthermore , a part of the brain stem that metes out the neurotransmitter noradrenalin in response to threats was more active when volunteers listened to scary music with their eyes closed than open , as was a neocortical brain region known to control emotion – the ventral prefrontal cortex .
None of these changes occurred when volunteers listened to scary music in total darkness , suggesting that temporary blindness – which could certainly heighten fear – does n’t explain the results , Hendler says .
She also thinks her team results are n’t limited to scary movie soundtracks .
“ I suspect if we had music that was positive , we would get a similar effect . ”

Although Erla Feinberg ’s final act might have disappointed most of her grandchildren , it carried out her late husband ’s dying wish in a way that held up in court .
In a unanimous decision , the Illinois Supreme Court this week ruled that Max Feinberg and his wife could legally disinherit any grandchildren who married outside the Jewish faith as long as the method of doing so did not encourage divorce .
“ Although those plans might be offensive to individual family members or to outside observers , Max and Erla were free to distribute their bounty as they saw fit and to favor grandchildren of whose life choices they approved , ” Justice Rita Garman wrote .
The origins of the case date to when Max Feinberg , a Chicago dentist , discovered that a grandson was taking a Gentile to the junior prom at Niles West High School .
Feinberg wrote his strong feelings about religious loyalty into his will in a section that some family members have dubbed the “ Jewish clause . ”

When Feinberg died in 1986 , his son , Michael Feinberg , and daughter , Leila Taylor , became executors of trusts for their mother .
Max Feinberg had stipulated that upon Erla ’s death , their grandchildren would become lifetime beneficiaries of those trusts .
However , if any of them married outside the faith , and their non-Jewish spouse did not convert to Judaism within a year , he wanted their share of those trusts to revert back to their parents .
After her husband ’s death , Erla Feinberg came up with a different scheme , same intent .
When she died in 2003 , she bequeathed $ 250,000 to the one grandchild who had married within the faith .
The four other grandchildren , who had not , got nothing .
Michele Feinberg Trull , a disinherited granddaughter , argued that the clause , dubbed the “ beneficiary restriction clause ” by the court , violated public policy by offering money to practice a particular religion .
The court disagreed , pointing out that Erla Feinberg did not set up a system that encouraged heirs to divorce and remarry to claim an inheritance .
“ Erla did not impose a condition intended to control future decisions of their grandchildren regarding marriage or the practice of Judaism ; rather , she made a bequest to reward , at the time of her death , those grandchildren whose lives most closely embraced the values she and Max cherished , ” Garman wrote .

Steven Resnicoff , co-director of the DePaul College of Law’s Center for Jewish Law & Judaic Studies , hailed the court decision as consistent with Illinois public policy .
“ It ’s not just a Jewish clause .
It ’s a Catholic clause .
It ’s a Muslim clause , ” Resnicoff said .
“ It ’s not uncommon that people want to encourage children to follow in their footsteps .
[ The ] decision emphasizes the principle that , with some exceptions , a person is free to allocate his or her assets as the person sees fit . ”

TO LEON WERTH
I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for dedicating it to a grown - up .
I have a serious reason : he is the best friend I have in the world .
I have another reason : this grown - up understands everything , even books about children .
I have a third reason : he lives in France where he is hungry and cold .
He needs cheering up .
If all these reasons are not enough , I will dedicate the book to the child from whom the grown - up grew .
All grown - ups were once children — although few of them remember it .
And so I correct my dedication :

Radical anti-choice groups have found a disturbing ally in Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning , whose public statements reveal strong support for their agenda .
Also read Wendy 's tweets from the Carhart clinic here .
Wendy Norris , a Denver - based journalist , is working on assignment for Rewire to cover anti-choice movements at the state level in the West .
She is currently reporting from Bellevue Nebraska where she is covering the anti-choice movement ’s efforts to close Dr. Carhart ’s clinic .
She will be tweeting updates at @rhrealitycheck , and will be writing articles posted here throughout the weekend .
The expected refocusing of radical anti-choice protests from
Wichita , Kan. , to suburban Omaha , Neb. , following the murder of Dr. George
Tiller has found a disturbing ally in a top state elected official .

Twelve days after Tiller was gunned down at his church by
militant anti-abortion activist Scott Roeder , Nebraska Attorney General Jon
Bruning reportedly told KETV , reacting to news that Tiller ’s friend and
colleague , Leroy Carhart , M.D. intends to begin providing late - term abortions
in his Bellevue , Neb. , clinic , stated :
“ I ’m disgusted and I ’m saddened , and
I hate it that he ’s here in Nebraska and I hate it that he ’s in America , ”
Bruning said .
“ I mean , this guy is one sick individual . ”
The stunning remark evoked a firestorm of controversy on the
KETV Omaha television station Web page , summarized by this comment from
“ tomh ” :
I find it shocking that any reputable
public official would express such hatred for a law - abiding individual .
To be
sure some people do not like abortion .
However , there are times when a woman ,
perhpaps [ sic ] to save her own life , has to undergo such a procedure .
What makes
this situation even worse is that as the state ’s Attorney General he should not
be encourageing [ sic ] the types of activity that we witnessed at the church in
Wichita or the museum in Washington .
The progressive political blog , NewNebraska.net , demanded
Bruning retract the statement and issue an apology .
According
to the site ’s managing editor , Kyle Michaelis , neither has been forthcoming .
The propriety of the state ’s top legal adviser making such
an incendiary comment now casts a shadow over the attorney general ’s office ,
which acknowledged recently accepting a formal complaint by anti-abortion
groups demanding an investigation of Carhart ’s clinic .
Bruning spokeswoman Leah Bucco- White told the Omaha
World - Herald that the complaint was filed by local activists Rescue the
Heartland and Nebraskans United for Life and national groups Operation Rescue
West and the Christian Defense Coalition — the very same absolutist
anti-abortion faction organizing the Aug. 28 - 29 mass protests at the Carhart
clinic .
The letter was referred to the state Department of Health and Human
Services .
Health department press agent Marla Augustine cited state
confidentiality laws when contacted about the details of the politically
charged accusations .
News accounts have alluded to the longstanding strategy by
the anti-choice movement to repeatedly make vague , spurious claims against
physicians well after they have been discredited .
Augustine did confirm that no previous complaints against
Carhart have resulted in state disciplinary action .
She declined to estimate
the time frame for completing the probe .
Bucco-White did not respond to an inquiry about the
incongruity between Bruning ’s personal comments and his office ’s need to
impartially review the facts of the investigation .
The compound appears to stop HIV getting in to cells
Lab tests of the chemical - CSA - 54 - at Vanderbilt University show it disables the virus 's ability to infect cells .
It was shown to attack HIV in a new way - targeting the membrane of the virus to stop it locking on to cells .
UK experts said the research was interesting - but warned a great deal more research was needed before its true value could be known .
We will need to see tests on humans before we can know its true value
Roger Pebody , Terrence Higgins Trust
The family of chemicals from which CSA - 54 come - ceragenins - are synthetically produced small molecule chemical compounds .
They were developed by scientists at Brigham Young University 's Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , and are licensed to a company called Ceragenix Pharmaceuticals , which sponsored this research .
The compounds work by being electrostatically attracted to the negatively charged cell membranes of certain viruses , fungi and bacteria , the researchers say .
This mechanism is also seen in antimicrobial chemicals in the body 's immune system .
Hype ' unwanted '
HIV specifically targets a type of immune cell called at CD4 + cell for infection .
The lab tests showed CSA - 54 blocked infection by disrupting HIV 's ability to interact with the cells .
But it was not toxic to skin cells when tested at higher concentrations than those needed to disable the virus .
Dr Derya Unutmaz , Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , who carried out the tests , told the Salt Lake Tribune : " We have some preliminary but very exciting results .
" But we would like to formally show this before making any claims that would cause unwanted hype . "
He added : " This is particularly important as a compound that targets the viral membrane is likely to be effective against all strains of the virus , regardless of mutations as the viral membrane remains unchanged . "
UK experts agreed the study was an interesting development .
Most HIV treatments attack the virus when it has already infected a cell .
Roger Pebody , Terrence Higgins
Trust 's treatment advisor said : " This is a novel approach to stopping the virus infecting other cells .
" However it is very early test tube research and is many years away from clinical trials .
We will need to see tests on humans before we can know its true value . "
Nicola Douglas , of the National Aids Trust said : " Any research which offers hope of a cure for HIV is extremely welcome .
" In the last few years , HIV treatments have come a long way towards giving people longevity and quality of life , but Aids continues to kill more people worldwide than any other infectious disease . "
Brigham Young University and Vanderbilt have jointly filed a patent on the compounds .
