WAXAHACHIE , Texas , Oct. 15 ( UPI ) -- " Pre-vivors " -- women who have both breasts removed to avoid the possibility of getting breast cancer -- are on the rise , a U.S. surgeon says .
Valerie Gorman , a breast surgeon on the staff at Baylor Medical Center in Waxahachie , Texas , credits several scientific advances for the growing number of women she sees in her practice who choose mastectomies rather than risk the odds of becoming " survivors " if they were to contract cancer .

" Women today are more educated about their risk factors , and we understand genetics better , " Gorman said in a news release Wednesday .
" Plus , genetic testing is easier than in the past , and plastic surgery reconstructive procedures are more accessible . "
With genetic testing more readily available , more women are learning if they have a defective BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene .
The tumor suppressor genes are responsible for slowing down cell division .
Defects in these genes can increase a woman 's risk of developing breast cancer by up to 80 percent , said a statement by the American Cancer Society .
The average woman has roughly a 12.5 percent of contracting breast cancer so an 80 percent increase would raise the chance to about 22 percent -- or a 78 percent chance of not getting breast cancer
However , the risk of breast cancer in women who have mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes can be reduced by a dramatic 90 percent through a bilateral mastectomy , a study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2004 found .

The Pink Sari Gang , or Gulabi ( pink ) Gang , is a group of several hundred vigilante women in India , committed to protecting women against social malpractice , corrupt administrators , and abusive husbands .
A revolutionary movement in India 's northern Uttar Pradesh state 's Banda area , the Gulabi Gang is striking fear in the hearts of wrongdoers and earning the grudging respect of officials .
Leader Sampat Pal Devi , wife of an ice cream vendor , mother of five children , and a former government health worker , says , " we are not a gang in the usual sense of the term .
We are a gang for justice . "
Two years after giving themselves a name and uniform , the women in the Pink Sari Gang have thrashed men who have abandoned or beaten their wives and unearthed corruption in the distribution of grain to the poor .
Shunning political parties and NGOs , because " they are always looking for kickbacks when they offer to fund us , " Sampat Pal Devi says , " Nobody comes to our help in these parts .
The officials and the police are corrupt and anti-poor .
So sometimes we have to take the law in our hands .
At other times , we prefer to shame the wrongdoers . "
According to 25 - year - old gang member Aarti Devi , " Men used to think the law did n't apply to them but we are forcing a huge change . "
1366 Technologies Opens Innovative Solar Manufacturing Facility
October 14th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Many new solar energy companies are working on silicon alternatives , but 1366 Technologies is taking a different approach — the MIT - founded company has invented both a new cell architecture for multi-crystalline solar cells and a manufacturing process to lower the cost of the cells .
The process is so effective that 1366 believes it can make solar cost - competitive with coal by 2012 .
And with this week ’s opening of the company ’s solar manufacturing facility , that vision may actually come true .
According to 1366 Technologies President Frank van Mierlo , current silicon cells are practically begging for improvement .
“ The cheapest cell on the market is the multicrystalline solar cell .
Notice that it ’s blue — it should be black , ” he said .
“ We believe we can do a better job of trapping and capturing light . ”
1366 Technologies ’ new cell architecture , which was developed by MIT Professor Emanuel Sachs , improves surface texture and metallization enough to enhance silicon solar cell efficiency by 25 percent while also lowering costs .
Additionally , the company has pioneered a light - capturing ribbon that increases solar module efficiency by reflecting light back onto the surface of the cell .
The ribbon can recover up to 80 percent of the photocurrent from light that strikes the ribbon — a vast improvement over the 5 percent recovery rate of standard interconnect wires .
The 1366 pilot plant will run for nine months , at which point a full - scale manufacturing plant will be readied .
The company hopes to break ground on the larger plant sometime in the next calendar year .
“ I genuinely believe this is the problem of our century , and this is arguably the most challenging and rewarding effort one can undertake , ” van Mierlo said .
“ I ’m glad that a lot of very smart people feel the same way . ”

Back in the days of no-holds - barred advertising by Madison Avenue 's finest , anything went .
Drinking alcohol made you sexy , smoking cigarettes was good for your lungs and every washing powder contained a magic ingredient that made your whites super - white .
And guess what ?
Those days are back , at least for green advertising .
As more and more customers demand environmental responsibility from companies , few large corporations with any sort of public profile now dare to enter the marketplace without a blizzard of sustainability audits and low - carbon - emissions targets .
But that being so , the risk of being conned by slick corporate " greenwash " has never been greater , as the volume of complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority ( ASA ) testifies .
The green claims coming from corporations can be absurdly general .
Nearly everything we buy these days seems to be " sustainably sourced " or " environmentally friendly " .
Sometimes , though , they are crazily specific .
Virgin Trains declares : " Our Pendolino trains emit 76 % less CO2 than cars or domestic flights . "
But which cars , which flights , and how full are the trains ?
Or plain bonkers .
One brand of bottled water says its product contains " 300 % more oxygen " .
In August , the ad industry 's watchdog , the ASA , rapped oil company Shell 's knuckles for trying to claim , in an advertisement in the Financial Times , that its $ 10bn investment in sucking tar sands out of the Canadian midwest was a contribution to a sustainable energy future .
Tar sands contain bitumen .
It takes a great deal of energy to turn them into something you can put in a fuel tank .
Overall , the emissions from mining , refining and burning tar sands are between three and 10 times greater than for conventional oil .
Shell 's sleight of hand was to use the much - abused word " sustainability " to imply a green agenda when what it was really on about was keeping a sustainable flow of fuel out of its forecourt pumps .
The ASA cried foul .
Earlier in the year , the agency also upheld complaints against Renault for branding its Twingo an " eco " car and picturing it with leaves blowing out of its tailpipe , even though its emissions are among the worst for a car of its size .
Advertising , says the ASA , " should always avoid the vague use of terms such as sustainable , green , non-polluting and so on " .
In the real world , we have to admit , things can be nuanced .
Lots of corporate claims - about carbon neutrality , for instance - hang on exactly what activities are being audited .
Take Manchester airport , which was outed in a recent report from the sustainable development organisation , Forum for the Future .
Last year the airport 's owners pledged to make the airport carbon - neutral , with one small caveat : the target does not include the 200,000 - plus flights into and out of the airport each year .
As Forum for the Future observed , " this jars somewhat " .
And what are we to make of Fiji Water 's claims to be cutting the carbon footprint of its water by 25 % and offsetting the rest ?
" Every drop is green , " it says .
But is n't the whole idea of bottling water on a remote South Pacific island and shipping it to your dinner table just a tiny bit barmy ?
Equally questionable are the claims of financial institutions .
Back in the days ( oh , only a few weeks ago ) when the City of London was concerned with something other than day - to - day corporate survival , the City of London Corporation launched a City Climate Pledge , under which finance houses would pledge to " measure and monitor " their carbon footprint .
Good for them .
Perhaps a few will follow the lead of HSBC , which has developed close links with the environment group WWF and has claimed since 2005 to be the world 's first carbon - neutral bank .
But the pledge looks suspiciously like greenwash .
Companies simply have to fill out a form detailing their CO2 plans and they can use the pledge logo .
" Companies using the logo will be recognised as exemplar sustainable businesses [ able to ] attract consumers who are becoming more discerning about the credentials of businesses they deal with , " says the flyer .
Not bad for just filling out a form .
Especially as there does n't seem to be any follow - up or auditing process involved .
But as with the efforts of Manchester airport and Fiji Water , there remains a rather large elephant in the living room .
The carbon footprint of finance houses is not about whether they offset executive flights or put double glazing in the boardroom ; it is about their investment decisions .
The press release put out by the City of London said the pledge would " encourage City organisations to use their global influence to affect the behaviour of companies around the UK and the world " .
Could the City be about to impose a freeze on cash for tar sands or coal - fired power stations ?
Not so fast .
The pledge itself makes no mention of this .
I would have expected City institutions to be falling over themselves to sign up to the pledge .
But 11 months after companies were first asked to sign the pledge , and three months after its public launch , the pledge 's website is still promising that a list of signatories " will be available shortly " , and further inquiries revealed that just one company - Deutsche Bank - had so far completed registration .
Right now the pledge looks like a one - day PR wonder to green the City 's image , with no substance at all .
Or maybe they are all just a little busy right now .
To try to keep up with the welter of environmental claims , test the green spin and spot the green frauds , the Guardian is launching today a regular online column , Greenwash , and calls on readers to submit their examples of the fraudulent , mendacious , confusing , ignorant or just daft claims jostling for our attention .
Along the way , we may get to the heart of a dilemma that faces us all .
Can we shop our way to sustainability ?
Are some products so green it is better to buy two of them rather than one ?
Or are our own consumer lifestyles , suffused in greenwash , the problem ?
Is there really no alternative to putting away our credit cards , pulling on our thickest jumper and heading for the hills ?
We wo n't be limiting our investigations to corporations - we 'll have politicians in our sights , too .
Scraping away at the green patina on the new - look , Zac Goldsmith - inspired Conservative environmental policies , puncturing Brown 's grumpy greenery and unpicking the carbon contortions of the coal - loving Celts .
And now that both Barack Obama and John McCain claim environmental credentials , we 'll be looking for greenwash at the White House too .
And we wo n't forget that , even in the corporate world , greenwash is not just a defensive mantra to help maintain business as usual .
Some people are out there pushing the environmental agenda with sinister intent .
Take , for example , the green rebranding of Steptoe and Son .
Last year the EU introduced the charmingly named WEEE directive , which stands for Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment .
The aim is to prevent millions of tonnes of toxic TVs , personal computers , toasters and other electronic goods being dumped into landfill each year .
Instead , they have to be recycled .
You may not have noticed this because there are no laws stopping you putting that laptop into your dustbin .
But corporations and retailers are charged with making sure most of our electronic waste gets recycled .
The question is how .
Some of this stuff is making its way to a handful of hi-tech metals recycling plants in Europe .
But most is going to the developing world .
Often it has paperwork claiming it will be refurbished and re-used , but nobody has the resources to police the system , so in practice much of it ends up in primitive workshops in India and west Africa and China , where it is stripped out , boiled up , dunked in acid or smashed to smithereens by unskilled , low - paid and frequently child labour .
I have seen this " recycling " industry at work in Delhi , where barefooted children as young as eight dunk circuit boards in barrels of acid to remove traces of copper .
Last month , a charity called Computer Aid tried to blow the whistle on this .
Computer
Aid is one of the few organisations that is genuinely and safely refurbishing and reusing old computers , many of them going to schools in Kenya .
It fears this " good " and socially responsible recycling will be undermined by the bad guys .
Why is this happening ?
Partly because factories in India badly want the metals in your old computer .
And partly because too many European companies have a no-questions - asked policy towards every broker and cowboy willing to take troublesome waste off their hands .
As one industrial supplier told me last year , " A lot of these guys do n't even have addresses , just mobile phone numbers . "
Recycling may be a new term , but the trade is not new .
Until the 60s , recyclers plied the streets of Britain with a horse and cart collecting old stuff that could be sold on .
The characters in the television show Steptoe and Son were the archetypes .
They have been succeeded by a generation of car - crushers and cable - burners .
Nobody called it green then : now they do .
But the same wide boys are in charge , so if anybody has their mobile numbers , do please get in touch .
We are too ready to suspend our critical faculties with anybody claiming to be green .
But a great deal of recycling is not quite what it seems .
What happens to recycled glass bottles , for instance ?
As we post them in the recycling bin , we presume they go to make new bottles and cut out the energy cost of making new glass from sand .
My local supermarket bin in south London proudly proclaims that recycling one glass bottle " saves enough energy to power a TV for 20 minutes " .
Well , it would if they turned the glass back into new bottles .
But it turns out that often they do n't .
Much of London 's recycled glass is actually crushed and sold to construction firms as a substitute for sand , or an ingredient in a substitute for asphalt such as Glasphalt - " specially treated so it wo n't puncture tyres , " as one recycling website puts it .
That 's a relief , but how many assiduous recyclers trying to do their bit for the environment realise they are actually helping build new roads ?
How many more green scams , cons and generous slices of wishful thinking are out there ?
We want to name and shame them before the whole green movement gets a bad reputation .
" Green " has another meaning after all - naive .
And we cannot afford that .
Greenwash : Fred Pearce on the con of green electricity
How to spot a fake
It 's greenwash if it 's ...
• Ludicrously general
All claims for products being environmentally friendly or pollution - free should have evidence that clearly supports them .
• Overspecific
Be on guard against numbers or other " facts " that can only be true in specific circumstances , such as Virgin Trains ' claims to have 76 % fewer emissions than planes or cars ( see main feature ) .
Often these come with a discreet asterisk referencing an obscure study - look the study up , or ask the Guardian 's new Greenwash column to do so on your behalf .
• Reliant on nature pictures
Most pernicious , perhaps , are attempts to green products by association , such as cars driving through verdant meadows .
• Backed up by a tame boffin
Companies like to spotlight their researchers working on renewable energy , even if it makes up less than 1 % of their business .
Anybody can keep a tame boffin : to mean something , such research must be a significiant part of the company 's business .
( Incidentally , has anyone met a researcher ?
We would like to hear . )
• Simply absurd
If a claim sounds absurd , it probably is .
Inside knowledge can help you blow the whistle , but a nose for the absurd is just as good .
How to spot the real thing
It might just be true if ...
• What the company says matches what they do
Rob Harrison of Ethical Consumer thinks the most important question is : " Is their position consistent right across the group ? "
Some car manufacturers advertise their green cars but continue to lobby for lower carbon - reduction targets .
Look for companies who match what they say and do , such as Peugeot , one of the only car manufacturers likely to come in under the European emissions targets in 2010 .
• The company is in partnership with an independent ethical organisation
Forming a partnership with an independent organisation is voluntary and does n't have to mean much : groups such as the Ethical Trade Initiative or the Carbon Disclosure Project have little power .
All the same , it 's an indicator of willingness .
Some NGOs are more picky : their validation is , therefore , worth more .
• They take that extra , obsessive step
Evangelistically green companies such as Lush , Co-operative Food or Sawdays can never resist the chance to talk about the environment , and they 've all taken radical steps within their own organisations .
Lush uses minimal amounts of packaging and gives money to anti-road groups , Co-operative Food has clad its entire HQ in solar panels , and Sawdays publishers operates from zero - carbon offices .
• They are green innovators
DIY Kyoto came up with the Wattson , a device for measuring how much electricity your house is using .
BSkyB , headed by James Murdoch , has brought in the auto - standby device , which senses if the box has n't been used in the two hours after 11 pm , and automatically goes to standby .
• They set themselves targets
Quantifiable targets set for some specific time in the future - " we will reduce our water use by such and such by 2010 " - are an indicator of seriousness : they are handing you and the press a stick to beat them with if they miss the target .
In January , Tesco , for example , pledged to reduce its carbon footprint by 50 % by 2020 .
• They take action even if it may harm business
Marks & Spencer 's decision to charge for plastic bags , British Gas 's encouragement of reduced use : these are not immediately obvious comfort zones for money - making enterprises .
You can be cynical , or you can clap .
• They have been audited
Some companies get a third party in to check they 're doing it right : Eurostar called in Environmental Resources Management ( ERM ) to go over their plans with a toothcomb before they kicked off their big Tread Lightly initiative .
Some companies - the Guardian , for example - are so obsessive they will even audit their social report .
This could be seen as just showing off .
• They make it easy for you to find all this out
If you can't easily find the information , be suspicious and ring up the company .
Other possible sources of info : Ethical Consumer , FTSE4 Good Index , the Dow Jones Sustainability Index , and the ASA ( which may be considering cases against the company you 're looking into ) .

Col Gaddafi said state bodies were prone to corruption
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has said oil profits should be given directly to citizens , as part of sweeping economic and political reforms .
Speaking during celebrations to mark 39 years in power in Libya 's second city , Benghazi , Col Gaddafi extolled the virtues of privatisation .
The Libyan leader said society would " reformulate itself in a new , free , and democratic way " .
The changes will take place in the next four months , he said .
" The money that we put in the education budget , I say let the Libyans take it , " Col Gaddafi said in a 100 - minute televised speech to the General People 's Congress , Libya 's equivalent of a parliament .
" Put it in your pockets and teach your kids as you wish , you take responsibility . "
" As long as money is administered by a government body , there would be theft and corruption " .
He admitted there would be " chaos " while the reforms were implemented but urged people " to be ready " to receive their money .
Purge
The BBC's Rana Jawad in the capital , Tripoli , says a leader who once favoured socialism seems to be fully embracing capitalism .
Reuters news agency says many Libyans feel they have not benefitted from the recent rise in the oil price and the return of foreign investment since the end of Libya 's international isolation .
Libya's is Africa 's third largest oil producer after Angola and Nigeria .
Reuters says that the only government departments to be spared a purge are those of justice , defence , interior and foreign affairs .
Much of what Col Gaddafi said endorsed the recent calls made by his son , Sayf al - Islam Gaddafi , our correspondent says .
Sayf al - Islam Gaddafi has been a leading proponent of reform , but announced his retirement from politics last month .
Over the weekend , Libya signed a $ 5 bn deal with Italy to resolve colonial - era disputes .
Italy agreed to fund huge infrastructure projects , including a motorway all the way along the Mediterranean coast .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is to visit Libya last this week - the most senior US official to visit since diplomatic ties were restored in 2004 , after Col Gaddafi announced he was abandoning plans to acquire weapons of mass destruction .
The film had been due to be released in March
Film studio Twentieth Century Fox has applied to a Los Angeles court to block the release of Watchmen , based on the comic books written by Alan Moore .
Fox , which says it bought film rights to the series in the 1980s , has been given the go - ahead to launch an injunction against rival Warner Bros .
" We respectfully disagree with Fox 's position and do not believe they have any rights , " a Warners spokesman said .
Fox said it " will be asking the court to enforce our copyright interests " .
' Copyright interests '
The movie , about flawed superheroes , has already been filmed and was due for release 6 March .
It stars Patrick Wilson and Jeffrey Dean Morgan and is directed by Zack Snyder , who made hit movie 300 .
Last week US District Court Judge Gary Feess said
Fox could hold some of the rights to the material , even if it did not hold all rights .
Fox spokesman Gregg Brilliant said it planned to stop the release of the movie and " any related Watchmen media that violate our copyright interests in that property " .
His Warner Bros counterpart , Scott Rowe , said : " The judge did not opine at all on the merits , other than to conclude that Fox satisfied the pending requirements . "
She said last night :
" And I 've been there when George Bush has spoken to families of those who have suffered greatly . "

Like something from a horror movie , the swarm of bacteria ripples purposefully toward their prey , devours it and moves on .
Researchers at the University of Iowa are studying this behavior in Myxococcus xanthus ( M. xanthus ) , a bacterium commonly found in soil , which preys on other bacteria .
Despite its deadly role in the bacterial world , M. xanthus is harmless to humans and might one day be used beneficially to destroy harmful bacteria on surfaces or in human infections , said John Kirby , Ph.D. , associate professor of microbiology in the UI Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine .
" It may be that we can modify this predator - prey relationship or apply it to medically relevant situations , " Kirby said .
" It would be amazing if we could adapt its predatory ability to get rid of harmful bacteria that reside in places we do n't want them , including in hospitals or on medical implants . "
M. xanthus lives in a multi-cellular unit that can change its structure and behavior in response to changing availability of prey .
This adaptive ability to control movement in response to an environmental stimulus is called chemotaxis , and the research team coined the term predataxis to describe M. xanthus behavior in response to prey .
In earlier studies , Kirby and James Berleman , Ph.D. , a postdoctoral fellow in Kirby 's lab , showed that the presence of prey causes M. xanthus to form parallel rippling waves that move toward and through prey bacteria .
Now , how the bacteria organize to form these traveling waves in response to the presence of prey is the subject of the UI team 's latest study , which was published online Oct. 24 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) Early Edition .
" When an M. xanthus aggregate is placed inside a colony of E. coli bacteria , the M. xanthus proceeds to eat the colony from the inside out and creates a rippling pattern as the swarm moves through the prey cells , " Kirby said .
" We now know that this rippling pattern is the highly organized behavior of thousands of cells working in concert to digest the prey . "
Unlike the random motion M. xanthus exhibits at low levels of prey , the study shows that during predation , individual M. xanthus cells line up perpendicular to the axis of the ripple and move back and forth .
This motion of individual cells , known as cell reversal produces an alternating pattern of high and low cell density like crests and troughs of waves , and the overall motion of the wave formation is directed toward prey .
The UI team also showed that the ripple wavelength is adaptable and dependent of how much prey is available .
At high prey density , M. xanthus forms ripples with shorter wavelengths .
As prey density decreases , the ripple wavelength gets longer .
Eventually , when there is no more prey , the rippling behavior dissipates .
" The rippling appears to enhance predation by keeping more M. xanthus cells in the location of the prey cells , " Kirby said .
Finally , the UI study found that the bacteria use a chemotaxis - like signaling pathway to regulate multi-cellular rippling during predation .
Individual M. xanthus cells move by shooting rope - like projections called pili from either end of the cell .
These pili attach to surfaces allowing cells to pull themselves forward or backward in a " spiderman " type motion known as cell reversal .
The genes that regulate this cell reversal process are chemotaxis - like genes .
The UI team mutated two genes in this pathway to study their effect on the predatory ability of the bacterium .
One mutant strain rippled continuously even in the absence of prey , and individual cells exhibited a hyper - reversing action .
Conversely , the second mutation produced bacteria that were not able to ripple at all .
Both mutants were unable to respond to changes in the amount of available prey and both mutant strains were deficient in predation .
" Our study really connects the stimulus to the behavioral response through this molecular machinery , " Kirby said .
In addition the potential medical application of M. xanthus to destroy harmful bacteria , what Kirby learns about the molecular mechanisms used by the bacterium may also provide insights into the workings of a rarer , but potentially useful , bacterial cousin .
The related bacterium , Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans , has been found at superfund sites and it can transform soluble uranium , which can leach into the water supply , into insoluble uranium , which still is radioactive , but is stable and trapped in the soil where it can be more safely stored until the radioactivity decays .
###
In addition to Kirby and Berleman , the UI team included Jodie Scott and Tatiana Chumley .
The research was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health .

Is Henry Paulson a crony communist or a businessman ?
The answer could be the difference between economic disaster and recovery .
Understanding Paulson ’s role in stopping — or fueling — the credit crisis requires a review of two axioms from Economics 101 : ( 1 ) A credit crisis occurs when banks stop lending and ( 2 ) The amount banks can lend is a multiple of the capital in their vaults .
Therefore , ending a credit crisis means prompting new lending — and that means maximally increasing bank capital .
Enter Paulson , the former Goldman Sachs executive and current treasury secretary .
The bailout he fear - mongered through Congress aims to waste almost a trillion taxpayer dollars buying banks ’ bad mortgages — a scheme all but ensuring a disastrous outcome .
If Paulson pays banks exactly what their mortgages are worth , he will not increase banks ’ capital ( or their lending ability ) — he will merely convert one asset ( mortgages ) into another ( cash ) , making no impact on the credit crisis .
If , to protect taxpayers , he buys mortgages at lower prices than banks list them , banks will have to write down their capital and consequently contract lending — and the credit crisis will worsen .
If Paulson overpays for mortgages , he may marginally augment bank capital , but also incur massive taxpayer losses when he later resells the mortgages at their real price .
The silver lining is a little - noticed provision in the bailout bill allowing Paulson — if he chooses — to buy ownership stakes in banks .
According to Robert Johnson , the Senate Banking Committee ’s former chief economist , this would cost roughly $ 375 billion less than the mortgage - buying plan — and , better yet , more aggressively attack the credit crisis .
Mortgages may be underpriced today , but they retain some value on banks ’ books .
So rather than purchasing mortgages ( a capital - neutral transaction ) , Paulson could buy bank stock , infusing banks with new capital on top of their mortgages .
That would exponentially increase lending capacity , prevent taxpayers from buying toxic assets , give the public a share of future profits and grant regulators ownership leverage to restructure bank management .
This is where Paulson ’s personal proclivities come in .
A crony communist looking to socialize risk and privatize gain would consider these options and choose to buy mortgages — that is , choose to ignore the credit crisis , reward discredited executives and permit banks to keep any subsequent profits — all while inhibiting a potential government - mandated housecleaning of Wall Street .
Indeed , the Financial Times ’ Wolfgang Munchau says Paulson ’s mortgage - buying program is driven by “ a wish to benefit the investment banks he once chaired , and which stand to gain handsomely from such a package . ”
A businessman , by contrast , would limit taxpayers ’ exposure , give us a stake in future gains and demand management control .
He would , in short , treat taxpayers like Warren Buffett treats his Berkshire Hathaway shareholders when buying banks with their money .
This is how Sweden successfully confronted its banking crisis in 1992 , and how England is addressing its own meltdown today .
In fact , world leaders are citing our crony communism as a cautionary tale .
“ This is not the American plan , ” said British Prime Minister Gordon Brown in announcing his bank rescue .
“ We will have a stake in the banks — we are not simply giving money . ”
The bailout bill ’s failure to make this course of action mandatory should have killed the legislation in Congress .
But banking CEOs and their lobbyists turned “ should have ” into “ did n’t . ”
They love crony communism and hate government ownership stakes because , as financial analyst Luigi Zingales says , “ Nobody likes to pay for their own mistakes — it is much better to have the taxpayers pay . ”
Considering the opposition , then , it is a miracle any ownership stake language slipped into law .
Whether Paulson now uses that language will signal how deep Washington corruption runs .

Sir Alan Sugar stepped down as Amstrad chairman on 2 July Sir Alan Sugar has escaped unhurt after his plane ' crash - landed ' at an airfield on the outskirts of Manchester .
The business tycoon and star of The Apprentice walked away from the light aircraft after it hit a rut in the ground after landing on Saturday .
But Sir Alan is playing down the crash : " I had as much chance of dying from food poisoning from the sandwich a very nice lady made us in the clubhouse . "
The 61 - year - old had left an airstrip near his Essex home an hour earlier .
Bad weather Sir Alan was landing his four - seater plane at Manchester 's City Airport in a thunderstorm .
He managed to stop short of the perimeter fence .
He said : " On Saturday during heavy rain and a thunderstorm we landed at Barton , a friendly and club - like airfield now named City Airport Manchester - a far grander name than it suggests with a grass runway about the same length as a football pitch .
" We landed and ran over the end of the slippery runway by about 15 feet into some taller grass .
" In doing so the propeller of the plane picked up some minor damage and according to the rules this means the plane can't fly unless checked out by a qualified engineer , of which there were none available .
" As far as ' life - threatening ' is concerned , to put things in perspective my friend and I had as much chance of dying from the incident as we did in dying from food poisoning from the tuna sandwich that a very nice lady made us in the clubhouse whilst we waited for a mate to pick us up and take us home .

What are these ?
Hyundai's been making so many announcements about electric vehicles and hybrids lately you 'd think it was ZAP .
The Korean automaker 's promised to put a hybrid subcompact , a hybrid mid-size and a plug - in competitor to the Chevrolet Volt on the road within five years .
There 's even some speculation at least one of them could be stamped " Made in the USA . "
Hyundai 's going full - bore with its electric program , launching a partnership with Korean companies LG Chem , SK Energy and SB LiMotive to develop the batteries its cars will need if they 're to start hitting the road by 2010 as promised .
LG's got a solid background , having provided some of the batteries General Motors is considering for the Volt .
The Japanese dominate battery tech these days , but Hyundai says the Koreans could catch up by 2013 – at which point the company hopes to put a plug - in hybrid on the road .
Korean automakers are spending nearly $ 1 billion on battery tech , and the government has kicked in $ 40 million .
We 'll see the first of the Hyundais to use that technology in November .
John Krafcik , Hyundai's VP of product development , announced the new Sonata hybrid will make its debut at the Los Angeles International Auto Show in November and could be on the road by 2010 .
It 'll use a lithium - ion battery , making it the first partially - electric Sonata since Switched - On Bach .
Do n't confuse the gas- electric mid-size Sonata with another hybrid Hyundai in the works – a propane - electric hybrid based on the Avante
( known here in the states as the Elantra ) that promises 37.9 miles per gallon .
The subcompact could be on the road as early as next year , but there 's almost no chance we 'll see it here even though its propane powertrain could make a billionaire out of Hank
Hill .
Early signs suggest the Sonata hybrid will be made in America .
Hyundai spokesman Jim Trainor was coy when asked if the hybrid will be built in the same Alabama factory that cranks out the standard Sonata ( pictured ) and would only say Southerners build some mighty fine cars .
" The workforce down there and the products they 're building are awesome , " Trainor told the BirminghamNews .
" The quality coming out of the plant is awesome .
Certainly careful consideration will be given to those sorts of things when we 're looking at where a vehicle like that will be built . "
Hyundai's a rags - to - riches story better than any early - evening nominating convention speaker could offer .
From the dowdy Excel to the overly tarted - up sedans of the early 2000s , Hyundai has matured into the ultimate " cocktail party car " – comfortable yet unobtrusive , well - built but not overwrought .
The incredible Genesis and stately Sonata prove the carmaker has truly arrived .
Producing what could be the first lithium - ion hybrid to hit the street would be a major coup for Hyundai and a boon for Korean battery manufacturer LG .

People with more education and more mentally demanding occupations may have protection against the memory loss that precedes Alzheimer 's disease , according to a study published in the October 21 , 2008 , issue of Neurology ® , the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology .
The study involved 242 people with Alzheimer 's disease , 72 people with mild cognitive impairment , and 144 people with no memory problems .
Mild cognitive impairment is a transition stage when some memory problems are occurring beyond what is normal for a person 's age but not the serious problems of Alzheimer 's disease .
Researchers tested the participants ' memory and cognitive skills and used brain scans to measure the amount of brain glucose metabolism , which shows how much the brain has been affected by the plaques and tangles of Alzheimer 's disease .
The participants were followed for an average of 14 months .
During that time , 21 of the people with mild cognitive impairment developed Alzheimer 's disease .
The study found that in people with the same level of memory impairment , people with more education and more mentally demanding jobs had significantly more changes and damage in their brains from Alzheimer 's disease than people with less education and less mentally demanding jobs .
" The theory is that education and demanding jobs create a buffer against the effects of dementia on the brain , or a cognitive reserve , " said study author Valentina Garibotto , MD , of the San Raffaele University and Scientific Institute and the National Institute of Neuroscience in Milan , Italy .
" Their brains are able to compensate for the damage and allow them to maintain functioning in spite of damage .
There are two possible explanations .
The brain could be made stronger through education and occupational challenges .
Or , genetic factors that enabled people to achieve higher education and occupational achievement might determine the amount of brain reserve .
It is n't possible to determine which accounts for our findings . "
The results were found in both people with Alzheimer 's and people with mild cognitive impairment who developed Alzheimer 's during the study , suggesting that the cognitive reserve is already in effect during the mild cognitive impairment phase before Alzheimer 's begins , Garibotto said .
People with Alzheimer 's disease and people with mild cognitive impairment who developed Alzheimer 's during the study had metabolic dysfunction in the areas of the brain consistent with Alzheimer 's disease , whereas the healthy people and those with mild cognitive impairment who did not develop Alzheimer 's disease had no brain metabolism problems .
The study was supported by NEST - DD ( Network for Efficiency and Standardization of Dementia Diagnosis ) , 5th European Research Program and DIMI ( Diagnostic Molecular Imaging ) Network of Excellence , 6th European Research Program .
Artifex Software , the company behind the open source Ghostscript PDF processing software , has filed a lawsuit against voting machine vendor Diebold and its subsidiary Premier Election Solutions .
Artifex says that Diebold violated the GPL by incorporating Ghostscript into commercial electronic voting machine systems .
Ghostscript , which was originally developed in the late 80s , is distributed for free under the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) .
This license permits developers to study , modify , use , and redistribute the software but requires that derivatives be made available under the same terms .
Companies that want to use Ghostscript in closed - source proprietary software projects can avoid the copyleft requirement by purchasing a commercial license from Artifex .
Among commercial Ghostscript users who have purchased licenses from Artifex are some of the biggest names in the printing and technology industries , including HP , IBM , Kodak , Siemens , SGI , and Xerox .
Evidence of Diebold 's Ghostscript use first emerged last year when electronic voting machine critic Jim March was conducting analysis of Pima County voting irregularities .
He brought a technical question to the Ghostscript mailing list relating to his investigation and mentioned in passing that Diebold 's use of Ghostscript could potentially fall afoul of the GPL .
This view was shared by Ghostscript developer Ralph Giles , who referred the matter to the Artifex business staff so that it could evaluate the legal implications .
" Seems likely that they are not respecting our software license in this case .
We do not consider bundling as an integrated component intended to work with other software as ' mere aggregation ' under the GPL , " wrote Giles in a mailing list post .
According to InformationWeek , Artifex is seeking over $ 150,000 in damages and is calling for the court to block usage of the equipment .
Security researchers have uncovered numerous security vulnerabilities in voting machines produced by several major vendors , including Diebold .
The voting machine company has faced several high - profile lawsuits in the past , including one filed by the state of California , where Diebold machines were subsequently banned over fraudulent claims .
If Artifex 's allegations prove correct , then it will further demonstrate the broad scope of Diebold 's technical incompetence and irresponsible business practices .
JPMorgan Responsible for the Destruction of U.S. Financial System
The tag team of JPMorgan as the monster and Goldman Sachs as its harlot represent a powerful pair that is more responsible for destroying the entire US financial system than 95 % of the American public has any awareness .
The colossus of JPMorgan is a monster , a predator , nurtured by pond scum .
It has gobbled up Chase Manhattan , Manufacturers Hanover , Chemical Bank , Bank One , and more over the past two decades .
Their profound presence in keeping the USTreasury Bond yields down can never be understated .
They do so by managing 85 % of the credit derivatives on the planet .
They distorted usury prices , as in price of borrowed money , thus aggravating the LIBOR ( London InterBank Offered Rate ) market in a very visible manner .
The oblong usury prices have contributed mightily to the destruction of the US Economy itself , created bubbles , killed jobs , and wrecked savings .
The ugliest hidden activity for the JPMorgan monster is to manage the Bank of Baghdad , where they manipulate the crude oil price , where drug trafficking money is funneled from Afghan sales , under management by the US Military aegis ( guys with no uniform stripes or markings ) .
Maybe such illicit money offsets Credit Default Swap losses , making America strong for freedom and liberty .
Goldman Sachs is clearly the investment banking agent for the USGovt , given the privilege of insider trading in unspeakable proportions .
They manage the Plunge Protection Team efforts to intervene in financial markets , making America strong for freedom and liberty .
The new kid on the block is the FDIC .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp is steering fresh meat into the corralled JPMorgan stockyards for slaughterhouse feeding .
The label of harlot might be too kind , especially from the perspective of senior bond holders .
But JPMorgan requires fresh meat ( capital ) periodically , thus making America strong for freedom and liberty .
Never mind the fires caused after its hearty meals and flatulence .
This article discusses the JPMorgan monster , its behaviour , and teeth revealed .
Robb Kirby ( see his website , click HERE ) often covers JPMorgan illicit behaviour
This article discusses banking system realignments to destroy savings accounts owned by the people , and the Coup d'Etat just completed .
The criminals on Wall Street have taken full control of the USGovt financial management , with blank check written by a thoroughly intimidated US Congress , deceived steadily and easily .
Threats and intimidation are central to the successful coup .
The Ponzi Scheme has been revealed , even as the frail and tattered Shadow Banking System has been revealed .
The key to the bailouts is its continued Top Down approach , which favors the Ruling Elite and denies all but crumbs to the people , who have been subjected to a foreclosure revolving door on mortgage loan assistance .
Since nothing has been solved from this approach , a total systemic breakdown is assured , whose climax will be the current Administration and the Wall Street executives in charge of the criminal syndicate riding off into the sunset in retirement .
Rome burns .
Much more detail is provided in the upcoming October report due this weekend .
The theme is this subset synopsis article is of criminality , deception , monster exploitation , market corruption , and the collapse of a failed system , whose crescendo represents the greatest financial crimes ever witnessed in modern history .
Americans do it big !
The proprietary Hat Trick Letter covers much more of recent events , interpretation , and analysis , but here , focus on impropriety .
THE MONSTER , ITS BROKER & HARLOT
JPMorgan will require fresh asset meat every several weeks in order to survive , but the process will result in a sequence of severely damaging CDSwap fires .
Perversely , the FDIC is their investment banker agent .
Two mergers of questionable nature highlight the altered role of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp ( FDIC ) , which no longer protects bank depositors or their investors , but rather serves JPMorgan Chase .
When Bank of America merged with Merrill Lynch , a trend started , one that exposed private stock brokerage accounts .
Officially they can be legally borrowed across subsidiary lines .
The FDIC averted a failure of Merrill Lynch without the credit default implications .
The other event was more blatant , as the FDIC steered Washington Mutual out of bankruptcy failure and into the JPMorgan slaughterhouse .
Inside its chambers , JPM gobbled up the WaMu deposits and benefited from ratio improvements .
Senior bond holders were crushed , fully denied due process from bankruptcy .
The FDIC has become an ugly investment banker lookalike , serving JPM and not the US public .
The FDIC owns a pitifully small $ 45 billion in funds available for bank bailouts , at June count .
When the dust clears a year or more from now , many multiples more will be necessary for many bank failures .
The path of JPMorgan growth into a FRANKENSTEIN took radical changes in course after both the failures of Lehman Brothers and recognition that Fannie Mae & Fannie Mae had to be taken over by the USGovt .
To halt the run on their bonds , the USGovt acquired the entire F&F Cesspool .
The impact hit the Credit Default Swap market immediately .
AIG had been weakened one week earlier from the technical default of Fannie & Freddie , which resulted in broad CDSwap payout's .
Ripple effects from the Lehman Brothers failure that followed were deep and broad throughout the system , killing AIG .
The Wall Street central harlot ( Goldman Sachs ) advised the USGovt to assume full control and risk of AIG , as GSachs avoided $ 20 billion in sudden losses in the nick of time , a pure coincidence !
The entire episode with Wells Fargo bidding for Wachovia , in competition from Citigroup , is steeped in comedy with vampire stars .
The grapevine in Washington and Wall Street passes word that the Citigroup versus Wachovia wrestling match was actually a sponsored backdoor bailout attempt to save Citigroup , not just Wachovia .
Again , the FDIC was the matchmaker .
My term has been ‘ Dead Marrying the Dead ' which still holds true , since Citigroup has been dead for one year .
Under the original Citigroup proposal , the FDIC had arranged for guarantees of $ 42 billion for Wachovia debt by the US Fed .
The new Wells Fargo deal enabled the US taxpayers to get off the hook .
The reversal by the FDIC to serve the public has caused gigantic Wall Street problems , as Citigroup now finds itself in a position more perilous than anyone believed .
This battle has flip - flopped once , and might again .
Citigroup would probably have died if not for the USGovt purchase of bank stocks .
THE TEETH OF THE MONSTER REVEALED
JPMorgan is a monster predator at work , hidden from view .
After the Fannie Mae experience , covering their giant raft of CDSwap contracts , making huge payout 's , JPMorgan was close to a bankruptcy .
They needed to feed off another bank , to consume private deposits and thus shore up the balance sheet .
Lehman Brothers was let go to fail , but its failure would surely trigger a gigantic wave of credit market fires .
The Lehman CDSwap resolution has cost roughly $ 300 billion , paying 91 cents per dollar of coverage on their failed bonds .
The Wall Street Powers permitted Lehman to fail , so as to prevent a JPMorgan failure , thus risking that the fires caused could be contained in CDSwap fallout .
The irony is that JPMorgan undoubtedly suffered considerably from that fire in fallout .
Now JPMorgan might need another Wall Street failure , for to consume another block of assets , but with yet another ensuing CDSwap fire .
JPMorgan is a monster predator at work , soon hungry again .
It might be eyeing Morgan Stanley .
We might discover a failure in an unexpected place , like a big insurance firm , whose sector condition is not well advertised .
With each big bank failure , whether a commercial bank or investment bank , heavy damage is done to the system .
The CDSwap destruction is mostly hidden , with large pillars burned out .
We the people hear of the destruction only if and when a major bank fails as a result .
No death , no news , however but with potentially significant hidden structural damage .
As financial firms pay out vast sums on CDSwaps as in the Lehman case , and the Fannie Mae case , and the Freddie Mac case , the system bleeds capital .
Lending suffers .
The sequence corresponds to a powerful vicious cycle .
JPMorgan will need more deaths to survive , but each death causes more deadly CDSwap fires .
JPMorgan is a monster predator at work , which leaves fires on pathways where it last stepped .
The best analogy is that CDSwap contract payout 's from bond failures are like mini-Hiroshima events that might lead to a bigger such event .
Ironically , to save JPM the financial system must destroy the shadow banking system centered in New York City , since Wall Street firms , plus Bank of America are at its center .
The system lacks disclosure and transparency , just like Wall Street likes it .
Permit the pathogenesis to proceed further , and the majority of Western bank system must be burned in order to leave JPMorgan as prominent survivor to rule over a scorched empire .
This process is a sick consolidation .
The bank conglomerate is a major crime syndicate colossus , and center of the drug traffic money laundering , coordinated by security agencies , fully condoned by the US Federal Reserve itself .
The AIG story is nowhere complete , the latest being their expensive parties .
AIG has caused major complications , another monster that will resurface periodically at feeding time .
Personally , my wish is to see the RICO law brought forward , at least to deposit the monster in a cage .
In done my way , not a single additional US Congressional bill would be approved and granted for a bailout or rescue without rapid investigation , prosecution , turn to state 's evidence , asset seizure , restitution , and imprisonment for dozens of Wall Street executives , starting with Hank Paulson .
STOCK MANIPULATION WITH DEEP MOTIVE
Few analysts , pundits , or anchors are aware of the mammoth conflict of interest involved with the USTreasury Bond sales required to pay for all the bailouts .
JPMorgan , with the essential aid of Goldman Sachs , plot to bring down the DJIA index and the S&P500 index whenever the USTreasury conducts auctions or needs Congressional passage of key bailout bills .
They have sold $ 194 billion of Cash Mgmt Bills ( CMB ) in the last two weeks , today $ 70B , tomorrow another $ 60B .
The big stock declines seen recently work to the BENEFIT of the USTreasury and US Fed. as agent for auctions .
TBill yields are down near zero , in case you have not noticed , with principal prices corresponding almost as high as the bond permits .
The USGovt is conducting auctions for TBills at top dollar prices , when its credit rating should be caving in radically upon downgrades .
These USTreasurys are destined to enter default at a later date , where the loss to foreign investors will be maximized .
Most of the US public has savings dominated by stocks , with little in bonds .
So the US public is being fleeced , coming and going , since even money markets contain toxic mortgage bonds .
Look for the stock market decline to come to a surprising end when the USGovt has completed the majority of their planned emergency supply sales via auction .
The Wall Street tactics have recently turned more vicious and devious , actually creating volatility , producing fear for political purpose .
They accuse hedge funds of driving up the crude oil price , rendering great harm to the US Economy and US citizens .
So they urged unsuccessfully the Securities & Exchange Commission to force hedge funds to reveal their speculative positions .
The Wall Street thieves and conmen wish to learn details on hedge fund positions so as to target them illicitly .
In a queer twist , JPMorgan has benefited from an interesting double kill .
They exploit hedge funds , wreck them , then encourage them into the fold at JPM in brokerage accounts , where their private accounts are rendered vulnerable under the new US Fed. rules .
JPMorgan is a monster predator at work , which is permitted to manipulate markets and clients with total impunity .
There is one more detail .
Lest one forget , Goldman Sachs was exempt from the short rule restriction placed on a few hundred financial stocks traded .
The reason had something to do with market stability and integrity assurance !
Goldman Sachs clearly profited from the ups & down in the Dow and S&P500 , lifting stocks after Congressional agreements , pulling them down before those agreements .
JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs profit handsomely when the USGovt Plunge Protection Team pushes the stock indexes up with their usual methods .
Of course JPM and GSachs are the managers of the PPT efforts .
YES , IT IS TIME TO PUKE NOW !!!
HIDDEN USGOVT COUP BY WALL STREET
The US Congress has been subverted by intimidation and ignorance , maybe bribery .
Regulators and law enforcement bodies are mere accomplices .
The entire US banking system has undergone an unprecedented grand nationalize initiative , including the financial system , when considering the mortgage and insurance giants .
The total bailouts are huge when put into perspective .
This is a hidden coup , complete with deep fraud , corruption , and ruin for both prosecutors and whistle blowers .
The US Dollar is caught in the middle of a black hole scrambled with fraud .
Paulson is the new Chancellor of US Inc , Bernanke the new Currency Lithography Manager , and Sheila Bair the Investment Banker ( a la Goldman Suchs ) .
Paulson assumes all powers over the financial state from the president , via the banking industry control .
The government bailout redemption of $ trillion past fraud closes the loop .
Bernanke manages all efforts to use printed money for the purpose of buying worthless counterfeited and fraud - laced bonds , buying commercial bonds and posted collateral among businesses , as well as making printed paper products available to foreign central banks in relief of past fraud .
Bair will act as the director of slaughterhouse traffic for JPMorgan , which needs a steady supply of bank deposits to offset their destroyed balance sheet from continued credit derivative implosion , thereby betraying the chartered FDIC pledge to protect bank depositors and senior bank bond holders through liquidation procedures , with full recognition of expedience .
Hail to the king , long live the king !
The US public seems so dumbstruck that it cannot demand even full disclosure of the process , let alone private offshore bank accounts for the new leaders of the successful coup .
The coup formalizes a climax to a Ponzi Scheme .
A pyramid scheme is a non-sustainable business model that involves the exchange of money primarily for enrolling other people into the scheme , without any product or service bearing true value delivered .
With the ongoing steadfast support offered by Alan Greenspan , they were able to maintain an incredible Ponzi scheme .
They sold financial toxic waste products in the form of Mortgage Backed Securities ( MBS ) , Collateralized Debt Obligations ( CDO ) , Structured Investment Vehicles ( SIV ) , Unidentified Financial Objects ( UFO ) , and Credit Default Swaps ( CDS ) .
My favorite remains the UFOs .
The corruption of politicians in Congress enabled the process , with relaxed guidance by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) .
The two key ingredients for the Ponzi Scheme are a mythological ideology and a high priest to endorse the game from a credible pulpit .
Alan Greenspan claimed legitimacy of the US banking system , blessed credit growth and fractional bank practices as beneficial , and praised risk pricing systems using credit derivatives as sophisticated .
The high priest used to be Greenspan , but now a tag team has replaced him .
Hank Paulson is the spearhead for the great coup of the US financial system .
Usage of short restrictions rules has been key to both instilling instability at necessary times , and raiding hedge funds .
US Fed .
Chairman Bernanke swaps USTBonds for any piece of bonded garbage known to mankind .
Mammoth placements of leveraged trades by Wall Street firms make for some of the most grotesque insider trading in US history .
DECEIT & INTIMIDATION
The lies , deceit , backroom pressure , and fleecing of the American public is deep .
Take the Emergency Economic Stability Act .
Most of the initial $ 250 billion outlay was not devoted to American bankers , but rather to foreign bankers , primarily in Europe and England , and to purchase preferred US bank stocks .
The US public was not told about this redirection , which constitutes misallocation , misappropriation , and fraud .
Tremendous backroom pressure was exerted at every step .
The underlying assets involved in swaps do not even have to be US - based mortgage bonds .
The formerly submitted Paulson Manifesto was revived in a power grab , complete with considerable infighting and squabbles , since Morgan Stanley was given favor .
The usage of funds to buy investment stakes in the giant US banks is yet another direct Fascist Business Model tactic , assisting banks close to the power center , yet reeking with corruption .
The sickening irony is that they have no more money to disseminate and distribute .
They cannot reveal their lies until they formally request more Congressional funds .
Much discussion has come that the USGovt should adopt the Swedish model in the resolution of the current crisis .
Not in a New York minute !!
That would require heavy stock and bond losses , and more transparency of scum .
Interestingly , the market discounts words as worthless , while bailout actions fail to produce even a positive reaction for a full day , until Monday last week when the Dow Jones Industrial index rose over 900 points .
That was clearly Wall Street engineering a profitable short cover rally .
Check S&P futures positions beforehand , if you can .
The credibility of the US Fed. is close to being destroyed .
On October 15 , the same Dow Jones index fell over 700 points , almost 8 % .
Even the global rate cut was rejected by stock markets , a major insult .
Intimidation of the US Congress has been huge and powerful , similar to when the Patriot Act was passed in 2002 .
The Congress was actually threatened by martial law in the cities of the United States if the big bailout package was not passed two weeks ago !
This was not reported on CNN or CNBC , but C - Span did cover it .
The mobilization of the US Army for civilian control is well known in the past couple weeks .
See the Third Brigade back from combat duty in Iraq .
This account came from Rep Brad Sherman of California .
To achieve supposed financial stability , the nation succumbed to totalitarianism by Wall Street thieves , conmen , fraud kings , and criminals .
Instead , the bailout only covered up $ trillion fraud .
My position has been very stable and consistent , that such tactics are typical characteristics of the Fascist Business Model .
The state merges with the large corporations , who proceed to terrorize the citizenry after unspeakable protected corruption and theft .
To object is to be labeled unpatriotic !
TOP DOWN SOLUTION FAVORS THE ELITE
The top - down approach used to date aids the wealthy bankers , while the homeowners are denied aid .
That aid is promised but rarely arrives .
The fundamental problem here is that billion $ are devoted to shore up insolvent banks , to redeem their worthless ( or nearly worthless ) bonds , and to give a giant pass to the executives .
Trust has eroded throughout the system .
Banks distrust each other 's collateral .
The result is that eventually the US Economy will enter not a recession , not a depression , but a DISINTEGRATION PHASE .
Despite Bernanke 's studious efforts , borrowing from revisionist history , his liquidity is nothing more than bailouts at the top for the perpetrators of the housing bubble and mortgage debacle .
The bank system benefits little inside the US walls of finance .
A bottom - up approach might have had a chance to succeed , but a top - down approach is a sham .
To expect a top - down solution that actually relieves the housing inventory logjam is insane .
That is like feeding a teenager with meals placed inside the human rectum , expecting nutrients to find their way to the rest of the body !
The credit mechanisms do not travel upward within the pyramid , but rather in the downward direction , starting with a borrower , a good collateralized risk , and an underwritten loan , when plenty of lending capital is available .
The US public has bought this stupid ‘ Trickle Down ' philosophy for years , learning nothing .
The US Economy is on the verge of collapsing .
Short - term credit is being denied at key supplier intermediary steps , soon to result in recognized disintegration .
The primary practical objective of this corrupt trio ( JPM , GSax , FDIC ) is to avoid Credit Default Swap fires , which would bring an end to their reign of terror .
This US Economic failure is in progress and is unstoppable .
The 1930 Depression resulted after monumental credit abuse from the bottom up , as hundreds of thousands of people leveraged investments 10:1 with stocks primarily .
The 2000 Depression will come after monumental credit abuse from the top down , as hundreds of big financial firms leveraged investments by 7:1 and 20:1 with bonds primarily .
The most absurd of all is the CDO - squared , leveraging upon leverage .
Total seizures have crippled the banking system .
Short - term credit has largely vanished , as letters of credit are routinely not honoured at ports in the United States .
The panic will continue , especially when supplies dry up .
GOLD & SILVER AWAIT THEIR EXALTED STATUS
We are witnessing the disintegration cited in my recent forecasts .
It is a systemic failure , marred by lost confidence and trust in the entire financial system .
Expect foreigners soon to pull the rug from under the American syndicates in control .
Several key meetings have already concluded , totally unreported in the US press , which occurred in Berlin Germany .
Consider it the Anti-G7 Meeting .
Implications are profound , and involved the Shanghai Coop Org tangentially , since its member nations possess so much new commodity supply .
Consider it the Anti-NATO group .
An important and powerful alternative financial system is soon to spring into action , including high - level bilateral barter .
Those who expect the current US Regime to continue their financial terror are in for a big surprise .
Expect defaults in the COMEX with gold & silver , whose prices for paper vastly diverge from physical , to the anger of foreigners watching .
They hold massive precious metals assets .
Disparities now contribute to powerful forces , sure to break the current system .
Grand systemic changes come .
THE RESULT WILL BE A BREATH - TAKING DISCONTINUITY EVENT .
Ironically , the more inner anguish felt on the falling gold & silver prices , the closer we are to a new financial framework , with the US Dollar relegated to a Third World role .
A REPLACEMENT GLOBAL RESERVE CURRENCY HAS ALREADY BEEN DECIDED UPON .
Its launch awaits the proper moment .
The Americans are last to know , as usual .
The US leaders are under the illusion of being in control !

Thank you for revealing the truth of the JPM pig to the public .
Let the world see the true face of JPM monster .

19 Sep 09 , 06:20 A Radical Solution for America 's Insolvent Financial System
A Radical Solution for America 's Insolvent Financial System
The core problem of the United States ' banking system ( and maybe the world 's banking system ) is not liquidity but insolvency .
The liabilities of the United States ' banking system exceed the value of its assets .
The issue is not only the toxic assets ( toxic mortgage backed securities , toxic commercial real estate loans , sub - prime mortgages , alt - A loans , adjustable loans likely to go bust , increase in prime mortgage default rates , etc ) but also off - balance sheet liabilities ( such as expected huge unaccounted for future derivatives losses ) .
This means that bailouts are just beginning and will require bigger and bigger sums of taxpayer money as time goes on .
The government will resort to borrowing more and more and eventually to printing money when treasury debt auctions start failing .
The end result of this path is a currency collapse and probably total chaos as expected by gold bugs .
One other way to deal with this issue is to stop the bailouts and let the dominoes fall .
Defaults and cross - defaults will cause many , many depository institutions ( even very large ones ) to collapse leading to extreme decrease in money supply as bank deposits are destroyed .
Deposits of failed banks cannot be used to pay bills , make purchases and / or service debts .
Which will probably lead to even more defaults as unemployment increases and debtor 's are unable to service their debts .
This process will probably cause extreme deflation as businesses lower prices in a bid to survive .
This will also lead to wage cuts , increased unemployment and a deflation spiral and much chaos .
But probably less chaos than a currency collapse .
Is there a better way ?
Here is my idea : 1 ) We essentially need an orderly bankruptcy and liquidation of the United States ' financial system .
2 ) I suggest we create a government owned bank and transfer all deposits of the private commercial banking system to the new government owned bank .
This " transfer " is really just new money creation .
This new money will be digital cash ( electronic version of physical paper cash ) .
Very much like reserves at the FED .
3 ) Note that the plan will not create net new money since we will be destroying all deposits of the commercial banking system in the process .
4 ) All assets of the commercial banking system will be transferred to the government and auctioned off in an orderly manner over the next 10 years .
The proceeds from the sale would go the United States treasury and not the commercial banks .
The assumption here is that commercial banks deserve nothing since the entire industry would have been most likely destroyed any way .
Even good banks would have been destroyed due to bank runs and defaults if the government had allowed the dominoes to fall .
Of course bank shareholders , bank bond holders and counter parties of bank derivatives would not receive anything .
5 ) After the transfer FDIC protection will be removed for any private bank which wishes to remain in business or any new private depository institution or bank .
From that point on the government should make it absolutely clear that there will be no more bailouts and no more conversions .
This will discourage ( but not completely eliminate ) fractional reserve deposit banking and private money creation that results from pyramiding of government created money .
This will also limit debasement of the currency that results from fractional reserve deposit banking .
In fact , we can have " free banking " from that point on and not even have reserve requirements or capital requirements .
All depositors who use private banks will be fully at - risk .
The industry will have to set the interest rate high enough to attract depositors .
6 ) The new government bank will act as an electronic " piggy bank " only .
All deposits will be 100 % reserve and it will not make any loans .
Loan making will be left to the private banking system ( with no deposit insurance or a possibility of a future bailout ) .
The new government owned bank exists only as a " safe " money storage and a payment clearing system so the public does not have to carry around physical paper cash to make purchases and pay bills .
7 ) Of course this plan is not without pain or cost .
Cost of funds for banks and borrowers will probably rise as bank deposits are a source of very low cost money for the banks .
Nothing is free .
We are just exchanging higher cost of funds for removal of systemic failure risk .
Economically we are recognizing that when money is loaned there is always credit risk .
8 ) We are just separating the payment and clearing transaction system which is absolutely necessary for day - to - day commerce ( no credit risk ) from the loan banking and investment system ( has credit risk ) .

Models -
The tools
It 's always good to understand the weapon used to inflict the damages .
JPM invented derivatives in 1986 , the industry wide VaR computer model in 1996 and Goldman Sachs used their SecDB model during the Greek crisis .
Both models are used worldwide by banks and financial institutions ... who knows their fail points better than JPM and GS ?
Q.E.D.
Think about that !

I dig your style man .
Keep on keepin ' on .
Neither man describes himself as an atheist .
Mr. Charles , raised by liberal Jewish parents , said he became attracted to Judaism during preparation for his bar mitzvah , announcing to his parents that he wanted to become a rabbi .
Even after this passion passed , the ontological questions raised “ plague me to this day , ” he said .
“ Judaism is deeply ingrained in me , but I ’m definitely not a believer in the Bible .
I ca n’t accept that . ”
Mr. Maher was raised by a Catholic father and Jewish mother , attending mass until he was an adolescent , when his father parted with the church .
Describing his beliefs now , Mr. Maher said : “ I believe in ‘ I do n’t know . ’
I ’m not troubled by the giant questions I know I will never find out the answer to as long as I ’m alive . ”
Like the “ Borat ” movie “ Religulous ” casts its protagonist as a seeker among strange peoples , and gets its laughs by showing them in a silly light .
While Borat was more clueless than the people he encountered , Mr. Maher is always the smartest one on the screen .
The pickings are easy .
Mr. Charles said they had hoped to interview major religious figures , including the pope , the president of the Mormon Church and the Dalai Lama .
Instead they got members of the Truckers Chapel in Raleigh , N.C. , the guy who plays Jesus at the Holy Land Experience theme park in Orlando , and an Islamic rapper named Propa - Gandhi .
The filmmakers denied that they picked on easy targets .
“ I get this criticism a lot , ” Mr. Maher said .
“ It ’s a pet peeve of mine , because I ’m confronted with this notion that ‘ Oh yes , you only go after the extremists , and by doing that you make religion look silly . ’ ” He continued : “ Anyone who ’s religious is extremist .
See , we ’re just used to religion .
It ’s like what Matthew Arnold said about a tree .
It ’s not that there are no miracles .
A tree is a miracle .
You ’re just used to it .
And conversely religion is something we ’re just used to .
So the notion that God had a son , that he ’s a single parent , and the son went on a suicide mission , and you ’re drinking his blood on Sunday , that a man lived inside a whale and that the earth is 5,000 years old  all the essentials of religion that are in the Bible or the Koran  we ’re used to them .
But it does n’t mean they ’re not crazy , does n’t mean they ’re not ridiculous .
And so to be religious at all is to be an extremist , is to be irrational .
“ I interviewed Senator Mark Pryor .
He ’s a senator .
He ’s not a fringe person .
And I said , ‘ The way the world began , it could n’t really be 5,000 years ago in a garden with a talking snake , ’ and he said , ‘ Yes , it could be . ’
Now any religious person you ask that question to is going to give you an answer like that that makes him look silly . ”
Mr. Pryor , a Democrat from Arkansas , said he had not seen the movie , but that his interview with Mr. Maher was “ very hostile but very constructive . ”
He added that he did not consider faith and evolution to be in conflict , and that the 5,000 years referred to in some Christian texts might not be literal years .
( Mr. Pryor said he considered intelligent design a discipline of science , though courts have ruled otherwise . )
Sex slur hits the ' pitbull in lipstick ' :
Palin forced to fight claims she had an affair
Sarah Palin was embroiled in an astonishing smear scandal last night after she was accused of an affair with her husband 's business partner .
The allegation emerged within hours of a barnstorming speech to the Republican convention by the vice - presidential nominee .
The Alaska governor , a mother of five , hugged husband Todd on stage after announcing : ' He 's still my guy ' to the audience in St Paul , Minnesota .
Sarah Palin blows a kiss to her supporters after wowing the Republican crowd
But , according to the National Enquirer supermarket tabloid , Mrs Palin cheated on the 44 - year - old fisherman in an ' affair that nearly ruined her career ' .
It claimed the relationship was being widely discussed in Alaska , and that Mr Palin had severed all connections with the friend who allegedly cuckolded him .
The magazine went on to allege that Mrs Palin had desperately tried to cover up the fact that her 17 - year - old daughter Bristol is five months pregnant , confirming it only when she knew the media were about to break the news .
Mrs Palin , 44 , was the victim of a slur earlier in the week when it was claimed that her youngest child , four - month - old Trig , who has Down 's Syndrome , was actually Bristol 's son .
The latest claim , of adultery , was condemned as ' a vicious lie ' by the McCain camp .
' The smearing of the Palin family must end , ' said Republican chief strategist Steve Schmidt .
Governor Palin makes a speech at the Republican Governors Association luncheon in Minneapolis , and below , her campaign badges
' The allegations insinuating that Governor Palin had an extramarital affair are categorically false . '
The Enquirer has a reputation for sensationalism , paying for stories and digging dirt on the lives of politicians and celebrities .
But its credibility was boosted recently when revelations about the then Democrat presidential candidate John Edwards cheating on his wife while she was battling breast cancer proved to be true .
In her convention speech , Mrs Palin made a point of introducing all her family .
With her husband , Bristol and Trig , were their other children Track , 19 , Willow , 13 , and Piper , seven .
Standing up for Mom : Pregnant Bristol Palin and boyfriend Levi
Bristol 's bemused 18 - year - old boyfriend and apparent fiance , Levi Johnston , was seated with them and joined Mrs Palin on stage at the end of the speech .
She introduced her husband as a commercial fisherman and oil worker and ' proud member of the United Steelworkers Union ' .
To roars of applause , she declared : ' We met in high school , and two decades and five children later he 's still my guy . '
But the Enquirer insisted she had cheated on him .
It quoted an anonymous source saying : ' Todd discovered the affair and quickly dissolved his friendship and his business associations with the guy .
' Many people in Alaska are talking about the rumour and say Todd swept it under the rug . '
However the magazine went into no further detail about the alleged affair .
On the question of Bristol 's pregnancy , the Enquirer quoted sources close to the family as saying that Mrs Palin had desperately tried to cover it up .
She confirmed her daughter 's pregnancy only after it was clear that the media already knew of it and that the news was about to break , according to the sources .
While Mrs Palin has publicly expressed support for Bristol and said that she will be marrying the baby 's father , the source says Mrs Palin had been working frantically to get the two married before the pregnancy news came out , but Bristol refused .
Threatening legal action against the National Enquirer , Mr Schmidt said : ' The efforts of the media and tabloids to destroy this fine and accomplished public servant are a disgrace .
The American people will reject it .'
But the tabloid refused to back down .
' The National Enquirer 's coverage of a vicious war within Sarah Palin 's extended family includes several newsworthy revelations , including the resulting incredible charge of an affair plus details of family strife when the Governor 's daughter revealed her pregnancy , ' said a spokesman .
' Following our John Edwards exclusives , our political reporting has obviously proven to be more detail - oriented than the McCain campaign 's vetting process . '
To add to Mrs Palin 's headaches , she was confronted with further revelations in the respected Washington Post concerning the socalled ' Troopergate ' scandal .
She is accused of abusing her power by trying to get her sister 's ex-husband fired from his police job after he allegedly threatened her father .
The Post printed e-mails sent by Mrs Palin criticising the official inquiry into her ex-brother - in - law , State Trooper Mike Wooten .
She is accused of getting rid of her public safety commissioner Walt Monegan for failing to axe Trooper Wooten , who had been married to her sister .
As for John McCain , he faced the daunting prospect early today of being overshadowed at his own convention coronation .
Republican officials were worried that Mrs Palin 's electrifying performance could steal the show from the 72 - year - old White House nominee in his own speech to the Minnesota convention .
' How do you top that ? ' said one Republican strategist .
Why so sour , Mr Naughtie ?
Amid the chorus of approval for Sarah Palin 's convention address , one voice remained distinctly unimpressed .
James Naughtie , of Radio 4 's Today programme , reported that the Alaska governor had spoken with ' directness and tartness ' .
He also claimed that her tone was surprisingly ' sharp ' for what was supposed to be an introductory speech to the country .
Many Americans observing the BBC 's coverage of the presidential race have accused it of favouring the Democrats , loosely the U.S. equivalent of the Labour Party .
Naughtie showed his colours in 2005 when he asked Labour 's Ed Balls : ' If we win the election , does Gordon Brown want to remain Chancellor ? '
Meanwhile at BBC 2's Newsnight , Emily Maitlis was accused of flirting with an American politician during an item from the convention hall .
The glamorous 37 - year - old presenter left colleagues cringeing and viewers aghast when she prefaced a question by telling Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge he was ' charming ' and ' handsome ' .

AMERICANS ' ATTITUDES ON AIR MARSHALS AMERICANS ' ATTITUDES ON AIR MARSHALS ABOUT THIS STORY ABOUT THIS STORY Michael Grabell is an investigative reporter for ProPublica , an independent , non-profit newsroom based in New York City that produces investigative journalism .
USA TODAY editors worked with Grabell and ProPublica editors in preparing this story for publication .
Shawn Nguyen bragged that he could sneak anything past airport security using his top - secret clearance as a federal air marshal .
And for months , he smuggled cocaine and drug money onto flights across the country , boasting to an FBI informant that he was " the man with the golden badge . "
Michael McGowan used his position as an air marshal to lure a young boy to his hotel room , where he showed him child porn , took pictures of him naked and sexually abused him .
AIR MARSHAL SURVEY : Download the complete results ( PDF )
And when Brian " Cooter " Phelps wanted his ex-wife to disappear , he called a fellow air marshal and tried to hire a hit man nicknamed " the Crucifixer . "
Since 9/11 , more than three dozen federal air marshals have been charged with crimes , and hundreds more have been accused of misconduct , an investigation by ProPublica , a non-profit journalism organization , has found .
Cases range from drunken driving and domestic violence to aiding a human - trafficking ring and trying to smuggle explosives from Afghanistan .
The Federal Air Marshal Service presents the image of an elite undercover force charged with making split - second decisions that could mean the difference between stopping a terrorist and shooting an innocent passenger .
But an examination of police reports , court records , government reports , memos and e-mails shows that 18 air marshals have been charged with felonies , including at least three who were hired despite prior criminal records or being fired from law enforcement jobs .
A fourth air marshal was hired while under FBI investigation .
Another stayed on the job despite alarming a flight attendant with his behavior .
This spring , after U.S. embassies , airlines and foreign police agencies complained about air marshal misconduct overseas , the agency director dispatched supervisors on international missions .
From 33 to 3,000 Before 9/11 , the Air Marshal Service was a nearly forgotten force of 33 agents with a $ 4.4 million annual budget .
Now housed in the Transportation Security Administration , the agency has a $ 786 million budget and an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 air marshals , although the official number is classified .
Only a fraction of them have been charged with crimes , and some degree of misconduct occurs at all law enforcement agencies .
But for air marshals , the stakes are uniquely high .
Their beat is a confined cabin with hundreds of passengers in firing range .
There are no calls for backup at 30,000 feet , putting a premium on sound judgment and swift action .
Since 9/11 , air marshals have taken bribes , committed bank fraud , hired an escort while on layover and doctored hotel receipts to pad expenses , records show .
They 've been found sleeping on planes and lost the travel documents of U.S. diplomats while on a whiskey - tasting trip in Scotland .
The Air Marshal Service says it has the highest firearms qualification standard among federal law enforcement agencies .
Yet police and court records show some marshals have used their weapons imprudently :
In 2003 , a New York air marshal pulled his gun in a dispute over a parking space .
Another failed to turn over his ammunition on an international trip , as required by diplomatic agreements , and was detained by Israeli airport security in 2004 .
That same year , a Las Vegas air marshal " discharged " his gun in a hotel room , penetrating a wall and shattering a mirror .
In April , a Phoenix air marshal fired his during a fight outside a bar .
Still another left his handgun in the plane 's lavatory in 2001 , according to court papers .
He realized it was missing only after a teenager found it .
Robert Bray , director of the Air Marshal Service , says the misconduct cases do n't represent the exemplary work done by the vast majority of air marshals .
" We can reassure the public that these dedicated professionals go out there every day and put their lives on the line to make sure that everyone is safe , " Bray says .
" I do n't want them to be tarred by … a few allegations from a few years ago . "
Bray and other officials declined to discuss specific cases , citing privacy laws .
Under government policies , air marshals found guilty of felonies were fired or forced to resign .
But 10 air marshals convicted of misdemeanors , mostly drunken driving , were allowed to keep their jobs .
And even after notice that background checks were poor , the agency failed to root out air marshals with troubled pasts before they committed felonies .
Current and former air marshals say the misconduct cases show that the agency continues to struggle with policing its own ranks , a problem that surfaced in its post - 9/11 buildup .
Since then , the service has had three leaders , been moved four times to different parent agencies and been blasted by Congress for , among other things , failing to cover enough flights and enforcing a dress code that many air marshals felt blew their cover .
Don Strange , the former special agent in charge of the Atlanta office and a finalist to lead the agency in 2006 , says turmoil and low morale have led good air marshals to quit and made it harder for managers to maintain the highest standards .
" It starts with the urgency ( to hire and train recruits ) in a ridiculous amount of time , " he says .
" Things start to spin out of control . "
Recruiting rush Under heavy congressional pressure , the government rushed to hire thousands of air marshals after 9/11 .
Partly motivated by enduring images of planes hitting the World Trade Center , the Pentagon aflame and a charred Pennsylvania field , 200,000 applied .
With limited spots , the Air Marshal Service had an acceptance rate of about one in 40 — four times as tough as Harvard's .
" We 're getting the cream of the crop , " then - TSA spokesman David Steigman told reporters .
" The people who are going into the air marshal program are the best of the best . "
But that was n't necessarily the case .
Shortly after joining the agency , three air marshals were indicted in corruption investigations at their former police departments .
One , Louis Pirani , had been hired in early 2002 , despite being under FBI investigation for months on suspicion of skimming profits from drug couriers as a sheriff 's deputy in Arkansas .
He eventually was convicted and went to prison for lying to investigators .
Just two weeks after joining the air marshals in April 2002 , Shawn Nguyen filed for bankruptcy , claiming $ 200,000 in debts .
Three years later , the former narcotics officer began carrying cash and cocaine past airport security for a man he knew as a drug trafficker , but who 'd already turned to the FBI .
" I do n't care what 's in the [ expletive ] package , you know what I mean ?
Just tell me how much it is and what I 'm getting in money , " Nguyen told the informant in a recorded conversation recounted in court records .
" I 'm the man with the golden badge . "
Nguyen was sentenced to seven years in prison .
Before becoming an air marshal , Brian Phelps had worked at five small police departments in Alabama , but none for more than a year .
He was fired from the job he held longest for losing his temper and acting " irrationally " before thinking things through , prosecutors said .
He quit another job in lieu of being fired for misconduct while on duty , says Mayor Paula Phillips of Douglas , Ala .
In 2005 , Phelps , known as " Cooter " among fellow air marshals , told a colleague that he wanted to see his wife 's picture on a milk carton , court transcripts say .
He asked the air marshal , who 'd worked in Chicago 's housing projects , whether he knew of anyone who could help .
The colleague said he did : The Crucifixer .
The colleague told the Air Marshal Service , and after numerous contacts with FBI agents posing as hit men , Phelps was arrested and sentenced to 25 years in prison .
Another air marshal , David Kellerman , was arrested on felony charges for dealing in stolen property in 1983 and for carrying a concealed weapon in 1990 .
Although judgment was withheld in both cases , Kellerman was sentenced each time to probation , according to Florida Department of Law Enforcement records .
In September , Kellerman — a Green Beret and Purple Heart recipient — was sentenced to 27 months in prison after being caught hiding a cache of weapons that included AK - 47s and a grenade launcher stolen while he was on leave for a military tour in Afghanistan .
Kellerman told investigators he was bringing back training aids for his job as an air marshal firearms instructor .
Background checks
Because air marshals receive top - secret security clearances , background checks are supposed to include criminal history searches going back 10 years , credit reports and interviews with relatives , neighbors and employers .
Checks are conducted by the federal Office of Personnel Management , a separate agency , which forwards results to the Air Marshal Service .
Kellerman 's charges predated the 10 - year check period .
But in Phelps ' case , three officials — Justice Ashley , former assistant police chief in Guntersville , Ala . ; Chad Long , the current Douglas police chief , and Phillips — say they could n't recall the air marshals contacting anyone to make a background check .
It 's unclear whether Pirani's FBI scrutiny and Nguyen 's bankruptcy were missed or disregarded .
A 2004 report by the Department of Homeland Security 's inspector general also flagged gaps in the background checks .
The report cited 504 applicants who were recommended for hire and awaiting offers , noting that nearly a third had potentially disqualifying problems , including past arrests , bankruptcies or disciplinary problems .
" Many ( air marshals ) were granted access to classified information after displaying questionable judgment , irresponsibility and emotionally unstable behavior , " the report said .
This summer , after a Houston TV station reported that three air marshals had been charged with drunken driving , including one with a prior DWI conviction , Rep . Ted Poe , R - Texas , grilled TSA Administrator Kip Hawley at a congressional hearing .
In a subsequent letter to Poe , Hawley said that 28 air marshals had been hired with misdemeanors on their records , and nine more kept their jobs after a drunken - driving conviction .
TSA policies state that employees who drive drunk " demonstrate a disregard for TSA 's mission " and raise questions about their ability to deal with security threats .
Yet the policy allows drunken driving to be punished with a letter of reprimand , one of the lowest penalties .
By comparison , the FBI mandates at least a 30 - day suspension without pay for drunken driving .
Although other federal police agencies generally allow for flexibility in discipline , many big -city departments , such as New York , Los Angeles and Chicago , mandate a suspension or loss of pay for a first offense .
" It 's more serious than a letter saying , ' Do n't do it again , try to do better , ' " Poe said in an interview .
" I do n't think a person should have a criminal record and keep their job with the Air Marshal Service — including a DWI . "
The flying public agrees .
In a national survey for ProPublica conducted by Harris Interactive , 86 % of those who'd taken a commercial flight in the past year said it was unacceptable for someone convicted of driving under the influence to become an air marshal .
No office compiles uniform statistics on arrests of federal law officers , making it difficult to compare agencies .
The 2004 inspector general 's report found 753 documented cases of misconduct by air marshals over 20 months , with offenses from sleeping on duty to flunking drug tests .
After the report , the agency said it tightened its background procedures .
When misconduct occurred , the agency said , it had acted " swiftly and decisively , " terminating 101 air marshals over two years and taking resignations from 32 others .
But problems continued — Kellerman , Phelps and Nguyen all committed their crimes after the 2004 report .
The service declined to say what 's been done since to check for cases that fell through the cracks .
Hiring standards erode
Over the years , the service has loosened some hiring practices : •
In 2002 , the agency decided that recruits no longer had to pass a rigorous firearms test requiring them to prove speed and accuracy in close quarters similar to an airplane .
The test is still used in training but is no longer a hiring qualification .
•
In late 2005 , the agency began hiring TSA screeners , new college grads and others with no law enforcement experience .
The change departed from practice during the 9/11 ramp - up , when air marshals almost uniformly were chosen from law enforcement , such as the Border Patrol , federal Bureau of Prisons and police and sheriff 's departments .
•
Two years ago , officials suspended a requirement that air marshals pass a written psychological test and an interview with a psychologist or psychiatrist .
Bray , the director , says the changes did not lower hiring standards and that it 's unfair to suggest a TSA screener or a recent college grad could not be up to par after training .
The Air Marshal Service still has the highest standard for shooting accuracy among federal police agencies , he says .
In the ProPublica survey , 87 % said air marshals should be required to pass a psychological stress test , and 77 % said they should have prior experience in law enforcement .
Two cases show why psychological testing might be valuable .
Orlando air marshal Marcus Rogozinski was on a mission from New York to Dallas in 2006 when he walked to the galley and showed a flight attendant a book with some pictures of blue crystals , his supervisor , Richard Lozada , wrote in an e-mail introduced at a competency hearing
If she had good thoughts , Rogozinski told her , the water could be turned clear , Lozada recounted .
But if she had bad thoughts , it would turn murky .
When Rogozinski went to the lavatory , the alarmed flight attendant walked back to his partner , Paul Steward .
" I ca n't believe he is able to carry a gun ! " she said , according to an account written by Steward .
In 2007 , another flight attendant complained that Rogozinski " was talking about all kinds of crazy stuff like outer space , " according to a memo from air marshal David Cameron .
" No ( air marshal ) should have to pay more attention to their partner than to the passengers , " Cameron wrote .
Afterward , Rogozinski failed a psych exam and was put on leave .
In June , Rogozinski was convicted of bank fraud for trying to cash a $ 10.9 million check from a woman he said he believed was Cambodian royalty .
The money , he told prosecutors , was partial settlement for a " personal lawsuit " after he was scratched by the woman 's cat .
Then there 's the case of Michael McGowan , who joined the air marshals after 9/11 .
Before he was sentenced to a sex - offenders unit in 2006 , his lawyer pleaded with a judge for help for his client .
" He is taking the position ' I have a serious problem , I 'm sick , ' " said attorney Joel Weiss , according to a court transcript .
McGowan had been caught two years earlier trying to buy pornography of children as young as 7 over the Internet .
Investigators discovered he'd been molesting a Texas boy since 2002 and had enticed the boy by saying he was staying at a nearby hotel on air marshal business .
Even after his conviction , court records show , McGowan called the boy from prison and engaged him in sexual conversations .
' Impact on our reputation ' Earlier this year , a rash of complaints about air marshal misconduct on overseas missions set off new alarms .
The agency would not provide details of the incidents .
But ProPublica obtained an April 15 internal memo from Dana Brown , then director of the Air Marshal Service , warning the rank and file that the behavior threatened to create diplomatic problems for the agency on international routes , " some of the most important we fly . "
" In foreign countries , some have behaved in a manner that may jeopardize our ability to continue to operate effectively , " Brown wrote .
" The negative impact on our reputation and that of the American government has the potential to cause significant harm . "
To put a stop to it , Brown ordered " Quality Assurance Teams " of supervisors to monitor air marshals on international missions and act as liaisons with host countries .
" These are highly trained federal air marshals with guns on planes .
If they need chaperones , then we 're all in serious trouble , " says P. Jeffrey Black , a Las Vegas air marshal who in the past has testified before Congress about agency policies .
Bray says the agency was not able to substantiate the allegations of overseas misconduct and that Brown was simply being proactive .
Black says the job should n't be entry - level .
New hires need the experience and judgment learned from making decisions on the street , he says .
Poe , a former judge and prosecutor who sits on the House aviation subcommittee , says the unique nature of the job demands the highest recruiting standards .
He says he wants to address the issue of air marshal misconduct further when the new Congress is seated next year .
Air marshals " all have to be of high quality , not most of them , " Poe says .
" We can't take a chance that they will make a mistake . "
Six of Cincinnati air marshal David Slaughter 's colleagues wrote character references for him after his arrest in 2006 , according to court records .
" A man of impeccable character , " wrote one .
" An outstanding employee . " " Polite , " wrote another .
" His character around the office is one of example . "
" Dave 's demeanor and professionalism reflect favorably on the field office as well as the agency as a whole . "
Slaughter was convicted of abducting a female escort during a July 2006 layover in the Washington , D.C. , area .
In an interview , he said he hired the escort because he was having marital problems and wanted a woman 's perspective .
As they talked about how to spend their time , he went into the bedroom of his hotel suite and returned with his gun and handcuffs .
The woman tried to flee , but he prevented her from leaving and unplugged the phone , prosecutors said .
The two struggled , and when the woman got the door open , Slaughter pinned her to the ground , held her in a chokehold and handcuffed her , according to prosecutors and the woman , Cherith Zorbas .
Despite his colleagues ' support , Slaughter lost his job and got 15 days in jail .
Zorbas called the outcome " horrific " and said the public should be scared .
" He 's the only one on an airplane with a freakin ' weapon , " she said , " and he 's supposed to have it to be protecting us . "

Is He For Real ?

The Entrepreneur : Jasmine Lawrence , 17
Revenues : Over $ 1 million
Her Story :
As if being a teenager were n't hectic enough — try being a teen and a CEO .
That is the challenge that I am faced with every day .
It all started four years ago , when I decided to start a company to make all - natural hair and body care products .
Now I am managing national distribution chains and international online sales .
At the same time , I am also trying to have a life .
My day starts at 5 a.m .
After school , I head straight to my room for an hour power nap , then pry myself awake for homework .
On a normal day , after finishing my schoolwork , I answer e-mails , do interviews , and have a meeting or two with my four employees ( one of whom is my mom — she is the head of business development ) .
On a not - so - normal day , I may be packing to take a trip somewhere across the country to speak at a school , a church , or a business event .
At some of these events , I am surrounded by business people wearing suits and ties who are twice my age , if not more .
Look the Look , Talk the Talk
At first , it was a challenge to fit in — in the jungle of Corporate America .
I noticed , however , that all that I needed were a few adjustments and a little maturity .
I needed a professional attitude that would gain me respect among adults .
I also needed professional attire .
It was n't easy , because I had never been exposed to the world of business beyond what I had learned from my mom and dad .
I started my businesswoman transformation with my wardrobe .
I knew that I had to look the part if I planned to run a multimillion - dollar empire one day .
So , I went out and bought suits for all occasions .
I also went into my closet and pulled out the shoes that I usually wore only on special occasions .
I stood up straight , looked in the mirror , and saw the businesswoman I was destined to be .
Once I was satisfied with my outside appearance , it was time to look within .
I dropped the slang I used with my friends , and I adopted new business terms like " revenue " and " return on investment . "
I practiced my elevator pitch and readied myself for networking and sharing my ideas with others .
The first test of my business skills came in the form of an investor presentation competition in 2005 , where I had to discuss my business plan before a group of real financial advisers .
I was nervous when I first stepped into the room filled with so many people .
But I was confident in my business .
I knew it was really a good idea .
I was able to deliver a smooth presentation .
Many there were shocked and amazed at not only my age but also the poise with which I spoke and carried myself .
Hitting the Mass Market
A year later ( in 2006 ) , I had another challenge .
I was nominated for Black Enterprise 's Teenpreneur of the Year award .
Following the awards ceremony , a representative from Wal - Mart approached me .
He wanted to know more about my business and start a relationship , so that one day my products could be sold at its stores .
My dream of hitting the mass market seemed to be coming true right there .
Little did I know there were many steps I had to take to make them come true .
After learning even more about business and the retail world , I went down to Wal - Mart headquarters in Bentonville , Ark. , for a meeting .
It had taken almost a year to get UPC codes , minority - and women - owned business certifications , and also to learn how to ship and bill Wal - Mart .
It was a success that I was given the chance to do a test run in 10 stores to see how my products would sell .
The trial went phenomenally .
Not long after , Wal - Mart offered to sell my products in 200 stores across the country .
Many people could never picture a teenager running such a successful business .
I do n't think they should be so surprised anymore .
There are plenty of teen - run businesses today .
Teens are venturing past the conventional money - making jobs like babysitting , or working at fast food restaurants and lemonade stands .
We teens today have bigger dreams and higher expectations for ourselves than anyone could imagine .
Sometimes all we need is a little encouragement or some inspiration on what we can really do .
Live Your Dream
When I first started my business , a lot of people told me that I was too young and that I needed to focus on school .
Many thought that I was just a puppet and that my parents were really the ones calling the shots and running the business .
I saw past all of the negativity and did what I was called to do .
I never lost the support of my friends and family .
They were the encouragement that I needed .
Now that my business has started to truly make a mark in the hair care industry , I feel that it is my duty to give back .
My message is : Find your passion , and live your dream .
It is never too early or too late to take a chance and live your dream .
I am living proof .
However , in the midst of the speaking engagements and business meetings , I still manage to remain an honor student with a 4.0 GPA .
I do sports , community service , and after - school clubs .
I study engineering and have an amazing group of friends that I could n't do without .
I make time for myself , my family , and all the other things I love to do besides run my business .
I have a very full life , but I would n't have it any other way !

WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission has
sided with the National Football League in a long - running
programming dispute with Comcast Corp .
The FCC says Comcast should carry the league 's NFL Network on its popular digital cable package .
The commission ruled that Comcast discriminated against the NFL Network by agreeing to carry the channel only on a more expensive
sports cable service .
The NFL filed the complaint against Comcast in May .
The FCC ruling now goes before an administrative law judge , who could force Comcast to carry the NFL programming at a certain
price .
Comcast has argued that consumers will have to pay more for programming many may not want if the company is forced to include
the NFL Network in its regular digital cable package .
Teenager goes into convulsions after playing World of Warcraft computer game for 24hrs
A boy of 15 collapsed and went into convulsions after playing the World of Warcraft computer game for 24 hours .
The boy had seven friends gathered at his house in Western Sweden on Saturday night to play the legendary video game .
' They played all day and all night , ' his father told reporters .
The boys may have gotten a few hours sleep , but what little food they ate over the marathon session was eaten at their computers .
Then , at about 2 pm on Sunday afternoon , the boy had what reports described as an epileptic seizure .
A world away : Scenes from the massively popular World of Warcraft .
A 15 - year - old boy collapsed over the weekend after playing the game for 24 hours straight
His terrified parents promptly called for help and the boy was rushed to hospital .
Doctors said his bodily systems had been thrown off :
The combination of sleep deprivation , lack of food , and too long a stretch of concentrated game playing had been too much for him .
The boy is now expected to make a full recovery , according to The Times .
But his father did not take the incident lightly , warning the parents of the other boys present of the dangers of such marathon game sessions .
Last week the latest World of Warcraft installment , Wrath of the Lich King , was released in Sweden .
Since then , officials in the Game Over treatment centre in Linköping , central Sweden , have noticed a spike in calls from concerned parets , Svenska Dagbladet newspaper reported .
' It ’s been a huge problem .
We have parents who call everyday and ask , ' a spokesman was quoted as saying .
Eleven million people worldwide play WoW , according to the game 's American makers , Blizzard Entertainment .
That makes it the world 's most successful MMORPG ( massively multi- player online role - playing game ) .
For many , the game is a sociable alternative to slumping in front of the TV , but the release of Lich King has led some psychiatrists to raise the alarm about young players ' potential to become addicted , Scottish newspaper The Herald has reported .
' Some of my clients will discuss playing games for 14 , 16 hours a day at times , without breaks and without attending to their physical needs , ' psychiatrist Dr Richard Graham of the Tavistock Centre in London told the newspaper on Thursday .
' For those , the consequences are potentially severe , ' he added with startling prescience , hours before the boy 's collapse .
He spoke of his concerns that such prolonged gaming could produce ' a sort of socially withdrawn figure who may be connecting with people in the game but is largely dropping out of education and other social opportunities . '
In old movies we were going to improve society by making everything think like a computer .
Now the goal is to make computers think like brains .
Researchers at Missouri University of Science and Technology say they can make power network management more efficient by literally tapping brain cells grown on networks of electrodes .
The Missouri S&T group , working with researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology , plans to use the brain power to develop a new method for tracking and managing the constantly changing levels of power supply and demand .
Led by Dr. Ganesh Kumar Venayagamoorthy , associate professor of electrical and computer engineering , the researchers will use living neural networks composed of thousands of brain cells from laboratory rats to control simulated power grids in the lab .
From those studies , the researchers hope to create a " biologically inspired " computer program to manage and control complex power grids in Mexico , Brazil , Nigeria and elsewhere .
" We want to develop a totally new architecture than what exists today , " says Venayagamoorthy , who also directs the Real - Time Power and Intelligent Systems Laboratory at Missouri S&T .
" Power systems control is very complex , and the brain is a very flexible , very adaptable network .
The brain is really good at handling uncertainties . "
Venayagamoorthy hopes to develop a system that is " inspired by the brain but not a replica .
Nobody really understands completely how the brain works . "
The research is funded through a $ 2 million grant from the National Science Foundation 's Office of Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation .
The Missouri S&T team will work with researchers at Georgia Tech 's Laboratory for Neuroengineering , where the living neural networks have been developed and are housed and studied .
A high - bandwidth Internet2 connection will connect those brain cells over 600 miles to Venayagamoorthy 's Real - Time Power and Intelligent Systems Laboratory .
Missouri S&T researchers will transmit signals from that lab in Rolla , Mo. , to the brain cells in the Atlanta lab , and will train those brain cells to recognize voltage signals and other information from Missouri S&T 's real - time simulator .
Venayagamoorthy 's lab is capable of simulating a power grid the size of Nigeria 's , or a portion of the combined New England and New York grid in the United States .
Working with Venayagamoorthy on this project at Missouri S&T are Dr. Donald Wunsch , the Mary K. Finley Missouri Distinguished Professor of Computer Engineering , and Dr. Keith Corzine , associate professor of electrical and computer engineering .
Georgia
Tech researchers involved in the project are Dr. Steve Potter , associate professor in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University , and Dr. Ronald Harley , the Duke Power Co. Distinguished Professor in Georgia Tech ’s School of Computer and Electrical Engineering .
Traditional artificial neural networks ( ANNs ) have been around for years .
Modeled after the brain , they are designed to recognize patterns and learn over time .
But they do n't work well with complex systems , Venayagamoorthy says .
" As electric power and energy systems get larger and larger , the dynamics become more complicated , and the neural networks have to be scaled up , " he says .
" But as they scale up , they break down .
It becomes more difficult for neural networks to learn and change in real time .
" They can learn online , but the learning is slow and sometimes the decision - making is very short - sighted , " he says .
For instance , if a transmission line is taken out during a severe storm , traditional ANNs cannot react quickly enough to locate the problem and bring the system back online .
Through this research , Venayagamoorthy and his colleagues hope to develop what he calls BIANNs , or biologically inspired artificial neural networks .
Based on the brain=s adaptability , these networks could control not only power systems , but also other complex systems , such as traffic - control systems or global financial networks .
The Georgia Tech researchers , led by Potter , have developed living neural networks that can control simple robots , but this will be the first time anyone has attempted to tap the brain power to control more complex systems .
After testing the system in simulated environments , the researchers will then test them in actual power grids in Mexico , Brazil , China , Nigeria , Singapore and South Africa .
One goal of the project is to develop a system that can be implemented in the " future intelligent power grid , " says Venayagamoorthy .
The researchers envision that grid integrating a variety of power sources , such as wind and solar farms , energy storage facilities , self - sustainable community or neighborhood micro-grids , and other non-traditional energy sources .
" Our studies are going to be based on what is predicted for the next 20 years , " Venayagamoorthy says .
Why Are McCain Backers So Angry ?
From Republicans at political rallies to GOP lawmakers on TV talk shows , McCain - Palin supporters are angry , very angry – and they seem to think their anger justifies whatever they do : from calling Barack Obama a “ terrorist ” to shouting “ kill him ” and “ off with his head ” – to getting huffy when their violent rhetoric is challenged .

They ’re even angrier now after Rep. John Lewis , D - Georgia , a veteran of the civil rights movement , chastised John McCain and Sarah Palin for whipping Republican crowds up into the kind of fury that can set the stage for murder .
Lewis , who marched and bled with Martin Luther King Jr. , accused McCain and Palin of “ sowing the seeds of hatred and division ” in a way reminiscent of Alabama Gov. George Wallace , who rallied white anger against black civil rights advances in the 1960s .
“ George Wallace never threw a bomb , ” Lewis said Saturday .
“ He never fired a gun , but he created the climate and conditions that encouraged vicious attacks against innocent Americans who were simply trying to exercise their constitutional rights . ”
While Lewis ’s warning could have been an opportunity for McCain to reflect on the tone of his campaign , it became another excuse for him to get angry .
McCain – who has elicited some of the harsh crowd responses by asking ominously “ who is the real Barack Obama ? ” – denounced Lewis ’s statement as “ a character attack against Governor Palin and me that is shocking and beyond the pale . ”
Rather than apologize for his own recklessness – or , perhaps , pull a campaign ad that accuses Obama of lying about his association with a “ terrorist , ” former Vietnam War-era radical William Ayers – McCain demanded that Obama repudiate Lewis .
( Obama ’s campaign responded by saying Lewis was right to condemn “ hateful rhetoric ” at the rallies but distancing itself from the Wallace comparison . )
After McCain ’s angry retort to Lewis , mainstream TV talking heads began wringing their hands that Lewis had gone too far , noting that McCain – and even Palin – had pulled back a bit in the Obama - bashing on Friday , with McCain drawing boos himself when he offered a mild defense of Obama as “ a decent family man . ”
But the Republican counterattack against Lewis continued on Sunday as the McCain - Palin camp got riled up for the morning news shows .
Among the angry McCain - Palin surrogates was Sen. Lindsey Graham , R - South Carolina , who went on CBS ’s “ Face the Nation ” to deplore Lewis ’s criticism as “ an all - time low ” and “ an absolute offense to people like me . ”
Graham added , “ We ’re not going to be intimidated by this playing the race card simply because Sen .
Obama ’s record has been attacked in a very fair way . ”
The Real Victim So , the Republican Party , which built its recent political dominance on what Richard Nixon called the “ Southern Strategy ” and which just held a national convention filled with mocking references to Obama as a “ community organizer , ” is the real victim here .
Yet another reason to get angry .
Based on the reactions to Lewis ’s statement , it appears the McCain - Palin campaign takes no responsibility for the latest shout - outs about killing Obama and sees no connection between Palin ’s incendiary rhetoric that Obama “ pals around with terrorists ” and the violent anger that is bubbling out of right - wingers at the rallies .
The campaign slogan may be “ Country First , ” but the behavior often looks like “ Country Be Damned . ”
There seems to be no concern about what would happen to the United States if the angry victimhood of the McCain - Palin crowd , mixed with suggestions that Obama is a closet terrorist , might encourage some nut to take a shot at Obama .
Or even if the nation dodges that bullet , what would happen if the McCain - Palin campaign whips up enough racial resentment toward Obama to wrest some tainted victory away on Nov. 4 – sure to include some predictable GOP vote tampering and voter intimidation ?
What kind of bitterly divided nation would they preside over in 2009 ?
As angry as the Republicans are – though they ’ve held the White House for eight years and dominated the Congress from 1995 to 2007 – has anyone stopped to think that other Americans might get angry if it is perceived that the Republicans maintained their power through violence , racism or dirty tricks ?
Do the Republicans expect a repeat of Election 2000 – when they overrode Al Gore ’s victory in the national popular vote , dispatched rioters to Florida to disrupt the Miami recount and then had five Republican justices of the U.S. Supreme Court hand the White House to George W. Bush – while Democrats mostly sat by quietly ?
Millions of Americans rue the day that Bush was ushered into the White House as they look out over a wasteland of national opportunities squandered .
Instead of a vibrant economy , plentiful jobs , a robust stock market , a swelling budget surplus , a nation at relative peace and worldwide admiration – they see an economy in shambles , massive job losses , a stock market in free - fall , record deficits , two open - ended wars and global disdain .
If any group has a reason to be angry , it would be the plurality of Americans who voted for Al Gore and saw their collective judgment overturned by a partisan majority of the U.S. Supreme Court .
[ For details on how that happened , see our book , Neck Deep . ]
Votes Nullified
Many of those Americans not only had their vote effectively nullified – and their political judgment ignored – but they have suffered real economic damage .
Some are out of work while others are opening statements on their retirement funds this month to find they have lost much of their life savings .
Yet , these Americans have been relatively restrained .
They are n’t going to rallies and shouting death threats about the Republican ticket .
Nor are Barack Obama and Joe Biden whipping up crowds with accusations that their opponents are disloyal .
No , the anger is disproportionately among the Republicans .
McCain and Palin have turned their rallies – starting with the Republican National Convention through joint appearances this past week – into anti-Obama hate - fests , leading to taunts of “ terrorist , ” “ socialist , ” “ traitor ” – as well as racial epithets , the repeated invocation of his middle name “ Hussein , ” and suggestions on how to eliminate him .
The anger appears to be spilling over into events connected to other races .
At a Georgia Senate debate on Thursday , Republican partisans in the crowd booed the mention of Obama ’s name and a woman yelled out , “ Bomb Obama , ” the Associated Press reported .
McCain and Palin have stoked these fires with the inflammatory McCarthyistic tactic of exploiting Obama ’s tangential association with William Ayers , who four decades ago was part of a violent anti-Vietnam War group , the Weather Underground , but who has been living a constructive life since the mid-1970s as a college professor and expert on education policy .
Obama crossed paths with Ayers when the two were put on a board for the Chicago Annenberg Challenge , a program for educational excellence launched by the staunchly Republican ( and pro-McCain ) Annenberg family .
Though Obama ’s ties to Ayers appear to have been trivial ( he also hosted a tea for Obama ’s first state senate race ) , McCain and Palin have used what lawyers would call “ prejudicial ” evidence , playing up minor facts that are intended to inflame a jury .
In this case , the prejudicial quality is doubled by the fact that not only was Ayers a minor figure in Obama ’s early political career but that Ayers ’s violent behavior occurred a couple of decades earlier .
Obama , who was eight at the time and living in Hawaii , has denounced Ayers ’s involvement in anti-war bombings as “ despicable . ”
The Obama - Ayers guilt by association is almost as crazy as suggesting that Obama pals around with violent white racists because when Obama entered the U.S. Senate in 2005 he sought advice from Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia , who had been a member of the Ku Klux Klan as a young man .
McCain ’s Connections Similarly , one could go back through McCain ’s connections to radical right - wing groups during the 1980s when he listed himself as a supporter of the U.S. Council for World Freedom , which was affiliated with the World Anti-Communist League , a haven for neo -Nazis , racialists and “ death squad ” operatives .
Or there ’s Sarah Palin ’s links to the Alaska Independence Party , a group whose leader has denounced the United States and advocated secession from the Union .
Palin has spoken on behalf of the party , where her husband Todd was a member .
Indeed , those connections are more relevant than the Ayers ’s guilt - by - association tag – since they involved direct actions by the principals , not what some other person did in an earlier phase of his life .
Nevertheless , the McCain - Palin ticket has seized on Ayers as a central argument against Obama , using highly inflammatory words like “ terrorist ” and “ lie ” in a current TV ad .
The GOP campaign also has twisted an Obama comment about Afghan War strategy into a slur against American troops .
With this pattern , it is hard not to conclude that the McCain - Palin campaign is either willfully feeding red meat to its angry base as a political tactic or hoping to exacerbate doubts among white voters about an African - American candidate for President .
In either case , the American people might be more reasonably angry at John McCain and Sarah Palin for resorting to such ugly tactics and putting the nation at grave risk for their personal ambitions .

When you stash your cash away , you probably do n't give that much thought to the risks involved .
After all , it 's safe , liquid cash - not shares of Lehman Brothers .
But with financial hurricanes pounding the markets and your portfolio , you want to be sure the money you need in the next year or two is tucked away in a truly safe haven .
So which of your cash accounts meet this definition ?
Not as many as you once believed .
As it turns out , even money - market funds are n't as safe as you may have assumed .
But there has also been a scare in so - called cash alternatives , which are marketed to investors seeking slightly higher yields than traditional cash accounts provide .
Case in point : ultrashort bond funds .
These funds invest in debt securities with extremely short maturities , ranging from three months to a year .
This should put them just one notch higher on the risk scale than money funds , which hold securities with average maturities of 90 days or less .
Ultrashort bond funds , therefore , are designed to yield a bit more than money funds but with only a little extra risk .
At least that was the theory .
Not only has the average ultrashort bond fund lost about 5 % over the past year vs. a 2.6 % average gain for taxable money funds , but some portfolios have been outright disasters .
Toxic cash funds
Among the funds that have stumbled badly : Schwab YieldPlus has lost a staggering 33.7 % of its value over the past 12 months , while Fidelity Ultra - Short Bond fell 10.5 % .
Other hard - hit funds , including SSgA YieldPlus and Evergreen Ultra Short Opportunities , have been liquidated , and more are expected to close .
How is it possible that a bond fund that 's supposed to be like cash suddenly loses as much as a stock ?
In an effort to boost yields in this low - interest - rate environment , many of these portfolios invested in securities that were - you guessed it - backed by subprime mortgages .
And when the subprime market imploded last year , the funds began sinking into the red .
At that point investors fled , which only worsened the losses since managers were forced to sell toxic securities at fire - sale prices to come up with enough cash to meet redemptions .
" These failures really call into question the future of the ultrashort bond fund category , " says Morningstar analyst Miriam Sjoblom .
" Investors looking for stability really should look elsewhere . "
All of which may have you wondering where you can still find safety plus a decent yield - at least decent enough to outshine money funds and maintain your money 's purchasing power .
Here are a couple of options , with the lowest - risk choice described first .
Cash - alternative alternatives
Bank CDs and money - market accounts
For absolute safety , you can't beat the FDIC guarantees on CDs and money - market accounts managed by banks ( not to be confused with money funds run by mutual fund companies ) .
Even if your bank goes under , you 'll be covered for losses of up to $ 250,000 per person per financial institution .
And even though the Federal Reserve has started reducing short - term interest rates , you can still find attractive yields , says Greg McBride of Bankrate.com .
Stable - value funds
If you have a 401 ( k ) , you probably have a stable - value fund in your menu .
Recently yielding about 4 % on average , stable - value funds invest mainly in high - quality short - to intermediate - term bonds , which are guaranteed by insurers against loss , as well as interest - bearing contracts from insurance companies .
Are there any assurances these funds wo n't get burned by , say , mortgage securities ?
No , but the underlying investments are backed by insurers .
While that might give limited comfort in this financial melt - down , keep in mind that most stable - value funds invest not only in a diversified portfolio of debt but also in securities covered by several different insurers .
What 's more , many 401 ( k ) plans place trading restrictions on stable - value funds to prevent market timing .
You can leave the fund , but you may have to park that money in a stock fund for a few months before being allowed back in .
As a result , your fellow shareholders wo n't be able to create the same problems they did in ultrashort bond funds by forcing managers to sell at the worst possible time .
Stable - value funds have historically beaten intermediate government bond funds by more than two percentage points a year and intermediate bonds by half a point - and with far less risk , according to a study by the University of Pennsylvania 's Wharton School .
Of course , there 's no guarantee they 'll continue to do so .
But the study 's co-author David Babbel , professor emeritus of insurance and risk management at Wharton , says , " Stable - value funds are still the best bet for the fixed - income portion of your 401 ( k ) . "

Sept. 4 , 2008  --
A federal judge has sentenced one - time Washington power broker Jack Abramoff to an additional four years in prison and ordered him to pay $ 23 million in restitution for his role in an influence - peddling scandal that rocked the political scene in the nation 's capital .
Describing himself as " a broken man , " a despondent Abramoff , 49 , asked U.S. District Court Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle for a lenient sentence as his wife and children looked on .
" I 've fallen into an abyss , your honor , and I do n't quite know how to get out , " said the convicted lobbyist , who wept throughout the hearing .
" The pain for me and my family has been intense .
... I will recount this to the final days of my life . "
When he entered into a plea agreement to charges of fraud , bribery and tax evasion in January 2006 , Abramoff admitted that while he worked as a lobbyist , he received kickbacks , duped American Indian tribes in four states by charging exorbitant fees for his services to increase his profits and bribed public officials with decadent gifts , meals and trips .
At the hearing , victims from two of the tribes that Abramoff lobbied for said that he had defrauded their communities and ruined their tribes ' names .
In handing down the 48 - month sentence , Huvelle acknowledged Abramoff 's cooperation with the investigation , and the more than 350 letters of support filed with the court that painted him as a loving father who was involved in his community and generous with donations .
But she also called his crimes " very serious " and said his " conduct spanned many years ... and got much worse over time .
... This is necessary to act on respect for the law . "
He had faced a possible maximum of 11 years in prison .
Abramoff began serving a nearly six - year sentence stemming from a separate Florida conspiracy , fraud and tax evasion case involving the purchase of SunCruz casino boats in November 2006 .
He will serve today 's sentence concurrently with the sentence in the Florida matter , for a total of approximately six years behind bars .
He is currently housed at the federal prison in Cumberland , Md .
As part of the plea agreement on the Washington charges , Abramoff has provided vast information into political corruption , with guilty pleas coming from former Rep. Bob Ney , R - Ohio , former Interior Department Deputy Secretary J. Steven Griles and a host of other officials ranging from staffers to even the former deputy chief of staff of the Justice Department 's criminal division .
Once one of the most popular lobbyists in Washington 's notorious " Power Alley " of K Street and Pennsylvania Avenue , Abramoff wined and dined clients and Congress members at his now - defunct restaurant Signatures , which was across the street from the Justice Department , and was known for treating Congress members to extravagant trips , including one to a golf course in St. Andrew's , Scotland .
" It is hard to see the exact moment that I went over the line but , looking backwards , it is amazing for me to see how far I strayed and how I did not see it at the time , " Abramoff wrote in an e-mail letter to Huvelle , filed with the court Wednesday .
" So much of what happens in Washington stretches the envelope , skirts the spirit of the rules , and lives in the loopholes .
But even by those standards , I blundered farther than even those excesses would allow . "
" I see that my crimes all had the same cause -- my short - sighted and selfish view that the ends could justify the means , " Abramoff added .
" I am not a bad man ( although to read all the news articles one would think I was Osama bin Laden ) , but I did many bad things . "
Before the Justice Department 's criminal investigation into Abramoff 's lobbying activities , congressional investigators , led by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee chaired by Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , examined Abramoff and congressional aide Michael Scanlon 's dealing with the Choctaw Indian Tribe and its Washington lobbying efforts on gambling issues .
Abramoff and Scanlon bilked the tribes out of more than $ 19.5 million .
Scanlon entered a guilty plea to conspiracy charges in November 2005 , and is awaiting sentencing .
As part of his plea deal , Scanlon is cooperating with the government investigation and admitted that he and Abramoff , named as " Lobbyist A " in his case 's court documents , persuaded the tribes to pay them while never representing the tribes ' interests .
Abramoff recommended the tribes hire Scanlon 's public relations firm to provide support to their lobby efforts , but never told the tribes that he and Scanlon arranged to split their profits , a scheme they called , " Gimmie Five . "
E-mails between Abramoff and Scanlon were key to the Justice and congressional investigations .
In one exchange , Abramoff wrote to Scanlon , " We need to get some $ from those Monkeys !!!!... we 'll get the Choctaw money soon enough . "

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Federal Reserve added a combined total of $ 70 billion in temporary reserves to the banking system on Tuesday , as high stress gripped short term lending markets amid financial institutions ’ wariness of lending to each other .
After the operations , federal funds traded in the U.S. interbank market traded at 3.0 percent , above the 2 percent target rate the Federal Reserve sets .
The U.S. central bank said it was prepared to undertake operations later in the day , as necessary .
As the fallout from Lehman Brothers ’ collapse at the weekend continued to infect financial markets , the interest rate banks demanded for lending dollars overnight to other institutions ballooned to more than five times the U.S. Federal Reserve ’s 2 percent target rate .
London interbank offered rates ( Libor ) for overnight dollars as fixed by the British Bankers Association -- which trillions of dollars of derivative , financial and corporate contracts are referenced against -- soared to 6.43750 percent , the highest since January 2001 .
The New York Fed ’s combined $ 70 billion of temporary reserves added to the banking system so far Tuesday matched the combined amount added on Monday .
These daily totals are the biggest added since September 2001 , when the Fed moved to free up cash flowing to the financial system in the aftermath of the attacks on New York and Washington .
On Tuesday , the Fed added $ 50 billion of temporary reserves via an overnight repo , for which total bids submitted were $ 63.25 billion .
Then the U.S. central bank injected $ 20 billion via a 28 - day repo , for which total bids submitted were $ 68.20 billion .

Early on Tuesday the New York Fed , in a statement on its Web site , said in advance that it would arrange a big overnight repurchase agreement and was ready to arrange further operations later in the day as needed .
The Web site had also preadvised that “ in addition , at around 9:30 a.m. EDT the Desk will conduct its typical Tuesday morning $ 20 billion , 28 - day single - tranche repo , settling 1 - day forward . ”
Other global central banks also pumped vast amounts of extra funds into world financial markets for a second day on Tuesday in a concentrated effort to contain the fallout from the crisis sweeping Wall Street ’s biggest firms .
The European Central Bank injected 70 billion euros ( $ 98.09 billion ) into money markets on Tuesday , after 30 billion the day before .
In Britain , the Bank of England injected 20 billion pounds ( $ 35.21 billion ) , after five billion on Monday .
Demand was three times the amount of extra liquidity offered on Tuesday .

In Final Days Before Troy Davis Execution Date , Concerned Public Worldwide Demands Action
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - U.S. labor unions , having helped Barack Obama win the presidency , entertain high hopes he will enact their agenda to bolster their negotiating power with employers and increase their numbers after decades of decline .
Unions have “ an unprecedented amount of leverage ” after turning out white middle - class voters for Obama in battleground industrial states like Pennsylvania and Ohio that he won in Tuesday ’s election but had lost in the Democratic nominating primaries , said University of Illinois - Chicago labor expert Robert Bruno .
“ American workers won this election , ” said Anna Burger , chairman of the labor coalition “ Change to Win ” at a news conference this week in Washington .
“ The mandate has never been so overwhelming for a progressive economic agenda . ”
A cornerstone of labor ’s agenda is passage of the Employee Free Choice
Act that unions argue restores balance to its negotiations with employers , but is described as “ Armageddon ” by a leading business group .
Burger said she expected the measure and other parts of the unions ’ agenda to be addressed in the first 100 days of the Obama administration , which takes office on January 20 .
Other labor leaders sought to dampen the notion they were owed something by the incoming administration .
“ That is not the way Obama works , ” said Bill Samuel , legislative director of the AFL - CIO , America ’s biggest labor organization .
“ We are part of the conversation about the economy right now in a way that we were n’t when the Republicans were in charge ... we see the world in the same way ( as Democratic leaders ) , ” Samuel said .
BATTLE EXPECTED OVER LABOR LEGISLATION
A battle is shaping up in the U.S. Senate over the Employee Free Choice Act .
Its two major provisions would let prospective members sign union cards instead of waiting to hold secret ballot elections to unionize workers at a company , and call for a government arbitrator if a newly created union and the employer did not reach a contract within 120 days .
One - third of the time that a union succeeds in organizing a company ’s workers , it never reaches a contract with the employer , and the union often disbands at the company .
Both labor and business say passage of the law could mean unionization rates will soar .
Unions have arrested a decades - long decline and have roughly 13 million members , or just 7.5 percent of the nongovernmental work force .
That is down sharply from the mid-1950s when U.S. union membership reached 36 percent of the labor force .
Democrats Obama and Vice President - elect Joe Biden have both emphasized their support for the legislation .
Their Republican opponent , John McCain , called the measure “ a threat to democracy ” and warned it would hurt small business and erode workers ’ rights to vote in secret on joining a union .
Opponents say the law is unbalanced as written and will lead to workers being coerced into joining unions and permit arbitrators to undermine employers ’ control by setting wages , benefits and work rules .
“ This bill is Armageddon for the employer community , ” said Randy Johnson of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .
“ ( It ) can artificially drive up wages and create work rules that remove flexibility . ”
“ We ’ll have wage - led inflation for the first time ever in this country if this happens and I do n’t know if this economy can stand it , ” said William Adams , who helps employers plot strategy .
Adams said unions could make unreasonable demands then wait for the arbitrator to split the difference with the employer ’s offer .
Arbitrators can ignore outrageous demands , supporters say .
The act was introduced five years ago and won approval in the U.S. House of Representatives in March 2007 , but Republican opposition has prevented it from coming up for a vote in the Senate .
The big question is if backers will have the 60 or more Senate votes to end an expected Republican - led filibuster .
Democrats in Tuesday ’s election boosted their majority in the 100 - seat chamber to at least 57 , but trail in at least three undecided races .
Also on the union wish list is a proposed $ 100 billion infrastructure rebuilding program the Laborers ’ union said would create more than 1 million jobs .
Construction jobs have been particularly hard - hit in the current downturn , losing 657,000 jobs since the start of 2007 .
Overall , the U.S. economy has lost 1.2 million jobs this year -- many of them union jobs in autos and other industries -- including the 240,000 drop in October payrolls reported on Friday .
7 Barebones Rails Apps To Kick Start Your Development Process
Back in 2005 , the first Rails application a novice Rails developer produced was typically a simple blog - like system .
This was in no small part thanks to a great screencast produced by David Heinemeier Hansson demonstrating how to create such a system in 15 minutes .
Sadly , these screencasts have not been updated to 2008 standards , so sometimes it can be hard to figure out where to start .
Even for experienced developers , it can make sense to have a generic / base / bare - bones application from which to work .
Why deal with installing the same plugins over and over and laying down the same generic code ?
So , here are several barebones Rails apps that might provide a good base for your own template .
Bort
Bort ( Github repository ) is a very new ( first released this month ) barebones Rails app by Jim Neath , a British Rails developer .
It includes RESTful authentication , pagination ( using will_paginate ) , RSpec , Exception Notifier , an asset packager , a Capistrano recipe , and database - based sessions .
It 's fully Rails 2.1 compliant .
Bort E-mail Login Fork
A fork of Bort by Matt Hall that uses e-mail addresses for logins rather than usernames .
Expect to see a lot of customized forks of Bort over time - it could well catch on as the de-facto barebones / generic Rails application .
The Caboose Sample App
The Caboose Sample App was a big deal when it was unveiled in early 2007 , but does n't appear to have been updated since then .
It includes RESTful authentication , a user model with last login and timezones , full timezone support , attachment support ( through attachment_fu ) , basic views using Yahoo !
YUI CSS grids , RSpec tests , and exception notification .
There 's also a specially tailored version for SSL use .
Given its age , this might not be a solid starting point , but the code is well worth looking at .
Karmi's Rails I18N Demo App
Karel Minarik , a Czech Rails developer , has produced the " Rails I18N Demo App . "
It does what it says on the box and acts as a simple , minimal Rails application to demonstrate and test the new ( as of Rails 2.2 and edge ) Rails internationalization and localization APIs .
A good starting point if you want to see how to use I18N in Rails properly under the hood .
Karel also has a to - do list application that could act as inspiration .
Social Network Apps
LovdByLess
LovdByLess is an open source general social network Rails application .
It includes the usual social networking features , such as friending , messaging , profiles , commenting , user blogs , photo gallery , search , user dashboards , as well as Flickr and YouTube integration .
The presentation is very slick .
LovdByLess is offered under the MIT license , so reuse is hassle - free .
Insoshi
Insoshi bills itself as a " social networking platform " and is another open source social networking Rails app .
Like LovdByLess , it offers the usual gamut of social networking features such as profiles , activity feeds , forums , blogs , messaging , and so forth - along with an administration panel .
It 's made available under the GNU Affero GPL license , so any changes need to also be open source ( under the AGPL ) - this could make it unsuitable for commercial projects although an alternative license is forthcoming .
Community Engine Sample App
Community Engine is an open source Rails plugin that adds social network features to an existing Rails app .
Developer Bruno Bornsztein , however , has also developed a sample app that acts as a generic template for a fresh Community Engine driven app .
He 's also produced a tutorial demonstrating how it works and was put together .

Most people have been on the receiving end of an animal 's animosity at one time or another .
Some of these encounters are relatively harmless , like a bug bite , but other animal meetings can be painful or even deadly .
We 've all heard stories of violent bear maulings and gruesome shark attacks , but other animals strike in a much stealthier way with the help of potent toxins .
There are actually two kinds of toxic animals : poisonous and venomous creatures .
While the two terms are often used interchangeably , in the scientific realm , they have different meanings .
The difference lies in the way the animal transfers its toxins .
Whereas poison is transmitted passively through ingestion or absorption , venom is actively injected .
As a general rule , poison is used primarily for defensive purposes ( by prey ) , and venom is used for offensive purposes ( by predators ) .
In addition , most venomous animals can produce their own deadly concoction , whereas poisonous creatures usually acquire their toxicity through their diet .

A poisonous animal can only transfer its toxins if another animal comes into physical contact with it or eats it ( a sort of posthumous revenge ) .
Poison dart frogs , for instance , secrete a toxic substance from their skin which is potentially fatal to predators that venture too close .
Venomous animals , on the other hand , have a device to actively deliver their lethal cocktail .
For example , snakes and spiders have fangs , wasps use stingers and scorpions strike with their tails .
In this article , we 're not interested in those poisonous creatures that just wait around for something exciting to happen ; we 're focused on the venom - producing go - getters .
Some venomous animals are well known -- black widows , rattlesnakes and fire ants all come to mind ; others tend to lead a more private life .
In fact , one of the world 's most venomous animals is one you may never even see -- even if it bites you on the nose .
Actually , in the case of this particular animal , " bite " is n't quite the right word ; the more appropriate term is " sting . "
Many are awaiting the Watchmen movie to finally come out and some are showing their love by wonderful Lego tributes .
This great Nite Owlship replica from the Watchmen movie is a great example of a great fan that decided to make his own Watchmen movie lego art .
The link below goes into further explanation of the different angles , features and insides of the actual Watchmen Nite Owlship product .
It is a great remake and design piece that proves fans are very creative artists themselves .
We have seen other great remakes and Lego designs by fans , such as the Lego Radiohead Video for House of Cards , the Funny Nintendo Scenes , and the Lego Mindstorms which combine a robot in order to solve the Rubix cube .
Props to the artist and fan !

In my life I have never seen anything like this !
My niece got married today .
The Wedding festivities ended at midnight .
On my way home on the opposite side of the # 60 freeway going into Downtown L. A .
I see very large trucks w / flashing lights – about 25 to 30 – lined up to form a single - file line for cars to follow to be stopped by at least 2 dozen police !
This is on a 5 - lane freeway , mind you !
Thousands of cars and thousands of unsuspecting people are experiencing for the first time in their lives , the full impact of what a police state is all about this morning , folks !
The freeway looks like a parking lot !
As I transitioned to the northbound Golden State Frwy , aka the # 5 Freeway , which starts at the Canadian border and runs through Washington State , through Oregon and all the way through California to the Mexican border , just before I get to downtown L. A. on my side of the freeway I see the same thing in the distance .
Again , lots of trucks w / flashing lights and tons of cars stopping ahead of me to be herded to the checkpoint .
So , I quickly and fortunately got off at the very next offramp and tried to get on , again , further up the road .
However , there were several arrows on the streets for people to follow – seemingly to take you on a detour to another on ramp – but , no ; they only led to more check points !
Because I know my city like the back of my hand , I managed to evade the check points by going through neighborhood streets until I could finally get back onto the freeway some distance beyond the checkpoint .
I live in Burbank and I could n’t get onto the northbound Golden State Frwy until I passed Griffith park which is about 3 to 4 miles beyond where the check point started on the freeway on my side ( about 6 to 7 miles from where I first noticed the check point on the opposite side of the freeway ! )
Every single one of those 3 to 4 miles on my side had cars w/ mulitple passengers in them and the cars were at a complete stop waiting for their turn to be chuted in like cattle to be asked for their papers (? ) and to be questioned by the cops ( for possible DUI ? ) .
I would say , there were , at least , 3 to 4 and maybe even 5 thousand cars , approximately , on both sides of the checkpoints waiting to get through the .
Unbelievable !!
Never in my 61 years have I ever seen anything like this before !!
I saw at least 25 tow trucks pulling vehicles away from the check point areas .
I ’m very much in shock and very fortunate to know my way around my city to have avoided what is still going on as I type this message .
I had such a wonderful day only to be knocked back to the ugly reality of what is happening to us in our country , Martial Law !
IT ’S SCARY OUT THERE !!

Pictured : Rascal , the spaniel who got too close to a paper shredder
Call it an ear miss : Rascal the spaniel , with owner Jackie Wells .
He lost part of one ear after it got tangled in a paper shredder
Curiosity may have killed the cat - but Rascal 's story shows it does n't do the dog much good either .
The springer spaniel needed emergency surgery after peering into a paper shredder and setting it off .
The machine 's metal jaws bit into the 11 - month - old puppy 's ear and dragged it in , shredding it like a sheet of paper .
Rascal 's horrified owner Jackie Wells managed to switch off the power supply , but not before more than an inch of the dog 's right ear had been chewed up .
Mrs Wells , 49 , an exam invigilator , from St Albans , Hertfordshire , was shredding bills at home when the accident happened .
She said : '
To my horror the machine latched on to his ear and began to grind .
' The shredder has a sensor that switches it on whenever something , usually paper , hovers above it .
There must have been a fault with the safety device .
As soon as I saw Rascal was stuck I immediately disconnected the machine and called the vet .
' I could n't believe it , the poor little devil . '
With the help of her son Robert , 25 , a commercial pilot , Mrs Wells rushed the dog to the vet with the shredder still attached .
Lucky escape : Rascal recovering at home
Rascal was given local anaesthetic and painkillers before the vet , Leonard Cooper , could untangle the shredder from his ear .
Mr Cooper , from the Cayton Veterinary Surgery in nearby Smallford , removed the teeth from the electric motor , which enabled him to manually reverse the blades .
However , there was no choice but to amputate part of Rascal 's ear .
Mr Cooper said : ' It was hard to get the ear out , it was held tightly in place .
Mangled :
The floppy ear after it was caught in the shredder
' It was a bit gory .
The flesh to the ear had , as you would imagine , been cut into tiny strips , just as if it was paper .
Fortunately , no harm has been caused to Rascal 's hearing and once the hair on his ear has re-grown his ears may be a little lopsided but the injury should n't be visible . '
Mrs Wells said yesterday that Rascal was bandaged but making a good recovery at home .
Before :
The spaniel prior to the accident
She said : ' He really does live up to his name .
He 's a nutter , but an adorable dog with a lovely nature .
' He was in shock , but seems unfazed now . '
Suffering : Rascal is given pain relief while he waits to be freed
Recovering :
The distraught dog was rushed to the vet - with the shredder still attached
Shredder :
Its vicious metal jaws caught the tip of Rascal 's hairy ear , sucking it between its teeth
If you were somehow bothered by the previous post of dancing squirrels than maybe you 'll be one of the sick weirdos that would love these earings made of their feet .
As a related note , you may be interested in these equally disturbing custom squirrel taxidermy projects .

From the lips of unofficial GOP spokesperson Bill Kristol , we get Sarah Palin ruminating on Jeremiah Wright :
" To tell you the truth , Bill , I do n't know why that association is n't discussed more , because those were appalling things that that pastor had said about our great country , and to have sat in the pews for 20 years and listened to that -- with , I do n't know , a sense of condoning it , I guess , because he did n't get up and leave -- to me , that does say something about character .
But , you know , I guess that would be a John McCain call on whether he wants to bring that up . "
Call me crazy , or overly optimistic , but I do n't think Wright can save these fools .
Racism is a luxury that , at this point , a lot of white voters can ill - afford .
I think a crucial number of them know that .
Furthermore , I really , really , really doubt Palin wants to get into a game of who has the nuttier religious connections .
The Metropolitan police is to boycott the home secretary 's plan to arm 10,000 frontline officers with Taser stun guns because of their potential to cause fear and damage public confidence .
The Metropolitan Police Authority said yesterday it had no intention of immediately taking up Jacqui Smith 's offer to sanction an increase in the availability of Tasers .
" We recognise the potential to cause fear and damage public confidence if the use of Tasers is extended to non-specialist trained police officers and is perceived by the public to be indiscriminate , " the MPA said .
" There is no doubt that in some circumstances Tasers are a very effective alternative to firearms or asps [ metal batons ] but their use must be tightly controlled and we have seen no case made out to extend their availability . "
The home secretary defended her decision to make the weapons available to officers , saying she wanted to give them the tools they need to confront dangerous people .
" I 'm proud that we have one of the few police services ... that does not regularly carry firearms .
But every day the police put themselves in danger to protect us , the public , " she said .
The decision follows a 12 - month trial in the use of the 50,000 - volt weapons involving specially trained officers in 10 forces .
The stun guns were deployed on 600 occasions during the trial but were discharged only 93 times as officers found their threatened use was sufficient to resolve difficult situations .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission said 35 complaints had been made against the use of Tasers since they were introduced in 2004 for use by firearms officers in the UK .
The IPCC added that it backed the extension of the use of Tasers .
A new round of state polls from a faculty at “ Big Ten ” universities shows significant movement and now solid leads for Obama in key states including Pennsylvania , Ohio and Indiana :
Those states were key battlegrounds in the 2004 election , and last month the Big Ten Battleground Poll showed a tight race in all of those states but Illinois , which Obama represents in the U.S. Senate .
The first poll was taken just as the U.S. financial crisis first intensified and before the massive decline in the stock market , when McCain was enjoying his highest poll numbers of the campaign in the Big Ten and nationally .
“ In September , we saw virtually the entire Big Ten as a battleground , ” said Franklin , co-developer of Pollster.com .
“ Now Obama is clearly winning the Big Ten battleground .
The dominance of the economy as a top issue for voters is the overwhelming story . ”
The new Big Ten poll shows Obama ahead in every Big Ten state , including Indiana , where McCain held a slight edge in September , and Ohio and Pennsylvania , where last month ’s poll results showed the two candidates in a dead heat .
MSNBC : Bush creating ' embryonic police state ' Nick Langewis and David Edwards
Published : Tuesday August 19 , 2008
Print This Email This " Now that the Democrats were nice enough to fold up on FISA , " MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann said , " the issue is all contained now .
Right ?
Not exactly . "
The Justice Department has proposed changes to police intelligence - gathering rules that would ease the transfer of information about citizens to federal intelligence agencies , who would then keep the information for at least 10 years .
The changes , the first since 1993 , were introduced for public comment on July 31 .
Under the proposed changes , law enforcement agencies would be allowed to target groups and individuals on the basis of suspicion of participation in terrorist acts or providing material support to terrorists .
Former FBI agent and American Civil Liberties Union policy counsel Michael German , however , told the Washington Post that the proposed changes could lead to abuse of constitutional rights by law enforcement agencies , citing cases where police have eavesdropped on political dissenters and infiltrated their ranks .
" It turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government , " German said .
" If police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the CIA , they will be encouraged to collect more information . "
The real intent of the changes , Olbermann opined , is to implement them before President Bush leaves office " so the next president can't do a damn thing about unraveling this disaster , which is , appropriately enough , an embryonic police state . "
On Monday , the Senate Judiciary Committee called on Attorney General Michael Mukasey to delay the implementation of the new guidelines , which would take effect October 1 , until FBI Director Robert Mueller has a chance to testify to the Committee on September 17 .
" Efforts to harmonize the rules governing criminal and national security matters also raise potential civil liberties concerns , " said Committee chairman Sen.
Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) and Ranking Member Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) in a letter to Mukasey , " given the broader latitude currently given to investigators to consider race and ethnicity in national security matters . "

Working out is tough .
So why not skip the exercise and pop a few endurance - boosting pills ?
That dream , cherished by millions of sedentary couch potatoes , just got a little bit closer .
Today , researchers are reporting that an experimental drug can mimic the results of an exercise regimen – with no exercise required .
After four weeks of taking the pill , mice who had n't worked out displayed a 44 percent increase in their running endurance .
" It ’s tricking the muscle into ‘ believing ’ it ’s been exercised daily , " said the study 's lead researcher , Ronald Evans of the Salk Institute , in a release .
" It ’s basically the couch potato experiment , and it proves you can have a pharmacologic equivalent to exercise . "
Human muscle enhancement has already shown considerable success .
Steroids easily facilitate the creation of bulky muscles .
But that type of muscle - building does n't necessarily help you run a 10 k , and endurance - based exercise tends to yield more health benefits than strength training .
If drugs like this work in humans , it could prove a boon to an aging and increasingly overweight American population .
But not all researchers are convinced that " exercise in a pill " is actually possible .
" Physical activity is so important for maintaining the health of the human body in almost every human organ system , " said Darrell Neufer , a professor of sports medicine specializing in cellular energy systems at
East Carolina University .
" It 's going to be nearly impossible to create a pill that will mimic all the benefits that exercise has . "
Neufer cited a 2000 paper by BYU and Washington University scientists that , he said , showed the drug the Salk Institute scientists used " does not fully mimic the adaptive response to exercise . "
Until this study , only high doses of resveratol , a possible anti-aging drug and metabolic enhancer , had shown promise increasing endurance by enhancing mitochondrial function .
But resveratol works by stimulating an entirely different set of proteins and could have a wider range of effects , for good or ill .
The new work , which appears today in the journal Cell , tries to tackle the cellular energy problem that we call fatigue directly , by activating the enzyme AMPK with a long - known drug called AICAR .
Scientists believe that AMPK is an important regulator of the cell 's metabolism .
In that energy system , ATP is used to power cellular action , such as the muscle contractions associated with running .
In the process , ATP
breaks down into another substance called AMP .
As that happens ,
British researchers have shown that AMPK acts to crank up ATP production .
The drug , AICAR , mimics AMP , effectively tricking the body into thinking that it needs more energy and to begin producing more ATP – making more energy available for cellular action .
In other words , if ATP is the " molecular currency " of cellular energy transfer , AMPK is the mint that can print more money , and the drug is a kind of forged note from the Treasury Secretary ordering the mint to begin printing more bills .
Neufer , however , questioned the novelty of the research around AICAR , saying that the compound has long been linked to the creation of mitochondria – cells ' engines – which , in turn , create more ATP .
" The bottom line is that the main finding is not a particularly new finding , " Neufer said .
" I 'm surprised that this got into such a high - profile journal . "
Still , the molecules Evans is studying have athletic authorities worried because they appear to increase endurance among trained athletes .
In the same Cell paper , the researchers showed that , using a separate drug , they could increase the levels of a protein called PPAR - delta , which resulted in a
68 percent endurance gain for exercise - trained mice .
Evans is already working with the World Anti-Doping Agency to find a way to test for this new kind of doping .
It wo n't be ready by this year 's summer Olympics , but the test could be ready in time to retroactively test the blood samples from athletes who compete in the 2008 games .
Neufer agreed that human athletes need to be cautious about trying to obtain pharmacological help .
" Right now you have no way to target the drug to specific cell types .
By giving Aicar systemically , you'd be activating the signaling pathway in every cell of the body , " he said .
" Without knowing what impacts that might have that would be a dangerous thing to do . "

The combination of a fuel - sipping diesel engine with plug - in hybrid technology is something that has n't really been utilized — until now .
This is the Volkswagen Golf Twin Drive Concept , and it looks even more promising than VW 's late Golf TDI Hybrid from Geneva .
Evidently , the Twin Drive can be run in electric - only mode for a range of up to 30 miles using an 82 HP electric motor .
But , there 's also a 2.0 - liter turbo - diesel that makes 122 HP which can take over once the batteries have been drained .
When the two powerplants combine , you become Captain Planet have a parallel hybrid with about 174 HP .
The range is aided even further by regenerative braking to charge the batteries , and start - stop technology that shuts the engine off when idling in traffic .
But is all of this just a techno ' showcase ?
Or will it actually be made available for normal people to save fuel with ?

Well , Volkswagen will work with the German government in experimenting with a fleet of 20 Twin Drive Golfs in 2010 .
Though evidently the Twin Drive just is n't green enough as is , so to further reduce emissions , the electrical energy required to charge the batteries of the experimental fleet will be generated from green resources such as windmills and hydro- electric dams .
Of course , there are no plans for US export , or for any production at all at this point .
But even though we 're more easily excited about speed than with being green , we would totally rock one of these as a daily driver .

‘ TROOPERGATE ’ HEATS UP ….
I ’m not sure why Sarah Palin ’s “ Troopergate ” scandal is n’t getting more play right now .
The still largely unknown Republican VP nominee is in the midst of a fairly serious ethics controversy , and after giving her word to cooperate as part of a transparent process , Palin and her team are acting like they have a lot to hide .
Usually , for the national media , this would be like waving red meat in front of a hungry dog .
Newsweek reports that Ed O’Callaghan , a former U.S. Attorney dispatched to Alaska by the McCain campaign , is actively trying to shut the investigation down .
The AP reports that Alaska ’s Republican state attorney general is blocking state employees from honoring legislative subpoenas , and explained yesterday that the officials are refusing to testify as part of the investigation .
TPM ’s Zachary Roth reports that Alaskan Republicans have enlisted out - of - state , right - wing lawyers to file suit , hoping to halt the investigation .
As we talked about yesterday , Palin is now refusing to cooperate with the investigation she ’d vowed to cooperate with , and is claiming executive privilege to shield her gubernatorial emails from scrutiny from investigators .
And even conservative Alaskans are surprised by the new - found , McCain - driven efforts to destroy Walt Monegan ’s reputation .
You really ca n’t experience the full effect of Monday ’s news conference featuring Palin spokeswoman Meghan Stapleton unless you hear it for yourself .
Stapleton passionately attacked former Commissioner of Public Safety Walt Monegan .
Her rhetoric was plain , desperate , and obvious .
Her tone , pure shrill .
With intensity , urgency , and alarm in her voice , Stapleton described Monegan ’s behavior as commissioner as egregious insubordination , full of obstructionist conduct and a brazen refusal to follow instructions .
Did Walt Monegan , former Marine , and lifetime crime fighter deserve this ?
Of course not .
But history has proven , get in the way of Sarah Barracuda ’s political ambition , and you wo n’t know what hit you .
In a reasonable political environment , these circumstances would create a genuine feeding frenzy .
We have an ethics scandal , involving a candidate for national office who appears to have lied , and who keeps changing her story .
We have promises of cooperation , followed by complete and total obduracy .
We have powerful Republicans converging to shut down a legitimate investigation .
We have , in other words , a serious political scandal , which a presidential campaign is doing its best to obstruct .
Where ’s the outrage ?
Alaska Report
A new chapter in the Troopergate scandal ; it seems that Alaska .
Rep. Gara’s , is calling on the State ’s Attorney General to appoint an independent investigator to look into possible criminal witness tampering by McCain - Palin campaign staff .
Prompted by the Director of the State Troopers , Colonel Audie Holloway ; who feels that there was potential witness tampering , he warrants the matter to be “ serious . ”
Alaska Report has the full details .
Over the past two months McCain - Palin campaign staff tried to stop the Alaska legislature ’s bi-partisan Troopergate investigation , which recently concluded with a report that that state ’s ethics law was broken .
See Michael Isakoff , Newsweek , “ Can He Stop Troopergate ? ” ( Sept. 16 , 2008 ) .
“ Until Senator McCain sent campaign staff up here on August 29 , everyone , including the Governor , agreed the Legislature ’s investigation was proper .
After the McCain staffers arrived , people who were willing to testify starting violating their subpoenas .
It ’s not rocket science that someone worked to change their minds , and that ’s a crime under Alaska law , ” said Rep. Gara .
The legislative investigation was initiated by a bi-partisan committee of 8 Republicans and 4 Democrats in July , before Governor Palin was named to the McCain ticket .
On October 10 that committee voted unanimously to release the independent investigator ’s report finding one ethics violation , and finding that the Attorney General had improperly withheld documents .
Alaska ’s witness tampering law makes it a crime to “ attempt ” to “ induce ” a person not to show up for a legislative subpoena .
See statutes below .
Approximately 10 witnesses failed to show for subpoenas during the Legislature ’s investigation into whether Governor Palin or her staff acted improperly in seeking the firing of her former brother - in - law , a State Trooper .
After failing to cooperate with subpoenas , these witnesses have since provided written statements .
Starting on August 29 the McCain campaign tried to create public pressure to stop the investigation with near - daily press conferences , and participated in unsuccessful legal efforts to try to stop the investigation .
Alaska ’s witness tampering statutes follow : Alaska Statute 11.56.545 – “ ( a ) Tampering with a witness in the second degree : A person commits the crime of tampering with a witness in the second degree if the person knowingly induces or attempts to induce a witness to be absent from an official proceeding , other than a judicial proceeding , to which the witness has been summoned .
( b ) Tampering with a witness in the second degree is a class A misdemeanor .
( Emphasis added ) .
AS 11.56.540 has similar elements , and is a felony .
I ’m glad to see they are getting vocal on this issue .
All the witnesses agreed to testify and then all of a sudden they refused .
How stupid does the McCain Campaign think the Alaskans are ?
They send up a whole staff to Alaska to run affairs for the Alaskan government , what is to stop them from applying pressure to witnesses , whose testimony could potentially be damning .
Absolutely nothing !
Update : Attorney general Colberg has written Gara back , suggesting he bring his concerns to the state personnel board investigator now looking into complaints against the governor .
“ Expanding the scope of the personnel board investigation would accomplish your goal of assuring that the allegations are taken seriously , and it would eliminate the potential for any perceived investigative conflict between the Department of Law and another entity , ” the attorney general wrote .
Here ’s Colberg ’s letter .
McCain - Palin campaign spokeswoman Meg Stapleton sent out this response to Gara ’s call for an investigator : “ This is yet another political stunt from Representative Les Gara , a Democratic Alaska state legislator who has been working with the Obama campaign since last year .
Rep .
Gara ’s previous hijinks include sending a letter to the Alaska State Troopers making a similar baseless accusation , and engaging in a sidewalk ambush in front of television cameras and reporters .
Decisions on how to respond to subpoenas in the Legislative Council ’s inquiry were made by individual witnesses and their attorneys .
No one from the McCain campaign provided advice to witnesses on how to respond to subpoenas .
Consistent with other efforts of Obama supporters nationwide to try to squelch legitimate political debate with baseless threats of criminal investigations of those who dare to take opposing positions , Rep. Les Gara has reverted to these tactics in Alaska once again .
Law enforcement ’s purpose is to protect the public , not to serve a political agenda . ”

Click to view Nintendo does n't exactly advertise it , but the remotes for the Wii gaming console — including the balance board that comes with Wii Fit — have Bluetooth capabilities .
That means you can connect your Wii peripherals to your computer to operate the media center hooked up to your TV , play emulated games with a Nunchuk , Classic Controller , or even a Balance Board , and pretty much have them do anything you can do with a keyboard .
Let 's walk through linking up your Wii peripherals and putting them in control of your Mac , PC , or Linux box .
To give you an idea of what you can do with a Wii / PC hook - up , here 's a look at one neat example : Controlling Windows Media Center from a distance , without having to shell out for a separate remote control .
Click to view
Do want ?
Let 's get it set up .

Setting up Bluetooth in Windows
The first thing to do is ensure your computer or laptop has Bluetooth capabilities — if you do n't see a Bluetooth icon in Windows ' Control Panel , chances are it does n't .
If you still want to get in , you can often get a USB - connected Bluetooth dongle for very little cash ( $ 5 and up ) .
If you do have a Bluetooth receiver , make sure you 're upgraded to the latest drivers — use Windows Update or check with your computer manufacturers ' web site .
Mac OS X and Linux users , you wo n't be using the same hook - ups or software , but we 'll suggest some software that works similarly a bit further along .
Now to hook up your devices .
We 'll start with the basic Wii remote , or " Wiimote . "
There 's only one way of doing it , but there are varying numbers of steps , depending on your software .
If you 've got software that can automatically seek out and hook up Bluetooth devices , start it up , hit 1 & 2 on the Wiimote , and you 'll connect .
If not , I recommend downloading a trial copy of BlueSoleil .
The unregistered trial limits you to 2MB of file transfer between devices and the computer , but when you 're just sending clicks and movements , that 's a good amount of time — I have n't run out after a week 's trial , so it might be 2 MB per session .
The unlocked copy is about $ 30 U.S. ( 19.95 in Euros ) .
You can also make due with Windows Vista 's built - in Bluetooth software .
Here 's how you 'll have to set up your device each time :

Open up Windows '
Bluetooth controls by right - clicking on a system tray icon or searching for it from the Start menu .
Choose " Add " from the " Devices " tab .
Hit the checkbox in the dialog that pops up saying your device is ready to be found .
Before going further , hit the 1 & 2 buttons near the bottom of your remote .
You 'll have to either hold them down or hit them every 10 seconds or so until your remote is found .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Once Windows finds your controller , named something like RVL - CNT - 01 , double - click its icon to select it .
Advertisement
Choose the " No passkey " option on the next screen , hit the Next button , and keep holding or re-clicking until Windows says your device is installed and ready .
The problem with this method is that you 'll have to perform this " installation " each time you want to pair your Wiimote .
If you 've got the BlueSoleil software installed , it 's much simpler — check out this how - to from WiiLi.org for screen - by - screen instructions on pairing your Wiimote .

Setting up GlovePIE
Programmer Carl Kenner designed his GlovePIE app to manipulate his computer using a virtual reality glove , but it 's expanded to take input from a whole bunch of devices , including Wii gear , and translate it into mouse and keyboard actions .
To get started , download the latest version of GlovePIE from Kenner 's site .
Unzip the GlovePIE folder out of the package , place it somewhere accessible ( like the Program Files folder ) , make a shortcut to the GlovePIE application and run it .
You 'll see a white screen at first , with tabs for " Untitled " ( the name of your script right now ) , GUI , and Variables .
Click on " GUI " and let 's get started .
You 'll see two buttons near the top : Detect Output to Emulate , and Detect Input .
Hit the " Output " key on the left , then click the left mouse button again ; it'll catch your movement and highlight a " LeftButton " item .
Click " Detect Input , " then click the " A " button on your Wiimote .
It should catch the click and show that you 've hit the " A " button on " Wiimote 1 . "
Advertisement
Advertisement
If it does n't , head to the " TroubleShooter " menu in the upper right , check the " Bluetooth Fix " option , and try again .
If you 're still not catching Wiimote signals , try re-pairing your device .
Once you 've got the mouse click and " A " button entered , hit " Apply , " and feel free to try out a few more combinations — your arrow keys to the Wii 's directional pad , the " Home " button to the Windows key , or whatever else .
Now head back to the " Untitled " tab , and see the small script you 've created simply by matching up key presses to Wii actions .
Hit the " Run " button on GlovePIE , and your script starts working .
Hit " Stop , " and the mouse and keys take over .
Advertisement
GlovePIE can also catch input from an attached Nunchuk or Classic Controller .
More importantly , though , it can sense movements in both the controller alone ( velocity movement ) and from a sensor bar .
That 's right — you can turn on your Wii and move the mouse using its sensor bar , or you can convert or build your own .
It 's not as hard as it might sound , given that the Wii's " sensor bar " is actually just a few strategically spaced LED lights in a plastic shell .
Instructables has a few tutorials for DIY bars , as does MAKE magazine .
You can even make your Wii sensor bar wireless with $ 8 in parts and no soldering required .
Luckily , GlovePIE enthusiasts have made a wealth of scripts available for some pretty clever Wiimote uses .
A Google search might turn up one for a specific app you 'd like to control from afar , but the gracious folks at the Wii Linux wiki have made a wealth of great ones available .
To use one , just copy its code , paste it into GlovePIE , then save it from the File menu .
Here 's a few notable scripts to pique your interest :
Advertisement
What about the Balance Board ?
Advertisement
Making the Balance Board control your computer is almost exactly the same process as with the Wiimote .
You use the same Bluetooth software and setup , but where you'd hit the 1 and 2 buttons on the Wiimote to make it discoverable , you 'll be hitting the tiny syncing nub inside the battery cover on the bottom of the Balance Board ( pictured at right ) .
Hitting it once should give you enough time to finish the sync in Vista ( or OS X or Linux ) , but you can hit it a few times to keep it going .
Once you 're synced up , you can plug in scripts that use the balance board as gas pedals ( as demonstrated by a Need for Speed fan ) , or surf the web with your feet using Firefox .
There are n't a ton of great scripts for the complex device right now , but I would n't bet against seeing some soon — two German programmers , for example , have already found a way to surf Google Earth using their board .
Mac and Linux users
GlovePIE is n't available for Mac or Linux systems , although there 's an open - source version getting attention .
Luckily , there 's more than one program that can map your Wii peripherals to input actions , and hooking up Bluetooth gear to Mac and Linux systems is likely easier than in Windows .
Here are your best bets : Mac OS X : Syncing your Wiimote to OS X ( 10.4 and higher ) is a simple matter of activating your Mac 's Bluetooth scanner , hitting the 1 and 2 buttons , and waiting for the link to be made .
Advertisement
Of all the apps that handle Wiimote input for a Mac , Remote Buddy has the most user - friendly interface for use and programming , but it 's proprietary , paid software ( 19.99 in Euros ) .
The free GlovePIE equivalent is DarwiinRemote , which features similar button - to - action mapping and support for sensor bar movement .
Linux :
Advertisement
Many modern distributions carry their own preferred Wii-interfacing tools in their repositories .
Ubuntu , for example , offers the command line tool Wminput , amongst others .
I used Wminput and this guide to control the Elisa media center with a Wiimote , and it worked flawlessly — though it obviously required some terminal work .
Wminput is actually a re-packaging of the Cwiid project , the closest GlovePIE equivalent for Linux , offering a GUI for mapping controls , a testing panel , and open - ended functionality .
The Ubuntu Forums have a good walk - through of setting up Cwiid on your system ; do a little searching , and you 'll likely find one for your own distro .
Your turn
It 's easy to get started creating , combining , and modifying existing Wii - PC scripts to use the Wii's wireless devices for all kinds of neat / lazy purposes .
What kind of control scripts have you found or made on your own ?
What clever uses can you find for the Wiimote and other peripherals on any platform ?

Are Central Banks the Most Efficient State Enterprise ?
Hummel 's Answer and My Explanation By Bryan Caplan
Two weeks ago , I relayed the following story :
Yesterday at the FEE seminar , I got to hear the excellent Jeff Hummel thoroughly debunk the crazy Rothbardian view that fractional reserve banking is “ fraudulent . ”
It was a fun ( and funny ) lecture , but the target was too easy .
So during the Q&A period , I decided to see whether Hummel would embrace a far greater heresy .
My challenge for him :
Agree or disagree :
In developed countries during the last 10 - 15 years , central banks have become ( close to ) the most efficient state enterprise .
Now you can hear Jeff ’s response ( as well as the full lecture ) :
Although he favors the abolition of central banking , his answer to my question is basically Yes .
And I agree on both counts .
Another rough patch may be coming , but it would be hard to improve over the 2 - 3 % inflation combined with stable output and employment that central banks delivered in the 90s and 00s .
But why have central banks have out - performed other state - owned enterprises ?
My best guesses :
1 . The public exaggerates the harm of inflation , and angrily punishes incumbents who allow inflation to spike .
Normally , such exaggeration encourages politicians to inefficiently make large sacrifices for small gains .
Luckily , though , low inflation turns out to be , in the long - run , a free lunch .
The public ’s inflation paranoia conveniently drives politicians to accept this free lunch .
2 . The people who run central banks are usually economists .
Whatever their problems , economists are – compared to other government officials – unusually likely to adopt economically efficient policies if you give them a chance .
So contrary to Rothbard ’s populist complaints , giving independence to central bankers has relatively good results .

A growing number of British couples are undergoing procedures at clinics overseas to determine the gender of their babies .
However , as the BBC's Colette McBeth reports , this service is often offered illegally .
Like many a story , it started out with a simple conversation with a friend .
Is that really possible ?
I remember asking , before going straight home to my laptop and typing the words " gender selection " in the search engine .
My friend had told me she knew of someone who was going abroad to have a daughter through IVF .
The woman in question had two boys , both conceived naturally , but had a burning desire for a girl and did n't want to leave anything to chance .
Once on the internet , I was amazed to learn how many women not only wanted the same but felt so strongly about it .
I found whole websites devoted to discussion about where gender selection was legal ( not the UK or most of Europe ) and the cost of treatment ( anything from £ 7,000 to £ 17,000 ) .
Many patients who were planning to go abroad were completely confused as to where it was legal and where it was n't
UK couples ' choosing baby gender '
Women who had four boys but could n't rest until they had a daughter , or three girls and desperately wanted a son .
And this was n't a cultural thing .
If anything , girls won over boys .
It is possible to almost guarantee the sex of a baby using IVF and a type of embryos screening called Pre-Implantation Genetic Diagnosis ( PGD ) .
In most countries , though , PGD is used only for medical reasons .
So if there is a genetic disease which runs in boys , couples would be allowed to have PGD to implant only female embryos .
Website advert Some countries , such as the US and Russia , do allow sex selection - but I quickly realised there was a problem with all of this .
Many patients who were planning to go abroad were completely confused as to where it was legal and where it was n't .
And some clinics seemed to be profiting out of the confusion .
One such clinic is the Jinemed Center in Istanbul .
It has a slick website and boasts the claim " life begins with us " .
It was also advertising on a gender selection website .
You could even plan a fortnight 's break in the sun , tell your friends you 're taking the family on holiday and go for IVF / PGD .
The only problem with all of that is that gender selection is illegal in Turkey .
No matter , I found many posts in which women said they'd had treatment there or had been told it was possible .
And it happened two Jinemed representatives were coming to London for the weekend to see prospective patients .
Secret filming
So one Sunday a few weeks ago I went along to a dental practice in Shepherds Bush in London where the Jinemed had hired a room .
I took a small handbag which in itself was fairly normal except this one contained a hidden camera .
We ( my husband accompanied me ) waited an hour to be seen .
The doctor and nurse had been rushed off their feet , it seemed .
Putting three embryos back in a young woman is really bad practice because of the high risk of multiple pregnancy
Professor Peter Braude
Kings College London
Two days of back - to - back appointments - and 50 % of those couples wanted sex selection .
I began to explain our story .
" I 'm 33 and we have two boys conceived naturally and ... "
Before I could finish the nurse interjected with a smile .
" And you want a daughter . "
Over the course of half an hour they explained the costs involved and said we could have the whole procedure done in Turkey .
They also said they normally put in three embryos .
That rang alarm bells .
The maximum in the UK is two and most doctors would like to see that reduced to one because multiple pregnancy is the single greatest risk with IVF .
Baby impact
In an earlier conversation it was suggested any extra foetuses could be " taken out " or aborted if I did get pregnant with twins or triplets .
I showed Professor Peter Braude of King 's College London our footage .
Having been involved in IVF for many years he advocates implanting only one embryo in women going for fertility treatment .
He said : " Putting three embryos back in a young woman is really bad practice because of the high risk of multiple pregnancy .
" So even if you went abroad for treatment and had your IVF treatment you 're bringing those twins back for care in this country - and besides the impact on the NHS there 's significant impact on those babies . "
Despite being told we had filmed its representatives offering to carry out the procedure , the Jinemed Center says it does not do it , and always warns patients about the risks of multiple pregnancies .
But , after contacting the Turkish government with our findings , it has now launched an official investigation into the Jinemed Center and warned UK patients not to travel there for gender selection .
Proof if needed that the desire to complete a family with a son or a daughter by going down the " high tech " route could turn into a legal nightmare .

What are these ?
I ’m lucky to have been invited to present three lectures on “ Beethoven & Philosophy ” to the Beethoven class being held this semester ( see below ) .
They ’re scheduled for the end of this month , so I ’ve been preparing .
Philosophers do n’t have a lot to say about music .
There is discussion of it in aesthetics , of course , and Schopenhauer and Nietzsche wrote a good deal about it .
Plato wrote about music in the Republic , though the distance between his culture and ours makes it pretty hard to appreciate .
So I ’m not taking the direct route of “ here ’s what philosophers have to say about Beethoven . ”
Rather , I ’m relaying what the big philosophical concerns were in LvB ’s time and just after it , and making links where I can to where his music expresses some of the passion motivating the philosophy .
That last bit , by the way , is really exciting for me .
What is the music that expresses the frame of mind Kant was in while crafting the CPR ?
What music expresses Hegel ’s insight that the real is the rational ?
What ’s the soundtrack to Nietzsche ’s eternal return ?
I think it all can be found in Beethoven .
Indeed , as in Shakespeare and Plato , it ’s hard to find a human voice that does n’t get expressed somewhere in the works .
The first lecture will be on Kant .
Remember that , for Kant , the world we experience has come pre-formatted for us by the structure of our minds .
Space , time , substance , and causality are all in the world because they are forms and categories we impose upon a reality that is , in itself , impossible for us to experience directly .
Similarly , it is the structure of the human mind that tells us how a human being , as a rational being , ought to behave ; and that is the sphere of morality .
And in the world of art , what we find beautiful has its harmony because of the way our understanding restrains our imagination , and what we find sublime has its power because it reflects the tremendous power of our will .
In all : there is order in the world , and morality , and beauty and sublimity because of us .
We invest the world with its intelligibility and its value .
( Can you here the final movement of LvB ’s 9th ? )
The second lecture is on German idealism ( the philosophies of Fichte , Schelling , and Hegel ) .
I have always been fascinated by German idealism because of its strangeness and difficulty .
The movement started as philosophers tried to tie up the loose ends Kant had left behind .
Most notably , he had n’t explained what this powerful “ human mind ” is , or how it relates to the reality we cannot experience .
The world in itself is something we can think , Kant said , but never understand .
But the GIs would not accept this .
If we can think it , then we can understand it .
Fichte thought the world in itself must be exactly what it seems to be — namely , an idea of the mind , which the mind produces as a sort of reflection of itself .
Schelling could n’t believe we ’re making all this shit up , so he postulated a higher unity of mind and reality frought with tension and disturbance , from which all things flow .
Hegel saw the absolute not as a pre-existent unity , but something coming into being through our attempts to understand the world and impose order on it .
The world becomes real as it becomes rational .
I cannot exaggerate the passion of these thinkers , and their zeal to find order in all things ; pulling out all stops in order to give voice to the turmoil and hope they felt within themselves .
( And that , to me , is how LvB ’s Grosse Fuge sounds . )
The final lecture is on Schopenhauer and Nietzsche , who each , in his own way , rebelled against the very idea that the core of reality was something rational .
They each placed will or blind passion at the heart of things .
Schopenhauer thought this made all of experience a long ordeal of suffering , for the will is never satisfied .
One can expect only tragedy after tragedy , and weariness .
( LvB ’s slow movement from the 3rd . )
Nietzsche saw the suffering as a necessary condition for victory : namely , the victory of accepting life just as it is , and embracing it .
( The final movement in LvB ’s last string quartet has the following annotation : “ Muss es sein ? … Es muss sein ! ” —
“ Must it be ? … It must be ! ” )
There you have it .
In any event , this has been a whole - brain exercise .
We ’ll see how the lectures go .
Liddy Dole deserves to lose for so many reasons .
But , in the end , Dole really did herself in with that “ godless ” ad she ran against Kay Hagan .
Public Policy Polling ’s blog , ( PPP is based in North Carolina ) had this analysis :
It is pretty clear to me based on our polling this weekend that Kay Hagan will be headed to the US Senate unless something very bizarre happens in the next 72 hours .
While numbers in the races for President and Governor are basically unchanged from last week there has been clear movement away from Elizabeth Dole , a sign that her ‘ Godless Americans ’ ad is blowing up in her face .
Dole has run one of the worst campaigns imaginable .
Dole is getting what she deserves .
If you live in North Carolina , pile on .
Crush Liddy while you ’re defeating McCain .
You ’re doing a favor for the rest of America .
And , one more time , here ’s the response ad from Kay Hagan , who will be North Carolina ’s next Senator :

Cigarette smoke permeates every nook and cranny of your body .
Stockbyte / Getty Images
The word digest implies something good .
If you digest a thought , it means you carefully deconstruct it in your mind .
This can lead to a better understanding .
When you digest food , you break it down into a form your body can absorb and use as energy .
The problem with cigarettes is that it 's more about ingestion than digestion .
Your body takes in a large amount of chemicals and carcinogens with each puff , and what does n't leave your mouth or nose through exhalation stays there for a while .
Our internal organs , blood and cells simply are n't built to process cigarette smoke .
When you smoke , the first thing that happens is a mix of gases is released around your eyes , nose and throat .
This happens within the first few seconds .
Your eyes may water , your nose might run and your throat will most likely become irritated .
Tiny hairs called cilia work to clean your bronchial tubes and lungs of nasty foreign matter .
They 're the street sweepers of the body .
Smoking paralyzes and can even kill the cilia so they can't sweep .
If you smoke , the cilia that you do n't kill wake back up and get out the brooms .
When smokers wake up coughing , it 's because the cilia are hard at work again .
Then the first cigarette of the day paralyzes the poor little guys again , and the hacking cough ceases .
It 's no wonder that smokers in the early days did n't realize it was bad for them .
If a cigarette stops the morning cough , it must be a good thing , right ?

Deep inside the lungs , cigarette smoke damages the floating scavenger cells that work to remove foreign particles from the lungs ' tiny air sacs , called alveoli .
A lot of what you inhale turns to tar .
This tar is n't unlike what you might use to pave a road or shingle a house .
Only about 30 percent of cigarette tar is sent back into the air through exhalation -- the rest sticks to your throat and lungs like saltwater taffy .
Besides being disgusting , tar kills healthy lung cells .
A pack - a - day smoker ingests a full cup of tar into his or her lungs every year .
The myth of low - tar cigarettes is just that -- a myth .
Cigarette manufacturers poke tiny little holes in the filter to " reduce " the amount of tar you ingest .
Sounds good , right ?
Unfortunately , your fingers block most of these holes when you hold a cigarette , and low - tar smokers end up inhaling more deeply to achieve the nicotine hit they crave .
The chemicals in cigarette smoke are pretty much immediately absorbed into your bloodstream .
From here they go straight to your heart and from there , everywhere else in your body .
Your heart begins to beat faster as soon as you light up , as much as 10 to 25 beats per minute .
That adds up to 36,000 extra beats per day .
Smoke can also cause an irregular heartbeat , or arrhythmia .
The oxygen level in your blood is reduced because the carbon monoxide produced when you smoke tricks the body into thinking that it 's oxygen .
( For more on this trick , read How does smoking starve your heart of oxygen ?. )
Problem is , your body 's cells still need oxygen , so your heart goes into overtime to supply it .
If you continue to smoke regularly , your senses of taste and smell will slowly fade , thanks to the tar that coats your tongue and nasal passages .
You probably wo n't even realize it 's happening and may only notice what you 've been missing when you quit .
Most smokers who quit report a noticeable change in how their food tastes and smells .
Campaign Notebook : Obama buys half hour of TV prime time NOTEBOOK
Obama buys TV time on Black Tuesday
Barack Obama is buying a half - hour slot on television networks in prime time on Oct. 29 , the anniversary of Black Tuesday of 1929 , when panic in the stock markets set in ahead of the Great Depression .
Leaving a campaign stop in Georgetown , Ohio , on Thursday , Obama declined to say whether he planned to address the current crisis in the context of the depression .
He would n't talk about the nature of the programming , saying , " We 're going to be talking about it tomorrow . "
Linda Douglass , a senior adviser to Obama , confirmed Thursday the campaign has purchased time on NBC and CBS .
She said that the campaign would buy airtime on Fox , unless it is carrying a World Series game that night , and that no arrangement had been made with ABC .
The last candidate to make such a purchase was Ross Perot in 1992 .
Is failing market Libertarian gold ?
Private markets fail , politicians from both parties jump to their rescue , and taxpayers get stuck with the bill .
Libertarian candidatecould n't have scripted a better story line to argue that Republicans and Democrats are interchangeable — with a helpless addiction to spending .
Can Barr capitalize on it ?
Republican strategists fear any gains he makes could come at the expense of their ticket because Barr 's economic views are closer to those of John McCain than to Obama .
Polls so far are n't registering a shift to the Libertarian candidate in spite of widespread outrage over the $ 700 billion rescue package .
The former GOP congressman from Georgia is languishing with about the same 1 percent share of support he 's had for months .
But Barr is sharpening his attacks on McCain , hoping fiscal conservatives frustrated over McCain 's support for the bailout will join his campaign .
Barr says traffic on his Web site is spiking and donations are picking up .
" This illustrates just how far the Republican Party in particular has slid , " Barr said .
" One would expect it from the Democrats , but for Republicans to be championing this massive government intervention ... is unbelievable . "
Brian Rogers , a McCain spokesman , said the campaign is not concerned because McCain has a consistent record of fighting wasteful spending and supporting what is in the national interest , not " what 's politically expedient . "
Writes Billy :
Nike Hindsight is , put simply , like giving bicyclists a pair of bifocals for their peripheral vision .
By using Fresnel lenses on the sides of eye wear , riders can detect motion in a field of view beyond the normal human limit of 180º .
To get technical , high power , diverging Fresnel zones aligned vertically distort into view an extra 25 º of view on either side .
In doing this , vision is radically distorted in the periphery , but as the eye detects only motion in that area , little clarity is lost in the process .
Reader Billy
May sent us these concept sketches for the Nike Hindsight , specially design biking glasses with specifically tuned Fresnel lenses for keeping an eye on approaching taxis / cars / baby strollers .
Writes Billy : Nike Hindsight is , put simply , like giving bicyclists a pair of bifocals for their peripheral vision .
By using Fresnel lenses on the sides of eye wear , riders can detect motion in a field of view beyond the normal human limit of 180º .
To get technical , high power , diverging Fresnel zones aligned vertically distort into view an extra 25 º of view on either side .
In doing this , vision is radically distorted in the periphery , but as the eye detects only motion in that area , little clarity is lost in the process .
A rider ’s clear benefit is in the early warning of approaching vehicles , but a less obvious advantage is reducing the necessary head rotation to check completely behind oneself .
Moreover , while the project was directed towards bicycling for the sake of simplicity , there ’s a myriad of sports and activities where a greater field of view becomes an advantage , so feel free to speculate .
Remember : Concept means these are not real - yet - but I would totally wear these if they were .
Even riding through the mean streets of Bay Ridge is a frightening proposition as grannies and the habitually stupid try to pass me all the time on my bike .
The TV show Stargate has inspired European researchers from 10 universities in the Symbrion program to create swarm robots .
Allen Whitfield from the University of the West of England , Bristol states :
Some robots might form a chain allowing rescue workers to communicate with survivors while others assemble themselves into a ‘ medicine bot ’ to give first aid .
The robots can form chains and would be used to help search for victims in collapsed buildings or other emergency situations .
The robots will not be ready for action for another 10 to 15 years .

The researchers focused on three genes Australian researchers have identified a significant link between a gene involved in testosterone action and male - to - female transsexualism .
DNA analysis from 112 male - to - female transsexual volunteers showed they were more likely to have a longer version of the androgen receptor gene .
The genetic difference may cause weaker testosterone signals , the team reported in Biological Psychiatry .
However , other genes are also likely to play a part , they stressed .
Increasingly , biological factors are being implicated in gender identity .
There is a social stigma that transsexualism is simply a lifestyle choice , however our findings support a biological basis of how gender identity develops
Professor Vincent Harley , researcher
One study has shown that certain brain structures in male - to - female transsexual people are more " female like " .
In the latest study , researchers looked for potential differences in three genes known to be involved in sex development - coding for the androgen receptor , the oestrogen receptor and an enzyme which converts testosterone to oestrogen .
Comparison of the DNA from the male to female transsexual participants with 258 controls showed a significant link with a long version of the androgen receptor gene and transsexualism .
Testosterone
It is known that longer versions of the androgen receptor gene are associated with less efficient testosterone signalling .
This reduced action of the male sex hormone may have an effect on gender development in the womb , the researchers speculated .
" We think that these genetic differences might reduce testosterone action and under masculinise the brain during foetal development , " said researcher Lauren Hare from Prince Henry 's Institute of Medical Research .
Co-author Professor Vincent Harley added : " There is a social stigma that transsexualism is simply a lifestyle choice , however our findings support a biological basis of how gender identity develops . "
Although this is the largest genetic study of transsexualism to date , the researchers now plan to see if the results can be replicated in a larger population .
Terry Reed from the Gender Identity Research and Education Society said she was convinced of a biological basis to transsexualism .
" This study appears to reinforce earlier studies which have indicated that , in some trans people , there may be a genetic trigger to the development of an atypical gender identity .
" However , it may be just one of several routes and , although it seems extremely likely that a biological element will always be present in the aetiology of transsexualism , it 's unlikely that developmental pathways will be the same in all individuals . "

A man was stabbed several times during an argument at a McDonald 's fast food outlet in Melbourne 's CBD last night .
Police say the man was involved in an argument with two others over their position in a queue for food about 11:30 pm .
It is believed the men followed the 30 - year - old man from Croydon outside and attacked him in Swanston Street near Flinders Street Station .
He was stabbed three times , once to the shoulder and twice to the chest and has been treated at the Alfred Hospital .
His injuries are not life threatening .
Yesterday we incorporated two polls conducted by Orion Strategies ( R ) into our database .
Today RealClearPolitics.com followed suit , but in doing so erroneously ( or perhaps intentionally ) labeled them as Democratically skewed .
Orion Strategies LLC is co-owned by Randy Scheunemann , a die hard Republican based on about five minutes of research .
You 've probably never heard of this guy but he 's donated $ 2,000 to McCain and upon further examination he 's actually a foreign - policy aide to John McCain .
I do n't know how a given pollster could be more partisan , but RealClearPolitics.com seems to disagree with this assessment .
Did they even do the leg work ?
My guess is surprisingly yes and here 's why .
RealClearPolitics.com has consistently conveyed a conservative slant ; this does not necessarily mean that their polling averages are partisan however ; although they do have some questionable practices .
Lets give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that their polling methods are impartial .
If an impartial algorithm exists , the only way to control the output is by altering the input .
Well they tried this and got caught .
The only remaining avenue for manipulation lies in the presentation .
By mislabeling the polls ' party affiliation they do no harm to their averages ' credibility ( as its still classified as partisan ) , but they are still manipulating their supposedly impartial presentation to fulfill their agenda .
When RealClearPolitics.com was previously called out for bias they pleaded innocent , but they seem to be repeat offenders .
This latest example serves to highlight the fact that RealClearPolitics.com is run by Republican hacks who will go to the end of the earth to further their political beliefs .
This example of intentional misinformation highlights everything wrong with the current Republican movement .
The means by which they seek to improve the democracy actually runs counter to the principles of democracy .
It is being predicted that Australians will soon accept that nuclear power is the answer to many climate change problems .
The president of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation , Ziggy Switkowski , says there has already been a shift in perception on the issue , with about half of the population now open to the idea .
" Community opinion now is reasonably evenly split between for and against and that 's a positive move from the nuclear power point of view in the last couple of years , " he told ABC2's News Breakfast .
" I think in the next several years we 'll get an alignment between communities being supportive of nuclear power and politicians realising that it 's really a large part of the climate change solution . "
Dr Switkowski says while he respects the Government 's opposition to nuclear power , he says it is not consistent with the view of most countries around the world .
" Progressively I think we 're going to have every state line up in support of uranium mining and export , " he said .
" The more uranium we export and the more nuclear power is produced around the world , the less the challenge becomes in terms of the evolution away from fossil fuel . "
Dr Switkowski says the WA Government 's decision to lift a ban on uranium mining is another step in the right direction .
He has dismissed concern about finding a storage site for waste from future nuclear reactors .
" To find one location in central Australia presumably that will progressively store the spent fuel from Australia 's reactors at the end of this century , we 're talking 80 years out , strikes me as a very straight forward technical problem , " he said .
Dr Switkowski says there is nothing to suggest Australia will be forced to accept waste from countries buying its uranium .
" Most countries have laws on their books that say ' if we are going to go nuclear we are responsible for our own waste , we will store it within our boundaries , we will not accept anybody else 's waste ' , " he said .
" I think you would struggle to find nuclear waste that people wanted to send to Australia . "

HOAXER CONFESSES
Throughout my career , I ’ve covered dozens of fake hate crimes — campus hate crime hoaxes , Muslim hate crime hoaxes , fake noose hangings , etc. , etc. , etc .
Most were perpetrated by liberals , but there have been some shameful ones on our side of the aisle as well .
I ’ve reported on the great lengths that warped attention - seekers have gone to in perpetrating fake hate crimes , including beating themselves up , carving swastikas on their dorm room doors and walls , locking themselves in bathroom stalls , and burning down their own houses .
Which is why I ’m not jumping up and down with outrage over Drudge - promoted story of a McCain volunteer claiming to have been attacked by a black man whom she accused of carving a “ B ” in her face after spotting her McCain bumper sticker .
She refused medical treatment after reporting the incident to police .
Why on earth would she do that ?
Look at her face ( photo via Hot Air ) :
What ’s wrong with the “ B ? ”
I share my reader Kathy ’s suspicions on this .
She writes :
Notice how the “ B ” is backwards on the right cheek … … if you were looking in a mirror and put it on your own face … it would appear backwards and would probably be on your own right cheek ( due to most folks are right handed ) … … she put it on her own face but forgot it would show up backwards .
She may have been robbed and beaten but I think she added the “ B ” … .
Take a close look at the picture .
Maaaaybe the alleged robber straddled her upside - down while carving it into her face .
Maybe .
But I ’ve got my doubts .
( Update : And yes , as many readers have pointed out , it ’s also the neatness and superficiality of that “ B ” that also raises red flags .
See my police officer reader ’s e-mail below . )
The woman has been identified as GOP volunteer Ashley Todd of Texas .
Her Twitter page is here and I find it , well , odd .
This seems to me to have shades of Paul Mirecki ( note that there was a photo in that case , too ) , Sarah Marshak , and Tawana Brawley all over it .
If I ’m wrong , I ’ll apologize .
If I ’m right , will this woman ?
It needs to be said — and since it is not said often enough by those on the other side of the political aisle , I ’ll say it again :
We have enough low - lifes and thugs in the world running loose and causing campaign chaos and fomenting hatred without having to make them up .
I ’ve been blowing the whistle on the real , left - wing rage not on the front page and in - your - face tactics throughout the election season .
Hate crimes hoaxes — by anyone , of any political persuasion , and of any color — diminish us all .
Either way , I hope that Todd gets the help she needs , that the whole truth comes out , and that justice is served on the perpetrator .
Whoever he or she may be .
***
Ace weighs in .
And from a reader who is a police officer :
“ I ’m a cop – 8th year now – and this McCain supporter attack just did n’t pass the “ smell test ” as soon as I read about it .
At this point , I ’ll guess the shiner was inflicted either by a friend willingly as part of this hoax or a boyfriend in a domestic dispute .
The “ B ” is far to [o ] shallow and clean to be taken seriously .
Reminds me of the stab wounds that a “ hero ” would get when fighting off a phantom attacker – far to [o ] superficial to have been done in what is a fairly violent encounter .
Either way , I ’m voting McCain 😉
***
Update 1 am Eastern : Via Pittsburgh Tribune - Review …
A knife - wielding man robbed a McCain - Palin campaign volunteer and etched a “ B ” into her face after he saw a McCain bumper sticker on her car , the woman told Pittsburgh police .
Police planned to administer a polygraph test to Ashley Todd , 20 , because her statements about the attack conflict with evidence from the Citizens Bank ATM where she claims the incident occurred , police said .
FYI : Todd ’s MySpace page has been turned private , but cached links are here .
Her Facebook profile has been deleted , but the cached front page is here .
Update 9:30 am Eastern 10 / 24 : She told police the assailant sat on her chest and pinned her hands down with his knees .
So much for all those thinking the attacker was upside - down with her head between his knees .
Update 3:26 pm Eastern : I was right .
Colombia has declared a state of emergency in response to widespread riots .
The violence broke out after investors lost millions of dollars in the collapse of pyramid schemes .
Under the state of emergency the Government has special powers to increase prison terms for illegal money collecting and to seize money from businesses involved in such activity .
President Alvaro
Uribe says money recovered from the illegal businesses will be repaid to poor investors who lost their savings .
He added , however , that richer investors should have known better and would have to suffer some of the financial blow .
The pyramid style schemes promised extravagant returns and while most investors were poor , senators and police officers were among those who lost out .

Using the latest techniques in space technology , astronomers at NASA and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory used direct - imaging techniques to capture pictures of four newly discovered planets orbiting stars outside our solar system .
" After all these years , it 's amazing to have a picture showing not one but three planets , " said physicist Bruce Macintosh of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore , California .
" The discovery of the HR8799 system is a crucial step on the road to the ultimate detection of another Earth , " he said .
None of the planets is remotely habitable , scientists said .
Both sets of research findings were published Thursday in Science Express , a journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
A team of American , British and Canadian astronomers and physicists , using the Gemini North and Keck telescopes on the Mauna Kea mountaintop in Hawaii , observed host star HR8799 to find three of the new planets .
Scientists estimate that HR8799 , roughly 1.5 times the size of the sun , is 130 light years from Earth in the constellation of Pegasus .
The individual planets in this planetary family are estimated to be seven to 10 times the mass of Jupiter .
Do n't Miss Mission to fix Hubble Telescope postponed
Astronomers say the star is too faint to detect with the human eye , but observers could probably see it through binoculars or small telescopes .
" This discovery is the first time we have directly imaged a family of planets around a normal star outside of our solar system , " said Christian Marois , the lead astronomer in the Lawrence Livermore lab study .
About the same time , NASA astronomers using the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope surprised the space community by locating a fourth planet .
NASA 's newly discovered planet , Fomalhaut b , is estimated to be roughly three times Jupiter 's mass and 10.7 billion miles from its host star , Fomalhaut .
NASA 's images show Fomalhaut b orbiting the bright southern star Fomalhaut , which is said to be 16 times brighter than our sun and 25 light years away in the constellation Piscis Australis ( Southern Fish ) .
" Our Hubble observations were incredibly demanding .
Fomalhaut b is 1 billion times fainter than the star , " Hubble astronomer Paul Kalas said .
" We began this program in 2001 , and our persistence finally paid off . "
Previous planet - hunting efforts have relied on the traditional Doppler , or " wobble , " technique , which works by measuring the gravitational influence a planet exerts on its host , or parent , star .
By studying these gravitational " tug - of - wars , " astronomers have been able to study a star 's velocity or brightness to infer the presence of a planet .

Share your photos of space
To determine whether the faint objects orbiting HR8799 were indeed planets and not other stars , astronomers studying the three newly discovered planets ( HR8799 b , HR8799c and HR8799d ) compared images from studies conducted in different years .
In all the documented pictures , the three objects were found to be orbiting in a counter - clockwise direction around HR8799 , proving that they were planets and not just background objects coincidentally aligned in the image .
According to the the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia , there have been 322 planets found outside our solar system .
The latest findings bring that total to 326 .
The extrasolar planets found have mostly been gaseous in their composition .
Both studies indicate that direct - imaging techniques can only aid our efforts in one day finding an Earth - like planet .

Dr. Rolf Gössner ist Rechtsanwalt , Mitherausgeber des mit der Theodor - Heuss - Medaille ausgezeichneten Grundrechte - Reports , Vizepräsident der Internationalen Liga für Menschenrechte und Jury - Mitglied bei den Big Brother Awards .
2006 verlangte er über eine Klage gegen das Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz eine Feststellung der Rechtswidrigkeit der Dauerüberwachung seiner Person .
Zudem sollte der Inlandsgeheimdienst mit der Klage verpflichtet werden , alle über ihn gesammelten Daten zu sperren und nach einer Einsichtnahme zu löschen .
Kurz vor der ersten mündlichen Verhandlung vor dem Verwaltungsgericht Köln am Donnerstag dieser Woche teilte das Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz nun überraschend mit , dass die Beobachtung " nach aktuell erfolgter Prüfung " eingestellt worden sei .
Laut Gössners Anwalt Udo Kauß konnte das Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz bisher nicht plausibel darlegen " weshalb die geheimdienstliche Beobachtung [...] über einen Zeitraum von 38 Jahren zum Schutz der Verfassung notwendig gewesen sein soll " .
Damit hat Gössner sein erstes Ziel erreicht , will aber weiterhin gerichtlich auf Einblick in die bisher geschwärzten oder geheim gehaltenen Teile seiner Akten drängen .
Auch die Rechtswidrigkeit der Langzeitbeobachtung will er noch von Gericht bestätigt wissen .
Bisher liegt dem Überwachten lediglich ein Teil seiner Akte vor , der etwa ein Viertel des Gesamtbestandes umfasst und den Zeitraum ab dem Jahr 2000 betrifft .
Obwohl das Verwaltungsgericht Köln bereits urteilte , dass das Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz für den gesamten Bespitzelungszeitraum Einblick gewähren muss , ließen die Teile von 1970 bis 1999 bisher auf sich warten .
Allerdings ist auch im Gössner einsehbaren Teil der Akten ein beträchtlicher Teil herausgenommen oder geschwärzt .
Diese Maßnahmen gehen auf das Bundesinnenministerium zurück , der obersten Aufsichtsbehörde des Inlandsgeheimdienstes .
Es begründete seine Entscheidung unter anderem damit , dass ein Bekanntwerden der Inhalte dem " Wohl des Bundes oder eines Landes Nachteile bereiten " würde .
Der weiterhin angeführte Verweis auf den " Quellenschutz " legt nahe , dass nicht nur veröffentlichtes Material über Gössner gesammelt wurde , sondern dass es auch eine verdeckte Überwachung gegeben haben muss .
Bei weiteren geschwärzten Stellen scheint es sich dagegen um vom Verfassungsschutz vorgenommene Kommentierungen von Gössners Schriften zu handeln , welche die Behörde Gössner ebenfalls vorenthalten will .
Gössner klagte dagegen beim Bundesverwaltungsgericht , das den Verfassungsschutz am 30 .
Oktober dazu verpflichtete , dem Gericht die umstrittenen Aktenteile im Rahmen eines In - Camera - Geheimverfahrens zur Prüfung vorzulegen .
Darauf , dass er vom Verfassungsschutz beobachtet werden könnte , stieß der Rechtsanwalt und Publizist 1996 , nachdem die Zeitschrift " Geheim " , für die er geschrieben hatte , als " linksextremistisch " eingestuft wurde .
Ein Auskunftsersuchen brachte ans Licht , dass bereits seit dem Jahr 1970 Daten über den damaligen Jurastudenten gesammelt wurden .
Der Gössner bisher zugänglich gemachte Teil der Sammlung enthält nach seinen Angaben vorwiegend Vorträge , Interviews und Artikel , in denen sich zwar kritische Würdigungen der Praktiken von Sicherheitsorganen und besonders von Geheimdiensten finden , aber keinerlei verfassungsfeindliche Inhalte .
Betroffen sind unter anderem Artikel in der Frankfurter Rundschau , im Freitag und im Weser - Kurier .
Laut Gössner , der nie Mitglied einer Partei war , wurde ihm vom Verfassungsschutz eine " Kontaktschuld " zu als extremistisch eingestuften Gruppen und Medien wie der " Vereinigung der Verfolgten des Naziregimes " ( VVN ) und dem Rechtsberatungsverein " Rote Hilfe " vorgeworfen – eine " Zusammenarbeit mit linksextremistischen bzw. linksextremistisch beeinflussten Personenzusammenschlüssen " .
Allerdings sprach der Menschenrechtler , der sich selbst als Befürworter eines " offenen , kritischen Dialoges " sieht , auch schon bei Veranstaltungen des Hessischen Verfassungsschutzes , des Bundesgrenzschutzes und der schleswig - holsteinischen Polizei , ohne dass in diesem Zusammenhang in den ihm nun zugänglich gemachten Teilen der Akte über eine " Zusammenarbeit " spekuliert worden wäre .
Es gibt einige Anhaltspunkte , die darauf hindeuten , dass es auch persönlich - institutionelle Motive gewesen sein könnten , die den Apparat zu einer so dauerhaften Bespitzelung motivierten : Viele seiner Schriften machten Fehlverhalten von Sicherheitsbehörden öffentlich ; und als wissenschaftlicher Berater der niedersächsischen Grünen half er mit , den dortigen Landesverfassungsschutz zu stutzen .
Nach der Auffassung der Internationalen Liga für Menschenrechte hat der Fall ihres Vizepräsidenten " grundsätzliche Bedeutung " , weil die Vorgänge zeigen , dass eine unbekannte Dunkelziffer von Publizisten , Rechtsanwälten und Menschenrechtlern ebenfalls von unverhältnismäßigen Bespitzelungsmaßnahmen betroffen sein könnte .
Eine nicht entsprechend begründete Beobachtung über einen so langen Zeitraum wie bei Gössner ist der Liga zufolge eine " schwere Verletzung von Grundrechten und des Verfassungsgrundsatzes der Verhältnismäßigkeit , für die das Bundesamt und die politisch Verantwortlichen im Bundesinnenministerium endlich zur Rechenschaft gezogen werden müssen " .
Aufgrund der beruflichen und ehrenamtlichen Tätigkeiten Gössners wurde durch die Langzeitausforschung möglicherweise nicht nur sein Persönlichkeitsrecht auf informationelle Selbstbestimmung verletzt , sondern ( über die Verletzungen von Mandatsgeheimnis und Informantenschutz ) auch die grundgesetzlich geschützte Berufsfreiheit sowie zahlreiche Rechte Dritter .
Selbst als Gössner Deputierter in der Bremer Bürgerschaft und stellvertretender Richter am Bremischen Staatsgerichtshof wurde , ließ der Verfassungsschutz nicht von der Ausforschung ab und erklärte dem Kölner Verwaltungsgericht stattdessen , warum seiner Ansicht nach eine Beobachtung von Richtern nicht gegen ihre vom Grundgesetz garantierte Unabhängigkeit verstoße .

Heidi Montag : Heidiwood Line Sunk by Anchor Blue
is an actress on The Hills and an aspiring clothing designer who developed a line of $ 10 - $ 60 fashion items under the Heidiwood brand .
She debuted the collection in April 2008 and signed a one year contract with Anchor Blue .
The retail chain told New York magazine recently that they will not renew Montag 's contract for 2009 and the business relationship will end .
Anchor Blue plans to open ten new stores next year .
According to company spokeswoman Marla
White : " We 're taking a completely new style direction and we 're very , very excited about it . "
Heidi ..... not so much .
Like Christmas or the Tooth Fairy before the big " reveal , " this video seems like pure magic to me .

Advertising in the ' 80s and '90s was different ; like Cyndi Lauper ( who , do n't get me wrong , I love ) , ads used to be loud , bright and over the top .
They shouted , " Look at me , " and I sometimes did , but often pressed the mute button or simply turned the page .
It seems , though , we 're in a new era where it 's about making the ordinary extraordinary , and the few hundred thousands views this Toshiba ad has already had suggests it 's working on people other than me .
My friend , a film editor , not a magician , explained the trick , and there 's a YouTube vid about it , too .
Basically , they filmed each person separately , using 200 cameras mounted on a large rig , then did lots of visual effects and compositing , then put it all together .
His words : " It would take a really , really , really big amount of work and even more money . "
It 's not like ad budgets , or the need for innovation , were ever weak : print advertisers had to draw readers ' eyes from the columns to the margins , and TV ads had to keep people from turning the channel .
Now , those wily advertisers do n't need a page or a TV channel .
Since the beginning of newspapers , there 's been symbiosis : editorial provided the page , the delivery method , for advertising , and advertising paid for the delivery of editorial .
But since advertisers can now put their videos directly on YouTube , there 's no need for an editorial vehicle to provide the eyeballs .
Advertisers know that if they make the ad funny enough or catchy enough or magical enough , I 'll forward it to all my friends .
Three people forwarded me a link to the Toshiba ad last week , and so far I have n't seen it grace my TV screen .
It 's one of many captivating , expensive ads that bypass media outlets , leaving that space for lower budget ads .
Even I 'm changing my forwarding habits .
I 'm a reading relic : I still spend hours every day reading whole online newspaper and magazine articles and blog posts .
And in the recent past , when I read something and thought of a friend , I used to send a link to the whole article , regardless of length , expecting they 'd find time to at least skim it , whereas I now copy and paste the relevant paragraph or two into the e-mail itself , and expect that few will even find time to read that ( with the exception of my journalist or information junkie pals ) .
Few friends send me links to articles these days ; most just send video URLs .
So it 's no coincidence that my inbox is also full of e-bulletins about record layoffs in the journalism industry .
Most notably , Time Inc. laid off 600 people ( including people at Sports Illustrated and People ) , several Vogue magazines have folded , the Economist is cutting , Radar folded ( again ) and CanWest announced cuts of 560 people last week .
It 's not just the inevitable extinction of a print dinosaur , accelerated by announcements that the cost of paper is going up 20 per cent this year , the online - only Gawker Media empire expects ad revenues to be down 40 per cent everywhere due to the economic downturn , and is folding publications and laying off staff .
That seems , um , like a lot .
There are endless panels and articles about the death of journalism .
But regardless of the reasons , in the end , many people are using their media time to watch cool ads and funny videos , then just quickly scanning the news headlines .
Could viral videos be the charming , captivating killer of the newsroom ?

Some carriers of HIV would be implanted with microchips under a bill backed by legislators in the Indonesian province of Papua .
John Manangsang , a Papua MP , said that by implanting computer chips beneath the skin of " sexually aggressive " patients authorities would be in a better position to identify , track and punish anyone who deliberately infected others .
Those convicted could face up to six months in jail or a £ 3,340 fine .
The proposed legislation has received backing from the provincial parliament and a majority vote is expected .
If approved it would be enacted next month , Manangsang said .
Under the bill , a committee would decide who should be fitted with chips and monitor patients ' behaviour , but it is unclear who would be on the committtee and how it would carry out its work .
Health workers and rights activists today criticised the plan .
Nancy Fee , the UNAids country coordinator for Indonesia , said she was not aware of any laws or initiatives elsewhere involving HIV / Aids patients and microchips , and expressed " grave concerns " about the effect it would have .
" No one should be subject to unlawful or unnecessary interference of privacy , " Fee said .
She warned that oppressive policies on HIV / Aids did n't work and pushed the problem further underground .
Indonesia is the world 's fourth most populous country and has one of Asia 's fastest growing HIV rates , with up to 290,000 infections out of 235 million people , fuelled mainly by intravenous drug users and prostitution .
Papua , the country 's easternmost and poorest province , has almost 61 cases per 100,000 people , which is 15 times the national average , according to internationally funded research .
Tahi Ganyang Butarbutar , a prominent Papuan activist , said : " People with Aids are n't animals ; we have to respect their rights . "
He said the best way to tackle the disease was through increased spending on sexual education and promoting condom use .
The cash - strapped American insurance company AIG has been ordered to " cease and desist " improper use of taxpayers ' money , after senior executives flew by private jet to a partridge hunting party at a 17th century English manor house .
New York state 's attorney general , Andrew Cuomo , yesterday accused AIG of breaking the law by bankrolling " unwarranted and outrageous " junkets in the wake of a $ 123bn bail - out by the US government to save the firm from bankruptcy .
" The party is over , " he said at a press conference .
" No more hunting trips .
No more luxury resorts .
They are not going to have the party and leave the hangover for taxpayers . "
A Sunday newspaper revealed that a group of AIG 's European bosses spent more than £ 50,000 on a trip to Plumber Manor in Dorset to shoot birds last week , with several executives using a private plane to travel from Germany .
The getaway came hot on the heels of a $ 440,000 retreat for insurance salesmen at a beach resort in California .
In a letter to AIG 's board of directors , Cuomo said such expenditures could be deemed fraudulent conveyances under New York law .
" The board should immediately cease and desist these improper and extravagant expenditures , which exploit the taxpayers , " said the letter .
" Immediate cooperation is expected , or we will commence legal action . "
He demanded that the AIG board stop " unwarranted and outrageous expenditures " and recover any past ones that were " unreasonable " , citing a $ 5 m bonus and $ 15 m " golden parachute " that AIG awarded Martin Sullivan , its chief executive , in March .
Beset by billions of dollars in liabilities on insurance policies protecting financial organisations against default on investments , AIG teetered on the brink of collapse last month .
The Federal Reserve bailed out the firm with an $ 85 bn emergency loan .
Last week , the insurer was granted a further $ 38bn credit line to avert any further deterioration in its finances .
An AIG spokesman told Bloomberg News that the events ought not to have happened : " The events referred to should have been cancelled .
It 's regrettable they were n't .
We 've issued a policy cancelling all such events . "
AIG aims to sell businesses to raise funds to pay back the government 's loans .
But a former boss , Hank Greenberg , warned this week that the company could struggle to come up with sufficient money , and that it runs the risk of eventual liquidation .
Another expression of disgust came from Senator Jim Bunning , Republican of Kentucky , who said the plan would “ take Wall Street ’s pain and spread it to the taxpayers . ”
“ It ’s financial socialism , and it ’s un-American , ” Mr. Bunning said .
Senator Dodd called the crisis “ entirely foreseeable and preventable , not an act of God , ” and said that it angered him to think about “ the authors of this calamity ” walking away with the usual golden parachutes while taxpayers pick up the bill .
“ There is no second act on this , ” Mr. Dodd said , acknowledging that speed was important .
But it is more important , he said , “ to get it right . ”
Mr. Paulson said in response to questions that he shared the senators ’ exasperation .
“ I ’m not only concerned , I ’m angry ” over the events that led to the problem , Mr. Paulson said .
He blamed an outdated regulatory system for the turmoil and , in an effort to counter any impression that the proposed rescue plan is for the benefit of fat - cat Wall Streeters , said : “ This is all about the taxpayers .
That is all we are about . ”
Mr. Paulson said that “ this troubled asset purchase program is the single most effective thing we can do to help homeowners , the American people , and stimulate our economy . ”
He and Mr. Bernanke said that the problems in the housing industry were the core of the crisis but that the problems would continue to spread far outside the housing sector if the problems in the mortgage markets were not addressed , and soon .
With global financial stresses and uncertainties continuing to play out , Mr. Bernanke warned in his testimony that “ if financial conditions fail to improve for a protracted period , the implications for the broader economy could be quite adverse . ”
He reminded the senators at one point that he had never worked on Wall Street and was instead an economic scholar who had studied earlier financial crises , including the Depression .
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
These days , the " M " in MSNBC might as well stand for Rachel Maddow .
Maddow , 35 , has become such a cable - news fixture that it's a little hard to believe she has been hosting her show for only three months , since replacing Dan Abrams .
MSNBC has long needed a boost .
It has frequently trailed rivals Fox News Channel and CNN in the ratings , and suffers from a rather spotty professional image at times as well .
Sometimes , the network has seemed to be wildly undisciplined , where anchors in prime time are all but encouraged to throw any kind of broadcasting style or editorial concept against the wall and see if it sticks .
For years , MSNBC has been one of the most enigmatic stories in the media world -- and a problem child in the NBC News family .
Its big brother , NBC News , has had the top - rated network news show in the breakfast and dinner hours for years .
Even when Tom Brokaw retired from anchoring the evening - news program and Katie Couric bolted from co-anchoring " Today , " both shows rolled on and did n't miss a beat .
Then there is MSNBC.com , which has helped pioneer uses of multimedia and graphics in more sophisticated ways than its peers .
It has deservedly won awards for its prowess .
Recently , MSNBC had to retract a segment in which a mythical pundit " leaked " the " news " that Sarah Palin apparently did n't know that Africa was a continent .
That even overshadowed a slip that Portfolio.com 's Jeff Bercovici noted not long ago : " Chris Matthews just said that one of President Bush 's biggest mistakes was his pledge to get ' Barack Obama ' dead or alive . "
Read related item .
( " Obviously , I was talking about Osama bin Laden , not the guy who just won the presidential election , " Matthews added .
I 'm sure that guy , the President - elect himself , was pleased with the correction . )
To MSNBC executives , Maddow serves as a neat counterpoint to Keith Olbermann , who has also built a strong following .
Olbermann is tough - talking , where Maddow is more subtle .
As the New York Times pointed out , MSNBC 's ratings surged 158 % during the final three months of the 2008 presidential campaign from the year - ago period .
( Other news networks also enjoyed major increases during the end of the campaign coverage . )
MSNBC " grabbed special attention by topping CNN for the last month of the race , something it had never done before , and by occasionally topping Fox , the perennial leader , in the audience category to which news advertisers pay most attention : viewers between the ages of 25 and 54 . "
A pleasant alternative
One of the reasons for her popularity is that Maddow took the time to build a following and gradually let the public discover her .
Before taking on " The Rachel Maddow Show " on MSNBC , she appeared frequently on the network as well as on CNN TWX , .
Maddow also gained a following from hosting a syndicated radio program on Air America ( yes , she 's a liberal ; I guess the cat 's out of the bag now ) .
Maddow is a pleasant alternative to the shouting and preening that passes for content on many of the cable - news shows .
The General Electric GE , - 1.29 % network 's newest star presents a nightly prime - time news program that stresses biting but civil discourse .
The audience has been noticing from the start , too .
In the 25 - to - 54 year - old demographic , Maddow outperformed Larry King on CNN in 13 of her initial 25 nights on the air , allowing MSNBC to surpass CNN in her time slot for the first time .
What has been the key to Maddow 's early success ?
Much has been made in the media about her lesbianism , intellectual prowess ( a Rhodes Scholar , she has an Oxford Ph. D. ) and penchant to dress down in a way that would make Joan Rivers blanch .
New York magazine 's Jessica Pressler might have put it best , though .
In a recent profile , she wrote of Maddow : " As one New York acolyte told me , ' She is more like one of my friends than anyone else on television . ' "
Read New York profile .
Is Maddow a star ?
You bet .
I spotted this phenomenon first hand .
A few Fridays ago , I had dinner in a Greenwich Village restaurant when word spread through the place that Maddow was seated a few tables away .
At that moment , even the jaded New Yorkers in the vicinity craned their necks to get a glimpse of her .
That is star quality at work .
The New York Times noted recently that Maddow " has made MSNBC competitive in that time slot for the first time in a decade .
The channel at that hour has an average viewership of 1.7 million since she started on Sept. 8 , compared with 800,000 before . "
Read New York Times story .
Still , Maddow has work to do in the 9 p.m. slot .
Her show still trails Fox 's " Hannity and Colmes " offering in the ratings .
Surprise star
Maddow 's popularity comes as a surprise to veteran media observer Michael Wolff , a Vanity Fair columnist and the author of the forthcoming book on Rupert Murdoch , " The Man Who Owns the News . "
( Murdoch is the chairman of News Corp. NWS , - 3.57 % , which owns MarketWatch , the publisher of this column . )
" I am totally surprised that she has turned out to be a breakout star , " Wolff told me on Friday .
" She is an intelligent , down - to - earth person .
( But ) I never saw her as a kind of dramatic voice , and I know her from Air America ....
There was a kind of earnestness to the show , and to her , that made you think , here we are in the liberal ghetto .
It turns out that the liberal ghetto turns out to be so large -- or that the conservatives are in a ghetto and the liberals have taken over . "
I asked Wolff to analyze Maddow 's success .
" No surprises , no hysterics , no drama -- just the nice liberal , lesbian down the street , " he said , tongue deeply in cheek
Tellingly , Wolff added , " Keith and Chris have much more flair , drama and pizzazz -- maybe that 's the point .
Good liberal earnestness is the thing now . "
Maybe the point really is that cable news shows will now try to find Maddow - like commentators .
Bill O'Reilly 's breakout success at the Fox News Channel , a division of News Corp. , as an in - your - face commentator has spawned imitators , to a degree , such as Olbermann and Comedy Central icon Stephen Colbert .
It seems to be Maddow 's time now .
MEDIA WEB QUESTION OF THE DAY :
What do you like or dislike about Rachel Maddow on TV or on the radio ?

BBC Latin America analyst
President Chavez is busy campaigning for key local elections next month
The dizzying collapse in oil prices has started a heated debate in Venezuela about the possible effect on its oil - dependent economy - and the political future of left - wing President Hugo Chavez .
Venezuela is particularly vulnerable to oil prices .
It is the Western hemisphere 's largest oil exporter .
More than 90 % of its export revenue and more than half of the government 's annual expenditure comes from oil .
President Chavez 's right - wing opponents are hoping a sustained drop in the oil price could curb his heavy spending on social programmes and undercut his support .
" Some Venezuelans - the wannabe Yankees - are praying for a continued drop in oil prices , " Mr Chavez said recently .
" But a price range of US $ 70 to US$ 90 a barrel will give us more than enough room . "
Foreign reserves
The Venezuelan economy is set to grow for the fourth year running this year on the back of strong oil prices .
Last July the price reached more than US $ 147 , but has slumped at one point recently to below US $ 60 .
Oil analysts Goldman Sachs say it could drop to US $ 50 in the event of a world recession .
OIL PRICE DECLINE
Why have oil prices fallen ?
The former head of the Venezuelan central bank , Domingo Maza Zavala , thinks that anything less than US $ 70 a barrel would mean current levels of economic activity could not be sustained .
" We are on the edge of a precipice and we should prepare for contingencies , " says Mr Maza Zavala .
" The government is presenting a different panorama to Venezuelans , which is dangerous because the best way of confronting dangers and risks is the truth . "
Analysts point out that the key factor is the average price of Venezuelan oil over several months and not the price on any particular day .
" There is no chance of an economic collapse this year , " Jose Manuel Puente , from the Public Policy Centre in Caracas , told the BBC .
" Even if the price stays low for the rest of the year , the average price for 2008 will still be around US $ 95 a barrel " .
Government officials are also quick to point out that Venezuela has large foreign exchange reserves of nearly US $ 40 bn .
That figure rises to well over US $ 50bn when a special discretionary development fund ( Fonden ) is included which President Chavez has used to spend mostly on foreign policy initiatives .
' Illusion of harmony '
However , even if the short - term outlook may be solid , next year may be another matter if the oil price is consistently below US $ 60 a barrel , analysts say .
Mr Puente says his main concern is the sustainability of current economic policies .
He points to three key weaknesses in the Venezuelan economy , which would be exacerbated by a low oil price - a burgeoning fiscal deficit , high inflation , and balance of payments problems .
Sooner or later the bomb will explode
Jose Manuel Puente
Public Policy Centre , Caracas
The Chavez government has been running an expansionary fiscal policy in order to pay for many of the social programmes for the poor known as " missions " .
This is one of the reasons why Mr Chavez remains popular , but the fiscal deficit has mushroomed in the first half of 2008 .
Inflation is running at 36 % in the last 12 months , the highest in Latin America .
And the balance of payments is heavily in deficit despite an estimated US $ 85 bn in oil revenues this year .
This is because a record amount of imports , nearly half from the US , has been sucked in to fuel a mini-consumption boom .
" Everything is linked to the oil boom , " says Mr Puente .
" If oil prices continue to fall , the country simply will be unable to continue importing to meet rising demand , maintain the exchange rate and the expansionary fiscal policy , and keep this illusion of harmony . "
Ticking time bomb Critics say President Chavez 's aggressive nationalisation policy has put off foreign investors , with the result that most investment now comes from the state , and not private companies .
According to figures from the UN Conference on Trade and Development , total foreign investment in Latin America last year was worth about US $ 126bn .
Of this , only US $ 600 m was invested in Venezuela , compared to more than US $ 8 bn in neighbouring Colombia , and US $ 15 bn in Chile .
Another structural problem is that despite the high oil prices , Venezuela 's oil output has actually been falling , from more than 3 m barrels per day in 1997 to about 2.4 m bpd now .
The problem , according to analysts Oxford Analytica , has been the absence of capital investment and of skilled management personnel in the state oil company , PDVSA .
Not all analysts paint a bleak picture .
They point out that there are plenty of non-essential activities which the Chavez government could cut both at home and abroad .
President Chavez himself has spoken of the need to make revisions and to be more efficient in spending .
Few doubt that Mr Chavez will face tighter funding next year - but how much is hard to quantify as the oil price is so volatile .
Mr Puente is convinced that the " warning lights on the dashboard " are serious .
" In the medium term " , he says , " sooner or later the bomb will explode . "

Little did we know then how appropriate its release would be earlier this month .
Financial panics , if left alone , rarely cause much damage to the real economy , output , employment or production .
Asset values fall sharply and wipe out those who borrowed and lent too much , thereby redistributing wealth from the foolish to the prudent .

Creating Executable Jars With Clojure A Brief Overview
Create the application directory structure .
For this example , I 'm using org.etherplex.example.JarExample .
I 'm going to make a project directory called simply " project " .
I 'm assuming Linux / OS X here , Windows users need to adjust this or install Cygwin .
mkdir - p project / org / etherplex / example
Create your application in Clojure , creating a main method that is named properly .
For this example , I used a file called JarExample.clj .
It resides in the project / org / etherplex / example folder .
( in - ns ' org.etherplex.example )
( clojure / refer ' clojure )
( def JarExample - main ( fn [ & args ] ( println " This is an example application ! " ) ) )
If we want to have our " main " class be called JarExample , then in clojure , we need to define a function called JarExample - main .
In general , Clojure will look for methods of a class in the same package as that class , and will use the form TheClass - methodName to locate the proper class .
Now we need to create a stubbed .class file that will dispatch method calls to our Clojure file .
The easiest way to do this is to use the REPL .
I start the REPL in the directory that is the parent of my project directory .
In this case , that 's my home directory .
cd ~
java - jar path/to/clojure.jar
Now that we are in a Clojure REPL , we can create our class stub :
( gen-and - save-class " project " " org.etherplex.example.JarExample " : main true )
First , we specify the path that contains our files ( " project " ) and then the fully qualified class we want to create .
We also specify a flag that indicates that we want Clojure to create a main method that dispatches out to the Clojure file we created in Step 2 .
Unpack clojure .
jar so you can include its contents in you jar file .
We need to make sure our jar has all the dependencies in it so it is easy to distribute .
cd ~
unzip path/to/clojure.jar
mv clojure project
Now we need to create a manifest file for the jar so Java know to execute JarExample .class .
This is the contents of a file called manifest .
txt that I put in my project directory .
Main - Class : org.etherplex.example.JarExample
Class - Path : .
It is vital that this file have a trailing newline !
Finally , we can create our jar file :
cd ~/ project
jar cmf manifest .
txt myjar.jar clojure org
And execute it with :
java - jar myjar.jar
This will create a jar file that contains clojure and your code , and will interpret / compile your .clj file on the fly and run it .
Good luck !

The first new Lotus in nearly 13 years takes the venerable British automaker in a new direction by bringing a measure of luxury and — dare we say it — practicality to the marque in a car aimed squarely at the Porsche Cayman .
Lotus believes the Evora will propel it into the big leagues .
It is betting on the car to broaden its appeal beyond the hard - core enthusiasts who so love the Elise by offering the same razor - sharp handling in a car more suited to daily driving .
" The Evora proves you can have phenomenal performance , fuel efficiency , elegant design and practicality " in a sports car with four seats , says company CEO Mike Kimberly .
All that in a car that gets 30 - plus mpg using the engine out of a — get this — Toyota Camry .
Lotus is making a big splash with the Evora at the Los Angeles Auto Show , and for good reason — it 's the first all - new car to come out of Hethel since the Elise appeared in 1995 .
If the Elise and its even more extreme Exige variant are the embodiment of Colin Chapman 's fanatical dedication to high performance through light weight , the Evora is aimed at people who think a sports car can include a few amenities .
Like , say , carpeting ( which is an option on the Elise ) .
Think of it as the refined bigger brother to the rambunctious Elise .
Bigger is a relative term when talking about a Lotus .
The Evora is 14.2 feet long with a 101.1 - inch wheelbase , up 2 feet and 10.9 inches , respectively , from the Elise .
It 's about the same size as the Cayman and , at a little less than 3,000 pounds , weighs about the same .
The extra room allowed the engineers to squeeze a pair of jump seats into the Evora , making it the world 's only mid-engined 2+2 .
Of course , you are n't going to fit back there unless OshKosh B'Gosh is your favorite brand of clothing .
In a nod to the universal truth that a proper sports car has just two seats , Lotus will offer a version that ditches the jump seats in favor of a luggage shelf .
Lotus proudly notes the trunk is large enough to swallow a set of golf clubs , which seems to be the industry 's universal standard for defining trunk space .
The heart of the car is the same 3.5 - liter V6 engine found in the Toyota Camry , although it has been tweaked with a Lotus - designed intake and exhaust systems to push output to 276 horsepower .
Those ponies run through a six - speed transmission also sourced from Toyota .
Look for a top speed in the neighborhood of 160 mph and a 0 to 60 sprint in less than 5 seconds .
The feds have n't released fuel economy figures for the Evora , but Lotus says you 'll see 30 mpg or better on the highway while emitting less than 225 grams of CO2 per kilometer .
The Evora gets a jazzed - up interior big enough for people as tall as 6.5 feet .
Although the Evora retains the race - ready look of the Elise , it 's tempered by the liberal application of leather and carpet .
There 's even a navi system , Bluetooth and Alpine stereo system .
It all looks downright comfy next to the minimalist Elise . " [ It 's ] a huge departure from what people might expect based on Lotus 's recent past , " says design chief Russell Carr .
" We wanted the
Evora 's cabin to feel special and to be surprising as well as sporty . "
The Evora is the first production car built on the company 's Versatile Vehicle Architecture , a remarkably adaptable platform that can be adjusted nine ways from Sunday with relative ease to suit a wide range of vehicles .
Lotus says VVA will allow it to develop new cars — like , say , the next - gen Esprit — in less time and at lower cost .
Look for the Evora in showrooms this fall with a sticker price around $ 75,000 .
Wait a little longer and you 'll be able to get a drop - top and , if we 're lucky , a supercharged version .

Here 's some news in Turkish from Zaman today on Iran and the United States .
Note that the name of the person in the article , Muhammed Rıza İzediyan in Turkish , is probably something like Mohammed Reza Izediyan but he does n't turn up in any related searches so who knows what the official spelling of his name is .
Edit September 15 : a helpful anonymous poster has said that the spelling is probably Mohammad Reza Izadian .
İran : ABD ile ticaret yap ıyoruz
Iran :
We trade with the United States
İran , ABD ile ticarette her hangi bir sınırlamanın söz konusu olmadığını bildirdi .
Ticareti Geliştirme Kurumu Başkan Yardımcıs ı Muhammed Rıza İzediyan , 4 . Kalkınma Planı çerçevesinde İsrail dışındaki bütün ülkelerle ticaretin serbest olduğunu söyledi .
İzediyan , özel ve resmi şirketlerin ABD de dahil tüm ülkelere ihracat yapabileceği gibi bu ülkelerden ithalatta da bulunabileceğini belirtti .
İran 'ın ABD 'den ithalatının son yıllarda artış gösterdiğini ancak bunun Asya ve Avrupa ülkeleriyle kıyaslanamayacak kadar az olduğunu anlatan İzediyan , “ ABD ile ticaret , İran 'ın dış siyaseti ve çıkarlarıyla çelişmiyor " dedi .
İzediyan , ABD 'ye ihracatın azalmasında ise ucuz ve kalitesiz Çin halılarının piyasaya girmesinin etkili olduğunu sözlerine ekledi .
Yaklaşık 30 yıldır doğrudan diplomatik ilişkiye sahip olmayan İran ve ABD birbirine ihracat ve ithalat yapabiliyor .
ABD , bir çok alanda ambargo uyguladığı İran'a Başkan George W. Bush döneminde 600 milyon dolara yakın ihracat gerçekle ştirdi .
İran , ABD 'li yat ırımcıların başta enerji olmak üzere tüm alanlarda yatırım yapabileceğini açıklamıştı .
Iran said that there is no discussion on limits to trade with the United States .
The deputy head of the Trade Development Association Muhammed Riza Isediyan said that in the 4th Development Plan trade is free with every nation except Israel .
Izediyan clarified that there could also be imports of private and public companies from these countries including the United States that can be exported to .
Izediyan explained that Iran showed an increase of imports from the United States over the past few years but that this was small enough that it could not be compared to that with Asian and European countries , saying that " The trade with the United States is not in contradiction with Iran 's foreign policy and self - interest .
" Izediyan added that the decrease of exports to the United States was affected by the entry on the market of cheap and low - quality Chinese carpets .
Over the past approximately 30 years Iran and the United States , which have no direct diplomatic relations , have been able to import and export to and from each other .
In the George W. Bush period the United States has had almost 600 million dollars of exports to Iran , a country against which there are embargoes in a number of areas .
Iran has said that American investors would be able to invest in all areas , most of all in energy .

It was a gambit that would not have been out of place in the 1970s  or the 1870s , for that matter .
This being a Bloomberg administration , there were no smoke - filled rooms , but there was definitely the sense that issues of civic moment were being handled in private environs .
“ The only thing that my clients have been talking about for the past few weeks is the fiscal dilemma that this city is facing , ” said Mr. Rubenstein , the public relations mogul who helped broker a deal in 1975 involving Abraham D. Beame , then mayor of the city , and Governor Hugh L. Carey back when the feds told the city to more or less drop dead .
“ I did step up because I want to see the city survive and prosper , ” Mr. Rubenstein said , “ and I think we all agree that he is the person who we would like to see leading us through this crisis . ”
In mid-September , after a year of talking on and off , Mr. Bloomberg and Rupert Murdoch , who owns The New York Post , met for dinner at an Italian restaurant on the Upper East Side and sealed a deal .
Arthur Sulzberger Jr. , publisher of The New York Times , had two breakfasts with the mayor , and although no specific commitments were made , an understanding was reached .
Mortimer B. Zuckerman , owner of The Daily News , said he had no trouble throwing his support behind Mr. Bloomberg .
He said there had been no cabal , no conspiracy , just three newspaper publishers all arriving at the same conclusion at a critical juncture in the life of the city .
“ Suggesting that the publishers can decide who the next mayor is is a little like being a 90 - year - old named in a paternity suit , ” Mr. Zuckerman said on the phone .
“ I only wish we had that kind of power .
I think he has been a remarkable mayor , we face tremendous challenges as a city right now , and it ’s clear that he is the person for the job . ”
Even Ronald S. Lauder , the cosmetics heir , who financed the campaign that brought about term limits in the first place , eventually came around .
McCain refers to Americans as ' my fellow prisoners ' Nick Juliano and David Edwards
Published : Wednesday October 8 , 2008

The last two years John McCain has spent on the presidential campaign trail seem to finally have transported the Republican candidate back to the Hanoi Hilton he called home for five and a half years .
At a campaign stop in Pennsylvania Wednesday , McCain referred to his supporters as " fellow prisoners " in a botched attack on his Democratic opponent Barack Obama .
" You and I together will confront the $ 10 trillion debt the federal government has run up and balance the federal budget by the end of my term in office , " he said .
" Across this country , this is the agenda I have set before my fellow prisoners and the same standards of clarity and candor must now be applied to my opponent . "
Judging by McCain 's pause , he expected that to be an applause line .
Silence greeted him from the perplexed crowd .
Standing behind her father , Meghan McCain briefly furrows her brow , apparently recognizing the 72 - year - old seantor 's gaffe .
Vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin also is flanking McCain on stage , but it is less clear whether she recognizes the mistake .
McCain makes no effort to correct his mistake , but he seemed flustered when the crowd did n't erupt at the line .
Glancing down at his prepared text , McCain charged on through to the next line in his speech .
" We 've all heard what he said , " McCain said of Obama .
" But it 's less clear what he has done , or what he will do . "
McCain and Palin were introduced at the Bethlehem , Pa. , stop by a local official who invoked Obama 's middle name , Hussein .
It 's the second time in three days that 's happened at an official McCain event , despite the campaign 's insistence it does n't condone such behavior .

Mark Wahlberg , who will play ' Irish ' Mickey Ward , hinted that Pitt 's departure has held up the film .
" They finally got the green light , " he told Coming Soon .
" Now we have to figure out the cast thing . "
Wahlberg added that he had been training for two years for The Fighter , saying : " It 's too depressing to talk about .
I get up everyday at 5 am to train for a movie that might not even happen . "
Aronofsky , whose upcoming film The Wrestler has received a positive critical reaction on the festival circuit , is currently circling a Robocop remake .

Wow .
Probably the biggest gaffe McCain has ever made , saying that he ’d refuse to catch Osama bin Laden if he had him in his sights .
Specifically , McCain and Palin have said that if they knew where bin Laden was hiding in Pakistan , and the Pakistani government refused to go in and get him for us , McCain and Palin would let bin Laden go free rather than going in and getting him ourselves .
Let me repeat : McCain and Palin would refuse to grab Osama bin Laden if he were in their sights because it would offend Pakistan , a sovereign nation .
( Talk about being beholden to the UN crowd ! )
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkt0LO3CE3I]
Barack Obama has said that he would grab bin Laden .
This infuriated McCain and Palin ( though Palin , to be fair , agreed with Obama , twice , a month ago – she ’s just catching up on her bin Laden lessons at McCain University ) .
McCain is all worried about hurting Pakistan ’s feelings , or something .
( He ’s such a sensitive guy now that he wears $ 8,000 worth of make - up . )
It ’s really quite astounding , McCain would let a mass murdering terrorist go free .
Good luck justifying that one to the American people .
I ca n’t understand why the Obama people have n’t jumped on this more strongly ( sic Biden on it ) .
I can see Obama or Biden now , saying something like this :
My opponent and I have a fundamental disagreement .
If I had Osama bin Laden in my sights , I would grab him .
John McCain and Sarah Palin have said , vehemently , that they would let Osama bin Laden go free .
We just fundamentally disagree on this point .
John McCain and Sarah Palin are more worried about hurting a foreign government ’s feelings than catching the man who mass - murdered nearly 3,000 Americans .
When McCain and Palin told us they were putting country first , we should have asked them which country .
Talk about erratic .
The media needs to ask McCain and Palin , point blank , would you or would you not let Osama bin Laden go if you had him in your sights ?
Do n’t let them worm out of it – they ’ve said quite clearly that they would let him go if the Pakistanis said “ no . ”
Ask them again and make them defend this horrendous admission .
In this case , it 's the economy that 's under water — and people are losing their houses due to foreclosures , not flood waters .
The government was behind the curve from the start , these experts say .
Communication was poor and organizational efforts were slow and often ineffective .
" The government acted as if it was initially on top of it and knew it was doing the right thing , " says Jonathan Bernstein of Los Angeles - based Bernstein Crisis Management .
" It came out later that they clearly did n't . "
No one escapes blame either .
Congress , President Bush , Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and even House Leader Nancy Pelosi — all made key mistakes , the pros say .
" As a result , " Bernstein says , " far more damage occurred than if they had been honest , organized , compassionate and understood the threat and did n't get into a position to respond to it before it was too late . "
First and foremost , the government was unprepared , even if the crisis was unprecedented and snowballed in ways no one could ever imagine .
" The administration did n't seem to have a plan prior to this , " says Neil C. Livingstone , Chairman and CEO of ExecutiveAction , which represents CIS countries , large companies and sports and entertainment figures .
" Surely someone should have been tasked with some contingency planning . "
He says Exxon was heavily criticized for its handling of the Valdez oil spill in the early going because its executives " did not seem engaged . "
The government has been paying for that critical misstep at the start and has since compounded the problem .
" When you are slow to respond to a crisis , you get deeper in the hole , and the longer it takes to dig yourself out , " says Larry Smith , a former press secretary for Sen .
Dan Quayle who runs the Institute for Crisis Management , a consulting firm representing religious and educational groups , as well as companies .
That slippery slope is partly illustrated by the number of measures being used and apparent shifts in strategy , which have sometimes failed to manage market expectations , causing stock market selloffs .
" When it 's absolutely predictable that there is going to be an emotional reaction that is damaging , the best thing you can do is be proactive , " says Bernstein , who 's clients include Fortune 100 companies .
It ’s taken some time , but finally Tina Brown , the grande dame of the Anglo - American media , has gone digital .
On 6 October , Brown – the former editor of the New Yorker , Tatler and Vanity Fair magazines and the author of last year ’s best - selling The Diana Chronicles – launched a new web - only publication called the Daily Beast ( www.dailybeast.com), after the Fleet Street newspaper in Evelyn Waugh ’s Scoop .
Unlike William
Boot , the inept victim in Scoop who is accidentally dispatched to Africa as a foreign correspondent by the editor of the Daily Beast , there appears nothing accidental or inept about Brown ’s involvement with TheDailyBeast.com .
Bankrolled by the New York City - based media mogul and chief executive officer / chairman of Inter - ActiveCorp ( IAC ) , Barry Diller , Brown ’s website is designed to combine her own editorial and design sensibility and what she described as her “ wide Rolodex ” of distinguished writers ( such as the satirist Christopher Buckley and historian Sean Wilentz ) with all the virtues of fastpaced , interactive , multimedia internet publications .
The internet , it would seem , has swept Brown off her feet .
“ I did n’t expect to love it as much as I have , ” she confessed when we spoke last week on the telephone .
What Brown particularly adores about the net is its immediacy ; a story can be commissioned in the afternoon and published the next morning , she said , citing the example of a piece about David Cameron by the Daily Mail columnist Peter Oborne , which she published in immediate response to an op - ed article about the Tories the day before in The New York Times by the conservative columnist David Brooks .
Brown , of course , is far from being the first traditional publisher to fall in love with the online medium .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Given the millions of publications that already clutter up the internet , I asked her , is there really a need for yet another glossy content and aggregation website publishing up - to - the - minute current affairs , gossip and cultural commentary ?
The new site , Brown explained , is her attempt to tidy up all that online clutter .
Designed as a daily guide , source and aggregator of the best online content , the Daily Beast is a trademark Tina Brown publication mixing highbrow commentary and unpredictable yet non-partisan opinion with irreverent entertainment and mischief .
“ I ’m equally interested in Carla Bruni ’s new record and who is going to be the next Secretary of State , ” she said .
It ’s the internet according to Tina and her wide Rolodex – an attempt to create an online version of what she calls a “ raucous dinner party ” .
Six weeks in , and Brown is thrilled with the Daily Beast ’s progress , particularly the clarity of its design .
She ’s also delighted with the website ’s traffic which , according to the web analytics company Omniture , had a very promising 2.3 million visitors and 11.4 million page views in its first month , with a 40 per cent of traffic representing repeat visitors .
“ Can you imagine doing this for another five or 10 years ? ” I asked Brown .
“ Yes , I can , ” she said .
Her task now is to build out the website , a task she can see herself doing “ for many years ” .
Then , of course , there ’s the money – and that ’s where Diller comes in .
Brown , whose Daily Beast editorial offices are in IAC ’s New York City headquarters , is relying on Diller ’s business experience , which she summarised as “ strong vision , strong nerve ” , to turn the Daily Beast into a profitable venture through advertising sales .
Given the attrition in the print business , she expects more advertisers to commit their dollars to the kind of focused , niche online audience she ’s building at the Daily Beast .
McCain presses Bush to sell F - 16s to Taiwan
As Congress considers administration requests to sell more than $ 6 billion in military equipment to Taiwan , Republican presidential candidate John McCain wants to add more submarines and new fighter jets to the package .
The administration wants Taiwan to sell 330 Patriot Advanced Capability ( PAC - 3 ) missiles and 30 Apache Block III Longbow Attack helicopters .
But it did not agree to sell all of the weapons Taiwan had asked for — specifically , new F - 16 fighter jets , McCain said in a statement .
“ The package will not include submarines or new F - 16 aircraft .
I urge the administration to reconsider this decision , in light of its previous commitment to provide submarines and America 's previous sales of F - 16s , ” McCain said .
“ These sales — which could translate into tens of thousands of jobs here at home — would help retain America ’s edge in the production of advanced weaponry and represent a positive sign in these difficult economic times . ”
The United States should work to improve relations between China and Taiwan , McCain added .
But “ we should understand that the possibility of productive ties between Taiwan and China are enhanced , not diminished , when Taipei speaks from a position of strength . ”
McCain ’s statement comes just after China canceled senior - level visits to the United States in response to reports of the weapons sales .
“ The Chinese reaction is unfortunate and results in missed opportunities , ” Pentagon spokesman Maj .
Stewart Upton said in a statement .
“ While we are disappointed not to have these opportunities to learn more about the Chinese military 's plans and intentions , we remain ready to engage with the Chinese to build mutual trust and confidence to the degree that the Chinese are willing to work with us . ”
Ashley Todd 's assault has been confirmed to be a hoax , according to KDKA .
Police reportedly admitted Friday the attack was a hoax .
20 - year - old Ashley Todd was facing a polygraph test to be administered by officials after claiming she was brutally beaten over her political views .
Ashley Todd , who claimed she was attacked and robbed of $ 60 at an ATM in the Pittsburgh , Bloomfield area Wednesday night when a ' 6 ' 4 , 200 - pound black man ' mugged her and discovered she was a McCain / Palin supporter .
According to Todd , the man robbed her at knifepoint before noticing the McCain bumper sticker on her car - triggering him to allegedly begin beating Todd with his hands and feet and carving an odd , backwards " B " on her face with his knife .

Often , vandalism of lawn signs is committed by bored kids who are n't pursuing a political agenda .
Not excusable , but for the perps , not much different than " mailbox baseball . "
We 'll probably never know how much of the destruction mentioned in Election brings out criminal behavior , a story from Rochester 's Fox 47 , is political and how much nonpartisan mayhem :
ROCHESTER , MN ( FOX 47 ) --
The election is bringing out some criminal behavior in Rochester .
Volunteers at the Democratic headquarters say more than 1,000 DFL signs have been trashed in the past week .
Last Friday , some vandals destroyed signs on North Broadway and West Circle Drive .
Joseph Book volunteers at the DFL headquarters and says he had four lawn signs stolen from his property in Haverhill Township .
They were for Barack Obama , Al Franken , Tim Walz and Andy Welti .
" It 's desperation or frustration , or whatever you call it , " Book says .
" It 's just a sad state of affairs when one person can't talk to a neighbor civilly . "
Book says he donated around $ 400 to help replace the ruined signs along the city streets and many other volunteers have put in a lot of time to help .
Theoildrum.com 's meteorologist friend , Chuck Watson , has an updated analysis :
" Although the raw models on our page are still showing peak shut ins fairly high , they are n't properly factoring in the fact that many platforms / rigs are n't shutting in since Edouard is fairly weak and they do n't have time to get the crews off without a major and expensive push anyway .
So I 'm sticking with a peak impact of 30 % or so short term , minimal damage to the offshore infrastructure .
Onshore is an interesting situation .
We have added a list of refineries in the damage swath , along with estimated down times .
The down times are currently all sitting at 2 days , since it is anticipated that there will be no significant damage , but some precautionary actions will interfere with production .
A slight increase in intensity and this could get bad quick if the storm stays on track - lots of valuable , and , compared to the offshore stuff , very vulnerable infrastructure in the way .
70kts and no opportunity to build big waves wo n't hurt most modern rigs / platforms much , but 70kts and even a foot or two of water in a refinery is bad news .

Going - Out - of - Business Sales Not Always Such a Bargain
Once the liquidators take over , the best prices may be elsewhere .
Nov. 25 , 2008  --
Several big chains have announced they will go out of business by the end of the year .
So now come the liquidation sales .
Could their bad luck be your lucky day ?
" Good Morning America " went shopping to find out .
The Liquidators
So , for example , the sign says Linens 'n Things , but it 's really not .
Six of the largest professional liquidators run the stores now : Hilco Merchant Resources , Hudson Capital , Gordon Brothers Retail Partners , Great American Group , SB Capital Group and Tiger Capital Group .
For these companies , going out of business is a business .
Labels on Top of Labels
When we shopped at the Linens 'n Things liquidation sale , we noticed something strange .
On product after product we could peel back the surface price tags to reveal the old prices below .
For example , the surface price tag on a Calphalon saucepan said $ 124.99 .
But the one underneath said $ 109.99 .
Rachael Ray cookware ?
$ 199 on the new label , $ 179 on the old .
The tag on a curtain scarf said $ 39.99 on the top , but peel it back carefully and there was another price tag for $ 27.99 below .
Carrying a hidden camera , we asked a clerk why there were price tags on top of price tags .
She said that they were instructed to cover up old Linens 'n Things prices and replace them with the liquidators ' prices .
Liquidators hire many of the original store clerks like her to stay on , so they are familiar with how the pricing changes .
When we pointed out that the product originally was cheaper , the clerk said , " It used to be when it was on clearance .
Right now , it 's not clearance , it 's just a discount .
Not great deals at all . "
How It Works
Several clerks explained that the liquidators come in before a going - out - of - business sale and raise many prices up to the regular selling price .
Then they discount from there , starting with small percentages off and deepening the discounts as the sale goes on .
" We had [ the ] best deals before , " a clerk told us .
" Now , 20 percent , 10 percent , it 's nothing . "
Raising prices before lowering them again can result in some odd situations .
We found a curtain that the liquidator priced at $ 79.99 minus 40 percent , so we paid $ 47.99 for it , which seemed pretty good .
But when Linens 'n Things had that same curtain on clearance , we could have gotten it for $ 19.99 , according to the hidden price tag .
" Contrary to popular belief , liquidation sales are n't a great deal for the consumer , " said retail industry analyst Stephen Baker of the NPD Group .
" The liquidator is there to make money . "
Baker explained that liquidators have less leeway than regular retailers in pricing their products because they have no factory - to - dealer incentives to fall back on .
In other words , when manufacturers are trying to get their products onto store shelves and gain market share , they may discount the price they charge to retailers or provide factory rebates .
Retailers can then advertise those rebates and pass the savings along to customers .
Liquidators do n't have options like that because their store is not going to stick around .
Despite what the public might think , Baker said liquidators rarely sell merchandise at a loss , even near the end of the sale .
He said there are other ways to sell it off , like to overseas markets hungry for merchandise .
So rather than trying to empty a store to the bare walls , Baker explained that going - out - of - business sales are more of a play upon human psychology .
" Retail is all about excitement , to get people into a store and get them into a mood to spend money , " he said .
Outside Goods
Liquidators often try to take advantage of that excitement by bringing in extra outside goods that were never sold at the store that is closing .
We spotted one example at a Linens 'n Things in Fairfax , Va. Hundreds of handmade Oriental rugs were brought in as the rest of the store was emptying out .
A salesman told a member of our undercover team , " They ship it after going out of business . "
Problem is , even though the rugs were never sold at Linens 'n Things , they still came with tags that said what the price supposedly " was " and what " you will pay . "
" If I can sell it , they send some more , " the salesman told us .
He even offered to bargain over prices and make us a deal .
So we found two things never before seen at Linens 'n Things : hand - knotted Oriental rugs — and haggling .
Store Closing Sales
We also visited a Circuit City store that is closing .
It 's a different situation there .
Only 21 percent of Circuit City stores are going under , while the rest of the chain tries to stay afloat .
In that case , Circuit City has hired two liquidation companies , Hilco and Gordon Brothers , to run its going - out - of - business sales .
At Circuit City you could see where the old price tags had been cut out of the product displays with a pair of scissors .
Once again , just asking as regular shoppers , we spoke to a clerk and asked why they had gotten rid of the old prices .
" We do n't go by the Circuit City price anymore , " she told us .
" It 's the liquidators ' prices now . "
By now the description sounded familiar .
She said the liquidator had raised many rates up to the regular price before the sale began , " and then deducted the , like , 30 [ percent ] to 20 [ percent ] or 10 percent , " she told us .
So how do the liquidation prices compare overall ?
Because only part of the Circuit City chain is going out of business , it was a rare opportunity to compare prices at regular stores run by the company with those at closing stores run by the liquidators .
The two are not connected .
One example :
We saw a Samsung HDTV that was only available as an open box item at the liquidation store and cost $ 1,799 with all sales final .
But at Circuit City 's regular stores it was available for $ 1,599 brand new — $ 200 less , plus we could return it .
The clerk in the liquidation sale TV department gave us some advice .
" To be honest , I would go to a normal Circuit City for bigger TVs , " she said .
" But you did n't hear it from me . "
Of the 60 electronics products we compared , a third were the same price or less at regular Circuit City stores .
And the majority of those that were cheaper at the liquidation sale were only 5 percent to 15 percent less .
When we told consumers outside of a going - out - of - business sale about our findings they were amazed , but not surprised .
" What does going out of business mean if you are jacking up the price rather than lowering the price ? " said one woman .
" I think anything that they put a ' sale ' sign on , people are going to be more inclined to buy , " another said .
The Companies Respond
Circuit City told us its closing stores are in the hands of the liquidators now and directed us to them .
Linens N
Things dissolved itself in bankruptcy court and does n't really exist anymore .
Hilco Merchant Resources spoke for the six liquidators that are now selling Linens N Things ' merchandise and the two running the Circuit City liquidations .
Hilco said , " Federal and state laws exist to guide liquidators in going - out - of - business sales and they abide by these laws in every respect . "
Hilco acknowledged that liquidators often raise prices back to the regular selling price and then discount from there .
To explain why we found prices at regular Circuit City stores were the same or lower for a third of products we checked , Hilco said , " [ Circuit City is ] continuing to price their merchandise to be as competitive as possible with other retailers .
As a result of aggressive pricing by Circuit City , it is very possible that prices on certain items in the closing stores could be higher ... "
Hilco acknowledged it is common to bring in outside merchandise for a going - out - of - business sale .
Liquidators call it " product augmentation . "
Hilco said it was not aware that the Virginia Linens 'n Things we visited was using " before " and " after " comparison prices on its rugs .
Bagging a Bargain
So what 's the best strategy to bag a bargain ?
It 's not that you can't get good deals at going - out - of - business sales .
You can .
Just do n't assume the prices are lower there .
You need to shop around as you would with any other purchase .
For the products we priced , we often could find cheaper deals online .
Sometimes competitors that are not going out of business will drop their prices to compete with the liquidation sale , so check them out too .
And keep in mind that the discounts get deeper as the liquidation sale goes on , but the merchandise gets thinner too , so it 's a balancing act .
If you have gift cards for Linens 'n Things or Circuit City , both chains are still accepting them at their liquidation sales .
On this Nov. 6 , AP reporter Jerome Delay took this picture of two girls , Protegee carrying her niece , Response , as they looked for their parents in the village Kiwanja in the midst of the confusion of the Congo ( DRC ) civil war .
Protegee was in a crowd of thousands about 90 kms north of Goma , eastern Congo , having walked for three days by herself .
She had been separated from her mother and fled on foot from their town about 12 miles ( 20 kilometers ) away .
Encouraged by reactions from readers all over the world , the reporter returned to the spot and managed to reunite Protegee with her mother .

As capital markets around the world are being rescued by national governments , global unemployment is reaching record levels and the labor market is expanding by tens of millions of workers each year .
In the face of the twin challenges of stagnating economies and climate change , stimulating green industry is more important than ever , according to a new assessment released by the Worldwatch Institute .
â€ œItâ€™s time for a bailout for the environment : one that creates jobs , is global in scope , and can help rebuild communities amidst the ashes of the current economic crisis , â€ says Michael Renner , co-author of the report , Green Jobs : Working for People and the Environment , written in collaboration with Sean Sweeney and Jill Kubit of Cornell University ’s Global Labor Institute . *
Green jobs are not only about renewable energy employment .
Reengineering buildings , transportation systems , agriculture , and basic industry all have the potential to create jobs that help reduce humanityâ€™s carbon footprint and protect the environment .
The report provides an overview of green jobs by sector :
In China , renewable energy technologies employ an estimated 1 million people in the wind , solar PV , solar thermal , and biomass industries .
The building and construction sector employs more than 111 million people worldwide .
Retrofitting the European Unionâ€™s residential building sector to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 75 percent would lead to some 2.6 million new jobs by 2030
.
Jobs in manufacturing fuel - efficient cars remain limited in number .
Public transit offers a greener alternative .
In the United States , transit agencies employed some 367,000 people in 2005 .
An estimated 900,000 people are employed in urban public transport in the European Union .
The steel , aluminum , cement , and paper industries are highly energy - intensive and polluting .
Worldwide , more than 40 percent of steel output and one - quarter of aluminum production is based on recycled scrap , rendering the estimated quarter million jobs in these two sectors at least a â€œshade of green.â€ 
Recycling programs create as many as 15 million jobs worldwide , but can entail dirty , undesirable , poorly paid , and even dangerous work , particularly in developing countries .
In Brazil , over 90 percent of recyclable material is collected by scrap collectors who have organized themselves into a national movement with 500 cooperatives and 60,000 collectors .
A study of 1,144 organic farms in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland showed that organic farms employed on average one - third more employees per farm than conventional counterparts .
In the Dominican Republic , organic farms are reducing the movement from rural to metropolitan areas with local employment opportunities .
Nearly 1.2 billion people depend on agroforestry for subsistence and income , particularly in Africa , Asia , and Latin America .
Planting trees on agricultural land provides multiple environmental benefits and can raise farm incomes .
Addressing the climate challenge in particular requires a multipronged approach that can create jobs , according to the report .
This approach prioritizes the development of more environmentally benign technologies ; greater efficiency of energy , water , and raw material use ; altered lifestyle and consumption choices ; economic restructuring ; and environmental restoration efforts .
It also requires adaptation to those changes that now seem inevitable and perhaps irreversible .
While there is significant untapped potential in the green jobs sector , not all news is good , according to the report .
Global unemployment stands at roughly 6 percent , affecting some 190 million people .
Some 487 million workers do not earn enough yet to rise above the $ 1 - a - day level of extreme poverty .
Furthermore , green investments are found primarily in a relatively small number of countries .
Green jobs development is still an exception in most developing countries , which account for some 80 percent of the worldâ€™s workforce .
Other issues include the rising level of informality in the global economy , a lack of rules and standards to help ensure decent jobs , and the fact that environmental costs are too often externalized , making it harder for green enterprises to compete .
Integrating social and environmental aspects into the cost of doing business and undertaking large - scale public and private sector investments will be key to realizing the massive potential that green jobs hold .
Government targets , mandates , business incentives , and reformed tax and subsidy policies must promote sustainable development in order for the green labor market to take off .
â€ œGiven all of the uncertainties in todayâ€™s world , itâ€™s time for a bold commitment and international cooperation to promote green economies that support conservation , low carbon technologies , recycling , and local communities , â€ says Renner .
â€ œI canâ€™t see how weâ€™ll escape our twin economic and environmental crises if we donâ€™t.â€ 

New law to allow police to collect DNA in secret from teacups
MI5 and the police may be allowed to secretly collect genetic samples from items such as cigarette butts and teacups under new laws that could massively expand the national DNA database .
The powers would allow investigators to break in to suspects ’ homes to collect DNA which could then be shared with foreign governments to check for links to crime and terrorism .
The new law , being discussed by Parliament , would mean the ‘ stolen ’ samples – thousands of which have already been taken by the security services – would be admissible in court and at a stroke hugely expand the Government ’s controversial DNA database .
Concern : Minister Lord
West wants data shared between governments
But human rights activists fear the new powers could lead to more innocent people having their DNA stored and , due to cross-contamination , being wrongly accused of crimes or terrorism .
The proposals , which are contained in the Counter - Terrorism Bill , were outlined last week by Security Minister Lord West in the wake of Labour ’s unsuccessful attempt to introduce legislation to hold terror suspects for 42 days without charge .
The move comes despite growing fears about the rapid expansion of the national database , which stores the details of 4.2 million people , including 573,639 who have not been convicted , cautioned or reprimanded for any offence .
Lord West said : ‘ During surveillance , a DNA sample may be obtained without a warrant .
A good example might be where a person discards a cigarette or a drinks container .
It can be collected covertly and a sample taken .
‘ Or , should a covert human intelligence source be used , the person under surveillance could visit the source ’s house and a sample could be taken from a teacup .
‘ There is a real need to share this data internationally , especially where terrorism is concerned . ’
But opponents say taking DNA samples without their being cross-contaminated is difficult , even for trained specialists .
Last night Dr Helen Wallace of watchdog group Genewatch said : ‘ This kind of DNA collection leads to a real danger of cross-contamination or genetic samples being taken from a person who may prove to be innocent . ’
Gareth Crossman , policy director of human rights group Liberty , said : ‘ Authorities will be able to take our DNA without our knowledge , without any formal legal process , and retain it regardless of whether a suspect is arrested .
‘ It will be carte blanche for them to take DNA and to keep that in perpetuity . ’
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked Royal Dutch Shell from drilling oil wells off Alaska ’s North Slope after finding that the Interior Department had failed to conduct an environmental study before issuing the company ’s drilling permit .
In a long - awaited ruling , the court said that the Minerals Management Service , the federal agency in charge of offshore leasing , had violated the 1970 National Environmental Policy
Act by failing to take a “ hard look ” at the impact that offshore drilling would have on bowhead whales in the Beaufort Sea as well as indigenous communities on the North Slope .
The decision canceled Shell ’s permit to drill at a prospect called Sivulliq , about 16 miles off northern Alaska , and ordered the agency to begin the process from scratch .
“ There remain substantial questions as to whether Shell ’s plan may cause significant harm to the people and wildlife of the Beaufort Sea region , ” the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit , in San Francisco , said in its ruling .
One judge , Carlos T. Bea , on the three - judge panel dissented .
Hmm .
Sarah Palin says in Omaha that she came to Nebraska not for strategic reasons or because the congressional district around Omaha is in play , but because she wanted to visit Nebraska .
Palin suggested that the obvious political ramifications had nothing to do with her decision to come here .
“ And you can ask — and probably the reporters will ask — the top dogs in our campaign why am I in Nebraska , and it ’s truly because I asked to come to the heartland of America today , ” she said .

Both map :: ( a -> b ) -> [ a ] -> [ b ] ( in [ ] ) -- and (. ) :: ( a -> b ) -> ( e -> a ) -> ( e -> b ) ( in ( ->) e ) -- are good names , and are intuitively prefix and infix respectively .

Kleisli as M
Epic Games is a privately owned company and does not disclose its earnings .
But on a Monday morning in late April , while standing in Epic ’s parking lot , at Crossroads Corporate Park , in Cary , North Carolina , awaiting the arrival of Cliff Bleszinski , the company ’s thirty - three - year - old design director , I realized that my surroundings were their own sort of Nasdaq .
Ten feet away was a red Hummer H3 .
Nearby was a Lotus Elise , and next to it a pumpkin - orange Porsche .
Many of the cars had personalized plates : “ PS3CODER ” ( a reference to Sony ’s PlayStation3 ) , “ EPICBOY , ” “ GRSOFWAR . ”
Cliff Bleszinski at Epic Games ’s offices .
Photograph by Phil Toledano
The last is shorthand for Gears of War , a shooter game , which Epic released in November , 2006 , for play on Microsoft ’s Xbox 360 console .
Gears of War was quickly recognized as the first game to provide the sensually overwhelming experience for which the console , launched a year earlier , had been designed .
Gears won virtually every available industry award , and was the 360 ’s best - selling game for nearly a year ; it has now sold five million copies .
On November 7th , a sequel , Gears of War 2 , will be released ; its development , long rumored , was not confirmed until this past February , when , at the Game Developers ’ Conference , in San Francisco , Bleszinski made the announcement after bursting through an onstage partition wielding a replica of one of Gears of War ’s signature weapons — an assault rifle mounted with a chainsaw bayonet .
Despite the rapid growth of the video - game industry — last year , sales were higher than either box - office receipts or DVD sales — designers are largely invisible within the wider culture .
But Bleszinski , who is known to his many fans and occasional detractors as CliffyB , tends to stand out among his colleagues .
Heather Chaplin and Aaron Ruby ’s “ Smartbomb , ” a book about the industry , recounts the peacockish outfits and hair styles he has showcased at industry expos over the years .
In 2001 , he affected the stylings of a twenty - first - century Tom Wolfe , with white snakeskin shoes and bleached hair .
In 2002 , he took to leather jackets and an early - Clooney Caesar cut .
By 2003 , he was wearing long fur - lined coats , his hair skater - punk red .
In recent years , he let his hair grow shaggy , which gave him the mellow aura of a fourth Bee Gee .
Bleszinski drove into Epic ’s parking lot in a red Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder , the top down despite an impending rainstorm .
His current haircut is short and cowlicked , his bangs twirled up into a tiny moussed horn .
He was wearing what in my high school would have been called “ exchange - student jeans ” — obviously expensive but slightly the wrong color and of a somehow non-American cut .
Beneath a tight , fashionably out - of - style black nylon jacket was a T - shirt that read “ TECHNOLOGY ! ”
His sunglasses were of the oversized , county - sheriff variety , and each of his earlobes held a small , bright diamond earring .
He could have been either a boyish Dolce & Gabbana model or a small - town weed dealer .
Bleszinski suggested that we go to a local diner .
He professes an aversion to mornings , and to Monday mornings especially , but he seemed dauntingly alert .
“ This car ’s like a wakeup call , ” he said .
“ By the time I get to work , my heart ’s pumping and I ’m ready to crank . ”
Before we were even out of the parking lot , we were travelling at forty - five miles an hour .
At a stoplight , Bleszinski exchanged waves with the driver of an adjacent red Ferrari — another Epic employee .
When we hit a hundred miles per hour on a highway entrance ramp , Bleszinski announced , “ Never got one ticket ! ”
On the highway , he slowed to seventy - five .
“ One of my jobs in life , ” Bleszinski said , cutting over to an exit , “ is to make this look a little cooler . ”
By “ this , ” he meant his job .
Bleszinski’s brand of mild outrageousness — the “ Cliffycam ” on his blog page , which , some years ago , allowed visitors to observe him online while he worked ; the photographs of him on his MySpace page alongside the splatter - film director Eli Roth and the porn stars Jenna Jameson and Ron Jeremy — qualifies him as exceptional in an industry that is , as he says , widely assumed to be a preserve inhabited by pale , withdrawn , molelike creatures .
There is some truth to this stereotype : most game designers are not like CliffyB .
But neither , really , is Bleszinski .
The nickname , he told me , was bestowed on him by some “ jock kid , ” when he was a small , shy teen - ager , and was meant as a taunt .
Bleszinski took the name and fashioned a tougher persona around it , but , after spending a little time with him , one has the sensation of watching someone observing himself .
Video games are founded upon such complicated transference .
Gamers are allowed , for a time , all manner of ontological assumptions .
They can also terminate their assumed personalities whenever they wish , and , lately , Bleszinski has been asking game - industry journalists if they might not “ sit on ” the CliffyB moniker “ for a while . ”
Bleszinski was born in Boston , in 1975 , eleven years to the day after the birth of his oldest brother , Greg .
His father , whom Bleszinski describes as a “ very stressed - out guy , ” was an engineer for Polaroid .
The Bleszinskis were a close family .
His mother , Karyn , told me , “ We always sat down at the dinner table together .
That was always important to my husband and me . ”
One of Bleszinski ’s earliest and strongest memories is the smell of popcorn spreading thickly throughout the house after he had gone to bed , which convinced him that his “ parents were having a great time and throwing a party ” without him .
In truth , this was merely his father ’s pre-bedtime ritual : over this nightly bowl of popcorn he would often melt an entire stick of butter .
In 1990 , when Bleszinski was fifteen , his forty - seven - year - old father died when an aortic aneurysm ruptured while he was golfing .
Bleszinski still remembers what game he was playing when he learned of his father ’s death : the Nintendo game Blaster Master .
He never played it again .
“ He took it very hard , ” Karyn told me .
She described Bleszinski as her “ unique child , ” noting that he was “ the most difficult , but he was difficult because he was the most inquisitive .
He ’d take apart whatever you got for him . ”
After her husband ’s death , Karyn moved the family to the Los Angeles suburbs , where she worked as a restaurant manager .
In 1991 , she bought a computer for her son .
“ I ’m not that technical of a guy , ” Bleszinski told me .
“ I started off programming my own games and doing the art for them , but I was a crappy coder and a crappier artist .
But I did n’t want to let that stop me .
I was going to kick and scream and claw my way into the business any way possible . ”
He thinks that it was perhaps only the death of his father that allowed him to do this .
“ If he had n’t passed , he probably would have made me go to Northeastern and become an engineer , ” he said .
In 1992 , a year after Bleszinski had taught himself the rudiments of computer programming , he sent a game submission to Tim Sweeney , the twenty - two - year - old C.E.O. of Epic Megagames , who had recently dropped out of a mechanical - engineering program at the University of Maryland .
( Epic ’s original name , Sweeney told me , was “ a big scam ” to make it look legitimate .
“ When you ’re this one single person in your parents ’ garage trying to start a company , you want to look like you ’re really big , ” he said . )
Sweeney still remembers Bleszinski ’s submission , a P.C. game called Dare to Dream , in which a boy gets trapped , appropriately enough , inside his own dreamworld .
“ At that time , ” Sweeney said , “ we ’d gotten sixty or seventy game submissions from different people and we went ahead with five of them , and Cliff was one of the best . ”
Once his game was in development , Bleszinski became more involved with the company .
Sweeney said , “ We ’d have four or five different projects in development with different teams , and every time one started to reach completion we ’d send it off to Cliff , and he ’d write off his big list of what ’s good about this game and what needs to be fixed .
Cliff ’s lists kept growing bigger and bigger . ”
Bleszinski was only seventeen .
When I asked Sweeney if he had had any reservations about entrusting his company ’s fate to a teen - ager whose driver ’s - license lamination was still warm , Sweeney said , “ That ’s what the industry was like . ”
Upon its release , Dare to Dream , in Bleszinski ’s words , “ bombed . ”
His second game for Epic , released a year later , featured what he calls a “ Rambo rabbit ” named Jazz , who carried a large gun and hunted frenetically for intergalactic treasure .
Jazz Jackrabbit , which imported to a P.C. platform innovations previously exclusive to Sega and Nintendo consoles , made Bleszinski ’s reputation .
Epic had begun as a company churning out somewhat rechauffé fare — pinball simulators , clone - ish retreads , an uninspired but popular game known as Unreal Tournament .
It was Bleszinski , in no small part , who filled Epic ’s parking lot with sports cars .
At the diner , I asked Bleszinski which games had most influenced him .
Super Mario Brothers , he said , “ is where it really kicked into high gear . ”
Indeed , the first issue of Nintendo Power , published in 1988 , listed the high scores of a handful of Super Mario devotees , the thirteen - year - old Bleszinski ’s among them .
“ There ’s something about the whole hidden element to Mario , where you jump and hit your head on a block and just out of nowhere secret things would appear , ” Bleszinski said .
“ They made you feel like a kid in the woods . ”
Issued in 1985 , Super Mario Brothers was a game of summer - vacation - consuming scope and unprecedented inventiveness .
It was among the first video games to suggest that it might contain a world .
It was also hallucinogenically strange .
Why did mushrooms make Mario grow larger ?
Why did flowers give Mario the ability to spit fire ?
Why did bashing Mario ’s head against bricks sometimes produce coins ?
And why was Mario ’s enemy , Bowser , a saurian , spiky - shelled turtle ?
In film and literature , such surrealistic fantasy typically occurs at the outer edge of experimentalism , but early video games depended on symbols for the simple reason that the technological limitations of the time made realism impossible .
Mario , for instance , wore a porkpie hat not for aesthetic reasons but because hair was too difficult to render .
Bleszinski retains affection for many older games , but he says , “ If you go back and play the majority of old games , they really are n’t very good . ”
He suspects that what made them seem so good at the time was the imaginative involvement of players : “ You wanted to believe , you wanted to fill in the gaps . ”
“ I ’d vote for her , but Election Day is the opening of moose season . ”

Games like Gears of War , which offer literal representations of what the gamer “ sees ” and “ does , ” differ so profoundly from a game like Super Mario Brothers that they appear to share as many commonalities as a trilobite does with a Great Dane .
The new games fill in all the gaps , and they have also done away with many of the symbolic prerequisites of video - game play , such as the number of “ lives ” a player has , the score , health bars , and so on .
In Gears , there is no score .
The player gets a single life ; if it is forfeited , one must start again at the nearest passed checkpoint .
The health bar is invisible ; the only indication of one ’s injury status is a gradually reddening icon , known as the Crimson Omen .
Super Mario requires an ability to recognize patterns , considerable hand - eye coördination , and quick reflexes .
Gears requires the ability to think tactically and make subtle judgments based on scant information , a constant awareness of multiple variables ( ammunition stores , enemy weaknesses ) as they change throughout the game , and the spatial sensitivity to control one ’s movement through a space in which the “ right ” direction is not always apparent .
Anyone who plays modern games such as Gears does not so much learn the rules as develop a kind of intuition for how the game operates .
Often , there is no single way to accomplish a given task ; improvisation is rewarded .
Older games , like Super Mario , punish improvisation : you live or die according to their algebra alone .
Gears is largely the story of a soldier , Marcus Fenix , who , as the game begins , has been imprisoned for abandoning his comrades ( who are known as COGs , or Gears ) in order to save his father , who dies before Fenix can reach him .
He is released because a fourteen - year war with a tunnel - using alien army known as the Locusts has depleted the human army ’s ranks .
This much we learn in the first two minutes of the game ; the next ten hours or so are an ingeniously paced march through frequent and elaborately staged firefights with Locusts , Wretches , Dark Wretches , Corpsers , Boomers , three blind and terrifying Berserkers , and the vile General Raam .
Along the way , players can treat themselves to the singular experience of using the chainsaw bayonets on their Lancer assault rifles to cut their enemies in half , during which the in - game camera is gleefully splashed with blood .
( Gears is one of the most violent games ever made , but Bleszinski maintains that it contains “ very much a laughable kind of violence , ” like “ watching a melon explode in a Gallagher show . ”
Still , one act of violence in Gears 2 is intimate and upsetting enough to have given one of the designers pause , until Bleszinski and others convinced him that the act grew out of a necessary dramatic trajectory . )
The story line and the narrative dilemmas of Gears are not very sophisticated .
What is sophisticated about Gears is its mood .
The world in which the action takes place is a kind of destroyed utopia ; its architecture , weapons , and characters are chunky and oversized but , somehow , never cartoonish .
Most video - game worlds , however well conceived , are essenceless .
Gears felt dirty and inhabited , and everything from the mechanics of its gameplay to its elliptical backstory was forcefully conceived , giving it an experiential depth rare in the genre .
White Knight Debuts Natural Gas-Powered Dryer
November 18th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
I always feel guilty when I use my dryer — after all , wo n’t my clothes dry just as well hanging on a clothesline ?
Fortunately , a British company called White Knight has come up with a way to ease my guilt .
The recently Eco Tumble Dryer runs on natural gas and has half the carbon footprint of a comparable British electricity - powered dryer .
The dryers are n’t totally electricity - free , however — a tiny amount of electricity is used to turn the drum .
Still , 90 percent of the dryer is powered by natural gas .
You can buy the Eco43A and Eco83A models now for £ 350 and £ 370 , respectively .

" What is the interest for my family ? "
" The Great Transformation , "
" fascism , like socialism , was rooted in a market society that refused to function . "
- Marlon Brando as Don Corleone ( The Godfather , 1972 ) .
" It is no longer our economy but our democracy that is in peril .
It was the economic meltdown of Yugoslavia that gave us Slobodan Milosevic .
It was the collapse of the Weimar Republic that vomited up Adolf Hitler .
And it was the breakdown in czarist Russia that opened the door for Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks .
Financial collapses lead to political extremism .
The rage bubbling up from our impoverished and disenfranchised working class , glimpsed at John McCain rallies , presages a looming and dangerous right - wing backlash .
As the public begins to grasp the depth of the betrayal and abuse by our ruling class , as the Democratic and Republican parties are exposed as craven tools of our corporate state , as savings accounts , college funds and retirement plans become worthless , as unemployment skyrockets and as home values go up in smoke we must prepare for the political resurgence of a reinvigorated radical Christian right .
The engine of this mass movement - as is true for all radical movements - is personal and economic despair .
And despair , in an age of increasing shortages , poverty and hopelessness , will be one of our few surplus commodities .
Karl Polanyi in his bookwritten in 1944 , laid out the devastating consequences - the depressions , wars and totalitarianism - that grow out of a so - called self - regulated free market .
He grasped that He warned that a financial system always devolved , without heavy government control , into a Mafia capitalism - and a Mafia political system - which is a good description of the American government under George W. Bush .
Polanyi wrote that a self - regulating market , the kind bequeathed to us since Ronald Reagan , turned human beings and the natural environment into commodities , a situation that ensures the destruction of both society and the natural environment .
He decried the free market 's belief that nature and human beings are objects whose worth is determined by the market .
He reminded us that a society that no longer recognizes that nature and human life have a sacred dimension , an intrinsic worth beyond monetary value , ultimately commits collective suicide .
Such societies cannibalize themselves until they die .
Speculative excesses and growing inequality always destroy the foundation for a continued prosperity .
The corporate con artists and criminals who have hijacked our state and rigged our financial system still speak to us in the obscure and incomprehensible language coined by specialists at elite business schools .
They use terms like securitization , deleveraging , structured investment vehicles and credit default swaps .
The reality , once you throw out their obnoxious jargon , is not hard to grasp .
Banks lent too much money to people and financial institutions that could not pay it back .
These banks are now going broke .
The government is frantically giving taxpayer dollars to banks so they can be solvent and again lend money .
It is not working .
Bank lending remains frozen .
There are ominous signs that the government may not be able to hand over enough of our money because the losses incurred by these speculators are too massive .
The downward spiral could spread like a tidal wave across the country , especially since our corporate elite , including Barack Obama , seem to have no real intention of bailing out families who can no longer pay their mortgages or credit card debts .
Lenin said that the best way to destroy the capitalist system was to debauch its currency .
If our financial disaster continues there will be a widespread loss of faith in the mechanisms that regulate society .
If our money becomes worthless , so does our government .
All traditional standards and beliefs are shattered in a severe economic crisis .
The moral order is turned upside down .
The honest and industrious are wiped out while the gangsters , profiteers and speculators amass millions .
Look at Lehman Brothers CEO Richard Fuld .
He walks away from his bankrupt investment house after pocketing $ 485 million .
His investors are wiped out .
An economic collapse does not only mean the degradation of trade and commerce , food shortages , bankruptcies and unemployment ; it means the systematic dynamiting of the foundations of a society .
The Patriot Act , the FISA Reform Act , the suspension of habeas corpus , the open use of torture in our offshore penal colonies , the stationing of a combat brigade on American soil , the seas of surveillance cameras , the brutal assaults against activists in Denver and St. Paul are converging to determine our future .
Those dark forces arrayed against American democracy are waiting for a moment to strike , a national crisis that will allow them in the name of national security and moral renewal to shred the Constitution .
They have the tools .
They will use fear , chaos , the hatred for the ruling elites and the specter of left - wing dissent and terrorism to impose draconian controls to extinguish our democracy .
And while they do it they will be waving the American flag , singing patriotic slogans and clutching the Christian cross .
This is a defining moment in American history .
The next few weeks and months will see us stabilize and weather this crisis or descend into a terrifying dystopia .
I place no hope in Obama or the Democratic Party .
The Democratic Party is a pathetic example of liberal , bourgeois impotence , hypocrisy and complacency .
It has been bought off .
I would like to offer hope , but it is more important to be a realist .
No ethic or act of resistance is worth anything if it is not based on the real .
And the real , I am afraid , does not look good .

Obama has widened his lead in Franklin County , Ohio ; McCain has gained ground in Hillsborough County , Fla .
Poll : Obama up in Ohio , tied in Florida
Sen .
John McCain has improved his odds of capturing one of Florida ’s most competitive counties at the same time a crucial Ohio battleground seems increasingly out of reach , according to a new Politico / InsiderAdvantage poll .
While Sen. Barack Obama has widened his lead in Ohio ’s Franklin County , where Columbus is located , McCain has gained ground in Hillsborough County , which includes the city of Tampa and is one of the Sunshine State ’s most competitive areas .

McCain trails Obama in Hillsborough by just two points , 46 percent to 44 percent .
That represents a four - point improvement for McCain since Politico ’s last Hillsborough survey , conducted October 12 , which showed Obama leading 47 percent to 41 percent .
But Obama has strengthened his standing in Ohio ’s Franklin County , where he currently holds an 11 - point lead over McCain , outpacing the Republican nominee by 51 percent to 40 percent .
Politico ’s previous poll of Franklin County , conducted October 13 , showed a closer race there , with Obama ahead by just five percentage points , 45 percent to 40 percent .
According to the Politico / InsiderAdvantage poll , Obama leads statewide in Ohio by 52 percent to 42 percent .
In Florida , the statewide survey shows Obama with a one - point lead , with 48 percent of poll respondents naming him as their choice for president , compared with 47 percent who chose McCain .
“ It ’s tightened a little bit in Hillsborough and it ’s tightened a little bit statewide , ” said InsiderAdvantage pollster Matt Towery .
“ It would still be leaning Obama , in my opinion , both the county and the state , but tightening . ”
Obama ’s lead in Franklin County comes in large part from his strength among male voters , Towery said .
“ [ McCain ’s ] doing worse with males than he ’s doing with females , and Obama ’s picking up the lion ’s share of independents in this particular county . ”
Franklin County women currently prefer Obama , 48 percent to 44 percent .
Among men , Obama leads by a surprising , 15 - point margin , 53 percent to 38 percent .
“ This is not good news for John McCain , ” Towery said .
“ This county is just so representative of what ’s going on in Ohio . ”
McCain ’s performance among men is stronger statewide .
He trails Obama by 7 points among men , 42 percent to 49 percent , rather than by 15 points as in Franklin County .
Obama currently leads among female voters in Ohio , 54 percent to 42 percent .
“ If [ McCain ] ca n’t do something about that male percentage he ’s a dead duck in Ohio , ” Towery said .
In 2004 , President George W. Bush won male voters in Ohio , 52 percent to 47 percent , and tied among female voters .
As Election Day draws closer , both presidential tickets have zeroed in on Ohio and Florida as possible keys to victory , and both have spent time campaigning in those states in recent days .
McCain stumped Thursday in Sarasota , Fla. , and Palin rallied supporters in Troy , Ohio .
On Wednesday , both members of the Republican ticket campaigned in Ohio .
Earlier in the week , Obama spent two days in Florida , campaigning alongside his former rival , Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton and visiting Miami , Pensacola , Orlando – and Tampa .
Recent polls have shown varied results in Florida .
A Mason - Dixon poll released Wednesday showed McCain with a one - point lead in the state , though a St. Petersburg Times poll released Thursday placed Obama seven points ahead of his rival , leading 49 percent to 42 percent .
For McCain , Florida is an absolute must - win battleground because it is virtually impossible for him to get to the 270 electoral votes needed for victory without the state ’s 27 electoral votes .
In theory , McCain could make up for a loss in Ohio by picking up Pennsylvania , but it would be a hard blow to lose a state with 20 electoral votes that President Bush won twice .
The latest wave of polls from Ohio have shown Obama building a substantial lead there , with a Thursday Quinnipiac University survey giving him a 14 - point lead , a Big Ten poll released the same day showing him ahead by 12 points and a CNN / TIME magazine poll giving the Democrat a tighter , 4 - point lead .
Previous Politico / InsiderAdvantage polling has shown Obama even with or ahead of McCain in a crucial set of battleground counties , including Hillsborough ; Franklin ; Jefferson County , Co. ; St. Louis County , Mo. ; Washoe County , Nev. ; Wake County , N.C. ; Bucks County , Pa. and Prince William County , Va .
The Politico / InsiderAdvantage poll of Florida ’s Hillsborough County , conducted Oct. 22 , tested 295 voters with a margin of error of plus or minus six percentage points .
In the statewide poll of Florida , also conducted Oct. 22 , there were 562 respondents with a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points .
The poll of Ohio ’s Franklin County , conducted Oct. 22 , had 432 respondents for a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points .
The Ohio statewide poll , also conducted Oct. 22 , tested 408 voters with a five - point margin of error .
I TOLD you this pup was the size of a hamster .

The son of a Tennessee state lawmaker has pleaded not guilty to hacking the email account of Republican vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin .
David Kernell , 20 , of Knoxville , Tennessee , entered the plea in federal court in Knoxville , on Wednesday , the same day prosecutors unsealed an indictment charging him with intentionally accessing Mrs Palin 's email account without authorisation .
Kernell , an economics student at the University of Tennessee , was brought into court wearing handcuffs and shackles on his ankles .
Johnny Henry of Laurel , Mississippi claims that the vibrating toilet seat he has concocted " is designed to stimulate , ” he said .
“ It ’s to make you feel good while you are there . ”
In other words , it seduces and stimulates stubborn bowels into action .
Mmmm ... sounds like how I would like to spend part of my morning between 8 and 9 am ( right after two cups of coffee and something with bran in it ) .
The good news is that Henry has developed a prototype and is already pitching it to investors .
With any luck , we will all be chillin ' in the bathroom with a vibrating seat and a whole pack of 3 ply sometime soon .

Concern grows over a fiscal crisis for U.S .
As the Bush administration proposes backstopping mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with a $ 300 billion line of credit and Congress contemplates another economic stimulus , the question is who will bail out the government ?
" People seem to think the government has money , " said former U.S. Comptroller General David Walker .
" The government does n't have any money . "
A rare consensus has developed across the political spectrum that the government 's own fiscal affairs are precarious , with an astonishing $ 53 trillion in long - term liabilities , according to the Government Accountability Office .
To put that number in human terms , the debt has reached $ 455,000 per U.S. household .
As that debt grows , the United States increasingly relies on foreigners , including China and Middle East oil producers , for financing .
" The factors that contributed to our mortgage - based subprime crisis exist with regard to our federal government 's finances , " said Walker , now head of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation , a group established to raise alarms about the nation 's budget .
" The difference is that the magnitude of the federal government 's financial situation is at least 25 times greater . "
Baby Boomers
This year 's presidential election coincides with the first retirements of the 78 million people born between 1946 and 1964 .
The first of this Baby Boom generation may now collect Social Security .
In three years , they will join Medicare , the giant health care program whose finances are commonly described as out of control .
Medicare accounts for the bulk of the nation 's long - term liabilities .
The presidential candidates , Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama , have not addressed what the aging of the Baby Boom generation means for the federal government .
Their brief forays - Obama 's suggestions to raise the payroll tax on high - income earners to buttress Social Security and McCain 's description of Social Security 's financing as a disgrace - have been met with furious attacks .
Both promise to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on new tax cuts and spending programs .
Their health care proposals concentrate more on expanding access than controlling the soaring costs that are driving the federal budget problems and squeezing workers and businesses .
Health care costs
" Health care costs are just amazing , " said John Shoven , director of Stanford University 's Institute for Economic Policy Research .
Total health care costs now consume 16 percent of the economy and are headed quickly toward 30 percent , Shoven said .
" Social Security is a big problem , but it 's dwarfed by health care .
Even the housing problem is dwarfed by health care . "
Just the built - in rise in spending on programs for the elderly will cost about 25 percent of workers ' payrolls over the next generation , said Richard Jackson , director of the Global Aging Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies .
Robert Greenstein , director of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , agreed that " the nation faces large , persistent , long - term deficits that ultimately risk damage to the economy .
We agree that policymakers have to make tough choices soon . "
There is consensus , too , on what needs to be done :
Cut spending and raise taxes .
A bigger problem is how to contain health care costs , but some form of rationing is necessary , experts said .
Only disagreement
The only real disagreement is whether the government 's fiscal condition will lead to a financial meltdown , or whether the U.S. economy is strong enough to right itself without a sudden loss of confidence and a flight of foreign capital .
" People on Wall Street think I'm Dr. Doom & Gloom , " said Kent Smetters , an economist at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania and a former Bush Treasury official .
" I believe we could have a financial crisis like we 've seen in South America or Asia .
It could easily happen , and under current policy will happen in the United States .
People say , ' Gee , give me a date . '
Obviously , that 's impossible , but the longer we wait , the higher the probability .
Could it happen in the next decade ?
Absolutely . "
Alice Rivlin , budget chief in the Clinton administration , discounts the possibility .
" We 're a much stronger economy than Argentina , " Rivlin said .
The government " can handle borrowing in the range that would be necessary in a recession , " she said .
" What we can't handle is the cumulative long - run obligation . "
Financial markets are often fixated on the short - run , and the government 's finances are far from transparent .
Unlike corporations , the government is not required to state its long - term obligations .
Crises of confidence , like today 's banking problems , strike suddenly when a tipping point is reached and investors decide to flee .
The government 's fiscal problems are " like termites in the house , " said Jackson .
" You do n't notice it until foundations are eroded . "
" I had such a frustrating meeting the other day on the Hill , where one staffer said , ' We do n't have a problem until Wall Street tells us we have a problem , ' " said Maya MacGuineas , head of fiscal policy at the nonpartisan New America Foundation .
" By the time the financial markets tell us we 've gone too far , it will be too late to fix this in any rational way .
We are the toad in boiling water , where it 's getting hotter and hotter and nobody 's really noticing . "
Will they still buy ?
The key is whether foreigners will continue to buy U.S. debt .
They now hold 45 percent of U.S. Treasury securities , and in all about $ 11.5 trillion of U.S. public and private debt , say UC Berkeley economists Ashok Bardhan and Dwight Jaffee .
Chinese entities , including sovereign wealth funds that invest government savings overseas , own about 10 percent of U.S. Treasury securities .
Even a minor change in China 's investment policy could have a major effect on the dollar 's value and cause " a sizable increase in interest rates , " the economists said .
Still , because of a shortage of creditworthy debt instruments worldwide , and the large role of U.S. institutions in global credit markets , foreigners have little choice but to invest in the United States , they said , predicting " slim chances of abrupt change . "
Action needed soon
Whoever 's right , all agree that the sooner the problem is tackled , the better .
" Like almost any financial problem , if you do n't work on it , what happens is it compounds with interest , " Shoven said .
" There are lots of ways to fix it , and what we pick is none of the above . "

Often lava does n’t flow on the surface , but it flows in so called lava tubes .
Lava on the surface of the flow cools down and builds a crust , while in the inner part , the lava stays hot and flows on quickly .
Rare and surreal static electric lightning flashes through a massive column of steam , sulfur dioxide , glass particles , ash , rock and instantly created black sand – all generated from a huge volume of molten lava dumping out of a single lava tube that carried it from magma chambers under the flanks of Mauna Loa ’s Kilauea volcano further upslope on Island of Hawaii

A fortnight is clearly a long time in ideology .
What fun historians will have with October 2008 .
Do you remember the hoary old days when they let Lehmans go bankrupt and refused to guarantee bank deposits ?
Where were you when a governor of the Bank of England worried about inflation and something called moral hazard ?
How tables turn .
Socialism is now cock of the walk , capitalism mugged by reality .
It is rubbish , total rubbish .
Market failure has been compounded by brain failure of the discredited profession of economics , overwhelmed by journalistic wish - fulfilment and glee .
The banks have not been " nationalised " , just deluged with money .
They remain pluralist and competitive institutions , with independent boards .
Their workers are not civil servants .
Investors retain their shares .
The bonus culture will revive .
The impresarios of greed have been punished , or at least a few of them .
But this is not socialism in our time , just public money hurled at the face of capitalism .
Guardian writers and Labour politicians have been drooling all week over what they call the " collapse of the free market model " of a modern global economy .
They are simply wrong .
All markets required regulating .
It was regulation that failed last month , not the market economy .
When a car is driven too fast and crashes it does not invalidate motoring .
For the record , exactly the same gloating was heard after the crash of 1987 .
It too " spelled the death of market economics " .
As Martin Taylor , formerly of Barclays , said on the radio yesterday : " Yes , people will return to old - fashioned banking - until they forget about what has happened . "
Then the game will start all over again .
Business can do without most things , but not private banks .
In a seminal encounter in the early 1980s , the late Nicholas Ridley was trying to persuade a reluctant Margaret Thatcher of the virtue of privatisation .
She feared she would lose control over such key industries as oil , gas and electricity .
Ridley pointed out that it was far easier to command the heights of the economy by statutory regulation than by public ownership , which was encumbered by trade unions and Treasury control .
Thatcher was persuaded , and the age of Oftel , Ofgas and Ofcom was born .
The one that got away was the City .
Hence the fiascos at BCCI , Lloyd's , Barings and Black Monday .
Hence too what happened when the new building society / banks , encouraged by Thatcher and her successors to this day , went potty over homeownership .
Britons were told that house - buying was the sensible way to save .
Ministers would declare the " right to homeownership " and demand that " every young person be helped on to the housing ladder " .
Nobody cared how much this might impoverish them , or who lent the money or how , provided ministers could take credit for soaring homeownership .
Nobody even cared when the negative - equity crisis burst in 1991 .
I carry no torch for the recklessness of the bonus culture , but it is politicians , not bankers , who should be apologising for the housing bubble .
As for the bonus - drenched BBC constantly demanding that bankers " say sorry " for bonuses , words fail me .
And its bonuses are not even earned .
The toxic housing loans that were the cause of the credit crash will take time to bleed out of bank balance sheets .
But bleed they will .
Provided politicians can be restrained from re-hyping the British and American housing markets , the system will return to normal .
Taxpayers will then get their money back , as shares are sold in tranches when the market suits .
This is state " greenmailing " , albeit on a grand scale , as was done with British oil shares in the 1980s .
Governments will have performed their proper function in easing market adjustment after the bursting of a bubble .
How quickly this works will depend on how far ministers show they understand banks .
The toxic loan scandal began with politicians mesmerised by house - buying .
MPs even expected taxpayers to pay their own mortgages for them .
Mortgage splurging became so politically correct that nobody dare associate it with loan sharkery .
On Monday Brown demanded that the banks in which he now has an interest stop paying dividends and bonuses , and return mortgage lending to its 2007 level .
This was the surest way both to send bank shares through the floor and to revive the sub - prime chaos .
Lady Vadera , the minister for economic competitiveness and small business , then added to the confusion by wanting the banks only " to maintain the same level of marketing and availability " of their mortgage offers .
What does that mean ?
Brown 's purpose in aiding the banking sector should be simply to guarantee a revival of reputable borrowing , not to pick and choose .
Forcing banks to eschew commercial decisions and make bad mortgage loans will drive them back to dodgy derivatives .
The arrival on the scene of Vadera , author of the chaotic nationalising of Railtrack , is hardly inspiring .
These people have failed the whelk - stall test too often for comfort .
All this has nothing to do with the death of capitalism , rather with its resuscitation after a nasty accident .
As every student of economics knows , capitalism depends on confidence , and confidence depends , in the final analysis , on power .
Belatedly , governments are feeling their way to honouring this responsibility .
But we should repeat the cause of the crash .
It was British and American politicians who encouraged people to buy houses they could ill - afford .
They duly acquired assets that would , in most cases , be realised not by them but by their children .
In the rest of Europe these people would be renting their homes and saving in a safer and more liquid fashion .
The first round of let 's - play - banker by Brown and Vadera this week suggests that this housing madness is far from cured .
We should therefore expect that its message will again be forgotten and the sickness eventually return .
Though bankers are more fun to blame , it was politicians whose laxity and craving for popularity lay at the root of the present trouble .
They should at least be denied any triumph for aiding its cure .

· This article was amended on Friday October 17 2008 .
Shriti Vadera is minister for economic competitiveness and small business , rather than City minister as we originally described her in the article above .
Paul Myners was recently appointed as City minister .
This has been corrected .
For some reason it seams that Martin guitars are the most common candidate for neck resets in our shop .
Nevertheless , our candidate for this demonstration is a 1960's Martin D - 18 .
Need I reiterate here that this article is for information purposes only and not a tutorial on how to do your own neck reset ?
We always start by heating the fingerboard extension with a specially made iron that fits over the frets and heats the fingerboard .
We get things pretty hot .
we usually heat things up to about 400 degrees .
Our thought here are that we want to transfer as much heat as possible in as little amount of time .
After only a couple of minutes the glue joint softens and we are able to start prying up the fingerboard with a small palette knife .
Working our way around the corner of the fingerboard extension , the fingerboard begins to give .
Once the end is free we start working our way towards the neck .
Pretty soon we 'll switch to a longer palette knife .
Here you can see Sharon working the longer palette knife all the way up to the 15th fret .
Sharon does most all of the loosening of fingerboards in the shop - as well as bridges , braces or anything else attached to a guitar .
Next , we remove the 15th fret with specially ground fret pullers .
Removing the 15th fret allows us access to the dovetail joint hidden by the fingerboard .
Sharon just " walks " the fret out from one side to the other .
With the fret out of the way we 'll be able to access the dovetail joint without any further disassembly of the guitar .
Here you can see that little Teflon wedge inserted into the fingerboard .
We use it to lift the board slightly so the softened glue does n't re-tack while it 's still warm .
Now we are ready to access the dovetail joint .
we begin by drilling a hole straight through the fret slot into the gap between the mortise and tenon of the dovetail .
I always drill two holes , one for the steam to go in and one for the steam to escape
Some luthiers like one .
I like two .
Here is a picture of the guitar wearing the Stew Mac neck removal jig .
A very neat tool that makes the job go a whole lot easier .
Prior to the folks at Stew Mac coming up with this we used a home made version that was a bit more crude , without all the fun moving and replaceable parts .
Here we have the ubiquitous Mr. Coffee cappuccino maker .
Our chosen tool for the production of steam .
with a hose attached to the frothing mechanism ...
and a needle attached to the other end of the hose ...
e can inject steam directly into the neck joint .
I think you can make out the steam coming out of the needle in this picture .
- I never tried to photograph steam before .
Do I need to get out more ?
We begin injecting steam into the dovetail ...
Wiping up any drips and splatters along the way - you definitely need a good pair of gloved for this job .
The reason why I like two holes as I mentioned above is so the steam has a place to evacuate rather than spit out all the other seams around the neck .
This cuts down on any finish damage that can occur .
As the steam softens the glue joint , the jig handle is turned to apply pressure to the dovetail .
If you look close , you can see a very small gap appearing between the fingerboard and the body .
We continue to apply steam in intervals and then apply a bit more pressure .
The gap will begin to get larger as the neck is pushed out of the heel block .
Here is a look at the neck sliding out of the body .
The neck has worked it 's way free of the body ...
with a bit of manual coaxing ...
we gently persuade the neck to let go completely .
There - it 's finally out .
Here is a shot of the neck - less body still in the jig .
Looking closely we can see the remnants of glue and old shims
It seems this neck has been reset once before .
Time to clean up the mess while the old glue is still soft and rubbery .
Here is a close - up of the underside of the dovetail and fingerboard .
All the old glue and yuck has to be removed from all the surfaces
Holding a neck while chiseling away all the old glue can be tricky ...
to solve the problem we cam up with this little universal neck holder .
It 's covered in leather to protect the finish .
I can hold a neck in just about any position ...
... to work on practically any part of the dovetail joint .
The neck can sit firmly in any tilted position .
Here we begin cleaning up the old glue .
Chiseling away and being very careful to remove just the glue ...
... and not any wood .
I can get get way up into the cheeks of the heel with a smaller chisel .
Now down to the fingerboard ,
Here I am using the chisel more like a scraper .
We keep our chisels pretty sharp but as you can see we are pretty hard on then so we do n't spend much on top shelf chisels .
The bottom of the fingerboard is cleaning up quite nicely .
There we go - clean as a whistle
Now that the neck joint is all cleaned up , let 's move onto the body .
This is a bit tricky as there is not a lot of room to move around in there .
The surface of the face that the fingerboard extension is glued to has to be cleaned as well .
As you can see we spend a fair amount of time taking apart guitars .
All of the necks and bodies are labeled with the work order number and the customers name .
We want to make sure that the right neck goes back on the right body .
Here is a stack of Martins all in the process of having their necks reset .
The next step is to relieve the dovetail .
This is a step that not a lot of shops do .
I like the procedure because it assures a tight fitting look between the heel and the body when we assemble the guitar .
The neck is held in a jig we normally use to hold guitars upside - down .
We us a small ball end cutter to make the cut .
We carefully cut a channel on the " cheeks " of the heel .
By relieving this area just a bit , the removal of material to re-angle the neck goes quite a bit smoother and conforms to the sides of the guitar much better .
Here is a look at the relieved part of the heel .
After we re-cut the angle of the neck , the relieved area will be much smaller then it is now .
As it is we remove very little material .
Now it 's time to start re-angling the neck .
We double check the neck angle before we start .
You can see how far below the bridge the neck angle points to before we get started .
With a neck angle this " under - set " there is no way to get a nice low action on the guitar
We begin by tapering the cheeks of the heel , taking more material off the back end of the heel and pretty much nothing from the fingerboard end .
Once I have removed enough material to satisfy me that there is improvement .
we tape off the area of the guitar that the heel comes into contact with .
The tape will protect the finish from the next step in our process .
Once again and all the way through the process , we keep checking our progress in terms of neck angle .
Here you can see that we have already improved things dramatically by about 50 percent .
We cut strips of 180 grit sandpaper and place it under the heel of the guitar face up , where the heel contacts the body .
Holding the neck firmly in the correct position , we pull the sandpaper out in one motion .
As the sandpaper is pulled out from under the heel , it will continue to cut the heel end of the joint more aggressively than the fingerboard end
This ensures that we will continue to improve our neck angle and also make sure that the cheeks of the heel conform nicely to the sides of the guitar .
Once again , we check out progress .
I think it goes without saying here that these steps take a lot longer than is represented here .
If we showed you all the pictures of how many times we check the angle , and then remove some more material , and then check again , and remove some more ... it would get a bit boring woud n't it .
Laying the straight edge on the fingerboard , we will be able to see where the neck points to at the bridge .
Finally things are looking
pretty good .
A closer look shows us that the straight edge is pointing well above the bridge - Perfect .
It 's time to move onto prepping the neck for re-installation .
This is another step that I find a lot of shops skip .
During the course of neck removal , trimming the heel and setting the angle , the heel can show some evidence of handling .
If you look close you 'll see some small chips of missing finish .
This one is n't too bad at all .
In fact most shops would ignore it .
I have always been of the belief that in this business we should ( wherever possible ) try to cover our tracks and remove all evidence that a guitar has been worked on .
Unfortunately it 's a belief that not too many repairmen share , all together too evident in all the " teeth marks " and tool marks we see on guitars coming into our shop having had repairs done elsewhere
Alight - I 'll get off my soapbox .
Back to this job .
In these couple of pictures I am brushing on some lacquer to the edge of the heel .
It can take several applications and plenty drying time in between .
And not for the other side .
After several applications and enough drying time , we have successfully built up the finish taller than the surrounding area .
Time to do a bit of sanding .
I merely wrap a small piece of 320 grit wet or dry paper around a polishing stick .
It gives me the right kind of backing for the sanding job ,
After working up through a few grits , 320 , 400 , 600 and 1000 - this is what we get .
Now it 's time to compound and buff up the finish .
Using some liquid compounds
I gently buff up the area .
Things get a bit sloppy while compounding .
The results are a nice shiny finish with no trace that we 've been anywhere near the neck .
Even upon close inspection you 'll notice all those little finish chips are gone .
Not it 's time to re-work the dovetail and get this guitar back together again .
Shims are glued in the neck .
We make ours out of Mahogany .
The same wood as the heel block and neck .
On top of the shims , we place very thin pieces of articulating paper - the same that your dentist uses .
They are glued in with a very light tack adhesive so they will be easy to remove later .
As the neck get inserted into the dovetail , the shims are making the neck sit proud of the body .
The idea here is to re-cut the dovetail tenon to exactly match the angle of the mortise .
Not a simple task since you can't really see in there .
Applying firm pressure , the articulating paper will leave it 's mark on the tenon .
here we can see very few spots that the tenon has contacted with the mortise .
We chisel down just the areas we know to be touching .
After another fitting we can see more area has contacted the mortise .
As we remove only the " blued " area the tenon will sit a bit farther back into the dovetail making futher contact and pulling the neck into the mortise .
This is perhaps the trickiest part of neck resetting .
It taks a firm understanding of the geometry involved .
Here we are removing a bit more material .
and a bit more .
After another fitting we see some more blue spots .
The blue spots will shift as the tenon changes shape to fit the mortise .
We continue ... OK - I think you get the idea hear - unless you want to see 70 or 80 more pictures like the last 10 .
As we keep this process up , the gap between the body and neck continues to shrink as the tenon takes the shape of the mortise .
Finally we get to the point where there is almost no gap at all .
The remainder of this tiny gap will disappear as we press the neck into the dovetail , ensuring a very tight fit .
Here we are lining up all of you clamps and gluing supplies so they are at the ready .
We apply a thin coat of glue only onto the surfaces that are going to be in a bare wood to wood contact .
First we clamp the fingerboard extension and check the centerline fit of the neck .
Then we get a couple of cam clamps to press in the dovetail area .
It 's not very clear in this picture because of the plastic covering on the caul , but it is notched to fit over the frets and has a radius to match the fingerboard .
The saran wrap is so we do n't inadvertently glue it to the fingerboard while cleaning up any squeeze out .
Here is our complete clamping setup , the long clamp from the heel to the tail block is probably unnecessary , but this setup covers all the bases , and I 've always been a big believer in insurance .
The most important part of our clamping setup is the two cam clamps .
They are doing all the real work .
Now we wait for things to dyr and move on to the frets .
First order of business , remember those two little holes in the fingerboard at the 15th fret ?
We fill them with a bit of glue and wood dust .
Looks nasty , I know .
with a little sanding in the area things will improve dramatically .
Here 's what things look like after a bit of rough sanding .
A lot better .
That 's a big improvement .
The filled holes will be re-cut to accept the new fretwire .
First we plane and prep the board for frets .
There are plenty of pictures throughout this site on re-frets - step by step - so I 'll spare you that here .
Just the highlights for now - the face gets protected with some transfer tape .
Notice the single fret in the guitar - we were testing for the right tang size .
A closer look at the 15th fret holes .
Nobody will ever know we were there .
The ubiquitous " Fret Buck "
One of the best tools I ever bought .
The Fretting is going quite nicely .
Finally all the frets are in .
The next step is to do the level and crowning of the frets .
There are lost of examples of those procedures on this site
So I figured I would spare you the photos here .
There - all leveled and crowned .
that was quick .
fretwork invariably leaves a fair amount of telltale signs on the sides of the neck .
You can see the lacquer missing from the edges of the frets .
In keeping with our philosophy that guitar repairs should always be able to be done with as little evidence that we 've " been there " we are going to touch up the sides of the neck
Sadly I have seen all together too many re-frets being done out there that leave this part of the job completely ignored .
After a few applications of lacquer , things are looking much better .
I 'll be the first one to admit that it 's not always possible to do extensive repairs without any cosmetic evidence that the work has been done .
But there is no excuse for not trying .
Here we are at the end of our neck reset .
A custom made bridge with a nice tall saddle .
Even though we have a fairly tall saddle - the action is now quite low .
Resulting in a very comfortable guitar to play .
A new bone nut tops things off quite nicely .
All set for another 30 years of service .
Scotland Yard will urge the government this week to grant Gurkhas the right to remain in Britain as the Metropolitan Police seeks to recruit them in its latest attempt to tackle violent crime .
Senior commanders believe the Nepalese soldiers , who have served with distinction in the British army , would make ideal police officers , and that their discipline , strength and fearlessness would prove crucial to combating the burgeoning threat of knife and street crime .
Chief Superintendent Kevin Hurley will tell Home Office officials and MPs on the Commons Home Affairs Committee on Tuesday that agreeing to offer thousands of Gurkhas settlement in the UK will provide an invaluable resource .
' Gurkhas would make exceptional members of the police service .
Many are multilingual in languages from the Indian subcontinent , highly motivated , loyal and an excellent way of diversifying our workforce , ' he said .
Senior
Met officers have also revealed that previous attempts to recruit Gurkhas have been ignored by the armed forces .
The Gurkhas ' courage will be highlighted hours earlier when five soldiers from the 1st Battalion , Royal Gurkha Rifles , are presented with the Military Cross at Buckingham Palace for bravery in Afghanistan .
The High Court last month ordered the government to recognise a ' debt of honour ' to the men by reconsidering a refusal to allow more than 2,000 off them permission to live in Britain because they retired before July 1997 .
For the past year or so , I 've been involved in documentation of frameworks that help developers to write better code , and to create applications that are more efficient and easier to test , debug , maintain , and extend .
During that time , it has been interesting to see the continuing development of best practice techniques and tools at one of the leading software companies in our industry .
Most of the work was outside my usual sphere of ASP.
NET and Web development , concentrating mainly on Windows Forms applications built using .
NET 2.0 .
This is an area where the standard design patterns that have evolved over many years are increasingly being refined and put into practice .
However , I regularly found myself wondering just how many of these patterns are equally applicable and advantageous within ASP.
NET applications , where we now have the ability to write " real code " in .NET languages such as Visual Basic .NET and C# - rather than the awkward mix of script and COM components upon which classic ASP depended .
Surely , out of the 250 + patterns listed on sites such as the PatternShare Community , some must be useful in ASP .
NET applications .
Yet a search of the Web revealed that - while there is plenty of material out there on design patterns in general , and their use in executable and Windows Forms applications - there is little that concentrates directly on the use of standard design patterns within ASP .
NET .
One very useful document that is available is " Enterprise Solution Patterns Using Microsoft .NET " .
This discusses what design patterns are , how they are documented , and their usage in .NET Enterprise applications .
It does not aim solely at ASP .
NET , but has plenty of ASP.
NET coverage .
About Design Patterns
Because there is so much general material available on the aims and the documentation of design patterns for executable applications , I will restrict this discussion to a few basic points before moving on to look at the patterns I find most useful in ASP .
NET .
The References section at the end of Part 3 of this series of articles contains links to many useful resources and Web sites related to design patterns in general .
While many people ( myself included ) find the term " design patterns " just a little scary - due not least to the way that they are usually described and documented - most developers use informal patterns every day when writing code .
Constructs such as try ... catch , using , and switch ( Select Case ) statements all follow standard patterns that developers have learned over time .
In fact , patterns can be :
Informal Design Patterns - such as the use of standard code constructs , best practice , well structured code , common sense , the accepted approach , and evolution over time
Formal Design Patterns - documented with sections such as " Context " , " Problem " , " Solution " , and a UML diagram
Formal patterns usually have specific aims and solve specific issues , whereas informal patterns tend to provide guidance that is more general .
Formal patterns usually have specific aims and solve specific issues , whereas informal patterns tend to provide guidance that is more general .
Brad Appleton , author of the book " Software Configuration Management Patterns : Effective Teamwork , Practical Integration " , describes design patterns , pattern languages , and the need for them in software engineering and development , like this :
" Fundamental to any science or engineering discipline is a common vocabulary for expressing its concepts , and a language for relating them together . " " ... a body of literature to help software developers resolve recurring problems encountered throughout all of software development . " " ... a shared language for communicating insight and experience about these problems and their solutions . "
" A pattern is a named nugget of insight that conveys the essence of a proven solution to a recurring problem within a certain context amidst competing concerns . " ( from " Patterns and Software : Essential Concepts and Terminology " )
The following sections of this article and the following two articles aim to demonstrate how you can use some of the common formal patterns ( some with minor adaptations to suit ASP.
NET requirements ) in your Web applications to achieve the aims set out so succinctly by the Hillside Group .
You can download the reasonably simple example application and open it in Visual Studio 2005 , or install it to run under Internet Information Services ( IIS ) .
The download file includes a ~readme . txt file that describes the setup requirements .
Basic Design Patterns and Groups
Design patterns fall into groups , based on the type and aims of the pattern .
For example , some patterns provide presentation logic for displaying specific views that make up the user interface .
Others control the way that the application behaves as the user interacts with it .
There are also groups of patterns that specify techniques for persisting data , define best practices for data access , and indicate optimum approaches for creating instances of objects that the application uses .
The following list shows some of the most common design patterns within these groups :
Presentation Logic Model - View - Controller ( MVC ) Model - View - Presenter ( MVP ) Use Case Controller
Host or Behavioral Command Publish - Subscribe / Observer Plug- in / Module / Intercepting Filter
Structural Service Agent / Proxy / Broker Provider / Adapter
Creational Factory / Builder / Injection Singleton
Persistence Repository
The remaining sections of this and the two following articles discuss the patterns that are most suitable for use in ASP .
NET , or which ASP.
NET implements automatically and allows you to extend to adapt the behavior to suit your own requirements .
See the index at the start of each article for a list of the patterns described .
The Model - View - Controller and Model - View - Presenter Patterns
The Model - View - Controller ( MVC ) and Model - View - Presenter ( MVP ) Patterns improve reusability of business logic by separating the three components required to generate and manage a specific user interface ( such as a single Web page ) .
The Model contains the data that the View ( the Web page ) will display and allow the user to manipulate .
The Controller or Presenter links the Model and the View , and manages all interaction and processing of the data in the Model ( see Figure 1 ) .
Figure 1 - The Model - View - Controller and Model - View - Presenter Patterns
In the MVC pattern , user interaction with the View raises events in the Controller , which updates the Model .
The Model then raises events to update the View .
However , this introduces a dependency between the Model and the View .
To avoid this , the MVP pattern uses a Presenter that both updates the Model and receives update events from it , using these updates to update the View .
The MVP pattern improves testability , as all the logic and processing occurs within the Presenter , but it does add some complexity to the implementation because updates must pass from the Presenter to the View .
The Provider and Adapter Patterns
The Provider and Adapter patterns allows otherwise incompatible classes to work together by converting the interface of one class into an interface expected by the other .
In more practical terms , these patterns provide separation between components that allows behavioral changes to occur without prior knowledge of requirements .
The application and any data sources it uses , outputs it generates , or classes it must interact with , can be created independently yet still work together ( see Figure 2 ) .
Figure 2 - The Provider and Adapter Patterns
The Provider pattern separates the data processing objects , and the application , from the source data .
It allows the code in the application to be independent of the type of data source and the format of the data .
A Provider component or service exposes standard methods that the application can call to read and write data .
Internally , it converts these calls to the equivalents that match the data source .
This means that the application can work with any source data type ( such as any kind of database , XML document , disk file , or data repository ) for which a suitable provider is available .
The Adapter pattern has the same advantages , and works in a similar way .
Often , the target of an Adapter is some kind of output .
For example , a printer driver is an example of an Adapter .
ASP.NET itself , and other frameworks such as Enterprise Library , make widespread use of the Provider and Adapter patterns .
The Service Agent , Proxy , and Broker Patterns
Various patterns exist that remove dependencies between a client and a service by using intermediate brokers .
There are many different implementations of the basic pattern , some of which use an extra service - agent logic component to connect the client with the local proxy or gateway interface ( see Figure 3 ) .
Figure 3 - The Service Agent , Proxy , and Broker Patterns
The aim of all these patterns is to allow remote connection to , and use of , a service without the client having to know how the service works .
The service exposes a Contract that defines its interface , such as the Web Service Description Language ( WSDL ) document for a Web Service .
A client - side proxy or gateway interface uses the Contract to create a suitably formatted request , and passes this to the service interface .
The service sends the formatted response back through its gateway interface to the client proxy , which exposes it to the client .
In effect , the client just calls the service methods on the client proxy , which returns the results just as if the service itself was a local component .
In the Service Agent pattern , an extra component on the client can perform additional processing and logic operations to further separate the client from the remote service .
For example , the Service Agent may perform service address lookup , manipulate or format the client data to match the proxy requirements , or carry out any other kind of processing requirements common to different clients that use the service .
The Repository Pattern
The Repository pattern virtualizes storage of entities in a persistent medium , such as a database or as XML .
For example , a repository may expose data held in the tables of a database as strongly typed Customer and Order objects rather than data sets or data rows .
It effectively hides the storage implementation from the application code , and allows the use of a common set of methods in the application without requiring knowledge of the storage mechanism or format .
Often , the repository uses a series of providers to connect to the source data ( see Figure 4 ) .
Figure 4 - The Repository Pattern
The Singleton Pattern
The Singleton pattern defines the creation of a class for which only a single instance can exist .
It is useful for exposing read - only data , and static methods that do not rely on instance data .
Rather than creating an instance of the class each time , the application obtains a reference to an existing instance using a static method of the class that implements the Singleton pattern .
If this is the first call to the method that returns the instance , the Singleton creates an instance , populates it with any required data , and returns that instance .
Subsequent calls to the method simply return this instance .
The instance lifetime is that of the application domain - in ASP.
NET this is usually the lifetime of the domain Application object .

Communism is frequently accused of having a system which promotes laziness and drudgery .
They posit that this happens because as in the system everyone is equal and the incentive of people to compete with their fellow man is not there , nobody feels the need to innovate , be creative or productive .
And since the state will reward everyone the same no matter what they do , as in a prisoner ’s dillema , people will prefer to “ defect ” from work .
This problem did seem realistic to me when I knew little about it and before I actually gave more thought to it .
How indeed do you make people work if they are not going to be rewarded for their trouble anymore than their lazy ass neighbour who sits and watches television all day ?
The answer to this problem lies in understanding that reward does not drop down from the non-existent state but that simply the reward of each worker comes from the work they do .
One of the core tenets of communism is that the total value of labour , which includes the surplus value which currently goes to the non-working capitalist , belongs to the worker who produces it .
Lets say that I work in a factory making cars with a thousand other people and we make a 1000 cars , each of us ends up owning one .
Once I have a car , either I can keep working in the same factory ( say because I like the work or because I do not care to learn anything else ) or I can move to another job , say making computers .
But what about the people who do n’t want to work in the car factory .
Do n’t they get a car ?
Of course they do .
It ’s very easy for a car factory to give one car to each of its workers and after that , the rest of the cars can be given for free for anyone who requests one .
And why not ?
After all , while working at the car factory , I got to eat food for free from the bakers , got the raw material for free from the steel and plastic workers , got to enjoy culture for free from the artists etc .
As such , the incentive of people to be productive lies in the fact that they will get to own the result of their increased productivity .
Not only that , but people have a large incentive to be more productive because that way they get to work less hours .
If you think that this is an unrealistic scenario and that this can never work you might be benefit from looking at the free software movement .
Why does a Free Software programmer help coding a program when he ’s not getting paid for it ?
Very often it ’s because he needs it to do something he ca n’t at the moment .
But why do it for free instead of selling his labour to the highest bidder ?
It ’s because he knows that he will get to reap the results of his labour .
Not only that but once more programmers join , he will get to reap the results of their labour as well , while all of them get to work less hours individually .
Furthermore , the Free software programmer knows that there are other free software programmers out there who do the same thing as he , but in their own projects .
He gets to reap the results of their labour and they do the same .
Similar to my previous example of cars for food , raw materials and art .
But the free software movement is comprised from generally middle class people who can afford to do it as a hobby , generally middle class people or students .
Most cannot concentrate their full potential on it because they must put a good part of it on their normal work or school .
Imagine what they would do if they could work totally free without worrying about survival .
Imagine what any other worker could do if he had the freedom these renegade programmers do .
‘ But what about innovation ? ’ I hear you ask .
What ’s the point of someone inventing new gadgets , systems or whatnot ?
I already mentioned that people have an incentive to be more productive as in that way they will get to work less hours .
Well , this is what machines do is n’t it ?
They make people more productive .
The workers have thus an incentive to create new and better machinery in order to reduce the time they have to spend working .
Medicine ?
Art ?
As is obvious from even our current culture , people who are inclined to those paths generally provide their own incentive .
An artist keeps creating despite the fact that in our capitalist culture he cannot make any money of it .
If anything , under Communism instead of the pop-culture we have to endure because it ’s the only thing that can bring a profit , artists can follow their own muse and create the new and interesting things they should .
Instead of medicine and science being driven by profit , with all the known problems of that , it will be driven by need and creativity .
A future Tesla will not have to die poor and starving because his exciting new science could not find sponsors or he did not understand economics , but rather will have the necessities he needs to focus on his work as much as he needs .
Of course , it is conceivable that social parasites will manage to find a way to survive within communism .
Perhaps they will prefer to hide how little they work , or they will group together and avoid working , I do n’t know .
The thing is that it ’s much more difficult to hide from the people you have to work with who know they will have to pick up the slack .
Where in a capitalist corporation the parasite can simply suck up to the boss and get off lightly , in Communism , there is no boss to speak of and the other workers will quickly put them in their place when they discover them , or at worst , ostracise them .
But lets take the worst case scenario , that somehow these parasites manage to survive and hide within a communist system .
What is the difference from our current system ?
Under capitalism we have parasites who not only do n’t need hide but are actually the ones who wield all the power .
They ’re called Capitalists .
The rich do not need to work , their money works for them .
All they need to do is sit around all day and give orders to the ones who are not as rich as they .
The life of the rich is one who does not contribute anything to society and gets to reap all the benefits .
And the worst part is that the overwhelming percentage of them do not even need to work to reach that level .
They simply are born into wealth .

When WordPress 2.3 was released into the wild , one of the new features was an update notification which told you when there was a new version of WordPress or a plugin available for download .
This was possible thanks to the API service called api.wordpress.org .
Earlier this year , I had the privilege of attending WordCamp Dallas where WordPress 2.5 was unveiled to the world .
I ’ll personally never forget that day , but when Matt showcased the automatic plugin upgrader , it confirmed my suspicions back when 2.3 was released as to where at least some aspects of WordPress were headed .
During some downtime at the event , I pulled Matt aside and asked if him if the team was going to end up heavily using the API to not only upgrade plugins , but upgrade the core and also install themes .
I do n’t remember exactly what he said , but never the less , that is indeed where WordPress is heading .
Thanks to this API , the future of WordPress from an end users point of view looks great .
WordPress 2.5 introduced automatic plugin upgrades .
A time saving feature that the masses have loved .
WordPress 2.7 is poised to really take advantage of the plugin API that the WordPress team has built thus far , allowing for the browsing and installation of plugins right from your administration panel .
Another feature which may or may not be finalized in time for 2.7 is the core upgrade functionality .
Again , thanks to the API for WordPress.org , upgrading WordPress could be as simple as a click of a button .
The next item to incorporate into WordPress is the theme repository .
Although no definitive proof showcases the theme repository being integrated into the WordPress back end , I feel that it is only natural to incorporate it much like the plugin repository .
What I say here is speculative , but based on the discussions that I have read , the plan is to allow users to browse around the theme repository and if they come across a theme they like , you ’ll be able to click an install button which will unpack the theme automatically leaving only the step of activating the theme .
I ’ve mentioned this idea to others and they bring up the subject of theme upgrades .
Because themes can be edited with the addition or subtraction of functions , I do n’t believe upgrading themes will be as user friendly as upgrading plugins .
However , unless a theme author completely revamps a theme , I do n’t see the need to have an upgrade theme feature added to WordPress .
Instead , the theme author should update the theme , change the version number and then , the theme repository API should notify the end user within the WordPress administration panel that a new version of their theme is available .
A link within the message would direct the user to that themes entry within the repository from which they could read the change log .
It would then be up to the end user on whether they want to apply the updates or not .
Based on my experience in dealing with WordPress end users , the three most difficult tasks when operating a WordPress powered site is upgrading WordPress , browsing and then installing themes , and last but not least , installing or upgrading plugins .
Thanks to the hard work of the WordPress developers and associated volunteers , the API has provided us with the opportunity to use a piece of software where the three most difficult tasks to perform when using WordPress are practically automated .
At the click of a button , you ’ll be able to install a plugin , upgrade a plugin , upgrade to a new version of WordPress or install a theme .
I may be wrong , but WordPress may be the first publishing system to provide this type of functionality to its user base .
I ’ve had this feeling for quite a long time that WordPress was eventually going to provide these features as a means of making it as easy as possible to keep everything up to date .
I suppose I may have a WordPress instinct built into me ?
At any rate , this is the road that the development team has decided to travel and I am happy to be part of the ride .
Are you looking forward to these three mundane tasks ( possibly ) being turned into simple mouse clicks ?
The photograph above shows the two candidates greeting each other at the beginning of last night 's debate .
Notice that Obama is looking at McCain , and McCain is looking at the audience .
It is just a moment , but it was typical .
Throughout the ninety minutes that followed , McCain refused to make eye contact with Obama , even as Obama sought eye contact with him .
This asymmetry in the two candidates ' body language is turning into one of the mini-narrative threads that start to form in the days following a major debate .
It 's interesting on the surface - for the signals it sent to viewers about McCain 's feelings about Obama - and also because of what it says about the two men's characters .
There are two theories emerging about why McCain could n't look his opponent in the eye .
One of them - the most intuitive one - is that he feels such utter contempt for Obama , this kid who has achieved nothing who dares to challenge his judgment on foreign policy , that he does n't wish to show him the minimum respect that eye contact implies .
This is of a piece with McCain 's exasperated grimacing at Obama 's answers and frequent uses of phrases like " what my opponent does n't understand ... " .
The other , fascinatingly proposed here , is that McCain 's refusal to look his opponent in the eye was a sign of fear , or at the very least , insecurity ( I have n't studied the tapes but as I recall Obama found it hard to look Clinton in the eye during their debates , and I think he did find her a bit intimidating ) .
Whichever it is - perhaps it's a mixture of both - it is indicative of something about the two men's temperaments .
Obama , a former professor , is by instinct and education a man who separates an argument from the person making it .
He is comfortable with abstract argument , and perhaps a little uncomfortable when things get personal .
McCain , however - as Eugene Robinson points out to Chris Matthews - tends to personalise arguments .
Indeed , McCain 's whole worldview is based on character ; he does n't really have much of a political philosophy .
That 's not all bad : it 's why he's got a good record of bipartisanship as a legislator - if he likes the man , he will disregard the ideology .
But it means he's not a great at discussing ideas - and if he does n't like someone , he can't help but let it show .
You can tell that the economy is in dire straits when fictional realms begin feeling the squeeze .
A man in Oregon was forced to shut down his Lord of the Rings - themed housing development as a result of the slumping real estate market .
Gawker :
An Oregon man who built a 31 - lot Lord of the Rings - themed development called The Shire — including a house with an attached " hobbit hole , " a central area called the " Ring Bearer 's Court , " and a set of bylaws called the " Declaration of Interdependence " — now faces financial ruin because of the bad real estate market .
Or maybe it 's because of the Lord of the Rings theme ?
No , definitely the real estate market .
Are there pawn shops in Middle Earth ?
If so , we hope this poor guy can hawk his Rings .
Meanwhile , unemployment is rising in Narnia .
More proof that Greater Manchester muslim Butt brothers continue to be a pain in the backside to the British people .
Hassan Butt has claimed to have recruited hundreds of British Muslims to fight for al Qaida in the past - though he is now touted as a " reformed terrorist "
Last March
I wrote about the other brother , Dentist Omer Butt , as he refused to provide dental care for any woman who did not wear a head scarf and reduced fees for those women who did wear a scarf .
( Note the article featured below says that Butt did this to muslim women - but the original article quoted from last March stated the more general term " women " . )
Omer Butt was subsequently found guilty of serious professional misconduct .
The latest incident involving the duo :
" Police were called to a pharmacy in Parr Lane , Unsworth , just after 10.30 am on Tuesday following reports that a car had blocked in other drivers and a man was refusing to move it .
The motorist , Omer Butt , 32 , is said to have driven the car at a female officer who was signalling for him to stop .
It is understood the vehicle hit the officer on the leg and caused her minor injuries .
Hassan Butt , 28 , then arrived at the scene and allegedly used racial and abusive language . "
The article goes on to state :
" " Omer Butt was subsequently charged with assaulting a police officer and Hassan Butt has been charged with a racially aggravated public order offence .
Both men have been bailed and are due to appear before magistrates in Bury on October 31 . "
It comes as no surprise that clearly Omer still has huge issues with women - considering the treatment of women by the followers of Islam and clearly Hassan still has not truly " renounced " terrorist " tendencies " - the British police apparently agree .
The Butt brothers actions certainly fly in the face of the media over - hyped ( myth of ) Islamophobia .
( and likely why this incident is local rather than UK national news )
Thus is it correct to say that the unacceptable & illegal actions of Omer & Hassan Butt are examples of Kuffarophobia ( muslim hatred of non muslims ) ?
Something tells me that we have n't heard the last from this pair of Butts .

Change , climate change , gasoline .
If you think you ’ve heard those words a lot from our presidential candidates , you ’re right .
The Global Language Monitor , which has been tracking the entire Obama / McCain showdown , puts them as the top three “ buzzwords ” in this election .
Most of us have played the Buzzwords board game , but at GLM , “ political buzzwords are terms or phrases that become loaded with emotional freight beyond the normal meaning of the word . ”
[ social_buttons ]
For example , change used to be a simple , everyday word meaning anything from a change of clothes to changing one ’s mind .
Now , it ’s turned into a promise of a different future for this country and a turnaround from the Bush - era policies .
It ’s difficult to hear the word and not think both Obama and McCain ( though Obama ’s motto , “ Change We Need ” gives him more of an edge on the word ) .
Climate change / global warming comes in second , says GLM , but it ’s only a half of 1 percent away from the overall lead .
So this means that the phrase is getting more attention , and also that it ’s starting to take on a more weighted meaning .
The question , though , that GLM ca n’t answer with its buzzwords is what kind of meaning it ’s starting to take .
Is it one of environmental activism , that people are finally realizing we have to do something about it before it ’s too late ?
Or is it more of a political meaning , that the public is hearing it more from politicians and associating it with the policies suggested by the different candidates ?
Or is it neither – are the candidates just spouting it so much that ’s it ’s become a household word without being fully understood ?
Nevertheless , there it is , coming in ahead of the “ Iraq War , ” “ financial meltdown , ” “ raise taxes ” and “ that one . ” “ Lipstick ” also made the list – I do n’t think anyone in the American public is going to think of lipstick quite the same again after this election .
Gasoline comes in third , especially as prices continue to fall ( does anyone else see prices almost below $ 2.00 ??! ) .
“ Price of oil ” is meanwhile at spot no .
13 .
As gas prices climbed above $ 4 for most of the summer , these were definitely on voters ’ minds .
However , “ drilling for oil in Alaska ’s beautiful natural land ” did n’t make the list .

School girls demonstrate outside the former US embassy in Tehran Demonstrations have been held in Iran to mark the 29th anniversary of the seizure of the US embassy in Tehran .
The Islamic revolution in 1979 took over from the US backed regime of the Shah and installed the clerical rule of Ayatollah Khomeini .
Students stormed the US Embassy on 4 November 1979 taking 52 Americans hostage for 444 days .
The hostages were released in 1981 and relations between Washington and Tehran have never recovered .
The old US embassy compound is now used by the Revolutionary Guards and the walls are plastered with anti-American slogans .
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne says demonstrators made use of the traditional chant of " death to Israel , death to America " , but on a wet morning in Tehran , school children and students helped make up the numbers and only a few people seemed to be listening to the speeches .
" The evil power of Israel is waning " said one speaker , others launched long tirades against the power of the American government .
US Election
The anniversary comes as Iranians , like the rest of the world , await the result of the US election with high anticipation .
Our correspondent says that despite the rhetoric many , probably most Iranians long for a reconciliation with the United States .
Some demonstrators expressed a hope that it might become possible if Barack Obama becomes the next US President , he said .
Jon Leyne says that even President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is hoping for a diplomatic breakthrough , although there is no sign he is willing to make any of the compromises that would make that possible .

The Imprinted Brain Theory
What causes mental illnesses like schizophrenia and autism ?
We have long known that both tend to run in families and that if one of two identical twins has such a disorder , there is a much higher than average probability that the other will too .
Autism is sometimes associated with genetic syndromes , such as Rett , Down , and Turner 's , Phenylketonuria , and Tuberous Sclerosis .
The clearest single - gene cause of autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) is Fragile X syndrome , with a wide range of severity in symptoms and 25 - 47 per cent of affected males meeting the criteria for autism .
But neither autism nor schizophrenia obeys classical Mendelian laws of inheritance in the way that Cystic Fibrosis or some types of colour blindness do .
However , there is also good evidence for social , environmental causes of mental illnesses .
Studies of the Dutch wartime famine and of the Chinese famine of 1959 – 61 reported increased incidence of schizophrenia among children born just after the events .
And a study of 2 million Swedish children born between 1963 and 1983 revealed a significant link between schizophrenia and poverty in childhood .
Those with 4 out of 5 measured indicators of hardship had an almost 3 - fold greater risk of schizophrenia than those with none .
Where ASD is concerned , the exponential increase in diagnoses since the 1980s has prompted some to suggest environmental or social causes : most controversially , childhood vaccines like MMR .
Autism can certainly result from ethanol or valproic acid poisoning during the mother 's pregnancy , and in the 1964 rubella epidemic in the USA , the rate of incidence of autism exceeded 7 per cent at a time when the normal rate of diagnosis was not much more than a tenth of one per cent .
ASD can also be caused by thalidomide , where it affects about 5 per cent of those with birth defects attributable to this cause .
The figure illustrates the idea .
According to the so - called imprinted brain theory , the paradoxes can be explained in terms of the expression of genes , and not simply their inheritance .
Imprinted genes are those which are only expressed when they are inherited from one parent rather than the other .
The classic example is IGF2 , a growth factor gene only normally expressed when inherited from the father , but silent when inherited from the mother .
According to the most widely - accepted theory , genes like IGF2 are silenced by mammalian mothers because only the mother has to pay the costs associated with gestating and giving birth to a large offspring .
The father , on the other hand , gets all the benefit of larger offspring , but pays none of the costs .
Therefore his copy is activated .
The symbolism of a tug - of - war represents the mother 's genetic self - interest in countering the growth - enhancing demands of the father 's genes expressed in the foetus — the mother , after all , has to gestate and give birth to the baby at enormous cost to herself .
Mental disorders can be located along a dimension of mentalism ( aka ' theory - ofmind , ' ' folk - psychology ' or ' people skills ' ) defined as our evolved ability to comprehend others ' actions and behaviour in purely mental terms ( such as intention , belief , desire , emotion etc. ) .
Autistics , notoriously , are poor where mentalistic skills like inferring intention or understanding false belief are concerned .
ASDs therefore belong on the hypo-mentalistic side of the continuum .
However , what we would now term psychotic spectrum disorders ( PSDs ) can be typified as hyper- mentalistic : paranoid schizophrenics , for example , symptomatically over - interpret intention either positively in erotomania ( delusions that others are in love with you ) or negatively in delusions of persecution .
They also entertain bizarre false beliefs about themselves and others , and generally exhibit excessive mentalism , often enshrined in quasi-religious or mystical delusions .
Indeed , the symptoms and signs of autism and psychoses like paranoid schizophrenia exhibit a remarkable pattern of antithesis : Autism / Asperger 's syndrome Psychosis / Paranoid schizophrenia gaze - monitoring deficits delusions of being watched / spied on apparent deafness / insensitivity to voices hallucination of and hyper - sensitivity to voices deficits in interpreting others ' intentions erotomania / delusions of persecution deficits in appreciating shared - attention / groups delusions of conspiracy theory of mind deficits magical ideation / delusions of reference deficit in sense of personal agency / episodic memory megalomania / delusions of grandeur literalness / inability to deceive delusional self - deception pathological single - mindedness pathological ambivalence early onset late onset
The concepts of hypo - and hyper - mentalism readily explain the last item : age of onset .
Typically , this is early childhood for autism but late adolescence or adulthood for schizophrenia : a difference which up until now has lacked an obvious explanation .
But the fact that you have to develop normal mentalistic skills before you can over - develop them to the point of psychosis readily explains why the mentalistic deficits of autism are apparent in childhood and why the hyper- mentalism of psychosis can only become fully apparent much later .
Mentalism appears to be the key to social behaviour because autistics are notably non-social in the sense that they typically lack social skills and have impoverished social lives with few if any friends , little interest in group activities , and muted emotional responses such as empathy and interest in others .
Consequently their behaviour often seems callous , childish , or self - centred .
However , mammals as a whole show a notable sex - difference in social behaviour to which human beings are no exception .
In general , females have been found to be more sociable , co-operative , and nurturing than males — particularly among primates .
This may explain why the mother 's genes appear to promote mentalism in human beings and why the father 's seem to motivate more self - interested behaviour .
From an evolutionary point of view , every one of a mother 's offspring carries an equal complement of her genes ( half of them ) .
But uncertainty of paternity — the bane of mammals thanks to internal , unseen fertilization — means that the genes of a father have no necessary reason to find themselves in any of a woman 's other children : Mother 's baby .
Father's ?
Maybe !
The result is that , from an evolutionary and genetic point of view , paternallyactive genes do not have the same self - interest in family cohesion and social cooperation that the mother 's characteristically do .
Why should the father 's encourage his offspring to co-operate with those of the mother 's other mates ?
Nevertheless , paternal genes do have a more positive cognitive bias of their own : what you might call mechanistic cognition .
This is the mode of cognition that we have evolved to interact with the physical , non-human , natural environment , and stands in contrast to mentalistic cognition , which evolved to facilitate social contact and cognition in relation to other people .
Significantly , autistics often show compensations for their mentalistic deficits in mechanistic cognitive skills , one of the most common being calendar calculation ( such as knowing the date of Easter in any year you care to name ) , rote memorization , and maths skills .
Indeed , the attraction of like - minded people with mechanistic cognitive configurations is probably part of the explanation for the remarkably high incidence of ASD in Silicon Valley , California , and in the Cambridge area in the UK — both places with high levels of employment in maths - , computer - and science - based industries .
If we have evolved two parallel cognitive systems rather than just one , they appear to vary in the same way that vulnerability to ASD or PSD does : more paternal influence predisposes to mentalistic deficits , but mechanistic compensations ; and more maternal influence is the converse .
A counter - intuitive prediction of this model corroborated by some recent clinical findings is that hyper - mentalism should go with mechanistic deficits in exactly the same way that autistic hypo-mentalism goes with mentalistic deficits .
Indeed , this model also suggests that if there are autistic savants with outstanding skills in mechanistic aspects of cognition , there ought also to be psychotic ones with the opposite , mentalistic ones .
However , the very same excellence in mentalism would make such psychotic savants much less noticeable than their autistic counterparts , whose deficits immediately identify them as odd , socially - isolated , and eccentric .
Psychotic savants , by contrast , can be expected to be deeply embedded in successful social networks , and found at the centre of excellence in such things as religious and ideological evangelism ; literary and theatrical culture ; litigation and the law ; hypnosis , faith - healing , and psychotherapy ; fashion and advertising ; politics , public - relations and the media ; commerce , confidence - trickery , and fraud of all kinds .
The following table gives some idea of the inverted symmetry to be found between mentalistic and mechanistic cognition : Mentalistic Cognition Mechanistic Cognition psychological interaction with self and others physical interaction with nature and objects uses social , psychological , and political skills uses mechanical , spatial , and engineering skills deficits in autism , augmented in women accentuated in autism , augmented in men voluntaristic , subjective , particularistic deterministic , objective , universal abstract , general , ambivalent concrete , specific , single - minded verbal , metaphoric , conformist visual , literal , eccentric top - down , holistic , centrally - coherent bottom - up , reductionistic , field - independent epitomized in literature , politics , and religion epitomized in science , engineering , and technology ‘ pseudo - science ' : astrology , alchemy , creationism ‘ hard science ' : astronomy , chemistry , Darwinism nurtured : culturally - and personally - determined natural : factually - and genetically - determined belief - based therapies : placebos , faith - healing , psychotherapy etc. physical effect - based therapies : drugs , surgery , physiotherapy , etc .
According to this way of looking at things , development can be pushed to either extreme by any factors that affect gene expression either before or after birth .
Valproic acid is known to do this , as is thalidomide and other environmental causes of autism .
Where purely genetic factors are concerned , the theory proposes that increased expression of paternal genes like IGF2 will predispose to autism — and expression of that gene is now known to be enhanced in individuals with ASD .
This will result in the features listed in the figure : higher birth weight , an increased vulnerability to cancer ( which is another expression of over - growth ) , and a larger brain in childhood with more white matter .
Furthermore , increased nutrition would mimic the effect of genes like IGF2 and predispose to growth , perhaps explaining part of the recent exponential increase in milder ASDs such as Asperger 's syndrome .
Indeed , the fact that birth - weights of new - born babies in Vienna rose an unprecedented amount during the 1920s perhaps partly explains why Asperger was to discover the autistic syndrome named after him during the next couple of decades .
And because all fathers are male the new theory can also be reconciled with the extreme male brain theory of autism , which persuasively argues that ASDs can often be linked to increased testosterone exposure in utero and to the more lateralized brain characteristic of males .
Significantly then , PSD — and schizophrenia in particular — are associated with the features listed on the other side of the diagram : low birth weight , a reduced vulnerability to cancer ( despite schizophrenics smoking much more ! ) , and smaller adult brains with less white matter .
Correspondingly , just as increased nutrition in pregnancy and / or early life might mimic paternally - active genes like IGF2 to predispose to ASD , the contrary conditions — starvation during pregnancy and / or early life — could be predicted to increase the risk of PSD , as we saw they indeed do , at least in the case of schizophrenia .
And because all mothers are female , enhanced expression of maternal genes also goes with reduced foetal testosterone and the less lateralized brain typical of women .
Indeed , the fact that mammalian females have two X sex chromosomes ( XX ) by contrast to the male 's one ( XY ) means that X chromosome gene expression is also implicated .
In cases where an extra X chromosome is present : X trisomy ( XXX ) and Klinefelter syndrome ( XXY ) , the presence of the additional X results in brain features similar to those found in schizophrenia , along with a notably increased vulnerability to psychosis , just as the theory would predict .
Another controversial and counter - intuitive prediction of the theory for which there is already much evidence is that , if ASD has increased in modern societies with higher standards of living as it so spectacularly has done , then PSD should be falling .
Interestingly in this respect , rates of admission for PSDs like schizophrenia have decreased by between 10 and 57 per cent in England and Wales , Scotland , Denmark , Australia , and New Zealand .
Indeed , even Bleuler , who coined the term schizophrenia , noticed a secular decline in his own lifetime , and a recent Canadian study showed a 42 per cent decrease in the number of first - admission schizophrenia cases over 20 years .
It found that annual inpatient prevalence rates decreased by 52 per cent between1986 and 1996 , with no corresponding change in outpatient rates , regardless of sex .
Although total major affective disorders increased , this was due to an increase in major depression , not bipolar disorder , which is now thought to be much more closely allied to schizophrenia than was once believed .
Surprisingly as it may seem , the new theory can even encompass the finding that infectious agents can sometimes be implicated in causing schizophrenia .
People infected with the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii are three times more likely to suffer from schizophrenia than those not infected , and so too are catowners .
The significance of the latter may lie in the fact that the parasite can only complete the reproductive phase of its life - cycle inside a cat .
It achieves this by causing its principal carriers , rats and mice , to lose their fear of cats , and so be much more likely to be eaten by one .
Inside the rodent 's brain , the parasite attacks the amygdalas , which play the same role in triggering fear - reactions that it does in humans .
But when infected rats are treated with anti-psychotic drugs like those given to human schizophrenics the rats ' fear of felines returns .
Men with Toxoplasma infection tend to be more reckless than normal , and infected people of both sexes are almost three times more likely to be involved in car accidents , and have measurably slowed reaction times .
In mice , only paternal genes are expressed in the amygdalas and there is good evidence suggesting that the same is true in humans .
This finding suggests the intriguing possibility that an explanation may lie in the parasite suppressing paternally - controlled brain systems like the amygdala to produce an overall preponderance of maternal brain function , which according to the new theory is the fundamental basis of psychosis in general and of schizophrenia in particular .
T. gondii , in other words , could be another of those environmental effects portrayed in black in the figure , but one pushing development pathologically towards the psychotic end of the spectrum by sabotaging brain systems built by paternal genes .
Finally , what of normal development ?
The implication is clear : so - called normality represents a more - or - less balanced expression of genes and environmental developmental influences .
However , the fact that all fathers are male and all mothers are female implies that the norms for the sexes are likely to be slightly offset .
This would fit with the finding that ASD afflicts more males than females and that men typically do worse on tests of mentalistic competence than do women .
Women , on the other hand , would be symmetrically offset to the more mentalistic side of the spectrum , and this might explain why rates of incidence of schizophrenia among family members of women with the disorder are higher than those among family members of men with schizophrenia .
And although there is a slightly higher incidence of schizophrenia overall in men , erotomania appears to be a predominantly female pathology , with women suffering more paranoid delusions and hallucinations than men , particularly in late - onset cases .
The model appears to rule out anyone suffering from an ASD and a PSD simultaneously , and such co-morbidity does appear to be rare — but is not unknown .
However , I know of cases of individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder who also show unmistakable signs of ASD during their non-manic phases .
Indeed , I have research on one individual who suffers from severe gaze - aversion , autistic deficits in a sense of self and social anxiety most of the time , but who becomes comfortable with other people during manic episodes when his sense of self hypertrophies into megalomania with the feeling that he is the returned Jesus Christ !
Furthermore , there is evidence of both ASD and PSD in Newton and Beethoven , and incontrovertibly so in the Nobel - prize winning mathematician John Nash .
Here the theory predicts that the ASD must come first ( typically in childhood ) and leave a permanent savant - like basis later built on by hyper- mentalistic tendencies to produce an unusually broadened and dynamically - balanced cognitive configuration : that of true genius .
Such a far - reaching theory as this can be expected to be controversial , and much remains to be done to work out its detailed implications .
But the theory does have one outstanding merit : it makes clear and profoundly counter - intuitive predictions about which genes are involved , about how they should be expressed , and about what effects they should be found to have in the brain and on behaviour .
Twenty - three experts are only the start : Nature 's comment will be decisive and , thanks to rapid progress in genomics and neuroscience , should not be long in coming .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Mayor Michael Bloomberg is sparking controversy with his reported plans to seek a change in the city ’s term - limits law so he can run for a third term and shepherd New York through the financial crisis .
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg testifies before the Senate Committee on Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs about the condition of the nation 's infrastructure on Capitol Hill in Washington June 12 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Kevin Lamarque
Bloomberg , who was elected in 2001 and re-elected in 2005 , is expected to announce on Thursday that he backs a City Council bill to lift the term - limits law and allow him to seek re-election again next year .
The move was welcomed by business leaders , who have supported the former Wall Street bond trader at the city ’s helm , but was finding a less - than - warm reception among civic groups and , not surprisingly , the mayor ’s rivals and critics .
“ It ’s an outrage .
It sends a terrible message to New Yorkers that their votes do n’t count , ” said Gene Russianoff , lead attorney for the New York Public Interest Research Group .
Voters in New York approved the law , which limits the mayor , City Council and other officials to two four - year terms in office , in 1993 and again in 1996 .
This decision would be made by the City Council , as it is too late to be placed on the ballot on November 4 election day .
The city ’s Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum , who has clashed often with Bloomberg , called the suggestion “ an insult to the democratic process and a slap in the face to New Yorkers . ”
“ This is a decision for the people , not for incumbents , not for editorial boards and not for a few wealthy and powerful individuals , ” Gotbaum said in a statement .
Supporters say Bloomberg , who founded the financial news and data company Bloomberg LP , a competitor to Thomson Reuters , is the ideal leader for New York as it faces the fallout from the meltdown on Wall Street .
CONTINUITY NEEDED ?
“ New York City and the country face a serious economic crisis , and continuity in leadership is crucial at this time , ” said Kathryn Wylde , head of the Partnership for New York City .
While in City Hall , Bloomberg , a multi-billionaire , has reined in spending with small across - the - board cuts and was salting away surpluses when Wall Street was riding high .
Wall Street makes up about a third of the city ’s wage base , and each financial sector job creates roughly three service positions in industries from law offices to small shops .
Bloomberg was unavailable for comment , and a spokeswoman would not discuss his plans .
News of his plans was first reported by The New York Times .
A number of likely candidates for mayor in 2009 blasted the idea , including Democratic Councilman Tony Avella who said : “ The worst thing an elected official can do is change the law to stay in office . ”
Bloomberg ’s predecessor , Republican Rudy Giuliani , also sought to stay on as mayor as his second term was ending in 2001 after the attacks of September 11 .
But his proposal proved unpopular , and its lack of success cleared the way for Bloomberg to run for the job .
A longtime Democrat , Bloomberg switched parties in 2001 in order to run in the less crowded Republican mayoral field .
He has since become an independent .
Bloomberg weighed a bid as an independent candidate for U.S. president this year but opted against it .
Every Major Terrorist Threat Has Ties to Pakistan

CIA Director Michael Hayden told the Atlantic Council this afternoon that al Qaeda ’s safe haven in Pakistan ’s ungoverned tribal areas have provided a “ sanctuary ” that has “ allowed it to recover some capacity lost when expelled from Afghanistan ” nearly seven years ago .
It has developed a “ close , co-dependent relationship with Pashtun extremist and separatist groups ” through very careful exploitation of cultural norms , respect for tribal leaders and , increasingly , intermarriage .
“ Let me be very clear , ” Hayden said , “ Today , virtually every major terrorist threat that my agency is aware of has threads back to the tribal areas . ”

TF2 vs. Vanilla FPS
Just about every game hits a point where they need to start talking about fine tuning the balance of how their combat works , and oftentimes , guns are usually brought up as the proper way to get the balance ball rolling .
Normally , this is a pretty good argument to base a balancing conversation on , but typically only if you ’re actually making a gun game .
It comes down to a “ narrow vs. broad ” scope issue , which I hope I can successfully illustrate below .
Too often , I think we as designers rely on the ideas of how the different ranged weapons work to find where the damage models in our games should belong .
Additionally , we as gamers wind up rewarding developers who keep making the same kind of gun games ( CoD4 , R6 , Battlefield , etc. ) that do n’t differentiate themselves very much due to being mired in a “ sim ” mentality .
The problem with this mentality is that guns ( real guns , that is ) are just too fine of a scope to use for anything other than gun combat balance .
Let ’s face it : they all do the same thing .
They shoot a bullet in a relatively straight line .
This fact rarely changes , regardless if it ’s a pistol , assault rifle , or a sniper rifle ( and even a shotgun ) .
The only variables you have to play with now are range , damage , rate of fire , ammo capacity , and spread if you ’re dealing with any kind of repeating weapon .
And even then , when you get down to the brass tacks , you wind up with a graph that looks a lot like this :
I like to call this Narrow Band gameplay .
I ’m not saying it ’s not fun .
It ’s just narrow .
The weapons have their differences ; their scale and scope are just closer together than I think people realize .
On the surface , especially to a game engine and the engine ’s rules , a pistol is n’t really all that different than a sniper rifle .
So when I first played Team Fortress 2 , I was a bit frustrated with the way the game played , because I was so accustomed to this Narrow Band form of FPS gameplay .
Sure , Halo had the Needler , and Unreal Tournament had a goo gun , but you could always just pick up another weapon in those games if you did n’t like the one you had .
You were n’t forced to keep the gun you had when you chose it , and so the gameplay model was n’t horribly changed from the Narrow Band form of gameplay .
It danced in the Broad Band path of balance , but if you could find a gun that shot straight when you needed it , you could always use it .
What I found in TF2 surprised me to a great extent , and I think it ’s why it has such staying power .
They pretty much built off of the previous “ team ” gametype models ( TF , Unreal Tournament ) and ratcheted that knob up to 11 .
First , they seemed to adopt the Blizzard multiplayer strategy of “ make every weapon feel overpowered , ” and then they balanced their weapons in such a way that hardly any gun shoots straight , and then made you keep them .
This , from a FPS design model , blew my frickin’ mind .
That to me is the definition of Broad Band balancing .
Just looking at the damage graph for their game is like looking at a cartoon model for weapon damage ( an irony not lost on anyone , to be sure ) :
Take a look at the two different “ Combined Experiences . ”
The typical vanilla FPS seems paltry by comparison .
That is n’t to say that it ’s a worse game or even a worse experience .
I actually enjoy both kinds of FPS combat balanced games .
But , I mean , dayum .
Look at that TF2 damage model .
It ’s just so freakin’ different compared to the other FPS shooters out there ( and no , Quake ’s guns were n’t balanced quite like this ) .
Weapons deal less damage the further the shot goes , some guns have a ridiculous spread / damage ratio on them mitigated by build / cooldown phases , and still others are completely useless save for a singular purpose .
And yet , it ’s a nearly perfectly balanced system .
No one weapon in TF2 has any clear uber advantage over all of the weapons in the game ( obviously , some have a designed advantage over another class ) .
But the amazing thing to me despite these radical differences in the style of combat balance , is that they are really just a matter of scale and perspective .
So long as you do n’t cross - over worlds , each system is balanced within its own universe .
Essentially , when both systems are balanced at their own respective scales , they almost become the same system , even though they appear to be worlds apart .
Despite this , I have the feeling that the “ Broad ” style games are much more difficult to balance , due to the “ overpowered ” nature of each gun , than the sim - like “ Narrow ” ones .
Anyone have any experience balancing both ?
This is a color composite image of the central region of our Milky Way galaxy , about 26,000 light years from Earth .
Giant clouds of gas and dust are shown in blue , as detected by the LABOCA instrument on the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment ( APEX ) telescope at submillimetre wavelengths ( 870 micron ) .
The image also contains near - infrared data from the 2MASS project at K - band ( in red ) , H - band ( in green ) , and J - band ( in blue ) .
The image shows a region approximately 100 light - years wide .
Outbursts from the black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy generate material that is stretched as it orbits near the gravitational behemoth .
New observations from two telescopes provide a better look at what 's going on down there .
While black holes can't be seen , material swirling into one is superheated , giving off radiation that can be observed .
While the Milky Way 's black hole is not among the most active in the universe , it is prone to flare - ups .
A team of European and US astronomers used ESO 's Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) and the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment ( APEX ) telescope , both in Chile , to study light from the black hole , called Sagittarius A* , at near - infrared wavelengths and the longer submillimeter wavelengths respectively .
This is the first time that astronomers have recorded an outburst with these telescopes simultaneously .
" Observations like this , over a range of wavelengths , are really the only way to understand what 's going on close to the black hole , " said Andreas Eckart of the University of Cologne , who led the team .
Sagittarius
A* is about 26,000 light - years away .
It is a supermassive black hole with a mass of about 4 million times that of the sun .
Most , if not all , galaxies are thought to have a supermassive black hole in their centers .
" Sagittarius A* is unique , because it is the nearest of these monster black holes , lying within our own galaxy , " said team member Frederick K. Baganoff of MIT .
" Only for this one object can our current telescopes detect these relatively faint flares from material orbiting just outside the event horizon . "
The emission from Sagittarius A* is thought to come from gas thrown off by stars , which then orbits and falls into the black hole .
The researchers detected violently variable infrared emission , with four major flares over a six - hour period .
The submillimeter - wavelength results showed flares that began more than an hour after the infrared flares .
The researchers explain that this time delay is probably caused by the rapid expansion , at speeds of about 3.1 million mph ( 5 million kph ) , of the clouds of gas that are emitting the flares .
This expansion causes changes in the character of the emission over time .
The material was moving at only 0.5 percent of the speed of light .
To escape from the very strong gravity so close to the black hole , the gas would have to be traveling at half the speed of light — 100 times faster than detected — and so the researchers believe that the gas cannot be streaming out in a jet .
Instead , they suspect that a blob of gas orbiting close to the black hole is being stretched out , like dough in a mixing bowl , and this is causing the expansion .

I ’ll be attending PloneConf this year again , giving a talk about Deliverance .
I ’ve been working on Deliverance lately for work , but the hard part about it is that it ’s not obviously useful .
To help explain it I wrote the philosophy of Deliverance , which I will copy here , to give you an idea of what I ’ve been doing :
Why is Deliverance ?
Why was it made , what purpose does it serve , why should you use it , how can it change the way you do web development ?
On the Subject of Platforms Right now we live in an age of platforms .
Developers ( or management or coincidence ) decides on a platform , and that serves as the basis for all future development .
Usually there ’s some old things from a previous platform ( or a primordial pre-platform age : I ’m looking at you formmail.pl !)
The goal is always to eliminate all of these old pieces , rewriting them for the new platform .
That goal is seldom attained in a timely manner , and even before it is accomplished you may be moving to the next platform .
Why do you have to port everything forward to the newest platform ?
Well , presumably it is better engineered .
The newest platform is presumably what people are most familiar with .
But if those were the only reasons it would be hard to justify a rewrite of working software .
Often the real push comes because your systems do n’t work together .
It ’s hard to keep templates in sync across all the platforms .
Multiple logins may be required .
Navigation is inconsistent and incomplete .
Functionality that cross-cuts pages — comments , login status , shopping cart status , etc — is n’t universally available .
A similar conflict arises when you consider how to add new functionality to a site .
For example , you may want to add a blog .
Do you :
Use the best blogging software available ?
Use something native to your platform ?
Write something yourself ?
The answer is probably 2 or 3 , because it would be too hard to integrate something foreign to your platform .
This form of choice means that every platform has some kind of “ blog ” , but the users of that blog are likely to only be a subset of the users of the parent platform .
This makes it difficult for winners to emerge , or for a well - developed piece of software to really be successful .
Platform - based software is limited by the adoption of the platform .
Not all software has a platform .
These tend to be the most successful web applications , things like Trac , WordPress , etc. “ Aha ! ” you think “ I ’ll just use those best - of - breed applications ! ”
But no !
Those applications themselves turn into platforms .
WordPress is practically a CMS .
Trac too .
Extensible applications , if successful , become their own platform .
This is not to place blame , they are n’t necessarily any worse than any other platform , just an acknowledgment that this move to platform can happen anywhere .
Beyond Platforms , or A Better Platform
One of the major goals of Deliverance is to move beyond platforms .
It is an integration tool , to allow applications from different frameworks or languages to be integrated gracefully .
There are only a few core reasons that people use platforms : A common look - and - feel across the site .
Cohesive navigation .
Indexing of the entire site .
Shared authentication and user accounts .
Cross-cutting functionality ( e.g. , commenting ) .
Deliverance specifically addresses 1 , providing a common look - and - feel across a site .
It can provide some help with 2 , by allowing navigation to be more centrally managed , without relying purely on per-application navigation ( though per-application navigation is still essential to navigating the individual applications ) .
3 , 4 , and 5 are not addressed by Deliverance ( at least not yet ) .
Deliverance applies a common theme across all the applications in your site .
It ’s basic unit of abstraction is HTML .
It does n’t use a particular templating language .
It does n’t know what an object is .
HTML is something every web application produces .
Deliverance ’s means of communication is HTTP .
It does n’t call functions or create request objects .
Again , everything speaks HTTP .
Deliverance also allows you to include output from multiple locations .
In all cases there ’s the theme , a plain HTML page , and the content , whatever the underlying application returns .
You can also include output from other parts of the site , most commonly navigation content that you can manage separately .
All of these pieces can be dynamic — again , Deliverance only cares about HTML and HTTP , it does n’t worry about what produces the response .
This is all very similar to systems built on XSLT transforms , except without the XSLT , and without XML .
Strictly speaking you can apply XSLT to any parseable markup , even HTML , but the most common ( or at least most talked about ) way to apply XSLT is using “ semantic ” XML output that is transformed into HTML .
Deliverance does not try to understand the semantics of applications , and instead expects them to provide appropriate presentation of whatever semantics the underlying application possesses .
Presentation is more universal than semantics .
While Deliverance does its best to work with applications as - they - exist , without making particular demands on those applications , it is not perfect .
Conflicting CSS can be a serious problem .
Some applications do n’t have very good structure to work with .
You ca n’t generate any content in Deliverance , you can only manipulate existing content , and often that means finding new ways to generate content , or making sure you have a place to store your content ( as in the case of navigation ) .
This is why arguably Deliverance does not remove the need for a platform , but is just its own platform .
In so far as this is true , Deliverance tries to be a better platform , where “ better ” is “ more universal ” rather than “ more powerful ” .
Most templating systems are more powerful than Deliverance transformations .
It can be useful to have access to the underlying objects used to procude the markup .
But Deliverance does n’t give you these things , because it only implements things that can be applied to any source of content .
Static files are entirely workable in Deliverance , just as any application written in Python , PHP , or even an application hosted on an entirely separate service is usable through Deliverance .

What Is Authority ?
by Michael Doliner
[ed .
This essay is about the US Constitution , the idea of a foundation , and the history behind it , based on Between Past and Future , a book by Hannah Arendt , originally published in 1961 and reprinted in 2006 by Penguin Classics edition , Penguin Group New York , NY , ISBN 0-14-310481 -0 , 298 pages ( paperback ) .
Michael Doliner studied with Hannah Arendt from 1965 to 1969 . ]
( Swans - November 3 , 2008 ) Some time around 1958 , Hannah Arendt wrote an essay called " What is Authority ? " that is reprinted in Between Past and Future .
Arendt claims that we do n't know what authority is because it no longer exists .
At the start she tries to clear away the prejudices of both left and right ; on the left the reflex thought that all authority is a restriction of freedom , and on the right the idea that authority requires an ever more rigid enforcement of laws .
These prejudices reinforce one another and leave authority itself completely hidden .
Seeing the world in terms of them obscures important distinctions between political regimes of tyranny , democracy , authoritarian rule , and totalitarianism that , with these prejudices , seem to blend into one another .
At this point Arendt recites what can only be called political history that illustrates just how deep our own problem is .
Even back then , in 1958 , Arendt points out that the crisis in authority has reached the level of childrearing in which parents lose authority because they have nothing really stable to pass on .
This is really an extension of the political problem .
The kaleidoscopic changes in the world have only accelerated since Arendt wrote the essay .
A quick sketch of this history will show us , in terms we are not used to using , at least a perspective on where we are today .
" Since authority always demands obedience , it is commonly mistaken for some form of power or violence .
Yet authority precludes the use of external means of coercion ; where force is used , authority itself has failed .
Authority , on the other hand , is incompatible with persuasion , which presupposes equality and works through a process of argumentation . "
( Between Past and Future Penguin Classics , New York , 2006 p. 92 . )
One aspect of our concept of authority is Platonic .
Socrates ' trial and death sentence were a Platonic obsession .
They convinced Plato that persuasion alone could not control the passions that the political realm could release .
He sought for some control on these passions that would retain freedom as the Athenians knew it .
That freedom was political freedom , the power to speak , be heard , and influence events , in other words , the ability to appear in public .
Our idea of free speech , that is , speech that nobody listens to , would have had no more interest for the Greeks than it does for us .
To say , " I disagree with what he says but I will fight for his right to say it , " is precisely the wrong idea , for it promises at the start that you will not listen .
Freedom requires others to hear , others who are also free , free to let words and meanings enter their minds , and then to judge .
Thus , as Plato often points out , the tyrant is not free , nor are any of his subjects .
Freedom involves a plurality of equals who have the opportunity to listen , the ability to weigh what is said , and the power to act upon it .
When done right it makes a society very smart in human affairs , a genius , an Athens as it were , among nations .
Thus Athens , thus republican Rome .
It allows people to think together about their most pressing concerns .
Minds are honed against minds .
Obviously , we are not doing it right .
Too bad , too .
Because the Chinese are very smart and are kicking our butts .
And the Russians , once they got rid of thinking they needed to play an expensive game called " Cold War " with us , look damn formidable .
They know what we apparently do not : that imperialism is over .
If we can't get rid of this crappy government , we 're doomed .
Plato 's problem was this : how could political freedom be preserved and the passions that destroyed Socrates be controlled ?
According to Arendt , Plato never found the answer .
Because the Greeks had no political experience of authority he had to find his model elsewhere , and he looked to the household , where he saw a despot .
Plato looked for a despotic force that also preserved freedom .
Clearly what is needed is a force external to those actually in power , " an external force which transcends the political realm . " ( p. 97 ) Near the end of Plato 's life he proposed the laws for this job .
Plato hoped that the laws would supply this " external force . "
To force " the many , " to whom reason cannot reach , to obey the laws , Plato produced the myth of Er , the first description of the later Christian hell .
Fear of hell was supposed to keep the many from giving license to their passions .
The " ideas " would persuade " the few , " to whom reason does speak .
But the ideas proved inadequate for the job .
The ideas are eternal unchanging truths .
Arendt argues that the original ultimate idea , as Plato saw it , was " the beautiful , " " that which shines most brightly , " rather than " the good , " " the useful . "
He needed " the good " to make the ideas applicable in the lower political world .
Since in the realm of ideas the beautiful is higher than the good , bringing the ideas into the political realm corrupts them .
For in the political realm we sacrifice the beautiful to the good ( useful ) .
Thus the philosopher , in trying to bring the ideas into the political realm , ceases to be a philosopher , for he corrupts the ideas .
Power also corrupts him , but even before power corrupts him , entry into the cave , so to speak , corrupts him by forcing him to misrepresent the ultimate idea .
The image of the cave also offers a second problem in that it portrays the citizens as merely looking on rather than speaking and taking part .
As a sideline I mention that all this is a philosophical challenge to anyone , like Leo Strauss , who might think to have philosophers rule .
Plato argues for the authority of his philosopher king by analogy with experts in other activities .
When it comes to health we defer to the doctor , for steering a ship we let the helmsman rule .
So too in the political realm we should defer to the expert in ideas and the laws .
So persuasive is this image that we accept without question the right of " experts " to rule .
But the analogy is false for there is no expert in the affairs of human beings ; that is , political affairs , or was n't one until Plato 's view dominated men 's minds .
Political affairs , the truly democratic Athenians believed , can only be run through free and open discussion in which the words and the appearance of their speaker actually have the power to persuade .
You want to listen to the person who has the best grasp of the present situation , and he is not necessarily the one who has studied what he thinks are the precedents .
In practice we doubt this pseudo expert who must bolster his authority and augment it with violence , either in the hereafter , in the mythical Er that the many believe in , or here and now , in the form of police .
But with violence , even its threat , freedom disappears .
The need for despotism is taken from analogy to the household , and the philosopher 's authority from an analogy with the expert .
Politics is , or should be , a community of equals , so both are improper analogies for the political realm and distort it .
Aristotle tried to solve this by substituting the analogy of teacher and pupil for that of captain and sailors .
The pupils are not slaves ( those who do what others think or what necessity demands ) and will become equal with their teachers .
But , Arendt insists , this too fails because the relationship in the educational analogy is temporary and political rule is not .
She remarks that when a politician claims to educate he conceals an effort to dominate .
In any case the Greeks took none of this seriously and continued in various ways with various amounts of democracy , but no authority .
It was the Romans who discovered the true nature of authority in their idea of foundation .
Whereas the Greeks found it quite easy to take off from their native cities and found colonies , the Romans were never able to do so .
There was one city , Rome .
The Romans saw Rome as growing and developing , an edifice slowly taking shape upon a foundation , the foundation was its founding , a unique event .
Life was a process of looking back to the foundation and adding to this edifice .
The word auctoritas derives from the verb augere ( " augment " ) , and what authority or those in authority constantly augment is the foundation .
The elders had authority " and had obtained it by descent and by transmission ( tradition ) from those who had laid the foundation for all things to come , ... " ( p. 121 ) All authority rested upon the wisdom of the founders who were no longer among the living .
The foundation was sacred and bound all future generations .
In this way the true authority was outside those who had actual power , that is , it is in the ancestors .
Arendt describes the trinity of religion , tradition , and authority as three legs upon which the political structure could stand .
The whole edifice was mostly within the human mind , not so much in ideas as in attitudes .
Roman religion comes from religio , to tie back .
It made one feel it was important to be pious , which meant to accept the transmission , through tradition , of what was needed to continue to build upon the foundation .
Those in authority interpreted the meaning .
They had to be old and in every other way plausibly connected as deeply as was humanly possible to the foundation itself .
They were supposed to give advice that drew from the wisdom of the ages , but they made no attempt to bestow absolute standards , as our laws do .
The Roman auctors were not the men who met in public , debated in the forum , and became the massive figures in Roman history .
No , for the most part they read the augers in entrails or the flight of birds , drew upon the well - known events in Roman history , gave warnings , and cautioned against certain enterprises .
It was generally considered catastrophic to avoid their advice .
When Rome waned and the church replaced it , it too founded itself upon a " rock , " a foundation .
" The basis of the Church as a community of believers and a public institution was now no longer the Christian faith in resurrection ( though this faith remained its content ) or the Hebrew obedience to the commands of God , but rather the testimony of the life , of the birth , death , and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth as a historically recorded event . " ( p. 125 ) The church was now an edifice , growing in history on the foundation of the historical facticity of Jesus , evidence of which was transmitted through the church .
The church draws its authoritative wisdom from the stories in the bible .
So the adaptation of the Roman - type foundation when the church became political changed the Christian religion itself .
The Greeks , including Plato and Aristotle , were the Roman " fathers " of thought and culture .
With the collapse of Rome , the church , now as a political entity , growing as it did among people used to this foundational model , naturally adopted it , and with it , Plato and Aristotle .
The Church established itself with a new foundation , and started over with a new Year One , at that point already well in the past .
The church then found itself with Plato 's problem , how to control the passions , and took Plato 's solution , sort of .
In place of the laws they put the commandments and injunctions of the Bible , and in so doing they tried to institute an absolute set of values , a " measure of measurements . "
But whereas the ideas compelled belief through argument , and not through any form of violence , the church needed to adopt Plato 's myth of Er , the Christian hell , to compel obedience to the commandments .
Thus it introduced violence into the foundation , and corrupted it .
For even the threat of violence is violence , and its use , politically , destroys authority and therefore political freedom .
For the purpose of political violence is to coerce speech away from belief .
Adopting
Er corrupted the church itself , for those high in the church had to admit that one of the greatest pleasures of heaven is watching the sinners writhe down below .
Evangelical Christianity is built upon this frisson , which is just about as far away as you can get from Jesus ' original teachings .
But , as a temptation , this frisson has been there smoldering within the church from its beginning as a political entity .
Thus the foundation within the church was always flawed and needed the threat of violence for support .
The mistake seems to go back to the longing for absolute rigid standards compounded by the need to use the commandments in the Bible in place of the laws .
With no justification the commandments needed the threat of violence to coerce obedience and with it inevitable corruption of the elite who would now enjoy watching from heaven over others suffering in hell .
Such a foundation not only did not guarantee , but actually closed down , whatever political space there was .
But over the centuries , for various reasons , fear of hell waned .
With the waning of the fear of hell , men no longer feared the consequences of violating the canons of " good . "
By the time of Machiavelli , church and state were thoroughly corrupt .
Perhaps because all foundational structure had collapsed into tyranny Machiavelli was able to understand the essence of this Roman structure .
He had the idea to reestablish the " state , " a name he invented for such foundation - based edifices .
Arendt claims Machiavelli sounds like Robespierre and he conceived of revolution , a new start , a new foundation .
But whereas the Romans located their foundation safely in the past , Machiavelli ( and Robespierre ) had to " make " theirs , and they were willing to use violence or any other means to do so .
For to think of " making " a foundation is to take a household category , that of making , for a political one .
Thus their efforts were necessarily doomed from the start .
For , as Arendt pointed out , where violence is used authority is already dead .
So , as we have seen , creating such structures is a tricky business .
The foundation has to have some august presence just to persuade people that it is worth building upon .
Both the church and Rome were fortunate to have foundations conveniently in the past .
It is much harder to start anew with a foundation actually laid in the present if you are going to expect people to respect it and consider it the wisdom of the ages .
Arendt claimed that all such attempts , save the American Revolution , had failed .
Americans did treat their document as a sacred document , its framers as Founding Fathers .
She speculates that the American " Revolution " succeeded because it had not grown out of a violent revolution , but a war with England , a quite different thing .
The defeated were not part of the new body politic , or if they were the Constitution was not a document written by the victors to rule the vanquished .
Most importantly , the Constitution did create a new body politic , something that had really never before been done on a fully conscious founding like the Constitutional Convention .
Also , Arendt guessed , the Constitution succeeded because it copied already existing charters , so it did n't have to create a foundation on bare ground .
There was some measure of casting the foundation back in time to the elders .
Given the difficulties , the American success in creating a foundation that actually protected political freedom was something of a miracle .
And if that is so we can see just what a precious and precarious thing this foundational " state " is .
That the political space within it is now closed there can be no doubt .
Although the Bush administration , since 9/11 , has slammed the door to political freedom shut , it had been closing for some time .
Arendt holds out little hope for its resurrection .
" Authority as we once knew it , which grew out of the Roman experience of foundation and was understood in the light of Greek political philosophy , has nowhere been reestablished , either through revolutions or through the even less promising means of restoration . " ( p. 143 ) From this perspective , revolutions , which we think of as a radical break , are actually an extension of the tradition , for a revolution is an attempt to set up a new foundation .
Since they are the only means of salvation provided by the tradition when things go wrong , and since all revolutions since the French have failed , apparently this means of salvation is inadequate .
The phony politics , the undermining of the Bill of Rights , the lying , the political violence , all show that the American foundation is gone .
It can not be revived because its contents , a system of checks and balances , which were supposed to check and balance the passions , have not been able to resist the onslaught of these passions upon the Constitution itself .
When the time came it could not deploy impeachment , its only tool for redress , in its own defense .
The premise of the Constitution is that its structure will control passions .
If something from outside the Constitution now restores it , say Barack Obama 's good will , then the Constitution 's structures to control human passions were both ineffective and superfluous , hence unnecessary .
So its restoration will only show its superfluity .
Regimes without political space quickly exhaust themselves .
They become ever stupider .
Real life , Arendt argues elsewhere , is lived within political space .
Once that opportunity disappears a person becomes , in Arendt 's word , embarrassed .
He can not be himself .
The expression , which used to be heard in every American home no matter how humble , that " even a boy who grew up in a log cabin could become president , " energized many an American life .
Now that this is no longer believed , Americans are dragging themselves across the landscape .
Galveston and New Orleans are still not cleaned up and their former inhabitants are all but abandoned .
Clearly restoration of the old foundation is impossible , not only for the reason above , but because of all the American political violence .
And we might as well admit that we wo n't this time be able to create a new foundational structure free of violence that would have sufficient majesty and plausibility .
The first time required Fortuna 's rare , oh so rare , smile .
We will not see it again .
That leaves either the possibility of a form of government without any political space , a tyranny or a totalitarian movement , with all that horror and boredom and transience , or some kind of democracy without any foundational structure , à la Athens .
Americans , never having been without a foundational structure , cannot imagine doing without it .
Our foundation has been in law , interpreted by scholars , the latter - day philosophers .
But is it so obvious that senators should be lawyers , Supreme Court Justices , " legal scholars , " and that advice should come from " think tanks " ?
Is it so obvious that someone who has the ability to listen to evidence and come to a conclusion that seems just to most people , needed to have studied a lot of " precedents " ?
We already know that in real life , for example where it concerns the abortion issue , precedents are meaningless .
Judges simply lean one way or the other regardless of precedent .
And we already know that a lawyer 's subtle arguments from precedent often produce injustice .
People have lived without a foundation before .
The United States is far too big to be a single foundationless democracy ; that is best suited to a city state .
It might break up .
But it is hard to imagine Americans not desperately trying , again and again , to set up a new foundation .
It is , after all , all they have ever known .
More than likely , given the general lassitude the end of freedom has produced , the United States will try to hold up the shredded and now hollow Constitution and continue to try to fool itself for as long as it can that , somehow , all the pieces can be fit back together again , and , somehow , what has happened can be forgotten .
They will wave the tattered Constitution like a sad little paper flag .
The only hope is what is always the only hope , the sudden flowering of political space in which those who are making the most sense , rather than those who hew to a particular line , are heard .
At this point this is , admittedly , a fantasy .
Given the immense differences in attitude in the United States , the unbridgeable gap of racism , the growing separation of classes , the institutional stupidity of the ruling elite , the anomie within monomaniacal capitalism , the paranoia whipped up behind 9/11 , and the panic as real problems begin to destroy social structure , good sense will not be easy to hear or distinguish from self - serving propaganda .
So the idea of political freedom suddenly flowering within the United States is hard to believe in .
Passions boiling over do not augur well .
But , if the Athenians could rationally take the step to abandon their city in the face of the huge Persian army and fleet bearing down on them , thus making an almost unimaginable political move in the face of panic - inducing imminent disaster , perhaps we too can do something .
Who knows ?
There is an alternative to entering this unknown , something brand new , never before considered in this whole story .
I propose it here for the first time .
I propose that we get ourselves a " Gadfly , " an official Socrates as it were .
This figure is sacrosanct .
Anyone who threatens him will die the most unpleasant possible death .
That ought to be enough to protect Socrates .
But he has no power other than to ask questions of anyone any time any place .
Now , of course , such a person is a real pain in the ass .
So although it is verboten to threaten the Gadfly it is perfectly all right to heap verbal abuse upon him if he , say , engages you incessantly with nonsense .
Of course , if he finds himself unable to speak in a public square because he is outshouted by idiots and lunatics , he would no doubt retire to a private house with intelligent company .
I admit getting this started in America with its cacophony will be a challenge .
But Socrates was also fascinating and serious , and people remained quiet to hear what he had to say .
The problem , Americans might think , would be whom would we choose as Gadfly .
But that would be easy .
It would be a sport , like a tournament at first , in which the contestants would have to engage in a Socratic argument with one another .
There is always a winner or a loser , but the Gadfly will also have to do more than win : he will have to attract a crowd .
Arguments about stupid things bore us , as do arguments carried on at stupid levels .
On the other hand people talking about what we need to talk about on an intelligent level , and perhaps with irony and logic , fascinate us .
Socrates mesmerized Alcibiades , the most beautiful and jaded and resourceful youth Athens ever had .
The Gadfly will have to , with talk alone , be so fascinating that people will be dying to hear what he has to say .
It 's a very tall order .
There has only been one Socrates , ever .
In America the whole thing might degenerate into a stand - up comedy act , but I do n't believe it would .
I am surprising optimistic on that part .
The Gadfly would be rewarded with decent varied food to eat , decent clothes to wear , and an average house where he can get off by himself .
His children would be brought up at the expense of the state .
Other than that the Gadfly lives a life of poverty .
No fancy anything .
Now , here is the scary part .
This Gadfly can ask anyone , even the president , anything .
He can go anywhere , into any meeting with his television cameras .
One television station will have the right to follow him and will share in his absolute immunity from the slightest threat under pain of the most horrible possible punishment from which hell itself would be a vacation .
The station will be supported entirely by the public and will have no programming other than watching the Gadfly whenever he wants it to do so .
It will have no advertising itself but will have advertisements on all other channels saying simply when there will be a " gadfly show " and whatever the gadfly wants to say about it .
No flash of any kind .
Of course this setup would be the end of secrecy .
There would be no secrets , no secret meetings .
Holy shit , they would know where our bombs are !
Yes I suppose it does require us to recognize that there is really no possibility , no remote possibility , of civilization surviving another major war .
We would have to recognize that the global contest cannot any longer be waged with war .
The ecosystem would no longer support us after that .
Although there might possibly be Homo sapiens still around they would not be living anything like we do .
Resources are too precious to even engage in minor wars .
Our wars are bleeding us to death as the Soviet Union 's bled them .
To be this institutional Gadfly is the punishment Socrates proposed for himself in place of the death sentence , so to establish the position of " Gadfly " would , in some measure , right the wrong of Socrates ' execution .
Perhaps then we could end this long twentieth century , which , in the form of science , has been philosophy 's finest gift and its revenge for Socrates ' death .
The world would have been completely different if the Athenian Assembly had taken Socrates up on his offer , and the Gadfly become an essential political office .
Now having a Gadfly is not the same as having a real public space , and a Socratic elenchus is not a form of political speech , but it would go a long way towards breaking up all the crap that is preventing the public space from opening up again .

The business end of Hanky Panky Paulson 's bazooka is glowing red hot as it continues to fire round after round of high explosive moral hazard contains an up to 85 billion dollar , two - year bridge loan from the Fed to the world 's largest insurer , AIG , to be guaranteed by the US taxpayer via the US Treasury .
Warrants convertible to up to 80 % of the common stock of AIG will be pledged as collateral to secure the US Treasury 's loan guarantee to the Fed , with proceeds from the sale of AIG 's now virtually worthless assets being supposedly used to pay down the loan .
It 's just Bear Stearns mixed with Fannie and Freddie .
You have a loan from the Fed guaranteed by the US Treasury being used to bail out AIG directly instead of being used to facilitate the assassination of BS by a predatory lender ( i.e. JP Morgan Chase ) , and you have what will be ultimate taxpayer ownership of AIG 's toxic waste by having common stock pledged as collateral instead of being purchased through equity injections , as with Fannie and Freddie .
The Treasury 's potential 80 % ownership greatly dilutes the value of the existing common shareholders , and the Treasury has been given the right to stop dividend payments on both common and preferred stock of AIG shareholders , which means basically that they have both just been vaporized .
The Fed 's Fascist Follies continue .
You , the US taxpayer , will now not only end up owning nearly worthless stock in these corporate cesspools , you have assumed all of their liabilities up to the amount of the loans / capital injections .
Remember , the bondholders are still ahead of you !!!
BS was $ 29 billion ( plus ) , Fannie and Freddie are $ 300 billion just for openers , soon to grow into a loss in excess of one trillion , perhaps even as much as two trillion or more , and now we pour another 85 billion into the pot of boiling moral hazard for AIG .
As we inhale the radioactive fumes from the detonation of this latest round of DU laced moral hazard , the stock markets and the dollar rally , while gold and silver decline , all thanks to the manipulation of markets that are rigged daily by the same scum who are bailing out the fraudsters .
It is nothing short of surreal .
Who do these cretins running our government , the Fed and Wall Street think they are to presume that we , the taxpayers , want to bail out these rampaging corporate fraud machines ?!
Who are they to saddle us with this debt when they have already overspent us into a nearly 100 trillion dollar national debt nightmare , after future costs of entitlement are factored in using GAPP ( generally accepted accounting principals ) .
Have n't they done enough damage already ?
Let these morons fail before their malevolent fraud and unprecedented and profligate financial imbecility cause the whole world economy to implode and then collapse as if blasted by a Force 5 tornado .
This is a clear case of : " You can pay me now , or you can pay me ( a whole lot more ) later . "
Let 's take our medicine now before these inane , vapid , Ponzi - scheming fraudsters send us into an even bigger debt - bubble oblivion as they continue to pump out more toxic waste with their Fascist , Freddie , Fannie , Fraud machine only to ask for even more bailouts !
We ask , is any of this even legal ?
Does it pass Constitutional muster ?
Unfortunately , and not surprisingly , our cowardly Congress and President never say " no " to anything the Illuminati ask for !
Could it be because they are all on the same team ?
We believe our subscribers know the answer to that question .
Vote out all incumbents , except for Ron Paul , in November .
As this transpires , Lehman Brothers has , somewhat surprisingly , been left to expire in the financial dessert as the Illuminist vultures circle it , waiting to pick its juiciest bones .
Barclays has torn the first shred of flesh and acquired its North American banking operations and investment research and trading businesses , plus its Times Square headquarters and other real estate , for $ 1.75 billion .
The Illuminists , through the nefarious , dirty dealings arranged by their privately owned Fed , their corrupt Treasury and SEC bootlickers , and their Wall Street cohorts , will now pick and choose who goes under and who stays afloat , and will arrange for who will buy out whom , as they fashion their next incarnation of our corporatist , fascist system .
You just saw Bank of America eat Merrill Lynch for 50 billion after turning down the offer to buy out Lehman Brothers .
This is the same bank that just bought a toxic waste dump known as Countrywide in what can only be a described as a suicidal move .
Now , Bank of America goes bonzai for Merrill Lynch , yet another toxic waste dump , as they tie on their red sun bandanas and get ready to go down in a blaze of glory .
What are these people thinking ?!
Are they that clueless that they can't see that all the assets in these companies are overvalued and are not marked to market , and that there are likely to be huge mortgage noteholder recourse and derivative counterparty liabilities ?
They should have waited and bought Merrill Lynch for a song , or not bought it at all .
Perhaps their arms were twisted by the Illuminists .
It is impossible to know all the nefarious machinations that are happening out there as our zombie economy implodes .
Watch all the options and short - sales frauds that will be running rampant as these greedy Shylocks use all their inside information , fed to them by the Fed and government officials in attendance at these clandestine meetings .
The Illuminati will now get to play financial gods , determining who lives and who gets the axe , so why not use that inside information to your advantage ?
At the upper levels of Wall Street , all trading is done based on inside information about breaking news and about planned market manipulations .
The Illuminists control the secret meetings , the fane - stream media and the manipulation of markets through the PPT .
They have a monopoly on inside information and market manipulation , and believe us when we tell you , they use both of these monopolies to rape , pillage and burn anyone that is not in their fascist , Marxist club .
They especially like to slaughter and devour the morons who use black boxes for investment , who they eat for breakfast every morning as the markets open .
Look at what just happened to gold and silver specs on the COMEX over these past two months .
We rest our case .
Note how , in all the above bailout situations , the shareholders get vaporized , and the bondholders get saved .
This is in keeping with what we told you about the bond markets , namely , that they are the seat of Illuminist power .
The small investors , the municipalities , the regional banks and the pension plans who invested heavily in the stocks of these failing companies get vaporized , while the bond - holding Wall Street fraudsters , the transnational Illuminist conglomerates and the thieving , currency - manipulating nations which took undue advantage of the elitists ' free trade , globalist agenda , or which gouged us with monopolistic pricing of oil and other essential commodities , get a bailout , courtesy of their victims .
It is like a mugger who steals your money , gambles it away , and then asks you to make good on his losses .
Even the mafia does n't go that far !
The message is now quite clear .
The sucker - dupe , equity - injection scheme , where big players like sovereign wealth funds are lured into rescuing fraudsters by providing capital under circumstances that are deceitfully made to look like tempting bargains , is now at an end .
Forget about equity injections .
Rescuing these toxic waste sewer holes , which we call “ fraudsters ” , is the surest way to blow your money out your derriere .
Talk about throwing good money after bad !
The big players have had their fill of this fraud and will now be content to stand aside , take flight and circle like the vultures they are , waiting to pick the bones of the walking dead , zombie companies who have been poisoned by the toxic waste derivatives that have been spread around the globe by the Illuminist fraudsters in the US .
The problem , which the fraudsters now face , is not a problem with liquidity , but with equity capital .
When you borrow money , you have the borrowed money as an asset , but then you have an equal , off - setting liability .
You get your equity capital either through accumulated profits , or by the sale of equitable securities like common or preferred stock .
Sufficient equity capital must be maintained , or your company becomes non-compliant with stock exchange rules , or with government regulations , and usually this triggers defaults on your debts as well , and the market loses all confidence in your ability to stay in business .
So basically , without sufficient equity capital , also known as net worth , your company is toast .
Losses , as from toxic waste , eat directly into your equity capital , and you must either sell assets and liquidate debts to meet your mandatory debt to equity ratios or you go under and file for bankruptcy .
In the present case , the Fed is flooding the system with liquidity , but the bank 's can't make any profits by use of fractional reserve banking leverage because they are afraid to lend money , which is what they are supposed to be doing for a living .
They are afraid to lend money because everyone is lying about their assets , and they wo n't even lend to one another much less to companies outside the banking system .
Without profits , there can be no new equity added to your balance sheets unless you get an equity injection from the sale of stock issues .
But now , because all the bailouts have vaporized shareholders , no one is in the mood to buy the stocks of companies suffering from toxic waste problems , especially companies like AIG that are heavily into counterparty liability on credit default swaps , which are costing them billions every quarter .
Because of these problems with equity capital , the Illuminati have taken a two - pronged approach .
The vipers of fraud , greed and speculation have run amok among many financial institutions around the world , flashing their toxic waste derivative fangs dripping with toxic waste poison , inflicting many bites , and injecting their toxic waste poison into the wounds .
The central banks have cut an " X " into the wounds , and are attempting to suck the poison back out .
They have two main suction cups .
First , the Fed and other central banks around the world are acting as a clearing house for toxic waste .
The Fed , for instance , has just extended their term securities lending facility by allowing their 20 or so primary dealers , flagship Illuminist companies all , to exchange any of their investment grade ( BBB or better ) securities for treasury paper , where before they were only allowing AAA paper ( even if the rating was false ) , and these auctions are going to weekly instead of bi-weekly intervals , so as to make sure the exchange of treasuries for toxic waste is readily available and that no one important to the system is left hanging .
This gives the Fed a lot of power , because anyone who gets out of line does not get his loan of treasury paper renewed .
You play their game , or you get taken out .
The Fed is acting as a parking lot for toxic waste vehicles so that the fraudsters do not have to show the garbage on their balance sheets , showing treasury paper instead .
That way , they are not forced into the fire - sale of derivatives to shore up their tanking equity capital positions as their mortgage related derivatives go into meltdown .
Such fire - sales could bring the whole system down by forcing other suffering institutions to mark their toxic waste derivatives to market , instead of marking them to model .
The elitists have taken a huge chance by allowing Lehman Brothers to fail .
Fire - sale bankruptcy liquidations do not good derivative prices make , and bankruptcy is bound to set off some large holdings of credit default swaps , and who knows where that could lead .
We suspect that this may be one of the most protracted bankruptcies in legal history for that very reason - to delay the liquidation of Lehman 's toxic waste .
We further suspect that Lehman will be bought up piece by piece in sales approved by the bankruptcy court but not made public ( i.e. a gag order will be placed on the terms of sale ) .
Second , the Fed is transferring liability for losses to the sheople taxpayers , by conspiring with the usual Illuminist players to design bailouts dripping with moral hazard .
For instance , trillions in toxic waste have just been transferred to the Treasury by virtue of its authorization and consent to inject equity in exchange for preferred stock .
They will just keep creating money out of nothing to keep buying preferred stock in order to provide the funds to make the bondholders whole , whether the bondholders are those who have loaned money to Fannie and Freddie directly , or are those who own mortgages or mortgage derivatives made or guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie .
The limits will be raised as high as necessary , and already $ 1.3 trillion has been authorized by raising the national debt ceiling in anticipation of the problems to come .
Since the Fed now holds a bunch of AAA - rated GSE toxic waste that it has exchanged for treasuries , in a very real sense , the Fannie and Freddie bailout is , in an extremely substantial way , a bailout of the privately owned Federal Reserve Bank itself , which we predicted would eventually end up eating the toxic waste to save the system .
Further , because the sheople have just guaranteed all this GSE paper , which previously carried a high risk of default due to the poor financial condition of Fannie and Freddie , the paper no longer carries such a high risk of default and will now retain substantially more of its value , thereby saving large financial institutions throughout the world from having to mark these assets down to account for the former elevated risk , and thus obviating the need for fire - sales of these assets to reduce debt and maintain equity capital levels , which would have led to a mark to market disaster for the big players .
This is also why the Fed has now opened itself up to absorb anything BBB or above , because all the GSE paper it holds has been guaranteed by the sheople .
And remember , those dollar bills you hold are not backed by gold anymore , but are now backed by the Fed 's general collateral , which was diminishing rapidly as it took in the toxic waste through it term securities lending facility .
The GSE bailout thus helped to preserve a large portion of the Fed 's general collateral , and this may in part account for the dollar 's rally when the GSE bailout was announced .
This is of course ridiculous , because what they hold is nothing but " worthless paper , " but that is not yet the perception of investors .
Otherwise , they would be storming the gold and silver pits .
The Fed may now in fact return the GSE paper it holds back to its original owner , because it is no longer perceived to be at great risk , and the Fed 's treasury paper will be returned to the Fed , where it can be used to absorb other , more troublesome , toxic waste .
The same reasoning was used to have the taxpayers save AIG , because this prevented the fire - sale of derivatives that would have been forced by a bankruptcy , and prevented a meltdown in the credit default swaps issued by AIG and the bonds these swaps insured , had AIG gone under .
It is all about preventing mark - downs and fire - sales .
Many banks , investment banks , mortgage companies and insurance companies like Fannie , Freddie , Bear Stearns , Merrill Lynch , Lehman Brothers and AIG are totally insolvent and nothing can help them stay afloat , save a bailout forced down the throats of the hapless sheople taxpayers either directly or via a buyout planned by the Illuminists and funded most likely with guaranteed financing , courtesy of the sheople .
Those companies that are allowed to fail , like Lehman Brothers , will be picked clean by various predatory Illuminist interests for pennies on the dollar just as we have described in previous issues of the IF .
Wait until a thousand banks go under .
The Illuminati will have a field day .
Meanwhile , as tanking stocks , bonds and derivatives take down banks and pension plans , the sheople will get to eat the depositor losses and the losses suffered by participants in under - funded pension plans through the almost broke FDIC and PBGC .
These losses will also run in the trillions of dollars .
The Illuminists are setting up a feeding frenzy for the sovereign wealth funds of other nations , who will no longer provide equity injections as discussed above .
That is why the FTC has discontinued publishing statistics regarding foreign investment in US assets .
Such investments are about to explode and the many treasuries out there are going to come home to roost , stoking inflation to unbelievable levels .
Those unlucky institutions that are allowed to fail will be fed to the hungry piranha , so they can dump their dollar surpluses in a more gradual fashion .
The Illuminati were threatened with a catastrophic dollar meltdown via a flood of sales of treasury paper , and they had to turn to the OPEC nations , especially Saudi Arabia , to force oil prices down , and to sell euros for dollars , and get the dollar to rally .
The dollar rally has taken pressure off exporting nations like Russia , China , Japan and Europe by making their exports more competitive with US consumers , and will enable them to buy more tangible property here in the US before ever - accelerating hyperinflation erodes , and eventually destroys , the purchasing power of their US dollar forex reserves .
Such reserves were accumulated through trade surpluses made possible by illegal currency manipulations that gave these nations unfair trade advantages against their US competitors , and this , coupled with free trade and globalization that did away with trade tariffs , has devastated our domestic businesses , especially our manufacturing sector .
Obviously , the Dickster had to go to Saudi Arabia to do some arm - twisting to " git 'er done . "
We are certain the Saudis did not relish lower oil prices or the inflation that a stronger dollar would impose through their dollar pegs , but in the end , self - preservation won out .
The Saudis undoubtedly also assisted with the gold and silver market manipulations that have taken precious metals to bargain basement levels , thus providing those who missed the previous rallies with a new , and very favorable , entry point .

ISR Issue 62 , November December 2008 A new political landscape
ISR ’s Lance Selfa contends a Democratic sweep will put a final exclamation point on a political era
AS THE longest - ever presidential campaign season moved into its last month , it became increasingly likely that Democrat Barack Obama would be the next president .
As the ISR goes to press about three weeks before Election Day , it appears that not only will Obama win , but that he will carry with him a substantial Democratic sweep that will toss Republicans out of office at all levels of government .
In the language of mainstream political analysis , 2008 is shaping up as a “ wave ” election that will alter the political landscape that has dominated American politics for a generation .
The ascension to the White House of an African American — in a country founded on African slavery — is historic .
Obama even has a good chance of winning southern states like Virginia and North Carolina that no Democratic presidential candidate has won in decades .
A huge Obama sweep will put an exclamation point on the end of a political era largely characterized by a backlash against the racial and social progress of the 1960s .
The conservative domination of mainstream politics and rhetoric over the last generation began with Richard Nixon ’s “ Southern strategy ” of coded racist appeals .
It reached its apogee with Ronald Reagan , who proclaimed that “ the South will rise again ” and whipped up resentment against “ welfare queens . ”
But the politics that Nixon , Reagan , and their successors in the Republican right — from Newt Gingrich to George W. Bush — promoted was n’t simply about making racism respectable .
It was about creating a popular base of support for a domestic neoliberal program of tax cuts for the rich , deregulation , union - busting and cutbacks in vital government programs for the poor .
Coupled with this free - market fundamentalism was a huge increase in the military budget and a more aggressive U.S. foreign policy stance .
That era now appears to be at an end .
After the administration of George W. Bush , governing for most of his term with a Republican majority committed to all of the tenets of the “ conservative revolution , ” ordinary Americans have seen the results : two disastrous wars draining hundreds of billions from taxpayers , a major American city washed away in a flood while the government looked on , and the greatest financial and economic crisis since the Great Depression .
As Obama might say , the electorate looks set to deliver the “ final verdict ” on the “ Republican revolution , ” and it wo n’t be pretty for the GOP .
Amidst the elation that millions will feel when they see George W. Bush and his cronies slink away from Washington will be the realization that the next four years — if not longer — will be difficult .
In addition to the disaster the economic crisis will bring ordinary Americans , the U.S. will also face the prospect of repeated overseas crises .
Richard Holbrooke , on the short - list to be secretary of state in an Obama administration , put it succinctly in the lead article of the September / October 2008 Foreign Affairs :
“ The next president will inherit a more difficult opening - day set of international problems than any of his predecessors have since at least the end of World War II .
In such circumstances , his core challenge will be nothing less than to re-create a sense of national purpose and strength , after a period of drift , decline , and disastrous mistakes . ”
Aside from general statements that “ the next president will have to scale back his agenda and some of his proposals , ” as Obama told the Associated Press , Obama and his team have been coy about what they plan to do .
So far , they have spent more time talking about what they wo n’t cut back — the military budget , plans for health care reform , investing in infrastructure , and so on — then what they will be forced to scale back .
It would be nice to assume that health care reform , an energy and infrastructure jobs program , and aid to education would n’t be casualties of the ill - conceived $ 700 billion bailout plan passed in October ( for which Obama campaigned and voted ) or of future similar efforts that are sure to come .
Unfortunately , that is n’t the way Washington works .
You can be sure that while Obama is promising to make greedy Wall Streeters pay and promising not to cut essential programs , his advisers are reviewing ways to do exactly that .
The challenge for them will be to identify not only places to cut the budget , but also ways to sell the cuts to a fed - up electorate that will be expecting relief .
In the current climate , Obama will have to sell austerity in such a way that it does not appear that he is bailing out Wall Street and doing nothing , as his campaign rhetoric emphasized , for “ Main Street . ”
That means he will have to sell the idea of shared sacrifice .
Any austerity - driven program that he and his Democratic colleagues pass will reflect the fact that they want to step up to the role of American capital ’s preferred team — after an election that looks set to leave the GOP in shambles .
Wall Street quite obviously leaned on the Democrats to win the unpopular bailout plan .
Meanwhile , business viewed the Republicans as “ irresponsible ” for having provided more “ no ” votes than the Democrats did .
One way for the Democrats to continue to rake in millions from big business is to continue spending billions to subsidize business , while providing the political cover for cutting back on spending that would benefit ordinary people .
Given that Obama is likely to have a Democratic Congress with strong majorities , he should be able to get a program passed that ’s not too much different from his own proposals .
So if that program ends up making unpopular cuts to sustain Wall Street bailouts or the Pentagon , he should n’t be allowed to use the excuse that he had to tilt right to win bipartisan support .
Nor should the Democrats be allowed to get away playing both sides of the fence — bashing the GOP for the free - market policies and wars that have produced the current disasters , while providing critical support for both of these failures .
Lost in the standard partisan posturing that takes place in each election year is the fact that the Democrats are complicit in virtually all of the disasters that Obama is hanging around the Republicans ’ necks .
There was no more zealous supporter of deregulation , free trade , privatizing government and welfare reform than the Democratic administration of Bill Clinton .
Obama ’s economic advisers come from the Clinton wing of the Democratic Party .
And hearing Obama ’s consistent rhetoric about “ taking out ” Osama bin Laden , keeping “ all options on the table ” regarding Iran , and stepping up the war in Afghanistan , it was sometimes hard to tell who was the neoconservative in the election — McCain or Obama .
And as the Democratic Congress ’s capitulation to Bush on almost all aspects of the war in Iraq has shown , a Democratic administration will want to prove itself as a responsible trustee of U.S. imperialism .
Despite all of this , millions of Americans will have voted for Obama and Democratic candidates hoping that they will act on the issues that concern the majority : ending the war in Iraq , fixing the housing mess , providing economic relief to ordinary Americans devastated by the crisis , and providing universal health care .
If the mainstream political system began to raise these “ liberal ” issues , people ’s expectations that something could be done about them would be raised .
And just breaking the stifling conservative orthodoxy of the last generation would make liberalism a more viable ideological alternative for millions who want to see real social change .
But no one should expect that positive social change will come from Washington or from Obama without pressure for it .
Our challenge will be to organize working people to demand that the next administration reflect their priorities , rather than Wall Street ’s .

Solar - Powered Robot Will Guard Your Home , Fertilize Your Lawn
November 29th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
If you ’re not freaked out by the idea of a robot roaming around outside your house , you might be interested in Louisiana State University ’s AgBot .
The solar - powered multi-function robot can do everything from taking care of your garden to guarding your house at night .
AgBot has the impressive ability to both fertilize soil and plant seeds .
It even has a built - in GPS to map out the land and mark structures to ensure it does n’t bump into them .
The robot has an impressive built - in security system , too — it has a night - vision camera on top of a 360 degree swivel , a high - frequency alarm system , and an advanced motion detector .
If AgBot senses motion , it will take a picture of the intruder and e-mail you a photo .
AgBot is still very much a prototype —its battery only lasts for 4 hours , making it a weak security device .
But AgBot ’s programmers expect the robot to eventually use stronger motors that will lead to a longer life .
When the robot does go on sale , its price tag wo n’t be out of reach for most consumers .
The prototype was built for only $ 2,000 , so a commercial version can probably be produced on the cheap .

The Win32 client can be downloaded here .
It 's a source release , available for .NET 1.1 and 2.0 , so you 'll need to compile the solution before you can use it .
Once you have compiled it , create a new console application and add a reference to As it 's just really a very scalable hash table , memcached is very simple to code against .
There are only a few things you need to configure .
memcached requires a list of all the servers in the pool to connect to .
The hash function that memcached uses to choose which machine to store values on requires knowledge of all the machines in the pool to function correctly , so maintaining this list is a concern when using memcached in the pool .
For now , however , we 'll just use a single local server for simplicity , running with default port ( 11211 ) and cache size ( 64 Mb ) , running with the very verbose option - this will allow us to monitor the memcached process from the command line .
Now to write some code .
We are running a single server locally , so let 's let memcached know about it .
Our memcached client is now ready to use .
Let 's try and stick some values in the cache and get them back out again .
If we go back to ourwindow , something like the following should appear when the above is run :
Themethod returns a value of type .
This you can cast to whatever type you originally put in the cache .
However , if you want to store objects , then you must serialize them , either yourself , or with the built - in .NET serialization mechanisms .
If the memcached server is not found or an error occurs duringand , no exception will be thrown to the calling code .
Basically , if your cache servers encounter a problem , to your code it will just appear as if the cache is permanently empty .
Bad for performance , but good for uptime .
C# 3 and Linq 's syntax extensions allow us to write some funky shortcuts for things like caching systems .
We can cache the results of DLinq queries in memcached the same as any other data , as long as we make sure we have a serialization policy for the classes .
For example , the following code from a data access layer method to return all the users of a site will first check memcached for the data .
If it is not found , it will execute the query and store the results in memcached .
The code to manage the caching is written in the form of an extension method , so you can simply add a single call to your DAL methods to enable memcached caching of query results .
The above code ignores nasty things like serialization , but they are easily added in .
There is an effort to standardize an object serialization format for use in memcached ( very useful when you have clients from multiple platforms and languages accessing the same pools ) to JSON , but you are free to choose the serialization mechanism .
I would recommend against XML however , due to the excessive redundancy and large documents produced in the language .
Using memcached with multiple servers in the pool is almost as easy as using with a single one .
Just supply theclass with the list of all the servers you wish to pool together .
Note , thatyour clients must be aware of the same set of servers , otherwise the hashing function to find data on servers will not work consistently between clients , which will adversely affect your hit ratio .

The browser itself supports plug-ins , but from what I can tell it does n't support just any Firefox extension , which is unfortunate .
Despite the indisputably cool feature set ( namely the whole three - browsers - in - one hook ) , Lunascape is a little unwieldy and very cluttered .

Hi All : Thank you Brad for all your hard work .
If your 6000 pages of info are not enough people can check out www.scoop.co.nz and look up usacoup got even more info .
We need to think about a national election with national standards .
three races only on the ballot .
President , Senate , and House races only .
The federal government pays for the cost of the election , AND requires a standard format with standard rules for a National election .
No other issues or races can be placed on the national ballot .
Of course a paper trail will be required , along with a national standard for who can vote .
With only 3 races on the ballot at one time counting by hand will be simple .
With a standard ballot format we can transform vote counting .
It goes without saying that there will be random review of ward vote counts .
Every factory I have ever worked at check a sample of their produced product to see if the machines are functioning the way they were programed .

We need to think about a national election with national standards .
three races only on the ballot .
President , Senate , and House races only .
Exactly what we do n't want .
States like Maryland have set state races for odd numbered years .
Turnout has been consistently low .
Counties & municipalities , like those in Maryland & Kansas , now have their elections on the first Tuesday in APRIL .
Turnout is near zero .
Why is this important ?
Election to municipal office is the stepping - stone to state & federal office .
In many states , that initial first step is now a contest between my friends & his friends , as no one else knows there 's an election going on .
Turnout of 10 % or less is typical .
Invariably the next day the local papers berate people for not voting , but , aside from friends & family of the candidates , who knew there was an election ?
Who thinks of the first Tuesday in April as an election day ?
Brad 's focus on secure elections is only part of the story .
I could tell you how city buses came to Santa Fe , NM , in a " special election " with such low turnout that the city fathers have been able to ignore the will of the voters , steal the money for other purposes , and run shabby buses as a result .
One of counselors was open about it :
Since he got more votes than the buses did , he felt entitled to take " excess " money from the buses & spend it elsewhere .
On his own private projects .
Voter manipulation is not just about events on polling day .

Very good posting Brad .....
Here is a recipe for accurate , anonymous and secure elections simply done , which should be our most desirable goal :
It starts with unassailable citizen voting rights .
Provide wide access to good accurate candidate information .
Use only uniform and easy to understand ballots .
Have a way to track individual ballots while maintaining voter privacy .
Provide easily accessible polling places , or another method of easily done but secure voting .
Voting should be open more than one day but less than one week and include a weekend .... or Voting Day should be a holiday .
Complete transparency and verifiability of the ballot vote counting process .
This includes taking control of the voting oversight process away from partizan party control and give it to a committee made of representatives from all parties and non-partizan watchdog groups .
( No more individual Secretary of State party chairs overseeing elections . )
Like Minnesota ... pass laws that require an automatic recount when the vote difference between the top two is 0.5 % .... but , unlike Minnesota , make it an unstoppable process .
( Franken can stop the count . )
For verifiability .... all paper ballots are to be secured and kept for a 5 +/- year period before recycling .... but also available for review by the public .
A Federal election deserves Federal oversight ... but we can't have the fox guarding the henhouse ... so how about a quasi - independent Federal Election Commission ... oops .. problem is the current one is n't all that independent .
This one will need a lot of discussion .
There are many issues within what I 've suggested ( like what citizens do not get a vote ) but this is a start .

Without PRE - election security with members of all parties having advocates , over seers etc right there recording and watching everything that is going on then NOTHING you listed really means a damn thing as all of it could have been manipulated .
I think it is pretty clear that Democrats lost 5 - 6 Rep seats and 1 Senate seat in Alaska alone ( due to fraud ) I also bet that Obama would have won the popular vote by more than 10 - 12 Million .
We will never know what the REAL election results are no matter what you do .
What we need to do NOW is to make sure that the NEXT election is held on HAND COUNTED PAPER BALLOTS with advocates from all parties present at all precincts .

Seems to me that lower Alaska turn - out is probably due to their being in a time - zone 4 hours before eastern time .
I know I had n't even left New Hampshire yet to drive home at about 8:30 eastern time , when NH has called for Obama .
Then it was n't so long after that that PA was called for Obama , and there was all that talk about " no realistic path to victory " for McCain .
I know the machines can and have messed with the vote before in Alaska , but maybe people like first - time voters figured they did n't really need to go to the polls to do it for Obama after all , since was already going to win .
Seems like someone might have kept some kind of how much voting went on in the last hour in Alaska or something like that .
It might have actually helped get out the vote if there was some question on the ballot , like in California with the controversial proposition 8 defining marriage so as to exclude same - sex marriages .

Here 's an idea .
Since we all know that democrats NEVER manipulate the voting system and ALL voter fraud and ALL voter suppression is from the those rascally Republicans , let 's just do this : Unless a Rubulican wins by more than 30 % of the vote the Republican should just concede , is that enough of a margin that you wo n't complain ?
It really does n't matter what type of ballots are used , the complaints will be there regardless .
It 's is just amazing to me that any time a Democrat wins , the Republican concedes and we move on .
BUT if an election is even relatively close , all the Democrats do is cry , whine , contest the election and even if it still turns out the Republican won you still whine that they stole the election .

Dear Brad , I was wondering as I read your latest post and comments from your readers ....
Since paper ballots are really the only way to ensure ( as much as possible ) the integrity of the vote and its count , why can't ordinary citizens ( or registered voters ) each donate a ream or two of paper ( special if required ) to their election headquarters on which the ballots for each election could be printed .
Or they could make a modest donation toward paying for the paper and ink used .
It would be great if after the votes are counted and the ballots held for the appropriate time designated by law , the paper ballots could be recycled for the next election and ballot printing .
One of the arguments that I hear frequently is about the cost of printing the ballots as an excuse to not use them .
This would , I would think , eliminate one of the excuses for not using them .
If each state would do this , I would think every state could easily transition back to the use of paper ballots only .
It is OUR ELECTION for OUR CHOSEN CANDIDATES .
We should play an important role in the responsibility of ensuring its process and validity .
In addition , an equal number of volunteers , from every political party represented in each state could be selected , through a random drawing of those individuals who indicate an interest and ability , could serve as counters after the voting booths close , with appropriate supervision / over - site by legal representatives from each political party .
Maybe this sounds simplistic or naive , but it appears that it might be a simple solution to a complex problem .
Often times simple and direct is the most effective way to addressing / solving challenges .
Thanks for all your hard work and effort !!
If I were independently wealthy I would donate a million dollars to your work .
Unfortunately , like many American and world citizens , I worry where my next meal is coming from , how I am going to be able to pay for fuel for my home and auto , money to pay for Dr's visits and prescriptions , etc. , etc. , etc .
But I did want you to know you are appreciated !!!
Soooo .....

It 's a sad comment on our whole electoral system that such eminently reasonable and obvious suggestions have to be made .
They should be the law of the land everywhere .
No system is foolproof but optical scanning seems best ; it has real paper ballots that are counted electronically .
The suggestions that there be a complete accounting of ballots printed , ballots spoiled , ballots completely filled out and ballots partially filled out and that these numbers be consistent with the number of voters who actually showed up are the only way to check on the system .
These results should be posted outside each polling place .
This is NOT a partisan issue , but it has been the case in the last 8 years , with the Republicans in power nationally and in particular swing states - Florida in 2000 and 2004 and Ohio in 2004 - that suspicion has fallen on them .

So that you all know --- the 2009 direction of Black Box Voting , after much thought as to the single focus most likely to generate meaningful , citizen - friendly change ( among the many really important reforms needed ) : Compliance .
Compliance in freedom of information , consequences for hiding information from the public , and compliance with their own existing checks and
balances .
This is the broad stroke .
I welcome input on specific ideas to enforce compliance and remove the hiding of documents and observation from the public .
If they actually stop hiding information and start complying with all existing
checks and balances , then each additional reform will have 10 times the power .
I 'd like to start with retention requirements and to require prompt publication on the Web of one copy of every report the system is capable of providing .
The audit logs , the poll
tapes .
They can all go online .
( Part of the Democrat - led push for absentee voting and central count procedures has functioned to eliminated the critical check and balance of the voting machine results tape , which is necessary to block both central tabulator adjustments and man in the middle attacks like they 're talking about with Mike Connell . )
There is a special type of scanner that scans poll tapes , no matter how long they are .
Of course , the establishment types are already rushing in the more politically safe reforms , like increased early voting and new techno - gadgets .
But meaningful ?
If we could just get compliance and prohibit the hiding of information .
This is not to say I endorse any of the machines .
But think how silly this is :
They all produce a lot of informative reports , BUT NO ONE USES THEM AND THEY ARE HIDDEN FROM THE PUBLIC .
Officials point to the checks and balances as the reason computerized voting is safe , BUT THEY DON'T IMPLEMENT THE CHECKS AND BALANCES , DON'T FOLLOW THEM , AND HIDE THEIR NONCOMPLIANCE FROM THE PUBLIC .
As a quick , simple focus , we need to FIRST address compliance and the hiding of information and observation from the public .
Once that 's addressed every reform made will have 10 times the power .
And it will cost nothing and take almost no time to simply print an electronic copy of every report already in the system and post it on the Web .
For the remainder of 2008 we 're working on the many anomalies in the recent election , so consider the next several weeks a comment period for how you would like to see compliance and consequences for hiding stuff addressed .

See the damage done by the McCain / Palin lies - # 41 .
This kind of media - supported brainwashing should imo be illegal .
The media pundits / " journalists " continue to shrug it off as " just politics . "
What they 're doing is unconscionable .
McCain should come forward , admit it and apologize for the damage he & Palin have done .
McCain & Palin eventually crossed the line & came very , very close to inciting a riot .
In fact ... it remains to be seen how deeply they have disturbed their " base " ... with baldfaced lies .
Bring back the Fairness Doctrine .

Kucinich also has been fighting to bring back the fairness doctrine for many years .
He is the ONLY " STATESMAN " left in congress .
There is no excuse to not have hand counted paper ballots .

the diebold machines use a tandy chip which is bootloaded from outside --- a vote flipping virus is also loaded at this time .
other diebolds networked together recieve the same virus .
when power is turned off --- the virus disappears .
restoring power and rebooting restores the virus .
the source code remains opaque at all times .
at any time during use --- the vote flipping virus can be activated by a ' voter ' in real time --- in the actual voting booth --- by punching in a correct sequence of buttons which are handily available on the display screen .
the ' voter ' leaves the booth and --- eureka !
instant winning tally for candidate of choice --- and by a predetermined margin of percentage .
this means that one could flip all the machines or just strategically selected ones .
perhaps its worth mentioning the buzz about inaccuracies in exit poll results --- that all the pros now claim to be unreliable is very recent --- in fact they started just 8 years ago --- during the 2000 presidential elections .
seems they were just fine demographic tools prior to then .
diebold restructured in 2006 becoming ES&S --- SO do n't niavely presume they went away .

The population of the U.S. is about 10 times that of Canada .
However , the number of voters per polling station should be ( or could be ) about the same .
In Canada , the vote is taken on paper ballots and the ballots are counted by hand as soon as the polls close .
It usually takes an hour or two .
Is that too simplistic ?

Why not require that as many of these documents as possible simply be posted on the web ?
Any public information that is on hard copy should be scanned and posted , and electronic documents can be posted directly .
Gov agencies routinely post volumes of scientific data and records online .
Seems like this would be far less costly both to the government and to private parties than separate FOIA - type requests , individually tailored .
Of course you would have to exclude anything that reveals the identity of a voter such as poll registers .
...
For that matter , why not post online every ballot cast ?
So long as they are anonymous , what 's the problem ?
... Let there be sunlight .

Jack / 45 says exit poles worked good before 2000 election //////votefraud.org talks about the voters news service - - owned by the big 3 networks and AP -- as running and manipulating exit poles , at least in the 1990 's -- I guess before most of todays vote fraud researchers were aware of the issue .
Right on , Shredder # 47 -- Its the only way to solve the problem - - live net video feed on every machine !!!

I am a volunteer observer for the Franken campaign in the Minnesota senate recount and I also worked in Ohio in the central Kerry HQ in 04 .
I am certain that I witnessed vote fraud resulting in the illegitimate Bush win in 04 .
I have tried to tell media sources that the biggest problem in Ohio was the computer tabulation and that this concern trumps all others such as reports of voter suppression and incidents of individual machine failures which have effectively just caused distraction .
GEMS is in use in Minnesota and I have no doubt that it has resulted in errors .
You seem to have a great understanding of the
issues around this .
Can you advise me how to
provide useful information to the Franken people
in order to help us promote an accurate recount and overcome the black box Diebold problems ?
Practically speaking at the point ( 11/15/08 ) ,
what can we do to overcome the hurtles in place from Diebold ?
After this recount and the other two remaining unresolved senate races are completed , what advice do you have for crafting effective talking points to the media to get Diebold removed and investigated ?
Thanks

Harmonix is giving you twenty extra downloadable add - on tracks for Rock Band 2 for free , pushing the sequel 's soundtrack well over 100 songs .
Not too shabby .
We hope you 've already registered for your downloads , should you have the Xbox 360 or PS3 version in hand .
The tracks , which go live November 4th , are more " up and coming " than they are " I just came " and do not , we repeat , do not feature Stan Bush 's " The Touch . "
Of the twenty , I think I 've heard of two — Between the Buried and Me and Dealership .
But I do n't get out much .
The tracks , which we 'll unofficially refer to as the Harmonix Gift Horse Track Pack , are : • The 88 - " Sons and Daughters " • Authority Zero - " No Regrets " • Between the Buried and Me - " Prequel To The Sequel " • The Cab - " Bounce " • The Chevelles - " Get It On " • The Cocktail Slippers - " Give It To Me " • Dealership - " Database Corrupted " • Endeverafter - " I Wanna Be Your Man " • The Ghost Hounds - " Ashes To Fire " • Hollywood Undead - " Young " • Kutless - " The Feeling " • The Len Price 3 - " If I Ain't Got You " • Lesley Roy - " I'm Gone , I'm Going " • Opiate for the Masses - " Burn You Down " • Semi-Precious Weapons - " Magnetic Baby " • Shaimus - " Like a Fool " • Thenewno2 " - Crazy Tuesday " • Tickle Me Pink - " The Time Is Wrong " • Underoath - " Desperate Times , Desperate Measures " • X Japan - " I.V .

Nobody on its right mind would dare to defend DRM ( Digital rights management ) in front of a web crowd , unless you represent one of the few enterprises pushing it forward , of course .
It ’s a simple fact of life , the consumer has never been pro-DRM , and for the right reasons .
But among the different types of restrictions and scenarios of how DRM is being used today , two specific cases come to mind as examples of poor implementations or just DRM gone awry for the consumer side .
Only this year , three major online music stores ( MSN , Yahoo , Walmart ) announced they would be taking their DRM servers offline , rendering consumer ’s music purchases useless to play on new computers .
Eventually these companies backed down and extended their deadlines by a few years , but in some of the cases it ’s only a matter of time .
On the gaming side , the DRM flop of the year has to be Spore .
After much anticipation prior to its release , the game got smashed everywhere online because of the copy prevention software that came built into the game .
Just yesterday it was also announced that another hit title , Far Cry 2 will be using the same SecuROM DRM software , though restrictions are expected to be less severe .
Yet , for many these imposed restrictions are enough for not spending any money in online music or games .
Is this your case ?
Have you had good / bad experiences with DRM restrictions as outlined above ?
How could developers and the music industry create a safer environment to generate sales without punishing the paying consumer ?

The USDollar rally in the last several weeks has been remarkable .
At closer examination , it highly resembles a spurt prior to death .
Imagine an old man who just had a heart attack , lost feeling in certain body parts , his mind not working right , plenty of nonsense gibberish coming from his mouth , and now he is dancing hard on some last gasps .
The vast liquidation movement is akin to the old man going through an embalming process while dancing atop the tables at the funeral parlor , as bidding proceeds for his cadaver .
Are Americans last to realize the financial structure destruction means the USEconomy does not enter a recession , but rather a bizarre unprecedented disintegration ?
It seems so .
The liquidation of speculative positions , the massive de-leveraging , the payouts of defaulted bonds , these events are the opposite of developments toward revival or resuscitation , like business investment !!
Liquidation is the exact opposite of investment , and precedes job cuts , not job creation .
The following survey of important issues is covered in depth in the October Hat Trick Letter .
This month , an additional Crisis Coverage report was included , since too much has been happening , most of it confusing .
Plenty of stories are occurring behind the stories , many covered .
Here is a quick survey touching the surface on issues discussed and analyzed more in depth for subscribers .
FACTORS BEHIND USDOLLAR RALLY
What is pushing the USDollar up cannot be construed as anything remotely resembling healthy factors .
In no way whatsoever does it resemble investment .
It is more like paid off death contracts , paid off death investments , paid off transfers from toxic US bonds into what are falsely regarded as safer US bonds with a guarantee from a crippled USGovt .
Foreign financial entities are liquidating on massive scale .
They need a tremendous amount of USDollars in order to complete transactions .
Also , a tremendous amount of USDollars are needed for CDSwap payouts as defaulted bonds are resolved .
Almost all CDSwap and other credit derivatives are paid out in USDollars .
The Lehman Brothers payout was full of lies , again .
The Lehman Brothers total volume of corporate bonds was $ 160 billion , but $ 400 billion existed in total CDS volume tied to them !
It is no surprise that the Dow and S&P500 stock indexes fell hard ( by almost 400 points on Dow ) and on the Lehman resolution day .
And market mavens boasted of no impact on the Lehman funeral date !
The DTCC ( Depository Trust & Clearing Corp ) reported only a net $ 5.2 billion payout on the Lehman Brothers failure CDSwap resolution .
The � Dis - Trust Clearing Corp� might want to check credit derivative experts who claim between $ 220 billion and $ 270 billion in that total after netting .
By the way , the DTCC is the official banking entity that oversees all stock clearing overnight , including all the naked shorting .
The de-leveraging process has left the central bankers empty handed , exposed as having empty financial cupboards .
Thus the need for massive central bank swaps from the USFed , which has perversely farmed out its function to foreigners .
In fact , the foreign central banks might be in possession of more US $ inventory items than the USFed .
So the US central bank has asked foreign central banks to do its job , and to manage the world reserve currency ?
This amidst a US $ rally !?!
The Credit Default Swaps are capable of burning Hiroshima holes all over the US financial system , resulting in USEconomic implosion from eliminated bank and financial system structures almost entirely .
The process has only begun , but in darkness .
The other purpose for big bailouts was to prevent CDSwap explosions , risking a string of bombs to go off .
The key aspect of CDSwap contracts is their hidden nature , with fuses intersecting in the dark .
When the market mavens talk about the de-leverage process , they refer to speculative investments being liquidated .
Oftentimes , they do not include in the story how Wall Street firms , desperate to stave off bankruptcy , are targeting viciously their own clients .
The big accounts lie in hedge funds , where the private wealthy are being decimated .
Credit is being pulled .
Margin calls are being delivered .
Margin ratios are being raised .
Those funds whose positions are aligned with the predators on Wall Street continue in their investment portfolios .
Those funds in opposition are attacked with artillery , carpet bombs , and early morning raids .
The USDollar is rallying amidst this type of sinister liquidation .
The result has been numerous spread trades anchored by the USTreasury Bond are forced into sale .
That means a USTBond buyback occurs from the short cover on the trade .
Whether a spread on mortgage bonds , corporate bonds , emerging market bonds , or crude oil , or gold , the trade is liquidated , and a USTBond is bought back .
NO TANGIBLE END DEMAND , ONLY USTREASRY BOND SHORT COVERS .
This is the basis for a US $ rally ?
WORSENING US$ FUNDAMENTALS
How many times have we seen the US stock market go down , non-government bond yields rise , the USDollar rise , and the USTBond yields fall ?
That has been the norm in the last few weeks .
These are death signals , not investment signals .
The USEconomy cannot afford liquidation and constricted credit , a well - known fact , seemingly forgotten today .
These signals come amidst falling confidence , more bank distress measures , more job loss , more home foreclosures , and lately , trouble with letters of credit at port facilities .
Financial markets , including the USDollar , have yet to factor in the deep USEconomic recession .
The USDollar rally flies in the face of deteriorating fundamentals .
See job cut announcements at Caterpillar , Merrill Lynch , General Motors , Chrysler , several Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs today .
Weekly jobless claims at close to half a million per week , equal to peak during the unrecognized 2001 recession .
See the UMichigan consumer sentiment , Philly Fed index , Empire Fed index , leading economic indicators , durable goods orders , on and on .
Retail sales , the backbone of the backwards USEconomy , are plummeting .
That is , the plummet is before inflation price adjustments .
Car sales are plummeting also .
Exports are to be worse from the higher US $ exchange rate on the table , combined with slower foreign economies .
The improved export trade has been a big boast from the lunatics running the asylum .
The USEconomy is accelerating in its decline , certain to produce a recession and huge USGovt deficits .
That deficit is likely to at least double and possible quadruple next year .
USTreasury
Bond issuance cannot conceivably finance all , or at least half , of the commitments .
The printing press will do the rest , which will cut down the US$ valuation .
The USDollar decline lies ahead , when the distortions slow or come to an end .
Gold will soar on the other side of this liquidation .
An extreme backlash attack is coming against the USDollar .
Rising import prices in foreign economies have already caused alarm .
Foreigners will soon attack the US $ in a matter of time , using heavy US $ - based reserves .
Their banking sectors are in disarray , primarily because they are intimately tied to the US $ and USTBonds .
The process has begun with Brazil and Mexico in Latin America , to use their strong reserves and sell into this queer US $ strength .
That is what reserves are for .
The process will spread to other nations .
GOLD MARKET CLOSE TO BREAKING
The gap between the physical gold market and paper gold market is widening .
An example bears this out .
In Toronto this week , a major off - market gold transaction took place .
The price paid was $ 1075 per ounce on the physical transaction .
Its volume was in the multi-million$ .
There was no US involvement in the transaction , and the settlement was in euros .
Enormous repositioning is ongoing by the groups that will participate in the new , partially gold - backed currency .
My take is this movement is from a large financial entity with global activity , and ties to central banks .
It might be tied to the upcoming split in the euro , into a Nordic Euro and trashed Latin Euro .
The Nordic version might contain a gold component .
This and other transactions are taking place with European settlement .
They are being satisfied in the alternative market , far from the distortions of COMEX .
This was a physical transaction with the real metal being moved .
Big shifts occur behind the scenes .
A couple of months ago , 400 metric tonnes were moved into storage with the Royal Canadian Mint by a sovereign entity .
The more massive the paper manipulation , the more violent the coming correction .
The asylum managers are losing control of their paper - physical arbitrage .
Watch the gold lease rates , and silver lease rates , which have each more than tripled in the last two months .
Lease rates precede price movement .
Bullion bankers , including central banks , are reluctant to lease their physical supply .
This time is no different , an event to come after the COMEX criminality is swept aside , or simply overwhelmed in return .
One well - informed source , with over two decades of gold market experience , actually expects arrests to take place among COMEX officials before long .
John Embry of Sprott Asset Mgmt has raised the possibility of a December gold futures contract default .
He is not predicting it , or claiming it as certain , but rather mentions how talk centers on the December gold contract as having extreme stress for actual delivery .
Pressure is building .
The December contract not only is end of quarter , but end of year .
He suggests a possible default .
He said , � there is probably going to be such an event to change perceptions .�
He cited a possible force majeure that could act as a �seminal event that defines the whole situation .�
He explained that the physical gold price would then dictate the paper gold price , a return to normalcy , and with a gigantic move up in the gold price .
Right now the paper gold market is overwhelming the physical side , but the physical side is constricted on supply .
He explained that hedge funds are being unwound on a massive scale , slaughtered by margin calls .
The long side must call for delivery on many contracts .
He also expects there will be many questions on the Exchange Traded Funds soon as well , although those are surely not as important as the COMEX contract defaults .
Watch and listen to his interview on the Canadian Business News Network ( CLICK HERE ) , and be sure to move to the 10 to 11 minute mark .
NEW BRETTON WOODS II FARCE Last weekend in Brussels , G8 Finance Ministers met .
Among other things , they discussed a reform to the global banking structures .
For the many challenged on geography , that city is in Belgium , headquarters for many European Union functions , in Western Europe .
Creditors were not present , which means the finance ministers were talking to themselves .
Credit masters were not invited .
The nations whose banking systems are in the process of implosion are essentially attempting to revise the global currency system .
Those in attendance constitute the losers !
However , the Arabs and Chinese were not present .
This seems entirely backwards .
The bankrupt nations do not dictate to the creditors terms of a revised agreement .
Imagine a large business saying the following .
� We are bankrupt .
We want a meeting .
We are going to dictate to you bankers anyway .
We are broke .
Our economies are shattered .
Our banking systems are in ruins .
But we going to tell you how we are to restructure our debt and rework a new system .
We realize our debts to you are bigger than we can ever repay .
We realize we cannot continue in commerce without your continued extended credit .
But we will force upon you a new system .
It does not matter what your opinion is .
You do not have a seat on this elite committee , sorry ! �
THIS FLOW IS NOT FROM THE WORLD OF REALITY !
No !
Bankruptcy receivership is next , where creditors will be left with few options .
They will be compelled to run management committees , and dissolve many functions of government .
Creditors will probably await the G8 initiative , then summarily reject it .
They will next propose their own new global financial structure .
The teenager�s credit card is about to be taken away , when the irresponsible kid proposes a new repayment system , new promises , new chores done even .
The kid has burned down half the neighborhood , yet thinks he can call the shots !
Sadly , the parents will probably ground him and force a tutor to direct his studies , and force a strict drill sergeant to direct his work activities .
His friends will not be permitted to form new teams that include him .
A �Post - US World� is being planned , and Americans are the last to know .
Entire new barter systems between a key pair of nations is about to be launched .
Regional bond and commodity organizations are being formed , with exclusion of the US .
The US press reports nothing on these important developments .
Foreign creditors will form new committees , which will be recognized in time as the Receivership Committee .
Foreigners are watching in horror .
Decisions have already been made , with Americans the last to know .
In order to arrest the cancer they so clearly see , they are ready to force a complete upheaval .
The USDollar will lose its global currency status , a thoroughly abused privilege .
The above lack of disclosure only reinforces their motive to take action .
They will move when they must , upon a system failure , or when they are challenged , or when flimsy attempts by debtors are made to dictate reform .
Without any changes forthcoming soon , the foreign banking systems and economies face huge threats to failure .
To friends , family , and contacts , my approach has been to attempt to explain the underlying forces behind revolutionary financial change .
Foreigners must cut off a cancerous body part , the one attached to the United States .
Foreigners must cut off flow from a toxic systemic organ , the one attached to the United States .
CUT IT OFF OR RISK DEATH .
They must disconnect of USDollar from the global currency system attached intimately to their own financial and economic systems .
They must to survive .
ARAB GOALS & MOTIVES Arabs clearly lust to control and manage a global gold trading center .
It will be in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates .
The new Gulf dinar currency will pave the road to that center .
The Gulf Coop Council is biding time , cutting time delay deals , warding off pressure by the USGovt , appeasing with weapons contracts from the USMilitary , and is working behind the scenes to create a new dinar currency .
The new Gulf dinar is likely to be primarily gold in its backing .
So , foreign nations will soon be forced to purchase the dinar for all or most of crude oil payments .
This forces the purchase of gold in order to purchase crude oil .
The demand for gold will thus fortify the global banking system , by means of commodity settlements .
Many details are unknown , but the basic structure has been slowly come to light .
A new motive flashes red in front of Arabs to institute some changes FAST .
The crude oil price is down , cut in half from July .
Their revenues are sharply reduced .
Russia figures into the complex deal to launch the dinar .
The Saudis and small sheikdoms need security protection .
The next chapter will involve protection amidst a gold - backed currency , not a military - backed currency , in Saudi eyes .
ISOLATED USTREASURYS
The other side to the Arab dilemma is that the USTreasury Bond demand is quickly eroding from Petro - dollar recycle on trade surplus .
The USGovt finds itself as relying far too much on foreign central banks for demand of USTBonds , relying far too much soon on the printing press .
The USTBond demand is missing the oil surplus in recycle .
Their reduced and unstable oil revenue motivates the Arabs to install a new payment system , based upon an end to the ugly defacto Petro - dollar standard .
It shamefully is the basis of what my analysis has called a Protection Racket .
The incredible fact evident in the data is that until mid-September , the US Federal Reserve has drained liquidity from the US private banking system in order to offset its colossal bond swap bailouts for major Wall Street and New York money center banks .
Their objective was to avoid undue US $ money supply growth .
THEY WERE TARGETING GOLD .
They essentially drained the lifeblood from the USEconomy on Main Street in order to subsidize fraud sanctioned and approved on Wall Street .
Only since mid-September has the USFed been monetizing USTBond debt issuance .
They are running scared , printing with abandon .
The gold price is falling as the USDollar printing press is rapidly heating up , no longer offset by bank system drains .
Details are in the Hat Trick Letter report .
DESERVED DISRESPECT
TO GREENSPAN
Can you believe what is happening before a Congressional banking committee ?
Greenspan is being grilled , as his past errors are vividly pointed out .
His past memos are being read back to him .
His wrong premises are being questioned as having being totally discredited .
His opposition to credit derivative disclosure is being challenged .
His opposition to Fannie Mae reform is being challenged .
He has been brought to task for his steadfast opposition for reform in the past during his tenure as USFed Chairman .
He is being interrupted by lowly Congressional reps .
His time to speak is being cut , in defense of others to be grilled .
HE IS BEING SHOWN THE DISRESPECT DESERVED OF ANY FAILED PUBLIC OFFICIAL .
Maybe they will demand to know who paid his second paycheck from Switzerland , and what his agenda was !
Not likely !
My view is that Greenspan was a primary key person used to take down the US banking system , to pave the way for a bigger agenda .
These are intelligent people who knew what they were doing , who were the cheerleaders , even the Mythology High Priest .
Greenspan admitted a grand flaw in his free market ideology .
He admitted being shocked that financial markets did not self - regulate .
Hey Alan !
They never self - regulate amidst a Fascist Business Model , since regulators and law enforcement is compromised as much as humanly or institutionally possible !
He admitted a failure in the global financial market structure as he perceived it , a stunning admission .
He acknowledged the USEconomy is faltering badly .
He sees the rise in job layoffs and unemployment .
He sees the retrenchment in consumer spending .
He sees the price declines in housing without abatement .
He forecasted a worsening recession .
His biggest admission is this .
He admits to a flaw in the structural model perceived in the critically function for global banking .
Wow !
THAT IS A BIG ADMISSION , NOT PROPERLY PERCEIVING THE GLOBAL BANK STRUCTURE .
He admits to how his risk pricing model did not take into account periods of financial stress .
Hey Alan !
Is that not what they are designed for ?
He used to boast for a full decade how offloaded risk via credit derivatives was a sign of sophistication , which enabled economic expansion .
Instead , my view is that risk offload devices contributed toward an expansion atop a bubble , which when burst , killed the entire US banking system and then the USEconomy .
He used to boast that credit derivatives shared the risk , but in fact it resulted in destruction on a widespread systemic basis .
Recall the many claims made by Bernanke , that the subprime mortgage bond bust would be contained .
The former Princeton Professor is not a good student of banking and economics !
Unlike me , he is greatly encumbered by the limitations of economics credentials !
Mathematics and statistics are pure science and its application as artistry .
NO SOLUTIONS FOR ECONOMY FROM BAILOUTS
Almost all US - based bailouts to date are to pay for dead financial firms .
Their shareholders and bond holders and asset base have been repaired but not restored .
To think this benefits the loan process is folly .
It facilitates retirement to the Caribbean for corrupt bank executives .
The flow of federal funds will not find its way to the people , or at least only pennies per dollar will .
The � Top - down Approach � is destined to fail because the corruption , bond fraud , accounting fraud , financial instrument shell game , and other assorted illicit procedures are the cause of the problem , and all lie at the top of the structure intended to trickle down !
To expect benefits downstream is lunacy .
In fact , the devices to assist and subsidize the criminal behavior at the top are vastly expanding with multiple branches .
No less than five special purpose vehicles created by JPMorgan Chase were announced on Wednesday .
The number of USFed lending facilities , all to big banks , none to people on Main Street , has exploded to such an extent that one needs a sportsbook guide to comprehend all the acronyms .
David Rosenberg of Merrill Lynch even coined the YAP , yet another program .
Proliferation might be what the architects of the Financial Coup d�Etat intended .
Confusion is the best friend of coup architects , just like truth is the first victim of war .
The people receive $ 1 for every $ 500 given to Wall Street elite in fraud redemption .
The rank & file population entered a � Revolving Door� of loan repayments that often do not reduce the loan balance , assured to end in foreclosure within a year or so .
The same nonsense of � Trickle Down� was prevailed when it has no past precedent of succeeding .
The lack of disclosure is a tragedy .
Congress demands no better disclosure , and receives none .
The Lehman Brothers resolution has been conducted in total darkness .
Evidence coming my way indicates that JPMorgan is using the dead Lehman carcass as a vast private arsenal to attack hedge funds .
Some such funds have most of their assets frozen , while their positions are attacked .
What is happening is criminal , a climax of this administration , which has been taken over by Wall Street .
A complaint has been made that Treasury Dept documents look like redacted CIA documents , hardly what is needed to instill confidence .
One official decree after another undermines investor confidence , the last being short rule restrictions on financial stocks , with an exemption given to Goldman Sachs .
This is a selective bailout of Wall Street , a process run by Wall Street , permitting financial crimes worthy of 1000 - page indictments .
DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS INTERUPTED
Big disruptive events are occurring in the distribution system .
Letters of credit are routinely being refused by export nations who distrust US sources .
A fall of 10 % to 20 % in shipping traffic to western US ports has been reported .
Ships are empty at Asian ports , some even loaded but interrupted on their voyage to US ports and European ports .
Many details are given in the October Hat Trick Letter reports .
Even manufacturers of shipping vessels are being severely affected , as credit has interrupted construction projects .
Indian suppliers are often demanding 100 % upfront on costs to east coast retailers , again showing the distrust .
Almost total attention has been given to banks and credit markets and stock markets .
The USEconomy is moving from recession toward something different from depression .
The current interruption could actually be more like disintegration .
Short - term credit is soon to interfere greatly with truckers and railways in distribution channels on the domestic side , much like letters of credit are wrecking havoc on the overseas shipper side .
The next big shoe to drop is credit cards .
Bank of America has announced plans , not yet fully implemented , to cut back on credit cards to lower FICO scorers .
The lower 60 % - ile of credit score recipients will find themselves without credit cards at all .
One friend told me that he used to own 10 credit cards .
Recently , all but four were simply discontinued , but a few were not used .
Other friends said most of their credit limits were slashed .
Changes are coming .
Then the next big shoe to drop will be commercial mortgage default .
No reprieve , rest , or respite for US bankers .
Changes are coming .
It will force defaults in most every conceivable financial corner .
DISHONOR AMONG BANKERS
The system is breaking down .
Just when the heart attack signals are actually improving , although only slightly , the USEconomy is falling off a cliff , as unprecedented decay is occurring .
Some improvement has been seen with the short - term LIBOR rate , the money market funding , TED spreads , and mortgage bond spreads .
But bankers and financial subsidiaries are in focus for dishonor .
The following message came yesterday to my desk .
It pertains to General Electric .
It involved dishonored Letters of Credit ( L/C ) .
The US banks not only distrust each other , they are engaging in criminal activity , like contract fraud .
If big enough , or connected well enough to the power center , it is permitted .
Again , no solutions , only proliferation of chaos .
� Try this one on .
One of our clients did a bond early last year ( underwritten by RBC / Dain Rauscher ) backed up by a General Electric Letter of Credit .
There is a tag end of $ 1 million .
The deal was the sale and lease back of 13 bank branches .
One remains .
The tenant is a regional bank .
RBC cannot remarket the bond now because the market is still frozen .
So the client , per the documents , called on the L/C for performance ( as allowed in the L/C , which extends to 2021 ) .
GE has reneged on the L/C and will not pay unless the two principals come up with $ 1 M in cash .
The client has said no way , the L/C has no such provision .
GE has said , too bad , if you don�t like it , talk to our attorney .
We �re not paying .�
Stories like this are probably surfacing all over the North American landscape .
US banks are defending themselves by dishonoring contracts .
COSTA RICA PREVIEW
If people inside the United States and Canada need to try an alternative location , options abound , but time is not plentiful .
One can get out of Dodge !
Try Costa Rica , where the operating attitude is PURA VIDA !
( pure life ! )
See the � Living Costa Rica� magazine website ( CLICK HERE ) , whose manager VictorF joined me recently for a nice dinner in San Jos� .
I am a cheap date , no alcohol , no coffee , no supersized body .
http://www.livingcr.com
Living Costa Rica is the number one magazine about Relocation , Real Estate , and Lifestyle in Costa Rica .
Its quarterly 5000 printed issues and online versions cover the entire country , in both coastal areas as well as the central valley where the capital San Jos� is located .
The magazine can be found in five star hotels , business centers , realtor offices , even gourmet restaurants .
Consider a trip to the greenest country ever my laid eyes have seen , whose land has the highest proportion of national reserves on the planet .
Gorgeous beaches , rich flowers and orchids , stunning trees , and more abound .
The central valley has no humidity , few if any flies or mosquitoes ( honestly ! ) , and cool breezes , not without a rainy season though .
My favorite trees are the emerald eucalyptus ( light green smooth bark easily shed ) and the fuego de monta�a ( fire of mountain , with fiery red blossoms at top of huge tree structures ) .
The national economy is almost self - sufficient in agriculture and electricity production .
Restaurants , clothes , and dental care come at 60 % to 70 % discounts .
Rents come at 30 % to 50 % discounts .
The nation contains the greatest diversity of ants , birds , and other creatures , like red frogs .
Eco-tours are common to visit tropical forests with their ziplines ( aerial clothes lines for movement ) , white water rapids ( like the famous Pacuare River enjoyed last November ) , volcanoes ( active and dormant ) , even butterfly sanctuaries .
Check it out .
The nation has no standing army , prefers love to war , and the police are friendly .
The national real estate market has little leverage with bonds and mortgages , which would put it at greater risk .
My apartment balcony includes a westward view , with rooftops , beautiful cloud structures , the northern foothills to the city , all lush and green .
The dawn is absolutely stunning here .
The air is fresh outside the main city .
Ten thousands of ex-pats in the greater metropolitan area and 30 thousand in the entire country cannot be wrong .

Title : Compiling the first F# program using interactive mode Author : Shivprasad Koirala Email : shiv_koirala@yahoo.com Language : ASP.NET Level : Beginner Description : F# Interview Questions
In this tutorial we will compile the first F# program using the interactive mode .
There are lot of talks going on regarding F# , just thought how about compiling the first program using interactive F# mode .
If you think you like the article or you think I should improve drop me a message on http://www.questpond.com which is my own private site .
I will surely improve on my writing .
Please note this tutorial has used F# compiler version 1.9.2.9 you can download the same from http://research.microsoft.com/research/downloads/details/52ba6040-6998-4de2-bfc6-f7a0f40c71e2/details.aspx
You can download latest F# compiler from http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/release.aspx .
You need to first install .NET 2.0 or greater and then F# .
Once you are done with the installation you should find F# in your program menu as shown in figure “ F# Interactive Console ” .
Figure : - F# Interactive console
That is all you need to learn F#... So let us start .
There are two types of execution mode in F# :-
• Full compilation to .NET code ( using fsc.exe which is found in “ C: \Program Files \ FSharp -1.9.2.9\bidn ” ) .
• Other is interactive mode ( using fsi.exe which is again found in the same directory “ C: \Program Files \ FSharp -1.9.2.9\bin ” ) .
So let ’s try to write our first program using the F# interactive .
For some time we will be using the F# interactive so that we can get hold of the concepts .
So click on Programs >> Microsoft Research F# >>
F # interactive console .
Once done you will see a screen as shown in figure “ F# Interactive Console ” .
The arrow in the figure shows the place where we will enter F# commands .
All F# commands end with a “ ; ; ” ( i.e. double semi-colon ) .
Figure : - F# Interactive console .
So let ’s type our first program .
Below figure shows a simple program which sets a string value and displays the same on the screen .
We have numbered the commands let ’s understand every command number by number .
Figure : - Your first program
1 and 2 – “ let ” keyword binds a identifier ( i.e. “ x ” in this case ) with value “ Shiv ” .
After you end the command with “ ; ; ” and press enter you will see “ Val x : string ” .
This is a information given by the F# compiler saying that I have declared your variable “ x ” as a string .
In short the compiler evaluates the type .
If you note in C# and VB.NET you need to define the variable data type .
Below figure “ Comparison ” shows how the “ let ” keyword maps to C#. “ let ” is a declaration keyword in F# .
Figure : - Comparison
3 and 4 – In this command we have asked the F# compiler about the variable “ x ” .
In line 4 we can see the answer of the compiler saying “ Val it : string = “ Shiv ” which means “ x ” is a string data type with value “ Shiv ” .
5 – Here we use the System .
Console .
WriteLine to display the data of the variable .
One of the things to be noted is that “ System ” is .NET namespace .
In one line we can say F# can use .NET functionalities in a seamless manner .
Figure : - F# and .NET
6 – We can see the F# compiler replying back with display “ shiv ” .
“ Let ” keyword in F# allows you to declare variables and methods .
Below figure “ Declaring variable ” shows how to declare a variable .
One of the important points to be
noted is that we do not need to define a data type .
F# depending on the value figures out
whether the declaration is a string or an integer .
For instance you can see when we gave
value “ 2 ” F# identified the data type integer while when we a gave a string value “ shiv ” it
identified the data type as string .
Figure : - Declaring Variable
Note : -
The syntaxes are bit different from what you do in normal programming .
So one of the important things in learning F# is thinking that it ’s a complete new language .
If you try linking the syntax styles with old C# and VB.NET we are sure you will be lost …
So clean your mind and think fresh .
Methods are also declared using the “ let ” keyword .
Below figure “ Comparing F# and C #
method declaration ” shows how F# methods are declared as compared to C# .
For instance we have declared method called as “ MyMethodIncrement ” which takes a
numeric value and increments it by one .
The method body follows after the method name
in F# .
There are no curly brackets like C# .
What ever variables we use in the F# method
becomes the input parameters for the method .
Figure : - Comparing F# and C# method declaration
Now let ’s run through the method and see how it works .
Figure “ Declaring method ” shows we have declared the method and called it .
Let understand the figure in the numbered fashion .
GOP VP candidate Sarah Palin is an ex marijuana consumer .
Mrs. Palin smoked her pot in Alaska , which her campaign points out was legal in Alaska at the time .
This is a curious defense as John McCain is an advocate for the federal arrest and prosecution of medical marijuana patients and providers who operate legally under California law .
Like any good politician Mrs. Palin she now claims she did n’t enjoy her marijuana , and that adults ( besides her ) should still be arrested , even though she was n’t .
“ ‘ I ca n’t claim a Bill Clinton and say that I never inhaled . ' ”
The paper quoted Palin as saying she opposed legalization of marijuana because of the “ message ” that would be sent to her children .
The arrest of 800,000 adults a year for cannabis does send a message - about the perpetual ignorance of government .
A better message for children is that one day they will be adults , and they will have adult decisions to make .
Mrs. Palin ’s marijuana stance seems to be typical political hypocrisy ; convenient and intellectually dishonest .
Today , Alaska still has the country ’s best marijuana laws .
According to NORML an adult can posses up to one ounce of pot at home , with no penalty .
Of course , the logic behind Alaska ’s policy ends there as possession of over 4 ounces is a felony offense .
If legal marijuana is good enough for the GOP Vice Presidential candidate , why not for all Americans ?
After all , where would John McCain be if Mrs. Palin had been arrested and put through the drug court deferred probation nonsense so many other defendants face ?
These are the threats as I see them :
ELECTION THEFT , carried out by the usual gutter tactics -- vote suppression , registration purges , deceptive absentee ballot mailings , vote caging , excessive voter challenges , and defective voting machines .
Greg Palast has spooked me severely in this regard .
Ohio is now in Democratic hands , and this will help tremendously , of course , but there are still Republican efforts at vote suppression in Michigan ( now under court challenge ) and Wisconsin ( through the state 's Republican attorney general . )
The Republicans still control the electoral process in Florida as well , although Charlie Crist seems like less of crook than Jeb Bush ( talk about damning with faint praise ! ) .
The Republicans in Missouri are particularly ruthless in dealing with St. Louis .
Are we ready ?
We seem more so than in 2004 , but I am convinced that hacking and electronic switching of votes are still very real possibilities .
Stephen Spoonamore may or may not have credibility , but his warnings deserve attention if only because the perpetrators of previous vote scams are still at large .
BradBlog also follows these issues obsessively .
Since the people running McCain 's campaign are all Rove Disciples , I have no doubt whatsoever that we face unprecedented challenges in this area .
Obama 's team is doing far better than Kerry 's did in confronting these issues , but we are not out of the woods by any means .
And voter intimidation issues in African - American and Hispanic precincts in the South and Southwest must be dealt with forcefully .
INCREASINGLY BRAZEN RACIAL APPEALS .
We 've already seen McCain 's " Scary Black Men Ripping Off the Old White Lady " commercial trying to tie Obama to corruption at Freddie Mac .
We also saw the " Sexually Perverted Black Man Who Wants to Teach Your Five Year Old About Sex " commercial , to me the most vile political ad I have ever seen in my 56 years .
There is NO reason to believe that this kind of vicious racial campaigning will not become more intense in SW Ohio , central Pennsylvania , Missouri , West Virginia , and in rural Virginia and North Carolina .
Remember , in 2004 the RNC circulated a flyer in Appalachia claiming that the Democrats wanted to ban the Bible .
There is no ugly appeal the GOP will not use .
THE KITCHEN SINK APPROACH , where the Republicans and Right Wing Hate Radio hurl every lying , obscene charge imaginable at Obama .
Expect Wright , Ayers , Farrakhan (!!)
Rezko , and every other discredited attack to be recycled on an endless loop .
Expect the lie about taxes to be driven home again and again ( and I LOVE how Obama attacked that lie in the first debate ) .
You think you 've heard these bastards lie about us so far ?
All of the slime that circulates in emails will be brought out into the open , more nakedly and aggressively than ever .
The GOP message ?
Obama is a dangerous covert Muslim who will sell America out to its enemies .
As the GOP grows more desperate , so will its attack propaganda .
VIOLENCE AND THREATS OF VIOLENCE .
There may be physical attacks on our canvassers , increased acts of vandalism , and attempts to physically intimidate voter registration drives .
Safety in numbers will be our friend in guarding against these attacks .
And the ultimate violent threat takes us into Tinfoil Hat / Nightmare territory -- an attempt to do violence to Obama himself .
A TERRORIST ATTACK in late October , conveniently timed to have the maximum impact on the electorate .
Would a desperate Bush - Cheney government permit such an attack ?
I know , tinfoil territory , but still possible .
THE CAPTURE OR KILLING OF BIN LADEN , also in late October , to allow the Republicans to trumpet their national security " superiority " .
Desperate people pull out all the stops .
The Bush - Cheney Administration is the most criminal , most corrupt , most vile in American history .
A McCain victory is their only hope of avoiding disaster .
McCain will bury their crimes ; Obama will expose them .
Brace yourself .
Our enemies are cornered .
That 's when they 're most dangerous .
" We already have computers out there that are making decisions that affect people 's lives but they do it in an ethically blind way .
Computers decide on credit card approvals without any human involvement and we 're seeing it in some situations regarding medical care for the elderly , " a reference to hospitals in the US that use computer programmes to help decide which patients should not be resuscitated if they fall unconscious .
That did n’t take very long .
Any more Republicans want to lecture us again on the juicy terms and all the money we ’re going to make from this deal ?
Who ever would have guessed that $ 123 billion was not going to be enough ?
I need to sit down I ’m so surprised .
The troubled insurance giant American International Group already has consumed three - quarters of a federal $ 123 billion rescue loan , a little more than a month after the government stepped in to save the company from bankruptcy .
AIG has borrowed $ 90.3 billion from the Federal Reserve ’s credit line as of yesterday , the bulk of it to pay off bad bets the company made in guaranteeing other firms ’ risky mortgage investments .
That ’s up from roughly $ 83 billion AIG had borrowed a week ago , and the $ 68 billion level it reached a week before that .
The news comes as the company ’s new chief executive warned Wednesday that the government ’s financial lifeline may not be enough to keep AIG afloat .
Brilliant film .
The original one that is .
But that was over 50 years ago .
1951 to be exact .
The story is still profound and poignant , maybe even more so in todays society .
I understand that most people would never watch a movie that is even just 30 years old .
A 50 - year - old one ?
Forget it !
Given that I can understand why someone would want to do a remake .
The studios are just interested in the big bucks of course , but maybe Scott Derrickson is actually interested in more than that .
How about introducing a whole new generation to the classics of Klaatu and Gort ?
Smacking them in the head with the idea of us humans being a pretty fucked up race .
That we do need to change .
Or we will pay for our mistakes sooner rather than later .
The new international trailer for the remake is online .
Have a look .
Vodpod videos no longer available .
This trailer makes it look more like a disaster film than a poignant story about the inadequacies and mistakes of mankind .
I am hoping the original premise and message of the film was n’t changed .
If this turns into a special fx fest and nothing else the filmmaker clearly did n’t hit the target .
Or maybe that was the target all along .
Despite what it looks like I will watch it and hope for the best .
Hardly ever is a remake better than the original .
Why do we need them ?
No Bonuses for Top Brass of Bailed Out Insurer Pressure from New York attorney general results in AIG bonus cancellation .
November 25 , 2008  --
Beleaguered insurance giant AIG has agreed to cancel bonuses for its seven top executives for 2008 and to freeze 2009 pay at current levels for the next tier of top executives -- about 60 in all , the firm 's CEO today promised in a letter to New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo .
Click here to read the letter .
" AIG is mindful that it must act prudently and , as such , must impose curbs on executive compensation , " CEO Edward Liddy wrote .
" To meet these objectives , AIG 's top seven executives ( Leadership Group ) will receive no annual bonuses for 2008 . "
Liddy reduced his own pay to $ 1.00 , according to a press release also issued by the company , and would receive no severance package should he leave the company .
" We believe AIG 's step is a positive step , " Cuomo said on a media conference call following the release of the letter .
" I enocurage other Wall Street firms to wake up to the new reality on Wall Street and follow AIG 's steps quickly . "
Liddy 's letter was in response to Cuomo 's strongly worded Nov. 18 letter to AIG in which he said , " AIG has already received more than $ 150 billion in rescue financing and therefore should be completely transparent with taxpayers as to what the company 's compensation plans are . "
The pressure on AIG is one component of a prescriptive anti-bonus crusade by Cuomo , in which has used the clout of the office as much as its legal mandate , in order to attempt to affect change in the ethics of the market place .
" AIG 's demise has seriously harmed investors all over the country , " Cuomo 's letter also stated .
" On top of that , taxpayers have now sunk billions into the company to keep it afloat .
It thus seems hard to imagine that AIG could pay significant bonuses .
Today he enouraged other firms to follow AIG 's actions to curb compensation .
" Lets have a race to the top , lets have a new era of corporate responsibility and accountability . "
" AIG is extremely grateful for the support it has received from American taxpayers , " Liddy said in his reply today .
" We recognize the obligation we have to use that support to help AIG recover , contribute to the economy and repay taxpayers . "
AIG Agrees to Freeze Top Executive Bonuses
In addition to cancelling bonuses for the top seven executives , Liddy said the firm would freeze 2009 pay at current levels for the firm 's 60 Senior Partners ( including those seven ) .
It would also restrict bonuses for those executives for both 2008 and 2009 .
The press release issued by AIG noted that the firm would develop " a funding structure to ensure that no taxpayer dollars are used for annual bonus or future cash performance awards for AIG 's " Senior Partners , " the top 60 members of management . "
That release and the letter certainly went some way to relieving tensions between the AG 's office and the firm , which has been perceived as recalcitrant in its response to multiple requests for financial information and restraint in corporate spending .
The first Cuomo letter to AIG was sent in mid-October when , despite the bailout , the firm continued to treat its senior executives to posh retreats , maintained a sky box with a half - million dollar view at Madison Square Garden , according to an exclusive report by ABCNews.com 's
The Blotter , and racked up hundreds of thousands of dollars in expenses that Cuomo said were " unwarranted and extravagant . "
Following that letter , the firm cancelled 160 corporate retreats , seminars and other events with prices as high as $ 750,000 per venue .
One past event was a partridge hunt that cost $ 90,000 .
AIG and the Attorney General issued a joint statement memorializing the agreement which also included the cancellation of a $ 10,000,000 compensation package to the firm 's chief financial officer .
Subsequently , the Attorney General sent AIG a second letter on Oct. 22 acknowledging that the firm agreed that it would make no bonus or deferred compensation disbursements from a fund of $ 600 million set aside for the executives of a financial subsidiary whose actions had contributed to the firm 's collapse .
" I find it hard to conceive of a situation where you could justify a performance bonus for management that virtually bankrupted the company , " Cuomo said in a conference call with reporters at the time .
List of Restrictions
Today AIG announced a number of additional restrictions on compensation .
Those included :
A funding structure to ensure that no taxpayer dollars are used for annual bonus or future cash performance awards for AIG 's " Senior Partners , " the top 60 members of management .
Paula Rosput Reynolds , Vice Chairman and Chief Restructuring Officer , who joined AIG in October , will receive no salary or bonus whatsoever in 2008 .
In 2009 and beyond , other than Reynolds base salary , any other compensation she receives will be tied directly to the progress of the restructuring efforts .
AIG 's Senior Partners will not earn long - term performance awards in 2008 .
Furthermore , they will not receive salary increases in 2009 , and their 2008 and 2009 annual bonuses will be limited .
In addition to Mr. Liddy foregoing any severance payments , there will be restrictions on severance payments to members of this management group , which exceed TARP severance restrictions .

Paris
THE posters displayed in Paris Métro stations show a slim woman in her 50s in a cocktail dress , reclining on a leather sofa .
Her hair is natural , her makeup understated , her smile satisfied .
In the foreground , a man , his torso nude , slips two 100 - euro notes into his pocket .
The posters were advertising “ Cliente , ” a popular movie that revolves around clichés about prostitution and gigolos in France .
Judith , the client , who is played by Nathalie Baye , one of France ’s highest - paid actresses , is not a pathetic , lifted rich woman of a certain age and nothing to do .
Rather , she is a hard - charging , 51 - year - old television shopping - channel anchor and director who , after her marriage falls apart , wants good sex without strings and is willing to pay handsomely for it .
For Josiane Balasko , 58 , the director , author and actress ( she plays Judith ’s sister ) , the goals were twofold : to shatter a long - held taboo in France and to send a positive message to middle - aged women who find themselves alone and wanting sexual fulfillment .
“ Prostitution is the last sexual territory owned by men , ” she said in an interview .
“ Men are in control of pleasure and have the right to buy it .
Women do not .
A lot of my friends are alone , lonely , divorced .
They ca n’t always reinvent themselves with another man and a new family .
So I decided to show a female client of a male escort .
She ’s not a victim .
She is a woman who is in control of her life , her feelings , her sexual pleasure . ”
Annuals and perennials
Annual crops grow , blossom and die within one year .
Perennials overwinter and grow again the following year .
The life strategy of many annuals consists of rapid growth following germination and rapid transition to flower and seed formation , thus preventing the loss of energy needed to create permanent structures .
They germinate quickly after the winter so that they come out before other plants , thus eliminating the need to compete for food and light .
The trick is basically to make as many seeds as possible in as short a time as possible .
Perennials have more evolved life strategies for surviving in poor conditions .
They compose perennial structures such as overwintering buds , bulbs or tubers .
These structures contain groups with cells that are not yet specialised , but which can later be converted when required into new organs such as stalks and leaves .
The flowering of annuals
Annual crops consume all the non-specialised cells in developing their flowers .
Thus the appearance of the flower signals means the end of the plant .
But fortunately they have left seeds that sense - after winter - that the moment has come to start up .
Plants are able to register the lengthening of the days .
With the advent of longer days in the spring , a signal is sent from the leaves to the growth tops to activate a limited number of blooming - induction genes .
Deactivating two genes
VIB researchers , such as Siegbert Melzer in Tom Beeckman 's group , have studied two such flower - inducing genes .
They have deactivated them in thale cress ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) , a typical annual .
The VIB researchers found that mutant plants can no longer induce flowering , but they can continue to grow vegetatively or come into flower much later .
Melzer had found that modified crops did not use up their store of non-specialised cells , enabling perennial growth .
They can therefore continue to grow for a very long time .
As with real perennials these plants show secondary growth with wood formation creating shrub - like Arabidopsis plants .
Raising the veil of evolution
Researchers have been fascinated for a long time by the evolution of herbaceous to woody structures .
This research clearly shows only two genes are in fact necessary in this process .
This has probably been going on throughout the evolution of plants .
Furthermore it is not inconceivable this happened independently on multiple occasions .

Manufacturer Intel Model X25 - E Extreme 32 GB Price ( Street ) Availability Now Intel burst onto the storage scene back in September with its X25 - M solid - state drive .
This 80 GB SSD combined Intel ’s formidable chip - making prowess with its years of experience in high - performance storage controller design , and the results were impressive to say the least .
Indeed , the X25 - M was arguably the fastest solid - state drive we ’d ever tested , let down only by the comparatively slow write performance of its multi- level cell ( MLC ) flash memory chips .
There is n’t much Intel can do about the slow write speeds inherent to MLC memory .
However , the company has crafted a new solid - state drive based on single - level cell ( SLC ) memory chips that are n’t plagued by poor write rates .
This latest X25 - E Extreme boasts the same 250 MB /s sustained read speed as the X25 - M , but write speeds have been boosted from a paltry 70 MB / s to a much more impressive 170 MB / s .
Oh my .
Obviously , the X25 - E Extreme is going to be faster than the X25 - M. Read on to see where the X25 - E ’s faster write speeds help the most , and in some cases , where they improve performance more than you might expect .
Extreme for enterprise Solid - state drives use either single - level or multi - level cell flash memory .
The former stores one bit per memory cell ( a value of 0 or 1 ) while the latter is capable of storing two bits per cell ( with possible values of 00 , 01 , 10 , and 11 ) .
Obviously , MLC flash has a significant advantage on the storage density front .
However , that advantage comes at the cost of write speeds , which are typically much slower than reads .
Intel ’s MLC - based X25 - M , for example , is capable of reading at up to 250 MB/s , but its sustained write speed tops out at only 70 MB / s. Single - level cell memory does n’t suffer such a great disparity between read and write speeds , as evidenced by the X25 - E Extreme , which reads at up to 250 MB /s and writes at up to 170 MB /s .
Of course , the more balanced transfer rates offered by SLC memory do n’t come cheap .
The X25 - M 80GB is currently selling for $ 621 online , which works out to a seemingly exorbitant $ 7.76 per gigabyte .
But that ’s nothing compared to the cost of the X25 - E Extreme 32 GB , which at $ 719 online , rings in at an even steeper $ 22.47 per gigabyte .
Solid - state storage is n’t cheap , and single - level cell implementations are about as expensive as SSDs get .
The prospect of shelling out three times as much per gigabyte for the X25 - E is certainly daunting , but the drive does offer other perks to justify the premium .
For example , its 75 - microsecond read latency is 10 microseconds quicker than that of the X25 - M .
That ’s not a huge margin , but within the confines of a modern PC , where bits flip at billions of times per second on multiple processor cores , it ’s a notable improvement .
To put things in perspective , it ’s also worth noting that the access time of a VelociRaptor , which has faster seek times than any other Serial ATA hard drive , is two orders of magnitude slower at 7400 microseconds .
While the X25 - E ’s faster write speed and quicker access latency are great , it ’s on the longevity front that the drive offers the biggest step up over the X25 - M. Multi - level memory cells are limited to 10,000 write - erase cycles before they burn out .
Single - level memory cells , on the other hand , are good for 100,000 write - erase cycles — a difference of one order of magnitude .
SLC - based flash drives should last much longer than those that use MLC memory chips .
Exactly how much longer depends on several factors , including the write - erase content of the workloads involved , the size of the drive , its write amplification factor , and the efficiency of its wear - leveling algorithms .
Solid - state drive makers tend not to discuss those last two factors , but according to Intel , they can have a profound impact on a drive ’s actual lifespan .
Write amplification refers to the amount of data that must actually be written to a drive to complete a given write request .
Say you have a 4KB write request and a drive with a 128 KB erase block size .
You ca n’t just erase and re-write 4KB of that 128KB erase block — you have to clear and rewrite the whole thing .
The write amplification factor is the actual write size divided by the request size , which in this case is 32 .
Intel claims that the X25 - E Extreme ’s write amplification factor is less than 1.1 , and that “ traditional ” SSDs have a write amplification factor of closer to 20 .
Wear - leveling is also an important component of flash endurance , as drives spread the love in an attempt to distribute write - erase cycles evenly across available cells .
This requires some bit shuffling , and drives must take care to ensure that their wear - leveling algorithms do n’t burn through too many write - erase cycles in the process .
According to Intel , most SSDs have a wear leveling efficiency factor of three .
The X25 - E Extreme ’s wear leveling efficiency factor is quoted as less than 1.1 .
If we combine all the factors that Intel says affect solid - state drive longevity , we come up with the following formula for cycling : Cycles = ( Host writes ) * ( Write amplification factor ) * ( Wear leveling factor ) / ( Drive capacity )
With write amplification and wear leveling efficiency factors of 1.1 , and 20 GB of write - erase requests per day for five years , we should only burn through 1380 cycles on the X25 - E Extreme .
The same workload on what Intel defines as a “ traditional ” SSD , with a write amplification factor of 20 and a wear - leveling efficiency of three , consumes more than 68,000 cycles .
We do n’t want to rely too much on Intel ’s likely pessimistic assessment of the wear leveling efficiency and write amplification factors of other solid - state drives , but other SSD makers have n’t been able to give us equivalent numbers of their own .
The X25 - E Extreme ’s expected lifespan will , of course , depend on how many gigabytes of write - erase operations are thrown at it .
Even with 100GB of write - erase per day , it ’ll take more than 72 years to burn through the drive .
Couple that with the Extreme ’s two - million - hour Mean Time Between Failures ( MTBF ) rating , and one can probably expect the drive to last .
Like its MLC - based cousin , the X25 - E uses a 10 - channel storage controller backed by 16MB of cache .
Amusingly , the cache is provided by Samsung — one of the biggest players in the SSD market — via a K4S281632I - UC60 SDRAM memory chip .
The storage controller is an Intel design that ’s particularly crafty , supporting not only SMART monitoring , but also Native Command Queuing ( NCQ ) .
NCQ was originally designed to compensate for the rotational latency inherent to mechanical hard drives , but here it ’s being used in reverse , because Intel says its SSDs are so fast that they actually encounter latency in the host system .
It takes a little time ( time is of course relative when you ’re talking about an SSD whose access latency is measured in microseconds ) between when a system completes a request and the next one is issued .
NCQ is used to queue up to 32 requests to keep the X25 - E busy during any downtime between requests .
Even with its protective shroud removed , the Extreme looks not unlike the X25 - M that preceded it .
Both drives use a single circuit board populated with 10 memory chips on each side .
Intel makes these chips itself using a 50nm fabrication process .
With the X25 - E , however , the connection points are covered with what appear to be drippings from World of Goo .
No doubt this protective coating has been used to prevent enterprising pirates from , er , installing mod chips , or something .
Thus far , we ’ve only touched on the performance benefits that solid - state hard drives can provde , but there are other advantages to moving out of the mechanical world .
With no moving parts , SSDs are much more resistant to physical shock .
They ’re absolutely quiet , too , and typically consume much less power than traditional hard drives .
Intel rates the X25 - E ’s idle power consumption at just 0.06W , and when active , that figure only jumps to 2.4W .
The X25 - E ’s paltry power consumption will be particularly attractive for the enterprise applications at which the drive is targeted .
Indeed , this may be the first enterprise - class product to bring Extreme branding into rack servers .
Dude , that ’s totally where the X25 - E ’s power savings will add up , as stacks of drives are combined in RAID arrays where every watt saved will also lower cooling costs for the rack .
WorldBench
WorldBench uses scripting to step through a series of tasks in common Windows applications .
It then produces an overall score .
WorldBench also spits out individual results for its component application tests , allowing us to compare performance in each .
We ’ll look at the overall score , and then we ’ll show individual application results .

WorldBench also spits out individual results for its component application tests , allowing us to compare performance in each .
We ’ll look at the overall score , and then we ’ll show individual application results .
The X25 - E scores five points higher than its MLC - based cousin in WorldBench .
That makes it the fastest drive we ’ve ever tested here , and not by an insignificant margin .
Multimedia editing and encoding MusicMatch Jukebox Windows Media Encoder Adobe Premiere VideoWave Movie Creator
Although it ’s not often much faster than the competition , the Extreme still turns in the quickest times through WorldBench ’s multimedia editing and encoding tests .
Only in the Premiere test does the X25 - E put some real distance between itself and the rest of the field , besting the VelociRaptor by 18 seconds .
Image processing Adobe Photoshop ACDSee PowerPack
The X25 - E takes top honors in WorldBench ’s ACDSee test , where it ’s 34 seconds faster than the X25 - M , likely thanks to the faster write speeds allowed by single - level cell memory .
Multitasking and office applications Microsoft Office Mozilla Mozilla and Windows Media Encoder Scores are close throughout WorldBench ’s office and multitasking tests .
Other applications WinZip Nero
The X25 - E bounces back strongly in WorldBench ’s WinZip and Nero tests , though .
In the former , it ’s only a little quicker than the X25 - M. However , in the Nero test the Extreme really shines , leading the other solid - state drives we tested by more than a minute .
Boot and load times
To test system boot and game level load times , we busted out our trusty stopwatch .
To test system boot and game level load times , we busted out our trusty stopwatch .
Despite dominating WorldBench , the X25 - E is only a middle - of - the - pack performer in our boot time test .
It ’s essentially tied with the X25 - M here , and that puts it more than six seconds slower than Samsung ’s FlashSSD .
SSDs dominate our level load tests , with the Extreme curiously turning in a slower Far Cry load time than the X25 - M .
Even then , it ’s still a couple of seconds faster than the VelociRaptor .
File Copy Test
File Copy
Test is a pseudo - real - world benchmark that times how long it takes to create , read , and copy files in various test patterns .
File copying is tested twice : once with the source and target on the same partition , and once with the target on a separate partition .
Scores are presented in MB/s. File Copy

File copying is tested twice : once with the source and target on the same partition , and once with the target on a separate partition .
Scores are presented in MB/s .
To make things easier to read , we ’ve separated our FC - Test results into individual graphs for each test pattern .
We ’ll tackle file creation performance first .
FC - Test ’s scripted file creation sequences really stress a drive ’s write performance , and it ’s here that the benefits of SLC memory become readily apparent .
The X25 - E is more than three times faster than the X25 - M virtually across the board , and it ’s much quicker than any of the other drives we ’ve assembled , as well .
As one might expect , the Extreme is n’t much quicker than the X25 - M when we switch to FC - Test ’s read benchmarks .
The drives offer roughly equivalent read speeds here , although the X25 - E is a little quicker with each workload , perhaps due to its slightly lower read latency .
FC - Test – continued Next , the true file - copy test combines read and write tasks .
With no write performance weakness to speak of , the X25 - E dominates our file copy tests in dramatic fashion .
Copying from one partition to another does n’t slow down the Extreme , either .
It ’s still the class of the field , by huge margins with each test pattern .
iPEAK multitasking
We ’ve developed a series of disk - intensive multitasking tests to highlight the impact of seek times and command queuing on hard drive performance .
You can get the low - down on these iPEAK - based tests
We ’ve developed a series of disk - intensive multitasking tests to highlight the impact of seek times and command queuing on hard drive performance .
You can get the low - down on these iPEAK - based tests here .
The mean service time of each drive is reported in milliseconds , with lower values representing better performance .
Our iPEAK workloads were recorded using a 40 GB partition , so they ’re a little big for the 32 GB X25 - E .
The app had no problems running , but it warned us that I/O requests that referenced areas beyond the drive ’s 32 GB capacity would be wrapped around to the beginning of the drive .
Since there should be no performance difference between the beginning and end of an SSD , the results should be valid .
The X25 - E continues to make short work of the competition , slicing through our first wave of multi-tasking workloads with apparent ease .
Only the X25 - M comes close , and even then , only with the one workload that does n’t stress write performance .
Our second batch of multitasking workloads proves just as fertile ground for the X25 - E , which again mops the floor with its rivals .
The X25 - M comes close to matching the Extreme ’s performance with some workloads , but it ’s well behind with those that include a file copy operation as the secondary task .
IOMeter
IOMeter presents a good test case for both seek times and command queuing .
IOMeter presents a good test case for both seek times and command queuing .
Can you guess which IOMeter test pattern is exclusively made up of read operations ?
I thought so .
Only with the web server test pattern does the X25 - M manage to hang with Intel ’s latest SSD , as both drives roar out to a huge lead over the competition .
The M is quite a bit faster than the rest of the field when faced with IOMeter ’s other test patterns , too , but it ’s not nearly as quick as the Extreme .
Based on these results , it ’s easy to see why Intel is targeting the X25 - E at enterprise environments .
No other drive we ’ve tested even comes close to matching its performance , and that includes Samsung ’s SLC - based FlashSSD .
The X25 - E ’s IOMeter CPU utilization is much higher than the rest of the field , but that ’s to be expected given the fact that the drive is doing significantly more work .
HD Tach
We tested HD Tach with the benchmark ’s full variable zone size setting .
We tested HD Tach with the benchmark ’s full variable zone size setting .
HD
Tach ’s pedal - to - the - floor sustained throughput drag races nicely put the X25 - E ’s transfer rates into perspective .
The Extreme is shadowed by the X25 - M in the read speed test , but it ’s all alone in the lead when we look at writes .
What ’s particularly impressive here is that the X25 - E actually exceeds its supposed maximum write speed of 170 MB /s by nearly 38 MB / s. Perhaps even more striking is the fact that the VelociRaptor is at least 100 MB /s behind in both tests .
The Extreme retains the lead through HD Tach ’s burst speed test , although it does n’t have much of an advantage over the competition here .
All three of our solid - state drives share the lead here , flexing their huge access latency advantage over mechanical hard drives .
This test only tracks random access times down to a tenth of a millisecond , so it does n’t expose any differences in performance between the SSDs .
While the Extreme ’s CPU utilization is the highest of the lot , keep in mind that HD Tach ’s margin of error in this test is +/- 2 % .
Noise levels
Noise levels were measured with an Extech 407727 Digital Sound Level meter 1 ″ from the side of the drives at idle and under an HD Tach seek load .
Drives were run with the PCB facing up .
Noise levels were measured with an Extech 407727 Digital Sound Level meter 1 ″ from the side of the drives at idle and under an HD Tach seek load .
Drives were run with the PCB facing up .
These scores represent the noise generated by our test system as a whole , which is why the SSDs are all pegged at 42 decibels — that ’s the ambient noise level of the rest of the system .
On their own , flash drives do n’t so much as make a sound , regardless of whether they ’re idling or under load .
Power consumption
For our power consumption tests , we measured the voltage drop across a 0.1 - ohm resistor placed in line with the 5V and 12V lines connected to each drive .
Through the magic of Ohm’s Law , we were able to calculate the power draw from each voltage rail and add them together for the total power draw of the drive .
Behold , the power efficiency advantage of SSDs .
Mechanical hard drives do n’t even come close .
Interestingly , Samsung ’s FlashSSD consumes less power than both of Intel ’s solid - state drives .
We ’re only talking about fractions of a watt , though .

The 2008 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was announced earlier this week .
The prize was awarded to three europeans for the discoveries of two viruses that cause severe human disease ; the cancer - causing human papilloma virus ( HPV ) and the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) .
Two French scientists , Luc Montagnier , age 76 , at the University of Paris in Paris , France and Francoise BarrÃ© - Sinoussi , age 61 , at the Institut Pasteur in Garches , France will split half the prize for their discovery of the HIV virus .
BarrÃ© - Sinoussi is the 8th woman to receive the Nobel award for Physiology or Medicine .
A German researcher , Harald zur Hausen , age 72 , at the University of Dusseldorf , Germany , will receive the other half of the $ 1.3 million prize for establishing that most cervical cancers are caused by two types of human papilloma virus .
The human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV )
The HIV virus was identified in cultured lymphocytes ( a type of white blood cell ) from a patient with swollen lymph nodes , characteristic of the early stage of acquired immune deficiency [ 1 ] .
While most oncogenic retroviruses induce cell growth , the HIV virus instead mediates cell fusion of T lymphocytes , impairing the immune system .
A member of the lentivirus group , HIV RNA is converted to DNA and integrated into the T lymphocyte genome .
The virus effectively evades the host immune system by continually changing and moving its genome from one location to another .
By 1984 , Montagnier and BarrÃ© - Sinoussi had obtained several isolates of the HIV retrovirus from sexually infected individuals , haemophiliacs , mother to infant transmissions and transfused patients .
According to the Nobel committee , the discovery of the HIV virus made possible the rapid cloning of the HIV - 1 genome that [ 2 ] :
… has allowed unravelling of important details of its replication cycle and how the virus interacts with its host .
This led quickly to the development of diagnostic tools for identification of patients and screening of blood products , which has limited the spread of the pandemic .
Soon after the discovery of HIV , several groups presented evidence that HIV causes acquired human immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases provides a comprehensive summary on The Evidence that HIV causes AIDS .
The CDC estimates that 1.1 million U.S. adults and adolescents were living with diagnosed or undiagnosed HIV infection at the end of 2006 [ 3 ] .
For additional information on HIV prevention research and surveillance and the development of effective biomedical interventions to reduce transmission and HIV disease progression , see the CDC HIV / AIDS page .
The human papilloma virus ( HPV )
HPV is a group of viruses that includes more than 100 strains or types .
More than 30 types are sexually transmitted and can infect the genital area of men and women .
In the 1970s , Harald zur Hausen postulated a role for HPV in cervical cancer [ 4 - 5 ] .
Almost 10 years later , he identified human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 in two different human cervical carcinomas [ 6 ] .
Since then , HPV16 and HPV18 have been found in ~ 70 % of cervical cancers [ 7 - 8 ] .
Sexually transmitted genital HPV infections are very common .
Most occur without any symptoms and , over the course of a few years , go away without treatment [ 8 ] .
However , some HPV infections persist for many years and are the primary cause of cervical cancer .
For additional information on HPV , including fact sheets , statistics , treatment guidelines and resources for clinicians and educators , see the CDC HPV – STD page .
The National Cancer Institute also provides an informative fact sheet on the human papillomaviruses and cancer .

While several Republicans brushed aside the significance of the endorsement , saying they believed it had been in the works for weeks , others said they were more concerned by Mr. Obama ’s ability to dwarf Mr. McCain in spending during the final weeks of the campaign .
As strategists for Mr. Obama eyed intensifying their efforts in Georgia , North Dakota and West Virginia , Republican advisers were trimming their efforts back to states won by Mr. Bush in 2004 and hoping for the best elsewhere .
The endorsement and the new fund - raising figures came on a weekend filled with signs of fresh momentum for Mr. Obama .
He broke his record for crowd sizes , drawing an estimated 100,000 people to an outdoor rally in St. Louis .
But the campaigns appear to be locked in a bitter duel in Missouri and a few other states that supported Republicans in recent presidential contests .
“ The numbers we ’re seeing at rallies are good portents , ” said Mr. Obama ’s chief strategist , David Axelrod , who like other aides reflected a sweaty and nervous optimism .
“ These become good barometers of enthusiasm . ”
Using Mr. Obama as a magnet , the large rallies are specifically intended to stir interest in early voting and to serve as practice exercises for local campaign organizers to get out the vote on Election Day .
By focusing on several Republican - leaning states , like Missouri , North Carolina and Virginia , advisers said they were striving to pave several distinct routes to an Electoral College victory instead of relying on a set number of states as Democrats have in the past .
While Mr. Powell said he had no plans to campaign for Mr. Obama , he became the highest - profile Republican to add his support to the Democratic ticket .
He dismissed the notion that he was supporting Mr. Obama because they are both black .
He contributed $ 2,300 to Mr. McCain last year and said he had studied both candidates for nearly two years , but in recent weeks Mr. Obama had impressed him .
“ He displayed a steadiness , an intellectual curiosity , a depth of knowledge and an approach to looking at problems , ” Mr. Powell said , adding : “ Not jumping in and changing every day , but showing intellectual vigor .
I think that he has a definitive way of doing business that would serve us well . ”
Advisers to Mr. Obama said they had no immediate plans of using Mr. Powell in campaign advertisements , but that could change over the next two weeks .
Mr. Obama , who has used his large campaign treasury to buy 30 - minute spots on the television networks in the final week of the race , could highlight the endorsement at that point , but aides also said they expected Mr. Powell ’s words to receive plenty of attention on their own .

John McCain 's 10 - vehicle motorcade was headed back to his family retreat after several hours of debate practice early Saturday afternoon when it made an unscheduled turn into a McDonald 's parking lot .
Out jumped an aide , who hustled into the restaurant .

The service was quick , though , and the aide soon emerged carrying drinks , bags of food and a Happy Meal and climbed back into McCain 's sport utility vehicle for the quick drive to McCain 's home .
U.S. officials were working out details with Indian diplomats on Friday for the departure of a team of FBI agents to join the investigation of the Indian terror attacks that killed at least 150 people .
Among the dead were an American rabbi and his wife and a man and his teenage daughter who were traveling with a group from a Virginia meditation community , U.S. authorities said .
A second group of investigators was on alert to join the first team if necessary , said the officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the operation .
The investigators aim to learn more about the origins of the militants who carried out the lethal strikes on luxury hotels , a train station and an Orthodox Jewish center where the rabbi and his wife were among five hostages slain .
President George W. Bush said in a statement that his " administration has been working with the Indian government and the international community as Indian authorities work to ensure the safety of those still under threat .
We will continue to cooperate against these extremists who offer nothing but violence and hopelessness . "
His statement expressed sadness for the deaths and injuries of Americans .
" We also mourn the great loss of life suffered by so many people from several other countries , and we have the wounded in our thoughts and prayers , " Bush said in the statement released at Camp David , his presidential retreat in the mountains north of Washington .
Bush also expressed condolences to Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in a telephone call .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice telephoned her Indian counterpart , Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee , on Friday to discuss the Mumbai situation , State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid said .
He gave no details of their conversation but said American lives remained in peril in Mumbai .
U.S. officials were checking with Indian authorities and hospitals to learn more about the extent of casualties .
The State Department urged Americans not to travel , at least through the weekend , to the stricken city , India 's financial capital and the home of the Indian movie industry .
In New York , the Chabad - Lubavitch movement confirmed Friday that Rabbi Gavriel Noach Holtzberg , a dual Israel - U.S. citizen , and his wife , Israel - born Rivka Holtzberg , were killed during the terrorist assault on the ultrareligious group 's Mumbai headquarters , one of the attackers ' 10 targets in South Mumbai .
The couple 's toddler son , Moshe Holtzberg , survived the assault after he was taken from the center by an employee .
He was with his grandparents .
Rabbi Moshe Kotlarsky , vice chairman of the educational arm of Chabad - Lubavitch , praised the couple for their work in India .
" As emissaries to Mumbai , Gabi and Rivky gave up the comforts of the West in order to spread Jewish pride in a corner of the world that was a frequent stop for throngs of Israeli tourists .
Their selfless love will live on with all the people they touched .
We will continue the work they started . "
Bobbie Garvey , a spokeswoman for the Synchronicity Foundation , the meditation group in Virginia , identified the two slain members as Alan Scherr , 58 , and his 13 - year - old daughter , Naomi .
The meditation group said in a statement that four other members of the 25 - person group , two Americans and two Canadians , who were staying at the Oberoi Hotel were wounded by gunfire and were believed in stable condition .
A South Asia specialist said Friday that the terror " group itself is probably drawing from , in large numbers , Indian operatives , but it probably enjoys a fairly healthy support of Pakistan . "
" The big picture is that there 's probably going to be more of this , not less of this , to come , " the specialist , Christine Fair of the RAND Corp. , said Friday .
" I do n't think this is the most lethal attack that terrorists have perpetrated , but it is certainly the most expansive , in its scope and its scale and its perplexity . "
Pakistan 's ambassador to the U.S. , Husain Haqqani , said in a statement that his country is " confronting the menace of terrorism with great vigor . "
Haqqani insisted " it is unfair to blame Pakistan or Pakistanis for these acts of terrorism even before an investigation is undertaken . "
Democratic U.S. Sen . Russ Feingold urged restraint to avoid unnecessary tension in the South Asian subcontinent .
" As we continue to learn the details about the attacks and those responsible for them , we must not allow them to undermine the progress that has been made to foster better relations between India and its neighbor Pakistan , " said Feingold , a member of the Senate 's foreign relations and intelligence committees .
He described India and Pakistan as " critical partners in our global fight against terrorism . "
A U.S. counterterror official also cautioned that it was premature " to reach any hard - and - fast conclusions on who may be responsible for the attacks . "
But the official , who spoke on intelligence matters on condition of anonymity , added that " some of what we 're seeing is reminiscent of past terrorist operations undertaken by groups such as Lashkar - e - Tayyaba and Jaish - e - Mohammed . "
Those two groups are Pakistani militants who have fought Indian troops in Kashmir and are reported to be linked to al - Qaida .

For a Django project I 'm working on I wanted to allow users to select from a handful of skins to personalize the site 's appearance ( similar to Twitter 's new skinning functionality ) , and decided to try to put together a pluggable app to accomplish this .
Thus django - userskins was born .
The readme file is fairly thorough on discussing the implementation details , but I 'll make a few remarks here nonetheless .
Minimum possible database hits .
I felt that it was important to avoid database hits as much as possible , because allowing users to pick skins is n't much of an improvement if your site starts loading more slowly because of it .
My approach is to use cookies for persistence , and if an authenticated user does n't have a cookie , then it recreates a cookie for them by checking their skin preference in the database .
Thus , each user should only have to hit the database once , each time they clean their browser 's cookies .
Additionally , django - userskins has an option to never hit the database , and in that case it will only use cookies to store users ' preferred skins .
Conserve bandwidth .
Another issue that I felt was important was to conserve bandwidth as much as possible .
In this regard , I disliked any approach that involved injecting customized style sheets into application templates because it does n't allow caching / minification / far - future - expires and is re-sent with every single rendered template .
Instead django - userskins lets you specify the CSS file to load for each skin .
A simple case looks like this :
USERSKINS_DEFAULT
= " light " USERSKINS_DETAILS
= { ' light ' : ' light.css ' , ' dark ' : ' dark.css ' , }
Which will be used by the userskin template tag ...
{ % load userskins %} < head > < title > Yadayada </ title > { % userskin %} </head >
to render something like this :
< head > < title > Yadayada </ title > < link rel= " stylesheet " href= " http://127.0.0.1:8000/media/light.css " > </head >
Even more exciting ( to me ) , is that django - userskins can integrate with django - compress .
Your settings file will look something like this :
COMPRESS = True COMPRESS_VERSION
= True COMPRESS_CSS
= { ' light ' :{ ' source_filenames ' :( 'css/base.css ' , 'css/skins/light.css ' ) , ' output_filename ' : 'css/light_skin.r?.css ' , } , ' dark ' :{ ' source_filenames ' :( 'css/base.css ' , 'css/skins/dark.css ' ) , ' output_filename ' : 'css/dark_skin.r?.css ' , } , } USERSKINS_DEFAULT
= " light " # USERSKINS_DETAILS
is not used when integrating with django - compress USERSKINS_USE_COMPRESS_GROUPS
= True
Usage of the template tag is exactly the same , but will output the compressed , merged , and versioned file for the selected skin .
{ % load userskins %} < head > < title > Yadayada </ title > { % userskin %} </head >
Using this combination of django - compress and django - userskins , you can support userskin selection without sending additional data with each page , and ( with far - future - expires ) without even adding an extra http request to retrieve the skin 's css file .
Combined with the minimal approach to database access , it should be possible to use django - userskins with minimal impact on your site 's performance and bandwidth usage .
Skins for authenticated and anonymous users .
One nice thing about django - userskins is that users who are not logged in can specify a skin as well ( persistent via cookies ) .
Code for setting individuals ' cookies can be as simple as this ( for example , if you just had a list of available skins in a sidebar , and the users just click the link to change their selected skin ) :
from django.conf.urls .defaults import * from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect from userskins .models import SkinPreference def dark_skin ( request ) : hrr = HttpResponseRedirect ( " / " ) hrr .
set_cookie ( " userskins " , " dark " ) if request .
user .
is_authenticated ( ) : try : sp = SkinPreference . objects .
get ( user = request .
user ) sp . skin = " dark " sp . save ( ) except SkinPreference .
ObjectDoesNotExist : sp = SkinPreference . objects .
create ( user = request .
user , skin = " dark " ) return hrr def light_skin ( request ) : hrr = HttpResponseRedirect ( " / " ) hrr .
set_cookie ( " userskins " , " light " ) if request .
user .
is_authenticated ( ) : try : sp = SkinPreference . objects .
get ( user = request .
user ) sp . skin = " dark " sp . save ( ) except SkinPreference .
ObjectDoesNotExist : sp = SkinPreference . objects .
create ( user = request .
user , skin = " light " ) return hrr urlpatterns = patterns ( '' , ( r'^skin / dark /$' , dark_skin ) , ( r'^skin / light /$' , light_skin ) , )
If you do n't have authenticated users , then the selection view gets even shorter :
def light_skin ( request ) : hrr = HttpResponseRedirect ( " / " ) hrr .
set_cookie ( " userskins " , " light " ) return hrr
Missing anything ?
Can you think of any other use cases that are not covered by the existing design ?
Let me know and I 'll incorporate them as best I can .
I 'll be integrating django - userskins into a real app of mine sometime soon , and will keep refining it a bit as problems pop up , but I do n't imagine making many drastic changes unless new usecases are discovered .
The git repository is on GitHub , and the readme file can be found there as well .
Brazil 's President Lula told his country in September , " People ask me about the [ financial ] crisis , and I answer , go ask Bush .
It is his crisis , not mine . "
Fifty days later , British Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms told a conference of G - 20 nations gathered in Sao Paulo , Brazil : " We are in extraordinary times , the global economy is facing shocks which are wholly without precedent and we need a new approach . …
It is a global crisis .
It therefore requires an international response . "
In other words , what goes around , comes around .
Global schadenfreude toward a stupid and greedy United States and its subprime mortgage meltdown has rapidly become global concern about how to rescue the world from an all - encompassing financial disaster .
Here 's just a smattering of companies large and small that recently announced lowered outlooks for the year : Under Armour ( NYSE : UA ) , News Corp. ( NYSE : NWS ) , Starbucks ( NASDAQ : SBUX ) , Vodafone ( NYSE : VOD ) , Electronic Arts ( NASDAQ : ERTS ) , ADP ( NYSE : ADP ) , and Hormel ( NYSE : HRL ) .
( Yes , in these tough times , even the outlook for Spam is grim . )
And if that were not enough , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) recently lowered its outlook for the entire global economy .
One country 's plan to step up
Against that backdrop , China announced a 4 - trillion - yuan ( $ 586 billion ) stimulus package for its domestic economy this past Sunday .
It plans to fund extensive infrastructure construction , aid poor farmers , and cut export taxes .
While China 's plan has clear beneficiaries , and should help keep more laborers in their jobs and prop up domestic consumer spending , the most important ( and underreported ) aspect of the plan is how it will fundamentally change the economic relationship between the U.S. and China .
Here 's how it was
One of the big debates over the past half - decade was whether China had reached a point in its economic development at which its internal economic gravity would allow it to " decouple " from the global economy .
If so , it could continue along its fantastic growth trajectory , even as growth in the U.S. or Europe ceased or reversed .
That may sound like gobbledygook , but it 's important .
The U.S. has a $ 20 billion monthly trade deficit with China .
It 's funded by China 's willingness to hold U.S. treasuries in its Central Bank ( essentially , we 're borrowing the money ) .
China manages the arrangement by pegging its currency ( the yuan ) to the dollar at an artificially low rate , and by not worrying so much about certain niceties like environmental regulation and labor protection .
It 's a mutually beneficial arrangement -- a weak yuan supports Chinese exporters , helping the country industrialize and quickly integrate rural migrants into its urban workforce , with the salutary effect of keeping inflation and potential political unrest low .
For its part , the U.S. has gotten dirt cheap financing , by virtue of China parking more than a trillion dollars in U.S. government securities .
That has supported the dollar and allowed the Federal Reserve to fuel consumer spending by keeping interest rates low .
China 's stimulus package heralds the unwinding of this relationship .
Here 's how it will be
This is why the decoupling argument matters .
Many analysts have pointed to the thousands of factories that have shut down in China in these past few months as evidence that a slowdown in American spending will cause a depression in China -- potentially even leading to regime change .
But in fact , our trade imbalance with China is artificially preserved by the aforementioned currency peg , and by the decision of China 's state - run banks to make uneconomic loans to businesses it deemed worth propping up .
China has paid heavily for this relationship .
Rather than invest its surplus cash in its own country , the Chinese poured money back into the U.S. to further spur our debt - fueled consumption .
( Put less artfully , some poor Chinese guy in Shaanxi province was essentially helping you pay your mortgage . )
The announced stimulus package reverses that .
Hundreds of billions of dollars that would have gone to propping up the greenback are now being reinvested in China , helping it to transition from its reliance on exports to a self - sustaining economy .
So while China is n't yet decoupled from its export markets , this new spending plan will help it along that path .
What you need to do to survive
China 's huge currency reserves are about to be put to use , and while there will be some real and perhaps severe bumps along the way , the China that comes out on the other side will be a heck of a lot stronger , more independent , and more decoupled than the one we 've seen up to now .
Chinese premier Wen Jiabao called his country 's stimulus the " biggest contribution to the world . "
We do n't know whether that 's true , but we do know that China 's ability to reach deep into its huge coffers to finance further growth gives it a significant advantage over the rest of the world 's struggling economies .
This is why we continue to believe in the Chinese miracle , and why we think more American investors should be taking advantage of this current temporary downturn to diversify their portfolios into previously expensive Chinese stocks .
We 've recommended some Chinese companies at our Motley Fool Global Gains service that can help you do just that .
A few of them are now poised to profit mightily from China 's domestic bailout plan .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- NRG
Energy shares rallied 29 % Monday , playing off rival electricity generator Exelon Corp .'s unsolicited acquisition bid , valued at about $ 6.2 billion , to create what would be the largest U.S. power company .
Late Sunday , Exelon EXC , - 1.17 % said it wrote to the top two executives laying out terms including an exchange rate of 0.485 Exelon share for each NRG NRG , +0.61 % share .
The proposal represents a premium of roughly 37 % over NRG 's closing price on Friday .
The proposal marks a sign that depressed stock prices born out of the credit crisis could set the stage for greater merger - and - acquisition activity in the energy sector .
NRG 's shares jumped $ 5.67 to $ 25 .
Exelon shed 9 cents to $ 54.59 .
If a merger 's consummated , the combined entity would have a generation capacity of about 47,000 megawatts , or enough to supply nearly 45 million homes .
Exelon would greatly expand its presence in key growth areas of Texas and the Northeast .
" This combination would not only diversify Exelon 's generation portfolio geographically , it would also create immediate earnings and cash - flow accretion , " said Exelon CEO John Rowe .
In a conference call with analysts , Exelon said it plans to pursue the deal as either a friendly or an unfriendly offer .
NRG , which has yet to formally respond , acknowledged that it received the buyout proposal and that it 's reviewing it .
A combination would improve the credit rating of NRG -- which has more than $ 8 billion of debt -- and would also reduce its leverage .
Exelon conceded , however , that its own credit rating would suffer from the deal .
According to the text of the letter sent to NRG , the chief executives of the two companies met at the end of September to discuss a potential deal .
One analyst had a bullish take on the deal .
" We would view a combination between Exelon and NRG positively , allowing Exelon to capture incremental synergies to supplement its already strong growth outlook , " wrote BMO Capital Markets analyst Michael Worms in a note to clients .
NRG 's bid to build a new nuclear power plant in Texas also presents a plus for Exelon , he added .
However , the deal is far from done .
" This transaction was unsolicited ... and at this time , NRG 's management has only indicated that it will review the proposal , " Worms added .
In a separate statement , NRG confirmed it had received an unsolicited proposal and said its board of directors will review the offer and " determine an appropriate response . "
The company also advised its shareholders to take no action until the board 's review is complete .
The combined company would include 18,000 megawatts of nuclear energy .
NRG operates about 10,800 megawatts in Texas , 7,000 megawatts in the Northeast , 2,900 megawatts in the South and 1,000 megawatts in Australia and Germany .
Chicago - based Exelon already ranks as one of the nation 's largest electric utilities , with more than $ 15 billion in annual revenue .
Exelon lists 5.2 million customers in Illinois and Pennsylvania .
It also operates the largest fleet of nuclear power plants in the U.S.
Its operating units include ComEd and Peco , as well as power generation and power trading businesses .
Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A , - 1.30 % BRK.B , - 1.45 % , the investment vehicle of billionaire investor Warren Buffett , bought around 3.2 million shares of NRG during the second quarter .

September 15 , 2001
To The Editors —
In July of this year Dinitia Smith asked my publisher if she might interview me for the New York Times on my forthcoming book , Fugitive Days .
From the start she questioned me sharply about bombings , and each time I referred her to my memoir where I discussed the culture of violence we all live with in America , my growing anger in the 1960 ’s about the structures of racism and the escalating war , and the complex , sometimes extreme and despairing choices I made in those terrible times .
Smith ’s angle is captured in the Times headline : “ No regrets for a love of explosives ” ( September 11 , 2001 ) .
She and I spoke a lot about regrets , about loss , about attempts to account for one ’s life .
I never said I had any love for explosives , and anyone who knows me found that headline sensationalistic nonsense .
I said I had a thousand regrets , but no regrets for opposing the war with every ounce of my strength .
I told her that in light of the indiscriminate murder of millions of Vietnamese , we showed remarkable restraint , and that while we tried to sound a piercing alarm in those years , in fact we did n’t do enough to stop the war .
Smith writes of me : “ Even today , he ‘ finds a certain eloquence to bombs , a poetry and a pattern from a safe distance , ’ he writes . ”
This fragment seems to support her “ love affair with bombs ” thesis , but it is the opposite of what I wrote :
We ’ll bomb them into the Stone Age , an unhinged American politician had intoned , echoing a gung - ho , shoot - from - the - hip general … each describing an American policy rarely spoken so plainly .
Boom .
Boom .
Boom .
Poor Viet Nam .
Almost four times the destructive power Florida …
How could we understand it ?
How could we take it in ?
Most important , what should we do about it ?
Bombs away .
There is a certain eloquence to bombs , a poetry and a pattern from a safe distance .
The rhythm of B - 52s dropping bombs over Viet Nam , a deceptive calm at 40,000 feet as the doors ease open and millennial eggs are delivered on the green canopy below , the relentless thud of indiscriminate destruction and death without pause on the ground .
Nothing subtle or syncopated .
Not a happy rhythm .
Three million Vietnamese lives were extinguished .
Dig up Florida and throw it into the ocean .
Annihilate Chicago or London or Bonn .
Three million — each with a mother and a father , a distinct name , a mind and a body and a spirit , someone who knew him well or cared for her or counted on her for something or was annoyed or burdened or irritated by him ; each knew something of joy or sadness or beauty or pain .
Each was ripped out of this world , a little red dampness staining the earth , drying up , fading , and gone .
Bodies torn apart , blown away , smudged out , lost forever .
I wrote about Vietnamese lives as a personal American responsibility , then , and the hypocrisy of claiming an American innocence as we constructed and stoked an intricate and hideous chamber of death in Asia .
Clearly I wrote and spoke about the export of violence and the government ’s love affair with bombs .
Just as clearly Dinitia Smith was interested in her journalistic angle and not the truth .
This is not a question of being misunderstood or “ taken out of context , ” but of deliberate distortion .
Some readers apparently responded to her piece , published on the same day as the vicious terrorist attacks in New York and Washington , by associating my book with them .
This is absurd .
My memoir is from start to finish a condemnation of terrorism , of the indiscriminate murder of human beings , whether driven by fanaticism or official policy .
It begins literally in the shadow of Hiroshima and comes of age in the killing fields of Southeast Asia .
My book criticizes the American obsession with a clean and distanced violence , and the culture of thoughtlessness and carelessness that results from it .
We are now witnessing crimes against humanity in our own land on an unthinkable scale , and I fear that we might soon see innocent people in other parts of the world as well as in the U.S. dying and suffering in response .
All that we witnessed September 11 — the awful carnage and pain , the heroism of ordinary people — may drive us mad with grief and anger , or it may open us to hope in new ways .
Perhaps precisely because we have suffered we can embrace the suffering of others and gather the necessary wisdom to resist the impulse to lash out randomly .
The lessons of the anti-war movements of the 1960s and 70s may be more urgent now than ever .

Fireball Over Edmonton
Credit & Copyright Global Television Edmonton , YouTube
Explanation :
What if you 're driving down the street and an object from space shoots across the sky right in front of you ?
Such was the case last week for many people in south central Canada .
Specifically , an extremely bright fireball , presumably a desk - sized meteor from deep space , flashed across the sky just after sunset on 2008 November 20 .
The bright fireball was recorded on many images and movies , including the spectacular video shown above that was captured by a dashboard camera of a police cruiser in Edmonton , Alberta , Canada .
Because at least two streaks appear to be visible , the falling object likely broke up into pieces as it fell deep into Earth 's atmosphere .
By triangulating fireball images from several simultaneously recorded sources , astronomers hope to find an approximate orbit from whence the object came , as well as the likely place (s ) on Earth where large pieces would have impacted , were they to have survived entry .
In the best case scenario , pieces would be recovered from a known deep space comet or asteroid , giving humanity an unprecedented look at an ancient object that likely holds clues to the early years of our Earth and the Solar System .
Joe the Plumber all but came out of the water closet for Sen.
John McCain on Friday , saying that his famous exchange with Sen. Barack Obama made him “ scared for America ” and that he does n’t trust the Democratic presidential candidate on taxes .
The plumber , aka Joe Wurzelbacher , burst into the headlines after he buttonholed Mr. Obama less than two weeks ago during a campaign stop in his Holland , Ohio , neighborhood and quizzed him about his tax policy .
On Friday , he said that he was n’t impressed by the Illinois senator in their encounter .
“ When I was face to face with him , my honest first impression was that I expected something more .
I had heard so much about ‘ his presence ’ in the media that I was surprised to find that he seemed very average , ” Mr. Wurzelbacher wrote in a live online chat on WashingtonTimes.com ( read the transcript with Mr. Wurzelbacher here ) .
“ My gut feeling as he answered my questions ?
I was scared for America , ” he wrote in response to a reader who asked “ When you were face to face with Obama , what were you thinking and how did it feel ? ”
Mr. Wurzelbacher , arguably the world ’s most famous plumber , has become a cornerstone of Mr. McCain ’s Republican campaign , which had embarked on a statewide blitz across Florida in a series of “ Joe the Plumber ” events aimed at blue - collar workers .

On the campaign circuit Friday , the nominee repeatedly cited Joe the Plumber , telling supporters that if Mr. Obama is elected , the middle class is “ going to be put through the wringer . ”
The plumber , who again refused to endorse a nominee explicitly , said he learned about the tour “ on the news only this morning . ”
He said no one from either campaign “ has asked me to join them .
I ’m out to stick up for the regular folks . ”
Even though Mr. Obama promises to give Mr. Wurzelbacher at least a $ 1,000 tax refund if elected president , the blue - collar worker worries that Mr. Obama will break his word and back off his promise to give a tax break to every worker making less than $ 250,000 a year .
“ What worries me is that he is deciding that $ 250 k is rich right now , but what ’s to stop him from changing his mind ? ” Mr. Wurzelbacher said Friday ..
“ As we all know , politicians change their minds at the drop of a poll .
Personally , I think it will have to go lower .
How else will he pay for all he wants big government to do ? ” he said .
During a brief discussion on Oct. 12 , the candidate told the plumber , who had said he hoped to own his own company some day , that as president , he would try to “ spread the wealth around . ”
Mr. McCain has called the pledge socialist , and Mr. Wurzelbacher said Americans simply do n’t want that .
“ Whether or not his tax plan , as he states it today , would help me , it still comes down to principles .
I do n’t want someone else ’s hard - earned money .
How can you be sure they ’re not going to change their minds and decide you make too much money and want to take more of it to ‘ spread ’ to someone else ? ” the plumber wrote .
Mr. Wurzelbacher said he strongly supports the “ fair tax , ” which would repeal federal income taxes established in the 16th Amendment of the Constitution and replace them with a progressive national sales tax .
“ I like the principles of it , and especially the idea of doing away with the IRS .
That being said , I ’m a big proponent of the flat tax , which I believe would have the same effect and is just as fair .
We all have to pay taxes for the defense of our country and certain basic government protections for the people .
I would be interested in supporting and presenting either tax reforms to Middle America , ” he said .
He also said Friday that he would consider running for Congress in 2010 , challenging in the Toledo - area district represented by longtime Rep. Marcy Kaptur .
“ I ’ll tell you what , we ’d definitely be in one heck of a fight , ” Mr. Wurzelbacher said during an appearance on the Laura Ingraham show Friday .
“ But , you know , I ’d be up for it . ”

Due to the number of CLI commands needed to manually disable services in an attempt to make the router more secure , Cisco introduced the AutoSecure feature from the Major Release 12.3 and subsequent 12.3 T .
AutoSecure is a good command for customers without special Security Operations Applications because it allows them to quickly secure their network without thorough knowledge of all the Cisco IOS features .
The command is available for the Cisco 800 , 1700 , 2600 , 3600 , 3700 , 7200 , and 7500 Series Routers .
There are 2 mode :
Interactive mode : prompts the user with options to enable and disable services and other security features
mode : prompts the user with options to enable and disable services and other security features Non-interactive mode : automatically executes the Cisco AutoSecure command with the recommended Cisco default settings
Cisco Autosecure command :
Ciscozine #auto secure ?
forwarding Secure Forwarding Plane full Interactive full session of AutoSecure login AutoSecure Login management Secure Management Plane no-interact Non-interactive session of AutoSecure ntp AutoSecure NTP tcp-intercept AutoSecure TCP Intercept < cr > Ciscozine #

Jones Soda has done an outstanding job cultivating their company 's image as the small dogs scampering about the corporate kennel of soft drinks .
They 're no Pepsi or Coca - Cola , they 're the guys who slap photos of ugly children on their bottles and try to poison you before your parents ' holiday dinner .
Perhaps I was the victim of a competent , savvy marketing team that led me to believe Jones Soda represents an alternate choice , a vote against the two multi-billion dollar high fructose corn syrup empires .
Then we released this Photoshop Phriday .
Jones Soda responded by promptly launching lawyers at us , perhaps because there 's not much to do around the ol ' soda factory these days .
Maybe they 're trying to stimulate the economy by paying legal teams to send me angry letters , in which case it 's only a matter of time before Barack Obama grants them a major award for hopefully encouraging hope and change in a changing environment of hope .

Last week Red Hat detected an intrusion on certain of its computer systems and took immediate action .
While the investigation into the intrusion is on - going , our initial focus was to review and test the distribution channel we use with our customers , Red Hat Network ( RHN ) and its associated security measures .
Based on these efforts , we remain highly confident that our systems and processes prevented the intrusion from compromising RHN or the content distributed via RHN and accordingly believe that customers who keep their systems updated using Red Hat Network are not at risk .
We are issuing this alert primarily for those who may obtain Red Hat binary packages via channels other than those of official Red Hat subscribers .
In connection with the incident , the intruder was able to get a small number of OpenSSH packages relating only to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 ( i386 and x86_64 architectures only ) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 ( x86_64 architecture only ) signed .
As a precautionary measure , we are releasing an updated version of these packages and have published a list of the tampered packages and how to detect them .
To reiterate , our processes and efforts to date indicate that packages obtained by Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscribers via Red Hat Network are not at risk .
We have provided a shell script which lists the affected packages and can verify that none of them are installed on a system :
The script has a detached GPG signature from the Red Hat Security Response Team ( key ) so you can verify its integrity :
This script can be executed either as a non -root user or as root .
To execute the script after downloading it and saving it to your system , run the command :
bash ./openssh-blacklist-1.0.sh
If the script output includes any lines beginning with " ALERT " then a tampered package has been installed on the system .
Otherwise , if no tampered packages were found , the script should produce only a single line of output beginning with the word " PASS " , as shown below :
bash ./openssh-blacklist-1.0.sh
PASS : no suspect packages were found on this system
The script can also check a set of packages by passing it a list of source or binary RPM filenames .
In this mode , a " PASS " or " ALERT " line will be printed for each filename passed ; for example :
bash ./openssh-blacklist-1.0.sh openssh-4.3p2-16.el5.i386.rpm PASS : signature of package " openssh -4.3p2-16.el5.i386.rpm " not on blacklist
Red Hat customers who discover any tampered packages , need help with running this script , or have any questions should log into the Red Hat support website and file a support ticket , call their local support center , or contact their Technical Account Manager .
There has been an explosion of polls this presidential election .
Through yesterday , there have been 728 national polls with head - to - head matchups of the candidates , 215 in October alone .
In 2004 , there were just 239 matchup polls , with 67 of those in October .
At this rate , there may be almost as many national polls in October of 2008 as there were during the entire year in 2004 .
Some polls are sponsored by reputable news organizations , others by publicity - eager universities or polling firms on the make .
None have the scientific ...

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Some residents in battleground states are receiving more than a dozen daily robocalls , recorded messages often used to attack a candidate 's opponent .
Sen .
Barack Obama 's campaign has criticized the robocalls , but Democrats are launching them too .
Democrats Barack Obama and Joe Biden have criticized John McCain and Republicans for the calls , but both parties are players in the robocall war .
The McCain campaign launched 12 robocalls in the past six weeks , according to Shaun Dakin , founder of the National Political Do Not Contact Registry .
The Obama campaign has launched at least four robocall campaigns in the past month , according to the registry 's Web site .

Voters can block the calls by registering their phone number at StopPoliticalCalls.org .
iReport.com : Listen to a campaign message one reader received
i Reporter Emmanuel Mallo of Johnson City , New York , said he was frustrated when a McCain robocall awoke his son , causing him to burst into tears .
" You can't be waking up children ... to promote your political agenda , " Mallo said .
" People are going through stressful times . "
Former Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani is the star of a new robocall from the McCain campaign and the Republican National Committee .
In the call , the former federal prosecutor and New York mayor tries to paint Obama as soft on crime , saying the Democrat opposes " mandatory prison sentences for sex offenders , drug dealers and murderers . "
" With priorities like these , we just can't trust the inexperience and judgment of Barack Obama and his liberal allies , " Giuliani says .

GOP launches calls attacking Obama on Ayers Giuliani gets tough on Obama in new robocall
The Obama campaign did not have an immediate comment , but according to its Web site , the Illinois senator does support " reforming mandatory minimum prison sentences . "
Obama 's campaign released its own robocall in Wisconsin in response to what it called McCain 's " sleazy phone calls . "
According to the Web site Talking Points Memo , the call features Jeri Watermolen , a former McCain backer who has turned to support Obama because of the McCain campaign 's calls .
iReport.com :
Are you receiving robocalls ?
Tell us about it
" I live in Green Bay , and , like you , I 've been getting sleazy phone calls and mail from John McCain and his supporters viciously -- and falsely -- attacking Barack Obama .
I used to support John McCain because he honorably served our country , but this year he 's running a dishonorable campaign , " Watermolen says in the call .
Giuliani's robocall comes a week after the RNC and the McCain campaign sent out a robocall to swing - state voters highlighting the Democratic presidential candidate 's connection to 1960s radical William Ayers .
Fact check : Obama 's ties to Ayers
The calls are part of a $ 70 million last Republican push to get out the vote for McCain , using calls , mailings and door - knocking in battleground states .
Biden on Tuesday challenged McCain to " stop those ads . "
" If John McCain is serious when he said this morning , ' This election is about the economy , ' then I say , John , take down your robocalls .
Stop what you 're doing , John .
Debate the economy , not lies about Barack 's character , " he said .
But Dakin said voters can expect the calls to keep pouring in during the final days of campaigning .
" It 's essentially the spam of this elections cycle .
They 've become so cheap , so ubiquitous , at every level of every race , so particularly if you live in a battleground state , our members are reporting getting 10 to 15 calls a day .
That 's only going to increase , " he said .
CNN 's Alexander Mooney and Emily Sherman contributed to this report .
All About U.S. Presidential Election
THE ECONOMIST today endorses Barack Obama for president .
As a review of our past endorsements shows , the newspaper ’s ( and this blog ’s ) favour should not have been taken for granted .
When we have chosen to endorse , we have tilted for both Republicans and Democrats .
And despite the largely disappointing general election campaign , we find a lot to admire in both candidates .
John McCain in particular has shown courage in the past sticking to unpopular but sensible positions on things like free trade and immigration reform .
But what happened in this campaign cannot be ignored , either .
From our leader :
The Candidate McCain of the past six months has too often seemed the victim of political sorcery , his good features magically inverted , his bad ones exaggerated .
The fiscal conservative who once tackled Mr Bush over his unaffordable tax cuts now proposes not just to keep the cuts , but to deepen them .
The man who denounced the religious right as “ agents of intolerance ” now embraces theocratic culture warriors .
The campaigner against ethanol subsidies ( who had a better record on global warming than most Democrats ) came out in favour of a petrol - tax holiday .
It has not all disappeared : his support for free trade has never wavered .
Yet rather than heading towards the centre after he won the nomination , Mr McCain moved to the right .
Meanwhile his temperament , always perhaps his weak spot , has been found wanting .
Sometimes the seat - of - the - pants method still works : his gut reaction over Georgia — to warn Russia off immediately — was the right one .
Yet on the great issue of the campaign , the financial crisis , he has seemed all at sea , emitting panic and indecision .
Mr McCain has never been particularly interested in economics , but , unlike Mr Obama , he has made little effort to catch up or to bring in good advisers ( Doug Holtz - Eakin being the impressive exception ) .
The choice of Sarah Palin epitomised the sloppiness .
It is not just that she is an unconvincing stand - in , nor even that she seems to have been chosen partly for her views on divisive social issues , notably abortion .
Mr McCain made his most important appointment having met her just twice .
Mr Obama , on the other hand , has run his campaign brilliantly , and that does matter .
It is not just that he has more than held his own against Mr McCain in the debates .
A man who started with no money and few supporters has out - thought , out - organised and outfought the two mightiest machines in American politics — the Clintons and the conservative right .
Political fire , far from rattling Mr Obama , seems to bring out the best in him : the furore about his ( admittedly ghastly ) preacher prompted one of the most thoughtful speeches of the campaign .
On the financial crisis his performance has been as assured as Mr McCain ’s has been febrile .
He seems a quick learner and has built up an impressive team of advisers , drawing in seasoned hands like Paul Volcker , Robert Rubin and Larry Summers .
Of course , Mr Obama will make mistakes ; but this is a man who listens , learns and manages well .
Of course , Mr Obama is n’t perfect .
A vote for Mr Obama is still a risk , if a calculated one .
Our main doubts about Mr Obama have to do with the damage a muddle - headed Democratic Congress might try to do to the economy .
Despite the protectionist rhetoric that still sometimes seeps into his speeches , Mr Obama would not sponsor a China - bashing bill .
But what happens if one appears out of Congress ?
Worryingly , he has a poor record of defying his party ’s baronies , especially the unions ...
The risk remains that on economic matters the centre that Mr Obama moves to would be that of his party , not that of the country as a whole .
So Mr Obama in that respect is a gamble .
But the same goes for Mr McCain on at least as many counts , not least the possibility of President Palin .
And this cannot be another election where the choice is based merely on fear .
In terms of painting a brighter future for America and the world , Mr Obama has produced the more compelling and detailed portrait .
He has campaigned with more style , intelligence and discipline than his opponent .
Whether he can fulfil his immense potential remains to be seen .
But Mr Obama deserves the presidency .
And , by the way , he will probably get it .
Here ’s to hoping Mr Obama ’s moderate and sensible side wins over his primary - season , protectionist - populist side .

Online document : the full text of Osama bin Laden 's " letter to the American people " , reported in today 's Observer .
The letter first appeared on the internet in Arabic and has since been translated and circulated by Islamists in Britain .
In the Name of Allah , the Most Gracious , the Most Merciful ,
" Permission to fight ( against disbelievers ) is given to those ( believers ) who are fought against , because they have been wronged and surely , Allah is Able to give them ( believers ) victory " [ Quran 22:39 ]
" Those who believe , fight in the Cause of Allah , and those who disbelieve , fight in the cause of Taghut ( anything worshipped other than Allah e.g. Satan ) .
So fight you against the friends of Satan ; ever feeble is indeed the plot of Satan . " [ Quran 4:76 ]
Some American writers have published articles under the title ' On what basis are we fighting ? '
These articles have generated a number of responses , some of which adhered to the truth and were based on Islamic Law , and others which have not .
Here we wanted to outline the truth - as an explanation and warning - hoping for Allah 's reward , seeking success and support from Him .
While seeking Allah 's help , we form our reply based on two questions directed at the Americans :
( Q1 ) Why are we fighting and opposing you ?
Q2 ) What are we calling you to , and what do we want from you ?
As for the first question :
Why are we fighting and opposing you ?
The answer is very simple :
(1) Because you attacked us and continue to attack us .
a) You attacked us in Palestine :
( i) Palestine , which has sunk under military occupation for more than 80 years .
The British handed over Palestine , with your help and your support , to the Jews , who have occupied it for more than 50 years ; years overflowing with oppression , tyranny , crimes , killing , expulsion , destruction and devastation .
The creation and continuation of Israel is one of the greatest crimes , and you are the leaders of its criminals .
And of course there is no need to explain and prove the degree of American support for Israel .
The creation of Israel is a crime which must be erased .
Each and every person whose hands have become polluted in the contribution towards this crime must pay its * price , and pay for it heavily .
( ii ) It brings us both laughter and tears to see that you have not yet tired of repeating your fabricated lies that the Jews have a historical right to Palestine , as it was promised to them in the Torah .
Anyone who disputes with them on this alleged fact is accused of anti-semitism .
This is one of the most fallacious , widely - circulated fabrications in history .
The people of Palestine are pure Arabs and original Semites .
It is the Muslims who are the inheritors of Moses ( peace be upon him ) and the inheritors of the real Torah that has not been changed .
Muslims believe in all of the Prophets , including Abraham , Moses , Jesus and Muhammad , peace and blessings of Allah be upon them all .
If the followers of Moses have been promised a right to Palestine in the Torah , then the Muslims are the most worthy nation of this .
When the Muslims conquered Palestine and drove out the Romans , Palestine and Jerusalem returned to Islaam , the religion of all the Prophets peace be upon them .
Therefore , the call to a historical right to Palestine cannot be raised against the Islamic Ummah that believes in all the Prophets of Allah ( peace and blessings be upon them ) - and we make no distinction between them .
( iii ) The blood pouring out of Palestine must be equally revenged .
You must know that the Palestinians do not cry alone ; their women are not widowed alone ; their sons are not orphaned alone .
( b) You attacked us in Somalia ; you supported the Russian atrocities against us in Chechnya , the Indian oppression against us in Kashmir , and the Jewish aggression against us in Lebanon .
( c) Under your supervision , consent and orders , the governments of our countries which act as your agents , attack us on a daily basis ;
( i) These governments prevent our people from establishing the Islamic Shariah , using violence and lies to do so .
( ii ) These governments give us a taste of humiliation , and places us in a large prison of fear and subdual .
( iii ) These governments steal our Ummah 's wealth and sell them to you at a paltry price .
( iv ) These governments have surrendered to the Jews , and handed them most of Palestine , acknowledging the existence of their state over the dismembered limbs of their own people .
( v) The removal of these governments is an obligation upon us , and a necessary step to free the Ummah , to make the Shariah the supreme law and to regain Palestine .
And our fight against these governments is not separate from out fight against you .
(d) You steal our wealth and oil at paltry prices because of you international influence and military threats .
This theft is indeed the biggest theft ever witnessed by mankind in the history of the world .
(e) Your forces occupy our countries ; you spread your military bases throughout them ; you corrupt our lands , and you besiege our sanctities , to protect the security of the Jews and to ensure the continuity of your pillage of our treasures .
( f) You have starved the Muslims of Iraq , where children die every day .
It is a wonder that more than 1.5 million Iraqi children have died as a result of your sanctions , and you did not show concern .
Yet when 3000 of your people died , the entire world rises and has not yet sat down .
(g) You have supported the Jews in their idea that Jerusalem is their eternal capital , and agreed to move your embassy there .
With your help and under your protection , the Israelis are planning to destroy the Al - Aqsa mosque .
Under the protection of your weapons , Sharon entered the Al - Aqsa mosque , to pollute it as a preparation to capture and destroy it .
(2) These tragedies and calamities are only a few examples of your oppression and aggression against us .
It is commanded by our religion and intellect that the oppressed have a right to return the aggression .
Do not await anything from us but Jihad , resistance and revenge .
Is it in any way rational to expect that after America has attacked us for more than half a century , that we will then leave her to live in security and peace ?!!
(3) You may then dispute that all the above does not justify aggression against civilians , for crimes they did not commit and offenses in which they did not partake :
(a) This argument contradicts your continuous repetition that America is the land of freedom , and its leaders in this world .
Therefore , the American people are the ones who choose their government by way of their own free will ; a choice which stems from their agreement to its policies .
Thus the American people have chosen , consented to , and affirmed their support for the Israeli oppression of the Palestinians , the occupation and usurpation of their land , and its continuous killing , torture , punishment and expulsion of the Palestinians .
The American people have the ability and choice to refuse the policies of their Government and even to change it if they want .
( b) The American people are the ones who pay the taxes which fund the planes that bomb us in Afghanistan , the tanks that strike and destroy our homes in Palestine , the armies which occupy our lands in the Arabian Gulf , and the fleets which ensure the blockade of Iraq .
These tax dollars are given to Israel for it to continue to attack us and penetrate our lands .
So the American people are the ones who fund the attacks against us , and they are the ones who oversee the expenditure of these monies in the way they wish , through their elected candidates .
( c) Also the American army is part of the American people .
It is this very same people who are shamelessly helping the Jews fight against us .
(d) The American people are the ones who employ both their men and their women in the American Forces which attack us .
(e) This is why the American people cannot be not innocent of all the crimes committed by the Americans and Jews against us .
( f) Allah , the Almighty , legislated the permission and the option to take revenge .
Thus , if we are attacked , then we have the right to attack back .
Whoever has destroyed our villages and towns , then we have the right to destroy their villages and towns .
Whoever has stolen our wealth , then we have the right to destroy their economy .
And whoever has killed our civilians , then we have the right to kill theirs .
The American Government and press still refuses to answer the question :
Why did they attack us in New York and Washington ?
If Sharon is a man of peace in the eyes of Bush , then we are also men of peace !!!
America does not understand the language of manners and principles , so we are addressing it using the language it understands .
( Q2 ) As for the second question that we want to answer :
What are we calling you to , and what do we want from you ?
(1) The first thing that we are calling you to is Islam .
( a) The religion of the Unification of God ; of freedom from associating partners with Him , and rejection of this ; of complete love of Him , the Exalted ; of complete submission to His Laws ; and of the discarding of all the opinions , orders , theories and religions which contradict with the religion
He sent down to His Prophet Muhammad ( peace be upon him ) .
Islam is the religion of all the prophets , and makes no distinction between them - peace be upon them all .
It is to this religion that we call you ; the seal of all the previous religions .
It is the religion of Unification of God , sincerity , the best of manners , righteousness , mercy , honour , purity , and piety .
It is the religion of showing kindness to others , establishing justice between them , granting them their rights , and defending the oppressed and the persecuted .
It is the religion of enjoining the good and forbidding the evil with the hand , tongue and heart .
It is the religion of Jihad in the way of Allah so that Allah 's Word and religion reign Supreme .
And it is the religion of unity and agreement on the obedience to Allah , and total equality between all people , without regarding their colour , sex , or language .
( b) It is the religion whose book - the Quran - will remained preserved and unchanged , after the other Divine books and messages have been changed .
The Quran is the miracle until the Day of Judgment .
Allah has challenged anyone to bring a book like the Quran or even ten verses like it .
(2) The second thing we call you to , is to stop your oppression , lies , immorality and debauchery that has spread among you .
(a) We call you to be a people of manners , principles , honour , and purity ; to reject the immoral acts of fornication , homosexuality , intoxicants , gambling 's , and trading with interest .
We call you to all of this that you may be freed from that which you have become caught up in ; that you may be freed from the deceptive lies that you are a great nation , that your leaders spread amongst you to conceal from you the despicable state to which you have reached .
( b) It is saddening to tell you that you are the worst civilization witnessed by the history of mankind :
( i) You are the nation who , rather than ruling by the Shariah of Allah in its Constitution and Laws , choose to invent your own laws as you will and desire .
You separate religion from your policies , contradicting the pure nature which affirms Absolute Authority to the Lord and your Creator .
You flee from the embarrassing question posed to you :
How is it possible for Allah the Almighty to create
His creation , grant them power over all the creatures and land , grant them all the amenities of life , and then deny them that which they are most in need of : knowledge of the laws which govern their lives ?
( ii ) You are the nation that permits Usury , which has been forbidden by all the religions .
Yet you build your economy and investments on Usury .
As a result of this , in all its different forms and guises , the Jews have taken control of your economy , through which they have then taken control of your media , and now control all aspects of your life making you their servants and achieving their aims at your expense ; precisely what Benjamin Franklin warned you against .
( iii ) You are a nation that permits the production , trading and usage of intoxicants .
You also permit drugs , and only forbid the trade of them , even though your nation is the largest consumer of them .
( iv ) You are a nation that permits acts of immorality , and you consider them to be pillars of personal freedom .
You have continued to sink down this abyss from level to level until incest has spread amongst you , in the face of which neither your sense of honour nor your laws object .
Who can forget your President Clinton 's immoral acts committed in the official Oval office ?
After that you did not even bring him to account , other than that he ' made a mistake ' , after which everything passed with no punishment .
Is there a worse kind of event for which your name will go down in history and remembered by nations ?
( v) You are a nation that permits gambling in its all forms .
The companies practice this as well , resulting in the investments becoming active and the criminals becoming rich .
( vi ) You are a nation that exploits women like consumer products or advertising tools calling upon customers to purchase them .
You use women to serve passengers , visitors , and strangers to increase your profit margins .
You then rant that you support the liberation of women .
( vii ) You are a nation that practices the trade of sex in all its forms , directly and indirectly .
Giant corporations and establishments are established on this , under the name of art , entertainment , tourism and freedom , and other deceptive names you attribute to it .
( viii )
And because of all this , you have been described in history as a nation that spreads diseases that were unknown to man in the past .
Go ahead and boast to the nations of man , that you brought them AIDS as a Satanic American Invention .
( xi ) You have destroyed nature with your industrial waste and gases more than any other nation in history .
Despite this , you refuse to sign the Kyoto agreement so that you can secure the profit of your greedy companies and *industries .
( x ) Your law is the law of the rich and wealthy people , who hold sway in their political parties , and fund their election campaigns with their gifts .
Behind them stand the Jews , who control your policies , media and economy .
( xi ) That which you are singled out for in the history of mankind , is that you have used your force to destroy mankind more than any other nation in history ; not to defend principles and values , but to hasten to secure your interests and profits .
You who dropped a nuclear bomb on Japan , even though Japan was ready to negotiate an end to the war .
How many acts of oppression , tyranny and injustice have you carried out , O callers to freedom ?
( xii ) Let us not forget one of your major characteristics : your duality in both manners and values ; your hypocrisy in manners and principles .
All * manners , principles and values have two scales : one for you and one for the others .
( a) The freedom and democracy that you call to is for yourselves and for white race only ; as for the rest of the world , you impose upon them your monstrous , destructive policies and Governments , which you call the ' American friends ' .
Yet you prevent them from establishing democracies .
When the Islamic party in Algeria wanted to practice democracy and they won the election , you unleashed your agents in the Algerian army onto them , and to attack them with tanks and guns , to imprison them and torture them - a new lesson from the ' American book of democracy ' !!!
( b) Your policy on prohibiting and forcibly removing weapons of mass destruction to ensure world peace : it only applies to those countries which you do not permit to possess such weapons .
As for the countries you consent to , such as Israel , then they are allowed to keep and use such weapons to defend their security .
Anyone else who you suspect might be manufacturing or keeping these kinds of weapons , you call them criminals and you take military action against them .
( c) You are the last ones to respect the resolutions and policies of International Law , yet you claim to want to selectively punish anyone else who does the same .
Israel has for more than 50 years been pushing UN resolutions and rules against the wall with the full support of America .
( d) As for the war criminals which you censure and form criminal courts for - you shamelessly ask that your own are granted immunity !!
However , history will not forget the war crimes that you committed against the Muslims and the rest of the world ; those you have killed in Japan , Afghanistan , Somalia , Lebanon and Iraq will remain a shame that you will never be able to escape .
It will suffice to remind you of your latest war crimes in Afghanistan , in which densely populated innocent civilian villages were destroyed , bombs were dropped on mosques causing the roof of the mosque to come crashing down on the heads of the Muslims praying inside .
You are the ones who broke the agreement with the Mujahideen when they left Qunduz , bombing them in Jangi fort , and killing more than 1,000 of your prisoners through suffocation and thirst .
Allah alone knows how many people have died by torture at the hands of you and your agents .
Your planes remain in the Afghan skies , looking for anyone remotely suspicious .
( e) You have claimed to be the vanguards of Human Rights , and your Ministry of Foreign affairs issues annual reports containing statistics of those countries that violate any Human Rights .
However , all these things vanished when the Mujahideen hit you , and you then implemented the methods of the same documented governments that you used to curse .
In America , you captured thousands the Muslims and Arabs , took them into custody with neither reason , court trial , nor even disclosing their names .
You issued newer , harsher laws .
What happens in Guatanamo is a historical embarrassment to America and its values , and it screams into your faces - you hypocrites , " What is the value of your signature on any agreement or treaty ? "
(3) What we call you to thirdly is to take an honest stance with yourselves - and I doubt you will do so - to discover that you are a nation without principles or manners , and that the values and principles to you are something which you merely demand from others , not that which you yourself must adhere to .
(4) We also advise you to stop supporting Israel , and to end your support of the Indians in Kashmir , the Russians against the Chechens and to also cease supporting the Manila Government against the Muslims in Southern Philippines .
(5) We also advise you to pack your luggage and get out of our lands .
We desire for your goodness , guidance , and righteousness , so do not force us to send you back as cargo in coffins .
(6) Sixthly , we call upon you to end your support of the corrupt leaders in our countries .
Do not interfere in our politics and method of education .
Leave us alone , or else expect us in New York and Washington .
(7) We also call you to deal with us and interact with us on the basis of mutual interests and benefits , rather than the policies of sub dual , theft and occupation , and not to continue your policy of supporting the Jews because this will result in more disasters for you .
If you fail to respond to all these conditions , then prepare for fight with the Islamic Nation .
The Nation of Monotheism , that puts complete trust on Allah and fears none other than Him .
The Nation which is addressed by its Quran with the words : " Do you fear them ?
Allah has more right that you should fear Him if you are believers .
Fight against them so that Allah will punish them by your hands and disgrace them and give you victory over them and heal the breasts of believing people .
And remove the anger of their ( believers ' ) hearts .
Allah accepts the repentance of whom He wills .
Allah is All - Knowing , All - Wise . " [ Quran9:13 - 1 ]
The Nation of honour and respect :
" But honour , power and glory belong to Allah , and to His Messenger ( Muhammad - peace be upon him ) and to the believers . "
[ Quran 63:8 ]
" So do not become weak ( against your enemy ) , nor be sad , and you will be *superior ( in victory ) if you are indeed ( true ) believers " [ Quran 3:139 ]
The Nation of Martyrdom ; the Nation that desires death more than you desire life :
" Think not of those who are killed in the way of Allah as dead .
Nay , they are alive with their Lord , and they are being provided for .
They rejoice in what Allah has bestowed upon them from
His bounty and rejoice for the sake of those who have not yet joined them , but are left behind ( not yet martyred ) that on them no fear shall come , nor shall they grieve .
They rejoice in a grace and a bounty from Allah , and that Allah will not waste the reward of the believers . "
[ Quran 3:169-171 ]
The Nation of victory and success that Allah has promised :
" It is He Who has sent His Messenger ( Muhammad peace be upon him ) with guidance and the religion of truth ( Islam ) , to make it victorious over all other religions even though the Polytheists hate it . " [ Quran 61:9 ]
" Allah has decreed that ' Verily it is I and My Messengers who shall be victorious . '
Verily Allah is All - Powerful , All - Mighty . " [ Quran 58:21 ]
The Islamic Nation that was able to dismiss and destroy the previous evil Empires like yourself ; the Nation that rejects your attacks , wishes to remove your evils , and is prepared to fight you .
You are well aware that the Islamic Nation , from the very core of its soul , despises your haughtiness and arrogance .
If the Americans refuse to listen to our advice and the goodness , guidance and righteousness that we call them to , then be aware that you will lose this Crusade Bush began , just like the other previous Crusades in which you were humiliated by the hands of the Mujahideen , fleeing to your home in great silence and disgrace .
If the Americans do not respond , then their fate will be that of the Soviets who fled from Afghanistan to deal with their military defeat , political breakup , ideological downfall , and economic bankruptcy .
This is our message to the Americans , as an answer to theirs .
Do they now know why we fight them and over which form of ignorance , by the permission of Allah , we shall be victorious ?
A crazy Brazilian man named Freud is so afraid of being buried alive that he 's built himself a tomb nice enough to live in , complete with TV and food .
You know , just in case .
It also has built - in megaphones that would allow for him to call for help just in case his body raised from the dead in some sort of zombification ritual and he wanted to lure in some easy victims .
But it is n’t a conventional final resting place .
Inside the crypt , there ’s a TV , also a water pitcher and a fruit pantry .
Fresh outdoor air flows in through four vents from the chapel roof .
Within reach of the coffin are two makeshift megaphones — plastic cones attached to tubes running out through the wall .
One Saturday recently , Mr. de Melo lay in the coffin , shouting into the cones in a voice that echoed into the countryside .
" Help me !
Come quick !
I 've been buried alive ! "
It was only an equipment check — not an actual emergency .
Mr. de Melo , a resort operator and politician , built a burial vault he could survive in because he 's gripped by a rare condition called taphephobia , the fear of being buried alive .
" I have awful , awful nightmares of trying to dig myself out from underground , " says Mr. de Melo , whose physician father named him , presciently , for the pioneer of dream analysis .

I 'd say that in this day and age the chances of being buried alive are pretty slim , but hey , whatever helps you sleep at night .

After Jim Cramer implored his viewers to hound AIG employees last Thursday , he 's seen the error of his ways .
On last night 's show , before the news broke that AIG 's CEO Edward Liddy wrote Cramer a letter insisting that he apologize , Cramer sought to clarify his initial feelings on AIG 's staff .
Is the apology enough to sate AIG ?
They tell us they are pleased with Cramer 's apology .
Here 's the initial comments and the apology .
Let us know if you 'd feel alright with Cramer 's apology if you were an AIG employee .
Initial : " We should hound them in the supermarket , we should hound them in the ballpark , we should hound them everywhere they are .
We should make fun of them , and we should point fingers at them , and we should tell them that you have no shame . "
Pretty harsh , stuff , how does the apology stack up ?
Apology : “ Look , I want to clear something up .
Last week , I was talking about the old management at AIG and how they should be hounded .
It made it sound like I want to hound everybody at AIG .
No .
Thousands --- 99.9 percent of people who work at AIG are fabulous , including most of my neighbors .
It was the old guys who did this stuff .
That ’s who I ’m against .
I ’m sorry if I made it seem like it ’s everybody else .
No .
Everybody at AIG is good , except for the old board and the old CEO .
“ I like to say there ’s always a bull market somewhere .
I promise to try to find it just for you right here on ‘ Mad Money . ’
I ’m Jim Cramer .
See you back here tomorrow .
Sorry regular AIG guys .
I did not mean you . ”
GDP measures the value of all the goods and services
The US economy shrank at an annualised rate of 0.3 % between July and September , according to figures from the Commerce Department .
The gross domestic product ( GDP ) figures were better than expected , although they show the sharpest contraction of the economy since 2001 .
Consumer spending , which makes up two - thirds of the US economy , shrank by 3.1 % , the first contraction since 1991 .
The 0.3 % fall followed 2.8 % growth in the previous three - month period .
Company results
The growth data came on the same day that some of the US 's biggest companies reported their results for the July to September period : Broadcaster CBS made a loss of $ 12.46bn ( £ 7.59 bn ) in the quarter .
This included a write - down of $ 14.12 bn - worth of media assets
Electronics giant Motorola reported a loss of $ 397 m for the quarter , compared with a profit of $ 60 m a year ago , largely due to falling mobile phone sales
Paper and packaging company International Paper reported a 31 % fall in profits to $ 149 m and warned demand for its products had fallen
American Express , the credit card issuer , announced plans to cut 7,000 jobs as part of a plan to save $ 1.8 bn by the end of 2009
On the positive side , photographic company Eastman Kodak 's profits jumped to $ 96 m for the quarter , compared with a $ 37 m profit in the same three months last year
Personal care product maker Colgate - Palmolive reported profits of $ 499.9 m for the quarter , up 19 % on the same period last year Recession judgement The GDP figures showed that spending on non-durable goods , which are smaller purchases such as food and paper , dropped at its sharpest rate since 1950 .
The economic shrinkage means that the US economy is halfway to the standard definition of a recession , which is two consecutive quarters of negative growth .
But the official definition in the US is different , meaning that the US economy is never officially in recession until the National Bureau of Economic Research decides it is .
Nevertheless , the Federal Reserve is clearly concerned about the US economy and cut its key interest rate from 1.5 % to 1 % on Wednesday .
" Consumer spending is about 70 % of GDP and this looks like the lowest it has been in two decades , which goes to show that in the fourth quarter , we are going into recession , " said Bill Walsh , president of Hennion and Walsh in New Jersey .
The GDP figures were accompanied by Labor Department figures showing the number of new claims for jobless benefits last week .
There were 479,000 new claims in the week ending 25 October , which was the same number as the previous week , but still a high number , suggesting that the problems in the economy are feeding through to the job market .

' I did n't have time to be scared , ' says Britain 's bravest OAP who unmasked sledgehammer jewellery robber
The 84 - year - old man who foiled a jewellery raid by whipping off the mask of a sledgehammer - wielding hoodie has told how he thought the incident was a prank .
Have - a- go - hero William Grove stood up to the attackers while a crowd of shoppers stood by and watched .
As the two robbers smashed the jeweller 's window with sledgehammers , Mr Grove stepped out from the crowd and , proudly wearing a poppy on his lapel , walked up to the robbers as they pounded the reinforced windows .
Moment of truth : William Grove , 83 , rips away the would - be robber 's balaclava
He then grabbed one of them by the shoulder and pulled the balaclava from his face .
The pair were so alarmed that one of them had been unmasked that they fled to a waiting silver car and sped off .
Speaking to The Times today , Mr Grove said : " At first I thought it was a prank and that there were hidden cameras .
The sledgehammers were bright orange - but when I realised it was real I went over . "
The former RAF man added : " My plan was to carry out a move I had been taught in the Forcesand wait for others to help .
" I was going to grab his head and put my knee in the man 's back before grabbing him round the chest , holding him until the others intervened , " he told The Times .
The robbers were so shocked by Mr Grove 's intervention , right , that they fled
However , as Mr Grove tried to disable the man , he tore off his balaclava .
He added : " As soon as this happened I think they were both so taken by surprise at what I did that they just ran off .
" I did n't have time to be scared , it was all over in about two minutes . "
Then , with a modesty rarely seen these days , the 6ft 3in pensioner explained to police arriving at the scene that he could n't stop as he had to dash to an appointment .
With that , he handed them his business card , hopped on a bus and was gone .
Nick Thompson , a 35 - year - old IT technician who saw the pensioner single - handedly foil the raid from his office opposite the jeweller 's , said : ' I thought it was brilliant that someone in this day and age can still have the guts to take on someone much younger and bigger .
' Heroes like that do n't think twice about these things .
' There must have been about 40 or 50 people watching but he was the only who thought , " Hang on a minute , I 'm not putting up this " .
We were all amazed he had the guts to do it .'
Police , who believe the robbers may have got away with just one watch , are hunting two black men aged between 18 and 20 and the driver of the getaway car .
They have already interviewed Mr Grove , a former civil servant , who is said to have smiled to the crowd after his dramatic intervention on Thursday lunchtime at Ernest Jones in Richmond , South - West London .
' He gave this great little smile and then walked to catch his bus , ' said Mr Thompson .
' He must have known it was about to come and did n't want to miss it . '
Another witness , Ed Hardman , described the moment the robber was unmasked .
He said : ' The robber looked really confused and did n't know what to do , but yelled to his mates , put his hood up and ran off .
The old guy was a bit of a hero because no one else wanted to take on these two guys with huge sledgehammers . '
Mr Thompson 's brother Murray , who also witnessed the robbery , said : ' I 'm put to shame by what an 80 - year - old did . '
A police source said : ' His actions freaked them out and they just ran .
' It 's great that this man through his bravery managed to foil a robbery by himself and fortunately he does n't seem to have been injured . '
Ernest Jones said it would be rewarding Mr Grove , who uses a walking stick , with a Rolex watch as a thank you .
( See Correction & Amplification below . )
A decade ago , Leslie Collier , a 50 - year - old corn and soybean farmer in Charleston , Mo. , pleaded guilty to poisoning bald eagles .
He says the worst thing about his criminal record was that it meant he was barred by law from owning a gun .
So , after George W. Bush , a strong defender of the Second Amendment , took office , Mr. Collier wrote to the president seeking a pardon , saying he wanted to go hunting with his kids .
He explained that he accidentally killed the eagles while trying to poison coyotes that were attacking wild turkeys and deer on property he farms .
On the surface , the list of the 14 people pardoned by the president this week shows few common denominators in terms of time served , geographic location or even type of crime , except that the felonies were non-violent .
But a closer look at some of the newly pardoned shows many of them are church - going , blue - collar workers from rural areas ( and ardent Bush supporters ) who had little trouble finding jobs after their convictions .
There is another common thread : the important role firearms once played in their lives .
President Bush has pardoned fewer people -- 171 -- than any president since World War II , with the exception of his father , who pardoned 74 .
Presidents do n't discuss their reasons for issuing pardons , with few exceptions .
Nor do they tell petitioners why their wish was granted .
The Justice Department 's " pardon attorney , " who reviews hundreds of petitions a year and recommends candidates to the president , had no comment .
Each line is taken up by a single EBay Username , Password and EMail account .
Unfortunately , there are 5,534 of them and they 're spread across 121 pages .
Here 's a random screenshot of page 113 , each page containing roughly 46 usernames apiece : Click to EnlargeQuite a lot of the accounts do n't exist or are no longer registered users , but there 's enough live accounts in there for this to be something of a worry ( there also do n't appear to be any duplicates , which is unusual for a collection this big ) .
At first glance , it 's hard to say exactly where the data has come from or how new / old some of it is ( it 's apparently been passed around various file download sites over the past week or two ) , though a massive " roll - up " of stolen accounts from various Phishers seems most likely .
Most of the live accounts we saw look like this :
These would be newly registered users , or users with low feedback scores because they do n't tend to use EBay that much .
These are prime targets for Phishers , because they 're more likely to be fooled by fake logins .
Another worry is that many new / inexperienced users on EBay use the same login details for Paypal , so there 's the possibility of being able to access two sets of accounts from the same data .
I should mention , it 's not just new EBayers that can be caught out by these kinds of scams - there were quite a few high scoring EBayers in the stolen logins too .
A source tells me that hackers attempting to use these logins claim some have been " locked out " ( presumably logging in on an account from an unfamiliar IP address is triggering EBay Security checks ) though my source also tells me there are people bragging about there being " A lot of goodies " still in the list .
We 've notified EBay , and had the data removed from the web where possible ( a hat tip to Google for assisting in the removal of some cached data from their search engine ) .
Hopefully EBay will act quickly on the information they 've been provided and assist those unfortunate enough to have been Phished .
THE GODS OF GLOBALISM : THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS

The Constitution of the United States of America - Preamble
We the people of the United States , in order to form a more perfect union , establish justice , insure domestic tranquility , provide for the common defense , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity , do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America .
The Gods of Globalism will require a new Preamble .
Perhaps this one will do .
We the people of the Integrated Western Hemisphere , in order to form a more harmonized union , redefine justice , socially engineer domestic tranquility , redistribute wealth for the social good and higher purposes , encourage hemispheric welfare , and confiscate the blessings of liberty from our former selves to our new and more desired posterity , do abstain from any former sovereign constitutions and embrace a new social order under the guise of democracy .
I have been made aware of two pieces of legislation , thanks to the constant vigilance of the patriots at SOSUSA .US .
I send my most sincere thanks to them , for bringing it to my attention , so that I might bring it to yours .
This legislation has just confirmed the opinion I have long held that members of our congress have either lost their damn minds , are complete incompetents , or are intentionally complicit in the destruction of our national sovereignty .
Either way , I am tired of being the hog tied , blindfolded , gagged passenger in a vehicle driven by suicidal maniacs .
Yet another piece is being added to the framework , set in place for the demise of our national sovereignty .
I hope , by now , you have read my past article The Demise Of Our American Identity , which exposes and explains that a deeply embedded program is already in place to move our nation into a fully integrated Western Hemisphere .
This framework strives to harmonize our nation with international law through the United Nations , the Summit of the Americas , The Organization of American States ( OAS ) and the Inter - American System and has been moved progressively forward by way of NAFTA , the SPP and the soon to come NAU which will finally complete the permanent dissolution of our nation into a hemispheric conglomerate where all knees shall bend to the Gods of Globalism and a new social order shall reign supreme .
God help us all .
The following are just a few excerpts from one more piece of the integration puzzle .
As you are reading , what is obviously the bankrupting of our nation , think of the lives that have been lost for the cause of our liberty .
Think of the past generations who suffered and struggled to bring us to the comfort , security and national wealth we have all enjoyed and often taken for granted .
Think of our soldiers fighting and dying , even now , in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Then , think of your children and grandchildren .
Read the words that will enslave and impoverish them .
Our children will not be free as we have been .
They will never know the liberty we have known .
They will never know the prosperity that was possible for us , if we worked hard and studied and applied ourselves to our successful endeavors .
They will not be Americans , as we perceive America , unless this generation wakes up , pays attention and makes significant changes , quickly .
Time is short .
If you are waiting for someone else to rush in and save the day , stop waiting .
This is your country , your sovereignty , your freedom , you home , your family and your future .
This is your problem .
You must be a part of the solution or you have no one to blame but youself .
The move to Progressive socialism marches on and we are woefully behind is stamping it down .
To make changes , you must understand the plan .
Remember ; this is just ONE piece of the puzzle .

HOUSE VERSION
H.R.3692
( introduced 9/27/2007 )
Sponsor Rep Eliot Engel and thirty co-sponsors
Title :
To authorize the establishment of a Social Investment and Economic Development Fund for the Americas to provide assistance to reduce poverty , expand the middle class , and foster increased economic opportunity in the countries of the Western Hemisphere , and for other purposes .
Citizens of the United States of America , we can no longer entrust the sovereignty of this nation to most of those who are now in positions of power in our government .
Our best interests are not being served .
I pray that Americans will finally understand the consequences of our apathy or lack of understanding and will begin to step forward into the political arena and replace those disgraces that now hold our national sovereignty by the throat .
Until we see the truth and understand it , until we vote these scoundrels out of office and replace them with constitutionally directed candidates , we are on a collision course with disaster .
Our future leaders are out there somewhere , maybe even reading this now .
If so , I am asking that they step forward , trust in the citizen of this nation to see their value , and begin to bring our nation back towards a sound , sane foreign policy .

We can defeat this insanity and we must .
The very survival of our nation now depends on all of us .
Do all that you can to support candidates who will defend our constitution .
Send the rest of them back to the obscurity they so deserve .
They should hang their heads in shame for the disservice they have done this nation and our citizens .
Unfortunately ; I do n’t believe shame is a part of their DNA .
It is time for the awakening of our citizens .
Do your part .
Godspeed and God Bless the USA

High - Contrast black and white mobile -- Updated with 8 new shapes !
Black and white ( greyscale ) shapes : Color shapes : Outline only shapes : Star ( for hanging )
You 've probably read about the benefits of having high - contrast decor for your newborn , but might have been put off by the purchase price of some commercial products ...
Or maybe you just felt like making your own !
You can make a mobile with these shapes , or just cut them out and tack them to the wall or ceiling , or use them to make a collage for your baby to look at in the car ( glue shapes to cardboard or fabric , pin to seat in front of baby ) .
[ Actually , since you end up printing 4 of each individual shape and only use 3 for the simple mobile , you can do both the mobile and the car collage ! ] there are black & white and color versions .
Be warned : these take a lot of ink , so I also put up some that are just outlines of each shape .
You can print these out and color them yourself in whatever colors you like !
Materials needed :
Two copies each of desired shapes ( click at right for large , printable versions ) PDF versions : Black and white ( 311 K ) , Color ( 348 K ) , Outline ( 337 K )
Cardboard , either corrugated from a box , or brown from a cereal box ; or , if you want to get really fancy , foam board ( I used the sticky - sided kind for the mobile in the picture below )
For the simple version , you 'll need about two 8.5 x 11 " sheets ' worth of cardboard .
If you make the " involved " version , you will need about four sheets ' worth .
Or , you can print the shapes on cardstock -- this is sufficient in non -humid areas .
Glue : I like " Mod Podge " type products , as you can spread them really quickly with a foam brush .
Any white glue is fine , though ; double - sided tape would work well , too .
If you 're in a hurry , staples are fine !
Scissors , or craft knife and straightedge ( the latter is faster but more dangerous ! ) ; if you have some kind of paper cutter , that 's even faster for the square shapes .
Circular shapes are a little easier to cut with scissors .
Between 30 minutes and 3 hours ' time -- if you have a brush for glue and a paper cutter , it will go faster than if you are doing everything with scissors and simple white glue .
Staples are even faster !
Instructions :
Print out the shapes , two copies of each sheet , and one of the large star .
Lazy version :
Cut out one of each small shape and paste or staple it to cardboard , then cut the cardboard into the proper shape .
Using the other copy , fold the touching shapes together , then in half upwards , so that you have a t - shape .
Glue or staple the t- shape to the other side of the appropriate cardboard shape .
( Skip this step if using cardstock )
Tape a piece of thread to the top of each of the four shapes , or sew through the shape with needle and thread .
Glue or staple the large star shape to a piece of cardboad , and tape or sew thread to each corner , making a thread pyramid to hold this piece horizontal .
Tape or sew the smaller shapes ' threads to the corners of the big square ( the one with the star printed on it ) .
You could use all 12 if you wanted a really crowded mobile ... just use the simple shapes ( for a younger infant ) ... or the complex shapes or the character shapes ( for older infants ) .
Hang and enjoy !
More involved ( but prettier ) version , shown at right :
Cut out two of each small shape , and glue them to both sides of a piece of cardboard ( you may have to glue one on , cut the shape out , then glue on the other ) .
Cut out the other two of each small shape and repeat the above , but leave a pair of tabs at one edge .
Glue the tabs to one side of the other corresponding shape , making a t - shape that has full versions of each shape on each face .
Thread through the top of each one , and follow from step 5 above .
Hang above baby 's changing table or crib ( if s/ he has one ) .
This has amused Stephen since he was about 4 weeks old , and he 's now 13 weeks and still enjoys it .

Thank you all for your support , and happy trails !
When Berkeley resident Nancy Kates arrived at Oakland International Airport to board JetBlue flight 472 , she thought she was heading off on a routine journey to visit her mother in Boston .
Instead she ended up in a standoff with Transportation Safety Administration officials over her bra .
In the post - Sept. 11 world of heightened airport scrutiny , Kates , like most travelers , is familiar with the drill :
Take off shoes and belts , open the laptop , carry shampoo in 3 - ounce bottles .
For Kates , on Sunday , though , the security check got too invasive .
A big - busted woman wearing a large underwire bra , she set off the metal detector .
She was pulled aside and checked by a female TSA agent with a metal - sensitive wand .
" The woman touched my breast .
I said , ' You ca n't do that , ' " Kates said .
" She said , ' We have to pat you down . '
I said , ' You ca n't treat me as a criminal for wearing a bra . ' "
Kates asked to see a supervisor and then the supervisor 's supervisor .
He told her that underwire bras were the leading item that set off the metal detectors , Kates said .
If that 's the case , Kates said , the equipment must be overly sensitive .
And if the TSA is engaging in extra brassiere scrutiny , then other women are suffering similar humiliation , Kates thought .
The Constitution bars unreasonable searches and seizures , Kates reminded the TSA supervisor , and scrutinizing a woman 's brassiere is surely unreasonable , she said .
The supervisor told her she had the choice of submitting to a pat - down in a private room or not flying .
Kates offered a third alternative , to take off her bra and try again , which the TSA accepted .
" They tried to humiliate me and I was not going to be humiliated over this , " Kates said .
" If I was carrying nail clippers and forgot about them , I would n't have gotten so upset .
But here I was just wearing my underwear . "
So she went to the rest room , then through the security line a second time .
Walking through the airport braless can be embarrassing for a large - chested woman , not to mention uncomfortable .
The metal detector did n't beep on the second time through , but then officials decided to go through Kates ' carry - on luggage , she said .
The whole undertaking took 40 minutes , Kates said , and caused her to miss her flight .
JetBlue put her on another one , but she was four hours late getting to Boston .
" It 's actually a little funny in a way , but a sad , sad commentary on the state of our country , " Kates said .
" This is bigger than just me .
There are 150 million women in America , and this could happen to any of them . "
TSA spokesman Nico Melendez said Monday that he was n't familiar with the incident .
But he said in all circumstances , " we have to resolve an alarm . "
That 's the case for bras , artificial hips or anything with metal that sets off an alarm , he said .
" Unfortunately , we can't take a passenger 's word for it . "
Melendez said he did n't have any statistics on how many times passengers are screened because of bras .
But he said , " we do everything we can to ensure that a passenger does n't feel humiliated . "
Kates said she plans to talk to her family lawyer as well as the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Organization for Women and decide how to pursue the incident .
Barry Steinhardt , the director of the American Civil Liberties Union 's technology and liberty program , said Monday of federal security officials : " They can't find bombs in checked luggage , and they 're essentially doing a pat - down of private parts .
This is a security apparatus that is out of control . "
Kates said that although she flies about once a month , the only other time her bra has set off alarms in an airport was while she was being " wanded " in Cedar Rapids , Iowa .
When she explained to the security agent that the wand was picking up the metal in her bra , she said , that was the end of the matter and she was allowed to go on her way .
PHILADELPHIA --
Save the jokes , the taunts and all those insults about the losingest team in sports .
The Philadelphia Phillies just won themselves a World Series .
If that sounds strange , it was strange .
Nearly 50 hours after Game 5 started but was stopped by rain , Brad Lidge and the Phillies finished off the Tampa Bay Rays 4 - 3 in a three - inning sprint Wednesday night .
" It was a crazy way to win it with a suspended game , but we did and it's over , " 45 - year - old Phillies pitcher Jamie Moyer said .
" It has been a long wait , but it 's worth it . "
Left in limbo by a two - day storm , the Phillies seesawed to their first championship since 1980 .
Pedro Feliz singled home the go - ahead run in the seventh and Lidge closed out his perfect season to deliver the title Philly craved for so long .
Cheesesteaks , on the house .
" Who 's the world champion ? " manager Charlie Manuel asked the gleeful crowd during a 90 - minute postgame ceremony that lasted longer than Wednesday night 's action .
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said that President Bush talked to David Montgomery , the Phillies ' president , on Thursday morning .
She said he " offered his congratulations and said how exciting it must be for him , the team , and for all of the fans . "
Perino said that Bush also noted that Manuel had brought some of the players by the White House last year , and said he was " really impressed " by them .
She said Bush asked Montgomery " to give Charlie and the entire organization his best . "
Bundled in parkas and blankets , fans returned in force to Citizens Bank Park and saw the city claim its first major sports championship in 25 years .
No more references needed to those sad - sack Phillies teams in the past and their 10,000 - plus losses .
" They could taste it just as much as we could , " Series MVP Cole Hamels said .
It was among the wackiest endings in baseball history , a best - of - seven series turned into a best - of - 3 1/ 2 showdown when play resumed in the bottom of the sixth inning tied at 2 .
Nissan has announced the addition of a new Versa model to their 2009 lineup with pricing starting at $ 10,685 .
The Versa 1.6 Sedan , with its $ 3000 price advantage over the previous entry - level Versa 1.8 S , will effectively become the lowest - priced car in the United States , nearly $ 2000 less expensive than the current title - holding Chevrolet Aveo .
Equipped with a 107 - hp , 1.6 - liter inline - four engine and standard five - speed manual transmission , the new model will likely be a bit anemic .
However , due to its thrifty powertrain and what Nissan calls “ simplified content ” — or as we call it , “ el strippo trim ” — and subsequent lower weight , fuel economy is rated at 26 mpg city / 34 highway for the stick shift , with a 1 - mpg drop in highway performance if you opt for a four - speed automatic .
Considering the Versa ’s existing four - cylinder is capable of 27/33 mpg when equipped with the continuously variable transmission , it begs the question :
Why the new engine ?
Even so , the 1.6 ’s numbers are very respectable , especially for the cost .
Although the new model may come ill - equipped , we certainly can’t argue with value .
There ’s no word yet on a hatchback model , and while we suspect the sedan will remain the sole offering in the new 1.6 trim , we do n’t entirely discount the possibility of a five - door .
Nissan says the new model will be hitting showroom floors beginning November 18 , 2008 .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A lawsuit contending that thousands of people in India were exposed to polluted drinking water after the 1984 Union Carbide toxic - gas disaster in Bhopal was reinstated on Monday by a U.S. appeals court , which said a lower court improperly threw out the case .

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York sent the lawsuit back to a Manhattan federal court judge for further proceedings .
A three - judge panel of the appeals court found that the lower court had erred by granting the defendants ’ request for summary judgment in the case before giving the plaintiffs the opportunity to gain access to certain pretrial documents and other information they had sought .
A December 1984 gas leak at the Union Carbide Corp pesticide plant in central India -- the world ’s worst industrial disaster -- killed an estimated 3,800 people who inhaled toxic fumes , according to figures from the Indian government .
Many more have died from gas - related illnesses .
Union Carbide , now owned by Dow Chemical Co , paid $ 470 million in compensation in 1989 .
Union Carbide , along with former chief executive Warren Anderson , are defendants in the water pollution lawsuit .
The lawsuit was brought on behalf of people who lived or worked near the Bhopal plant who say they suffered ailments including cancer and neurological damage caused by contaminated groundwater .
The legal claims were first brought in 1999 after a study by environmental group Greenpeace found widespread water contamination in the area , said Richard Lewis , one of the lawyers for the plaintiffs .
“ We ’ve waited since 1999 to get our day in court and we look forward to proceeding , ” Lewis , of law firm Cohen Milstein Hausfeld & Toll , said on Monday .
Union Carbide said that the appeals court ruling was based on a procedural issue -- not the merits of the case -- and that it believed the claims would ultimately be dismissed .
“ The Second Circuit did not discuss the merits of the case or the merits of the trial judge ’s ruling of dismissal , and its decision should not be interpreted as a ruling on the merits , ” said Union Carbide spokesman Tomm Sprick .
He said the trial judge “ has consistently ruled to dismiss claims ” against the defendants as the issues have come before him .
In its ruling , the appeals court said the lower court judge , U.S. District Judge John Keenan , had erred by converting a motion to dismiss by the defendants into a motion for summary judgment -- which closed the case .
By doing that , “ we conclude that the district court did not give the plaintiffs sufficient notice to allow them adequately to respond to the converted summary judgment motion , ” the ruling said .
The lawsuit is seeking class - action status and unspecified monetary damages .
The plaintiffs contend there are potentially thousands of people in Bhopal who have suffered injuries linked to the polluted water .
The Raleigh News & Observer takes a look at one of those election quirks that could matter next week -- in North Carolina , straight ticket voters must also separately vote for president :
Unlike many states , a straight - party vote in North Carolina does not cast a vote for president .
A ballot expert says the split makes it more likely that voters , especially new voters , will leave their polling places failing , by mistake , to vote for president .
The split between presidential and straight - party votes has brought the state national attention this year because the margin between Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain is expected to be close , and North Carolina 's electoral votes would be a prize for either candidate .
An unusually high percentage of people in the state who voted in the past two national elections failed to mark a presidential selection .
In an analysis of election returns , Justin Moore , who received a graduate degree in computer science at Duke University , found that 3.15 percent of voters in North Carolina did n't vote for president in 2000 , and 2.57 percent did n't cast a presidential vote in 2004 .
Percentages higher than 1.1 percent -- the national , presidential - year average -- indicate a flawed ballot design or other problem , said Lawrence Norden , director of the Voting Technology Assessment Project at the Brennan Center at New York University 's law school .

Buffet Makes It Official : Even Goldman Sachs is Junk
Lots of press this afternoon on Warren Buffet 's investment in Goldman Sachs .
For $ 5 BN it looks like he will receive $ 5 BN face value in perpetual preferred with a 10 % coupon callable at 110 , plus 5 year warrants on another $ 5 BN worth of stock @ $ 115 / share ( which equates roughly to warrants on about 43.5 million shares @ $ 115 / share ) .
I am not an options guy , but if you take the take the implied volatility on Goldman 120 Jan-2011 calls and apply that out to 5 years ( which I realize is a generous leap of faith ) , it looks like the warrants are worth in the neighborhood of $ 50 - $ 55 / share depending on your assumptions ( options pros please correct me if I am way off here ) which means the 43.5 M in warrants are worth around $ 2.2BN to $ 2.4BN at issue .
That means that Buffet is really investing only about $ 2.8 to $ 2.6BN at a yield to maturity ( assuming 5 years ) of around 27 % to 29.5 % and that 's not even counting the 10 % preferred redemption premium .
With the 110 call on the preferred and the upfront warrant coverage , the YTMs are even higher if Goldman decides to call the preferred earlier .
Obviously , Buffet is getting a healthy discount because he's the ultimate in smart money , but still , when Goldman , the Gold standard in investment banks , is selling perpetual preferred at theoretical yields to maturity of 25 % + you have to wonder what the market rates really are for your average investment or commercial bank .
I assume the market will heartily applaud this deal , but I do n't know if I should be excited that Buffet thinks it is finally a good time to buy or scared to death that the best global franchise in investment banking has to raise money at interest rates that would make a sub - prime credit card issuer blush .

A friend told The Sunday Telegraph that the message of defiance was one he had already delivered in private to his senior staff .
There have even been reports that more than one of his aides last week began making inquiries about private sector jobs after the election , a clear signal that they expect to lose and a dramatic breach of etiquette in the dying days of a campaign .
UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon will demand that Israel pay Lebanon $ 1 billion in compensation over damages caused during the Jewish state 's 2006 war against Hizbullah , Lebanese media reported Saturday .
According to the report , the sum , based on World Bank appraisals , is aimed at covering the environmental and material damages caused by the Second Lebanon War , to neighboring countries as well .
The fundamental part of the compensation demanded is for the damage caused to the Lebanese coast due to an oil spill following an Israeli bombing of a southern Beirut power plant , which the Lebanese said had caused " an ecological disaster . "
According to the report , Ban plans to submit a report to the United Nations General Assembly at the end of the month , stating that damage Israel caused to the oil reservoir polluted Lebanon 's coast , and that the pollution spread to neighboring countries , especially Syria .
Ban further notes that the UN rehabilitation plan managed to clean some of the oil spill in several areas in northern Lebanon seashores .
The oil spill , which was defined the greatest natural disaster in Lebanon 's history , took place after Israel Air Force planes hit a power plant and caused some 110,000 oil barrels to leak into the Mediterranean Sea .
The report said that the UN wants Israel to compensate the countries harmed by the oil spill and restore the environmental situation along the Lebanon coast .
The Jewish state has yet to respond to the demand , despite messages conveyed in August 2007 .
About half a year ago , new agencies reported that the German government granted Lebanon 4.5 million euros ( about $ 6.4 million ) to help finance environmental projects and damage restoration activities following the war .
Lisa would flee .
( This was , in fact , Ms. Palin ’s response . )
In a conversation , you have to build your sentence phrase by phrase , monitoring the reaction of your listener , while aiming for relevance to the question .
That ’s what led Ms. Palin into word salad with Ms. Couric .
But when the questioner is 30 feet away on the floor and you ’re on a stage talking to a camera , which ca n’t interrupt or make faces , you can reel off a script without embarrassment .
The concerns raised by the Couric interviews  that Ms. Palin memorizes talking points rather than grasping issues  should not be allayed by her performance in the forgiving format of a debate .
The second myth about Ms. Palin is that her accent is contrived , or that it reveals laziness or ignorance on her part .
Certainly , Ms. Palin cranked the folksiness dial to 11 during the debate : she dropped more g’s , reverted to “ nucular ” after being teleprompted during the Republican National Convention to pronounce it “ new - clear , ” and salted her speech with cutesy near profanities like “ darn , ” “ heck ” and “ doggone . ”
But it would be unfair to question the authenticity of her accent or to use it as a measure of her intellect or sophistication .
The dialect is certainly for real .
Listeners who hear the Minnewegian sounds of the characters from “ Fargo ” when they listen to Ms. Palin are on to something : the Matanuska - Susitna Valley in Alaska , where she grew up , was settled by farmers from Minnesota during the Depression .
And no , “ nucular ” is not a sign of ignorance .
This reversal of vowel - like consonants ( nuk - l ’ - yer > nuk - y ’ - ler ) is common in the world ’s languages , and is no more illiterate than pronouncing “ iron ” the way most Americans do , as “ eye - yern ” instead of “ eye - ren . ”
Nor is Ms. Palin guilty of laziness in “ dropping g’s , ” because there is no such thing as “ dropping g’s . ”
The sounds at the end of “ nothing ” and “ nothin ’ ” are different consonants ( linguists call them “ eng ” and “ en ” ) , one produced with the tongue on the gum ridge , the other with the tongue on the soft palate .
We just spell the second one with two letters .
We all flip between “ eng ” and “ en ” in our speech , though lower - class speakers do it more , and everyone does it more when the conversation is more casual .
It ’s the output of an informality dial that all of us , regardless of accent , twiddle as we tune our speech to the circumstances .
Today it was once again possible to hear both serving officers of the armed forces and the newspeople who cover them speak of their belief that military and naval officers " serve the president . "
This time the mention was in connection with the " discovery " that Petraeus and Odierno have decided ( some time ago ) that they will not vote in the national election .
Odierno was taped saying that voting would be a bad idea because to do so would compromise his ability to " serve the president " whomever that might be .
It was actually a very old custom of the US Army that regular officers did not vote .
My father did not vote until he retired from the Army .
That custom has not been followed for a long time , but the reason that Odierno gave is not the reason that was contemplated in the past .
In days of old , it was understood that members of the armed forces served the constitution and through that instrument they served the federal union .
That is quite different .
The principle is simple .
The president is not sovereign .
He is the instrument of the constitution as are the members of the armed forces .
The president has no authority or right to order anyone in the armed forces to do anything that is unconstitutional or indeed illegal .
If he does , then he need not be obeyed and such an order is proof in itself of a " high crime . "
The present administration in Washington has done everything in its power to persuade that , in effect , the president IS sovereign .
This is a lie and a pernicious doctrine that , if accepted , would make us all the servants of a king or perhaps a queen .
I have had old army friends argue to me that they DO think of the president as king and that they must think thusly because how else would they know whom to obey .
I think it must be said that such ideas are unworthy in those to whom the constitution and the people have entrusted so much .

At first , Laurie could n't decide which kind of tea she wanted .
The camomile , which used to be her favorite for lazy evenings at home , now reminded her too much of Carl , who once said , in happier times , that he liked camomile .
But she felt she must now , at all costs , keep her mind off Carl .
His possessiveness was suffocating , and if she thought about him too much her asthma started acting up again .
So camomile was out of the question .
Meanwhile , Advance Sergeant Carl Harris , leader of the attack squadron now in orbit over Skylon 4 , had more important things to think about than the neuroses of an air - headed asthmatic bimbo named Laurie with whom he had spent one sweaty night over a year ago .
" A.S. Harris to Geostation 17 , " he said into his transgalactic communicator .
" Polar orbit established .
No sign of resistance so far ... "
But before he could sign off a bluish particle beam flashed out of nowhere and blasted a hole through his ship 's cargo bay .
The jolt from the direct hit sent him flying out of his seat and across the cockpit .
He bumped his head and died almost immediately , but not before he felt one last pang of regret for psychically brutalizing the one woman who had ever had feelings for him .
Soon afterwards , Earth stopped its pointless hostilities towards the peaceful farmers of Skylon 4 .
" Congress Passes Law Permanently Abolishing War and Space Travel . "
Laurie read in her newspaper one morning .
The news simultaneously excited her and bored her .
She stared out the window , dreaming of her youth -- when the days had passed unhurriedly and carefree , with no newspapers to read , no television to distract her from her sense of innocent wonder at all the beautiful things around her .
" Why must one lose one 's innocence to become a woman ? " she pondered wistfully .
Little did she know , but she has less than 10 seconds to live .
Thousands of miles above the city , the Anu'udrian mothership launched the first of its lithium fusion missiles .
The dim - witted wimpy peaceniks who pushed the Unilateral Aerospace Disarmament Treaty through Congress had left Earth a defenseless target for the hostile alien empires who were determined to destroy the human race .
Within two hours after the passage of the treaty the Anu'udrian ships were on course for Earth , carrying enough firepower to pulverize the entire planet .
With no one to stop them they swiftly initiated their diabolical plan .
The lithium fusion missile entered the atmosphere unimpeded .
The President , in his top- secret mobile submarine headquarters on the ocean floor off the coast of Guam , felt the inconceivably massive explosion which vaporized Laurie and 85 million other Americans .
The President slammed his fist on the conference table .
" We can't allow this !
I 'm going to veto that treaty !
Let 's blow 'em out of the sky ! "
This is absurd .
I refuse to continue this mockery of literature .
My writing partner is a violent , chauvinistic , semi-literate adolescent .
Yeah ?

Dr. David Schwartz , author of “ The Magic of Thinking Big ” contends that a key element of success is to follow a plan for liking people .
In the book , he talks of President Johnson ’s ten - point formula for success .
Here are those points for your review .
Ask yourself after reading each one :
How can I better practice this idea in my daily life ?
Learn to remember names .
Inefficiency at this point may indicate that your interest is not sufficiently outgoing .
Be a comfortable person so there is no strain in being with you .
Be an old - shoe kind of individual .
Acquire the quality of relaxed easy - going so that things do not ruffle you .
Do n’t be egotistical .
Guard against the impression that you know it all .
Cultivate the quality of being interesting so people will get something of value from their association with you .
Study to get the “ scratchy ” elements out of your personality , even those of which you may be unconscious .
Sincerely attempt to heal , on an honest basis , every mis-understanding you have had or now have .
Drain off your grievances .
Practice liking people until you learn to do so genuinely .
Never miss an opportunity to say a word of congratulation upon anyone ’s achievement , or express sympathy in sorrow or disappointment .
Give spiritual strength to people , and they will give genuine affection to you .
Which of these principles could you use the most help with improving ?
A - HA !
As I said yesterday , our courageous right - wing has uncovered conclusive evidence proving that our current trouble is the fault of the Darkies and the Joos .
I also pointed out how it's also obviously the fault of the Homos — but that we just did n't know yet exactly how they did it .
Well , now we do !

It may be a truism that little things mean a lot ,  but in the world of spam , flipping a single switch can have huge consequences that span the globe .
We saw that concept reinforced this past week when McColo Corp. , an Internet hosting firm based in San Jose , Calif. , had its Internet connection shut off by its upstream connectivity providers on suspicion that McColo was serving as a command and control center for various spamming bot net operations as well as a base of operations for various other unsavory activities .
Of course everyone , even McColo , is innocent until proven guilty .
But in the days following the disconnection , global spam volumes have reportedly dropped by nearly two - thirds .
I suppose it could be a coincidence ...
While many in the anti-spam world had been talking about McColo for a while as a source of problems , what seems to have brought the situation to a head was public attention in a series of articles by Washington Post writer Brian Krebs .
Until Krebs began turning over the rocks at McColo and spotlighted the awful things he found , McColo had apparently managed to string along its upstream providers into keeping its connection .
While many have praised McColos upstream providers , Global Crossing and Hurricane Electric , for taking the action they did to disconnect the source of so many problems , many have questioned why it took so long to act .
Those folks point cynically to the timing , blaming the providers for being happy to take McColos money until the heat became too much .
While I understand that frustration , in my experience such an interpretation is overly simplistic .
In full disclosure , I should note that I have been a customer of Hurricane Electric .
I dont have any special relationship with them other than having paid their standard rate for hosting services .
I also dont have any special knowledge of their decision - making in this case .
However , I have some idea of the way they made their decision from my years of working with ISPs and hosting companies .
While it may seem satisfyingly self - righteous to say they were just in it for the money ,  I can tell you that financial upside from hosting spammers and other neer - do - wells is usually far less than the costs of cleaning up their messes and rebuilding the reputation of your network space .
So why do hosting companies so often seem to tolerate spammers ?
First , once you graduate to the size ranks of companies like Global Crossing and Hurricane Electric , its nearly impossible to police every one of the thousands of customers occupying your network space .
The infrastructure for monitoring their activities , even if you had a legal right to do so , would be prohibitively expensive and unwieldy .
Thus most hosting companies have to rely upon those who are being harmed by bad behavior to call their attention to it .
Second , like most business relationships , the relationship between a hosting provider and its customer is usually built around a number of critical legal terms and conditions .
Those legal agreements help to set the ground rules for the relationship and form a foundation upon which both of the parties can rely in order to make important business decisions .
In a hosting and reselling environment , the reliance upon connectivity agreements is all the more important because many more companies on the downstream side may be relying upon that upstream connection in order to stay in business .
Cancelling an agreement is seldom undertaken lightly , and with all of the attendant legal liabilities of erroneously shutting down a companys connectivity , many companies will wisely require a significant amount of evidence before theyll invoke termination clauses instantly , without notice , or without giving their customer time to cure their problematic behavior .
This is particularly important because , in a world full of deceptive and fraudulent behavior , it can be difficult for even the most battle - tested spam investigators to suss out whos to blame and whos been framed .
For these reasons , I have seldom joined my colleagues in the anti-spam community in demanding that various companies be shut down upon the first hints of bad behavior .
Even setting aside the legal issues , there are far too many instances in which supposedly iron - clad evidence of spamming turns out to be a lot more complicated and fuzzy .
I can certainly empathize with the sentiment of unplug first and ask questions later ,  but the number of occasions in which that is the appropriate response are far fewer than you might think .
But when the system works , the rumors will lead to complaints , which will lead to actionable evidence , which will lead to spammers sucking dead cable .
That chain is why its so critically important that folks who are fighting spamming , phishing , and other illegal activities , continue to be vigilant and diligent in their evidence gathering .
Sometimes all you have is circumstantial evidence , but with enough of it , even the most risk - averse ISP lawyer will sign - off on pulling the plug .
If the McColo case proves anything , its that sufficient evidence , even if circumstantial , can be used  by reporters or others  to point a spotlight on chronic problems .
When that evidence is presented to those who are in a position to actually see whats going on , it can sometimes even result in swift action with far reaching consequences .
The McColo case tells us that the system , as kludgy and halting as it may sometimes be , does indeed work .
At least until the bad guys find a new rock to crawl under .
Sarah Palin : ' I always wanted a son called Zamboni '
As Alaskan governor , its should come as no surprise that Sarah Palin has a particular fondness for all things ice hockey - related .
And with boys already called Trig and Track , the Republican ’s vice - presidential candidate has certainly shown she is n't shy of giving her children unusual names .
But even by her standards , naming a child ' Zamboni ' - after the machine that makes the ice smooth during hockey matches - is perhaps taking things a little too far .
Room for a Zamboni ?
Sarah Palin ( C ) surrounded by her family members .
From L - R back row : son Track and husband Todd , second row : daughter Willow , Governor Sarah Palin , daughter Bristol , at front daughter Piper .
Palin has suggested that Zamboni might be a good name for a future child
Palin was quizzed about future names for children during a wide - ranging interview with People magazine in the US .
When asked whether she and her husband had any more unusual names up their sleeves , the politician said : ‘ We did .
We never got to get our Zamboni in .
I always wanted a son named Zamboni . ’
Her husband Todd , however , seemed less than impressed with the suggestion .
‘ I do n't think that would have flied , ’ he said .
Luckily , the possibility of Palin inflicting the bizarre name on any future offspring seems unlikely as she also admitted that her current brood of five is enough .
Zamboni is the brand name for the large machines that smooth and condition the ice during ice hockey games .
A Zamboni machine smooths the ice during an ice hockey match
Palin ’s five children all have unusual names .
A dedicated runner , she named her 18 - year - old son Track because he was born during the athletics season .
Her eldest daughter , Bristol , was named after Bristol Bay , the area where the Palin clan goes fishing .
The youngest of the clan is four - month - old Trig Paxson , whose first name is Norse for ' true ' or ' strength ' .
Paxson is one of his mother 's favourite spots in Alaska .
Her other daughters Willow , 14 , and Piper , 7 , also believed to be named after places in her home region .
Experts have said the offbeat names suggest Palin wants to give her children an edge in life .
' A lot of times when parents choose unusual names they 're looking to make their children stand out above the crowd , ' said Albert Mehrabian , a professor emeritus of psychology at UCLA .
‘ Short names like these are given by people who want their kids to be masculine .
She 's athletic , she 's coached kids , so maybe that 's part of her value system . ’
It is unclear what message naming a child Zamboni might give .
As it turned out , the power of the president soared to new heights under Bush .
Many of the administration ’s most aggressive moves came in the realm of national security and the war on terror in particular .
The Bush administration claimed the authority to deny captured combatants — U.S. citizens and aliens alike — such basic due - process rights as access to a lawyer .
It created a detention facility on Guantánamo Bay that it declared was outside the jurisdiction of the federal courts and built a new legal system — without any input from Congress — to try enemy combatants .
And it argued that the president ’s commander - in - chief powers gave him the authority to violate America ’s laws and treaties , including the Geneva Conventions .
The assertion and expansion of presidential power is arguably the defining feature of the Bush years .
Come January , the current administration will pass on to its successor a vast infrastructure for electronic surveillance , secret sites for detention and interrogation and a sheaf of legal opinions empowering the executive to do whatever he feels necessary to protect the country .
The new administration will also be the beneficiary of Congress ’s recent history of complacency , which amounts to a tacit acceptance of the Bush administration ’s expansive views of executive authority .
For that matter , thanks to the recent economic bailout , Bush ’s successor will inherit control over much of the banking industry .
“ The next president will enter office as the most powerful president who has ever sat in the White House , ” Jack Balkin , a constitutional law professor at Yale and an influential legal blogger , told me a few weeks ago .
And yet the issue of executive authority scarcely reared its head in the presidential campaign .
It was n’t addressed directly in any of the debates , and aside from a Boston Globe questionnaire on executive authority given to all of the primary candidates in December of last year , neither Obama nor McCain had much to say on the stump or in interviews about the power of the office he aspired to occupy .
“ Ambition must be made to counteract ambition , ” James Madison wrote , meaning that America ’s divided system of government would depend on both the president and Congress forcefully pursuing their respective roles — and in so doing , acting as a natural check on each other .
Why did that fail to happen during the Bush years , and will a new president and newly elected Congress act to undo the excesses of presidential power over the past eight years ?
Senator Lindsey Graham , the baby - faced South Carolina Republican who first stepped onto the national stage as a House manager of Clinton ’s impeachment trial , has not been an easy figure to pin down in the struggle over presidential power .
At times , he was one of the Bush administration ’s most reliable allies in the Senate , notably when it came to the executive branch ’s assertion that it could block enemy combatants from challenging their detentions in federal court .
In the fall of 2005 , days after the Supreme Court agreed to hear a Guantánamo detainee ’s lawsuit against President Bush , Graham came to the administration ’s rescue with a bill devised to kick the case off the court ’s docket and to make all pending and future detainee challenges illegal .
( The bill passed , but the justices nevertheless refused to dismiss the case , Hamdan v. Rumsfeld . )
But Graham , a former Air Force lawyer , was also one of a handful of Republican senators who resisted the executive branch ’s claim that the president could authorize coercive interrogations of detainees .
He memorably accused Alberto Gonzales , then the nominee for attorney general , of “ playing cute with the law ” in order to justify that claim and was a member of the triumvirate of so - called Republican mavericks — along with Senators John McCain and John Warner — who drafted a bill aimed at preventing the torture of enemy combatants .
“ The Bush administration came up with a pretty aggressive , bordering on bizarre , theory of inherent authority that had no boundaries , ” Graham told me one day last summer in his Senate office .
“ As they saw it , the other two branches of government were basically neutered in the time of war . ”
Google has admitted using forbidden APIs to get its iPhone application working , but despite that admission the application remains available on iTunes in apparent breach of the store rules .
Apple provides documentation on the APIs ( Application Programming Interfaces ) that developers are allowed to use , and restricts access to others for reasons they are under no obligation to reveal .
The specific API used by Google Mobile Search gives access to the proximity sensor that the app uses to detect when the handset is lifted against the face - and thus when it should start recognising speech .
Illegitimate use of the API was suspected by other developers , and was confirmed to C - Net yesterday .
Officially such applications should n't be allowed in the iTunes store , but it seems the rules do n't apply to everyone as Google Mobile Search remains available .
Apple has already been pretty arbitrary about how it applies the rules on listing applications - such as blocking MailWrangler on the grounds that it would confuse users , then allowing BdEmailer , apparently because the latter application is a write - only email app and therefore wo n't confuse anyone .
Other applications have been removed on even more indiscernible grounds , such as featuring a picture of a knife .
But while those rules have been arbitrary and largely unknown , they have so far been applied equally to all - even Google was forced to wait while its app went through the approval process .
Now , however , it seems that if you 're Google then not all the rules apply to you . ®

PSPGen is reporting that some good stuff is coming in the next big PSP update .
Please keep in mind that this is based on the firmware for PSP test units , so nothing is concrete and this is considered a rumor .
There will be PSN integration , text support for RSS feeds , and a snapshot feature .
This is not concrete by any means and I would like to advise you against placing your hopes in this .
Sony has confirmed that the PS Store will be coming to the PSP this Fall , so complete integration with PSN would not be too far fetched .
The ability to have text feeds will allow you to keep up to date with your favorite PlayStation site , and the snapshot feature would be appreciated , I know I want to save my portable game experiences .
Have your grains of salt ready , this could end up being completely incorrect and we know what happens when our hopes are dashed .
A lot of moaning . 😉
Looking to improve your romantic odds ?
Get your date a steaming cup of coffee .
That ’s the implication of a new study by researchers who wanted to see if there was any connection between physical and emotional heat .
To their surprise , they found that people who held a cup of hot coffee for 10 to 25 seconds warmed to a perfect stranger .
Holding a cup of iced coffee had the opposite effect .
If you want to make a good impression , advised study author Lawrence E. Williams , a University of Colorado at Boulder assistant professor of marketing , a fresh cup of coffee “ may bias the situation in your favor . ”

The study , to be published today in the journal Science , is the latest to show how physical properties such as distance or temperature can unconsciously influence emotional reactions .
In a previous experiment , for example , people who were asked to plot remote points on a graph expressed distant feelings about relatives afterward .
“ Our mental processes are not separate and detached from the body , ” said John A. Bargh , a Yale University psychologist and co-author of the current study .
The findings raise the potential for manipulation beyond matters of the heart .
Williams said it was not hard to envision marketers using warm cookies to make connections with customers -- and prime them to buy .
By the same token , Bargh said , shoppers who want to resist pushy salespeople could improve their chances by carrying an icy can of soda in a pocket .

But when it comes to personal relationships , researchers said , a hot beverage can’t always overcome awkward habits and distasteful traits .
“ If I had a nice , warm cup of coffee with Adolf Hitler , I ’m still not going to like him , ” Bargh said .
In the latest study , a lab worker asked each of 41 subjects to hold a cup of warm or iced coffee .
They were then asked to rate the personality of an unidentified person whom researchers described as “ skillful , industrious , determined , practical and cautious . ”
People who had held the warm coffee gave the stranger an average score of 4.7 on a seven - point scale , better than the average score of 4.3 from people who had held the iced coffee .

In a second experiment , a lab worker asked 53 participants to evaluate either a heated or a frozen therapeutic pad .
After completing that task , the subjects were told they could choose as a reward either a cold drink or an ice cream that they could either keep for themselves or share with someone else .
Of the people who had handled the hot pad , 54 % chose a reward to share with a friend , and 46 % picked a reward for themselves .
Among those who had touched the cold pad , 25 % selected a reward meant for sharing , and 75 % chose an item for themselves .
“ Physical warmth can make us see others as warmer people but can also cause us to be warmer -- more generous and trusting -- as well , ” Bargh said .
Researchers postulated that the association between temperature and emotional warmth begins in infancy , when the physical warmth of being held is connected to food , safety and love .
Later in life , a hot cup of coffee or a warm bath might activate memories of those feelings , they said .

But Piotr Winkielman , a psychology professor at UC San Diego , questioned whether the experiment actually tapped an emotional pool .
Only a brain scan would reveal that , he said .
“ Is there emotion involved ?
Or is it just a thought floating in their heads ? ” he asked .

Sometimes , words do n’t even come close .
Sometimes photos do n’t do the trick .
Sometimes , like when dealing with something as delicious as this ice cream , there is no proper justice .
But I will try .
fresh , crisp Greenmarket carrots ( $ 3/big bag )
It started with this big ‘ ol bag of carrots .
Last week I got a load of tomatoes at the Greenmarket .
This Saturday , I made off like a happy wabbit .
My snacking binges have gotten a little out of hand lately , so I thought these easy munchables would provide some buffer between me and the office vending machine .
Only , the workweek had n’t even started by the time I decided to turn the healthy veggies into minions of one of my most decadent desserts .
carrots zip through a grater
brown sugar adds a little density to the flavor ’s sweetness
This recipe came out of one of those , I wish someone would do that moments .
Make an ice cream fashioned after carrot cake , with chunks of chopped nuts and plump raisins , and top it with a sauce fashioned after cream cheese frosting .
Why not ?
Unlike so many of these moments , this one had been followed by action .
shredded carrot and raisins cook in cream until soft
These knobby , cute little carrots were so juicy and bright after shredding that they immediately seeped into the milk and cream even before it was heated .
To soften them to that familiar stage we ’re used to seeing in carrot cake , I let them simmer for about half an hour with the milk mixture , along with the raisins .
By the time the ice cream was done , I think most of the smaller shreds completely blended in as mush ; and the raisins had grown to fat , full balloons that were just breaking apart in the churning process .
Only the pecan bits , tossed in at the last few churns , retained their original shape , and add a nice crunch to the cream .
Maybe ice cream is n’t one of the most decadent desserts on the planet , but this one sure tasted up there .
Something about the way the warm spices of cinnamon , nutmeg and ginger mix with velvety dairy is intoxicatingly good .
I could smell it even while beating the spices up with the sugar and egg yolks , a haunting portent of an endless snacking session to come .
sometimes you feel like a nutmeg
I ’ve been watching the Olympics a lot lately , like many of you may have been , too .
Gymnastics are my favorite .
I find great satisfaction in seeing someone complete exactly what they know they ’re capable of doing , all in one routine .
The thought came over me while I was digging into this carton of ice cream and watching the Games , that here is one instance when everything I know about ice cream making came together perfectly .
Beautifully .
From letting the custard heat just long enough that it coated the back of a metal spoon , to not letting the ice cream churn too long , so that it turned slightly buttery , but taking it out right at that soft , almost soupy stage and letting it ripen to the right texture in the freezer ( which was so not intuitive the first few times I made ice cream ) .
I ’d give the consistency of this ice cream ’s base a perfect ten .
( Although I took too long setting up the photo so it melted too much in the photo at top . )
After all , the Olympic ice cream making scoring system can still use perfect tens in my dream world .
The only hurdle next is not eating so much that my stomach turns to complete flab .
Nastia has great abs .
You can see them through her leotard , that ’s how great they are .
a perfect finish
Carrot Cake Ice Cream
( makes about 1 quart )
2 cups whole or 2 % milk
1 cup heavy cream
5 egg yolks
1/3 cup white sugar
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup packed shredded carrots
1/4 cup raisins
1/4 cup chopped walnuts or pecans
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon ground ginger
In a small bowl , beat the egg yolks with the sugars and spices until fluffy and the lighter in color .
Set aside .
Combine the milk , cream , carrots and raisins in a medium saucepan .
Bring mixture just to a boil , then reduce heat to very low .
Let simmer , stirring occasionally , for 25 minutes .
( Do not let boil . )
While beating the egg yolk mixture , pour in a small spoonful of the hot milk mixture and continue to beat .
Repeat process with a larger spoonful , while beating , then repeat again , and again .
( This will temper the eggs , so that they do n’t cook lumpy . )
Next , scoop all the egg yolk mixture into the hot milk mixture .
Return heat to medium - low .
Cook about 8 - 10 minutes longer , stirring frequently with a spatula to scrape all corners of the bottom of the pot .
Do not let boil .
The custard should be just thick enough to coat the back of a spoon , but have no lumps .
Let custard cool completely , then transfer to an airtight container and completely chill in the refrigerator at least 2 hours .
Follow your machine ’s instructions for churning length .
Add the chopped nuts in the last minute of the churning process .
Transfer ice cream to an airtight container and freeze for 2 hours to “ ripen . ”
Serve with the cream cheese sauce ( recipe below ) .
Cream Cheese Sauce
( makes about 4 servings )
1/4 cup cream cheese
1 tablespoon milk
2 tablespoons confectioner ’s sugar
1/8 teaspoon vanilla
Beat all ingredients together in a bowl until smooth in consistency .
Cost Calculator

2 cups plus 1 tablespoon milk ( at $ 4.50 / half gallon ) : $ 0.75
1 cup heavy cream : $ 1.29
5 egg yolks ( at $ 3/dozen ) : $ 0.63
1/2 cup shredded carrots ( at $ 3/big bag ) : $ 0.20

Health Factor
Seven brownie points :
For all my bellyaching about binge ice cream eating , I must say there are some redeeming qualities about this one .
Not that it ’s ever good to go overboard , but there have been worse ice creams to do so with .
Although I followed the rules toward making a decidedly rich , creamy base with the amount of egg yolks used , I thought it would be somewhat necessary given juices from carrot blending into it .
But those juices add a bit of Vitamin A , and the raisins , a tiny dose of immune - building antioxidants .
Of course where milk is concerned there ’s plenty of calcium .
But ice cream is also where plenty of sugar and cholesterol is concerned .
Green Factor
Five maple leaves :
The Greenmarket gets the win for the carrots .
But for much of the other ingredients , it ’s a tie .
I had to run out and grab some more eggs , along with cream , so I was able to get cage - free eggs but only generic cream .
As for raisins , it seems like they ’re only made in California .
I could be wrong , but manufacturers certainly like to advertise them as such .
How can I get tickets to one of the Presidential Inaugural events ?
Tickets for Inaugural Events can be obtained through your Congressional representatives .
Allocations are decided by each representative , and you can request them through their Congressional offices .
Tickets are limited , and lottery systems are often used to distribute tickets to constituencies .
In addition to this , tickets will become available through secondary ticket sources as well .
Do I need tickets to watch the Inaugural Parade ?
No .
Tickets are not required to attend the incoming Presidents historical Inaugural parade .
However , there will be several ticketed areas that will be restricted to ticket holders only .
What is a sanctioned Inaugural Gala Ball ?
What is an un-sanctioned Presidential Inaugural Ball ?
Presidential Inaugural Gala Balls are split into two categories - sanctioned and un-sanctioned .
At a sanctioned ball , the new President is guaranteed to make an appearance .
No so in the un-sanctioned balls - while it is not unprecedented , the President is not expected to attend .
How much do tickets cost ?
While ticket to the Inaugural Balls vary in price , the tickets to the Swearing In Ceremony and Inaugural Parade may be abtained from your Congressional Representatives at little to no cost .
If you are unable to obtain them this way , there are other options to purchase tickets so you may attend one of these historic events .
Flat tire , stuck in the mud , or just want to lift your car up ?
This jack is perfect for you .
No worries of placing the jack on the frame correctly , or if you can get a jack under it at all .
By attaching the 15 - ft hose to your tailpipe , you can lift your vehicle with ease through the power of its own exhaust .
Great for changing flats , recovering from mud , sand , snow , or whatever else you may be off - roading in .
Works with vehicles , trailer , campers and ATVs .
As though recoiling from her own memories , Khalida shrank deeper into her faded armchair with each sentence she told : of how gunmen apparently working for Iraq 's Interior Ministry kidnapped her , beat and raped her ; of how they discarded her on a Baghdad sidewalk .
But her suffering did not end when she fled Iraq and became a refugee in Jordan 's capital , Amman .
When Khalida 's husband learned that she had been raped , he abandoned her and their two young sons .
Rumors spread fast in Amman ; soon , everyone on her block knew that she was without a man in the house .
Last month , her Jordanian neighbor barged into her apartment and attempted to rape her .
Khalida never reported the incident .
Like tens of thousands of Iraqi refugees in Jordan , she does not have a permit to live or work here , and she is afraid that if she turns to authorities for help she will get deported .
So instead of seeking punishment for her assailant , she latched the flimsy metal door of her apartment and stopped going outside .
Her story sheds light on a problem that is little researched , poorly understood , and largely ignored : Iraqi rape victims who now live in Jordan illegally and without protection .
Sexual assault is heavily stigmatized in the Middle East , and victims are often afraid to talk about it to anyone , fearing that their families will abandon them .
And their shaky status in Jordan leaves them afraid to seek help and vulnerable to new assaults and abuse .
They fear persecution by Jordanian immigration authorities almost as much as they fear returning to Iraq .
" The lack of legal status does lead to these sorts of protection issues [ and ] puts them in very exploitative situations , " says Imran Riza , who heads the mission in Jordan of the United Nations ' High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , the main international agency that assists Iraqis in Jordan .
Women like Khalida , he says , " are certainly vulnerable , and much more vulnerable than others . "
Rape is a common weapon of any war ; no one knows how many Iraqi women have been raped since the war began in 2003 .
Most crimes against women " are not reported because of stigma , fear of retaliation , or lack of confidence in the police , " MADRE , an international women 's rights group , wrote in its 2007 report about violence against women in Iraq .
Some women , like Khalida , are raped by Iraqi security forces .
A 2005 report published by the Iraqi National Association for Human Rights found that women held in Interior Ministry detention centers endure " systematic rape by the investigators . "
A handful of organizations are working to help rape victims in Iraq .
MADRE , together with the Organization of Women 's Freedom in Iraq , operates several shelters and safe houses in Baghdad for Iraqi rape victims , where the women have access to healthcare and counseling .
But militias often target women 's rights advocates in Iraq , so these facilities are " a clandestine network , " operated by " mostly somebody who at a great risk to themselves has opened a room for these victims , " says Yifat Susskind , MADRE 's communications director .
The shelters have helped several thousand Iraqi women since 2003 .
Most rape victims learn about the shelters from other women .
Documenting sexual assault in Iraq by international researchers remains complicated because of widespread violence .
" There 's been a security issue , so we have n't been able to get people on the ground to look at the issue for a long time , " says Marianne Mollmann , who leads women 's rights advocacy at the New York - based Human Rights Watch , which published its last report about rape in Iraq in 2003 .
Similarly , no one has tried to estimate how many Iraqi refugees have been raped while in Iraq or in Jordan , says Mohamad Habashneh , a Jordanian psychiatrist who works with Iraqi rape victims .
Mr. Habashneh has treated approximately 40 Iraqi rape victims for clinical depression and post - traumatic stress disorder .
But he estimates that they are just a fraction of Iraqi refugees who had been raped .
Psychiatrists like Habashneh charge between $ 25 and $ 40 per visit , too expensive for most Iraqi refugees , who , like Khalida , live hand - to - mouth on monthly handouts of about $ 100 from international agencies .
Many victims are afraid to go outside or travel to a clinic out of fear of being detained by Jordanian authorities .
To help these women , women 's rights organizations in Jordan must coordinate with larger agencies , such as UNHCR , to provide care and programs that would help the victims earn money " because rape survivors are alienated from their family and therefore have no way to sustain themselves , " Ms. Susskind says .
But so far , these resources are not available for most Iraqi rape victims in Jordan .
There are no support groups , no counselors , no hot lines , an no one to soothe Khalida when she has flashbacks that make her relive the day when assailants dressed in police uniforms arrived at the Oil Ministry where she worked and said they were taking her in for questioning .
She did not tell her husband that she had been raped but he figured it out .
Now , Khalida does not blame him for going away , or for leaving her so vulnerable to men who wish to prey on her .
" I have his phone number , " she says , sobbing quietly .
" I dial it sometimes for the kids to talk to their father .
Sometimes , because I love him , I like to hear his voice .
But when I say ' hello ' he hangs up . "
Nanoparticles emitted by common kitchen appliances are more abundant than previously thought , leading for an urgent call for more research on health implications .
[ social_buttons ]
In 150 experiments using gas and electric stoves and electric toaster ovens , researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) are working to determine their impacts on indoor levels of nanoparticles .
Previous studies measured particles with diameters greater than 10 nm , but the technology used in these experiments allowed researchers to measure particles as small as 10 times the size of a large atom , called ultra - fine particles ( UFP ) .
“ The results of this test , ” said researcher Lance Wallace , “ should affect future studies of human exposure to particulates and associated health effects , particularly since personal exposure to these indoor UFP sources can often exceed exposure to the outdoor UFP . ”
Other recent research has demonstrated the difficulty of mapping out the health effects of nanoparticles .
Even if a certain nanoparticles do not appear to be toxic , the interaction between the nanoparticles and other compounds in the human body can potentially cause serious problems to cell functions .
“ In experiments carried out elsewhere to mimic environmental exposure , nanoparticles delivered into the lungs crossed the lung barrier and entered the blood .
Particles in the blood can reach the liver , amongst other organs .
We also know that nanoparticles directly injected into the blood for medical purposes are also likely to end up in the liver .
We do n’t yet know if the nanoparticles are safely eliminated from the liver by specialised cells or whether these extremely small particles can enter the liver cells and disrupt their normal functioning . ”
– Dr Celine Filippi , University of Edinburgh
Researchers at the University of Massachusetts recently presented a study to the American Association for Cancer Research that found that nanoparticles could possibly damage DNA and lead to cancer .
“ The DNA damage could potentially lead to mutations and ultimately increase the risk of cancer .
Several studies have shown that smaller particles are more likely to enter cells and cause more toxicity . ”-
Sara Pacheco , researcher at the University of Massachusetts
The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution ( UK ) stated on Wednesday “ There is an urgent need for more research and testing of nanomaterials . ”
The example given was of asbestos , another widely - used material that was later found to cause cancer .
The NIST experiments were carried out in a three - bedroom test house equipped to measure ventilation rates , environmental conditions and contaminant concentrations .

One of my favorite new books explores the weird , gross and icky aspects of health .
“ Why Do n’t Your Eyelashes Grow ? ” by Dr. Beth Ann Ditkoff is filled with quirky body knowledge and was the source for my recent Weird Body Quiz .
For the Best of Well podcast this week , I spoke with Dr. Ditkoff about how the book came to be and learned about eyelash growth , why blond hair turns green in a pool , why we have nose hair and why our stomachs lurch when we ride a roller coaster .

Not only does smoking shorten life expectancy , it also has a significant impact on the quality of life in old age , according to a new study .
The Finnish study , published in the Archives of Internal Medicine , evaluated data on 1,658 white men born between 1919 and 1934 of similar socioeconomic status .
They were participating in the Helsinki Businessmen study .
At the start of the study , in 1974 , all men were healthy .
Their cardiovascular risks and smoking habits were evaluated at that time .
The men were re-evaluated 26 years later through surveys .
At that time , there had been 372 deaths .
Participants who had never smoked lived an average of 10 years longer than heavy smokers ( defined as more than 20 cigarettes per day ) .
The quality of life of the surviving participants was measured using a survey scale that measures health - related quality of life in categories including physical functioning , role limitations caused by health problems , role limitations caused by emotional problems , social functioning , emotional well - being , fatigue / energy , and general health perception .
The greatest difference was between those who had never smoked and heavy smokers .
Two categories where the differences were particularly stark : physical functioning and role limitations caused by health issues .
Nearly 70 % of the heavy smokers in 1974 had quit by 2000 .
However , the researchers write that the effect of smoking status at the start of the study still had a strong impact on death and quality of life .

I ’ve been ranting about this on twitter , but most of you are n’t there .
I ’m completely bemused , gobsmacked , and hornswoggled by Nicola Roxon ’s new Men ’s Health Ambassadors .
They might not be salaried , but they ’re going to get their travel expenses paid as they go around preaching what they believe is best for men ’s health .
The general concept ?
Terrific .
All for it .
The media is all over the appointment of Julia Gillard ’s hairdresser to the role , but I ’m not too exercised about that .
What am I pissed off about ?
Fatherhood Foundation president Warwick Marsh and Lone Fathers Association president Barry Williams .
These are two of the authors of the crap spewing forth from “ Gender Matters ” , about how homosexuality and transgenderism and feminism are Wrong and a Creeping Menace to the Family .
They might be a hate group that decorates their propaganda with pictures of ickle bitty babies – but they ’re still a hate group .
And it ’s unthinkably inappropriate and insulting for our Health Department to be recognising them as “ leaders ” and paying them to preach their brand of hate .
This is the Howard government ’s style , and while we knew Labor was going to be somewhat socially conservative , this is completely beyond the pale .
I hope this gets reversed quick smart .

It 's here the family 's broken
and it's here the lonely say
that the heart has got to open
in a fundamental way .
THE Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek has been the star of three documentaries in recent years — which is three more than your average Marxist - Lacanian psychoanalytic theorist — but he claims not to have seen more than a snippet of any of them .
“ It is just too traumatic , ” he said in a recent phone interview from Warsaw , where he was attending a conference .
The problem has much to do with the larger - than - life image that he has cultivated and seems now to both relish and resent .
A disheveled , bearlike presence , Mr. Zizek , 58 , is part mad professor , part bumbling clown dispensing ideas at breakneck speed and in a loud sibilant staccato .
“ I am too emphatic , ” he said emphatically .
“ Too expressive .
I do n’t think this works on screen .
Even if I state something totally obvious , I say it with this intensity , as if I am saying the last truth . ”
While he has no plans to sit through it , Mr. Zizek ’s latest documentary , “ The Pervert ’s Guide to Cinema , ” which will be shown at the Museum of Modern Art from Wednesday through April 23 , is his favorite of the bunch .
“ At least it is not about me , ” he said .
( The two earlier movies , “ Zizek ! ” and “ The Reality of the Virtual , ” were , respectively , a tour documentary and a filmed lecture . )
Data visualizations can be gorgeous , but images often do n't do them justice , especially if we 're talking live , real - time visualizations ( some of which require a lot of processing power and can't even be run on a regular desktop computer ) .
We 've dug out 7 videos of awesome data visualizations you simply must see .
Skyrails
Skyrails is a social network visualization system , but it can be used to visualize any graph or dataset .
It has a built in programming language for processing , but it allows for the creation of menus so even non-experts can use it .
As far as the actual visualizations go , they redefine awesomeness .
For more info on this amazing tool check out the official homepage .
Radiohead - House of Cards
After all the techy stunts they 've pulled over the years , we 're practically counting on Radiohead to be on the forefront of technology , and they did n't let us down with their last video , House of Cards .
The video was created sans the use of cameras ; it 's pure data , and if you feel so inclined , you can create another version of the video by using the same tools they did .
Fidg't Visualizer
Fidg't Visualizer is a powerful desktop tool that enables you to visualize your Last .
FM or Flickr network according to various criteria ; for example , you can see what types of photos are more popular than others , or how popular a certain band is among your friends .
Animation of a Large Social Network
There 's not much info about the data used here , but boy does it look gorgeous !
The data comes from an unspecified German social network , and the visualization was created with a tool called Walrus .
You can find more about the project here .
Project Palantir
You know what a palantir is , right ?
It 's the crystal ball thingy from Lord of the Rings - Saruman and Sauron 's favorite toy .
Well , now it 's also a real - time visual representation of the actions happening on Facebook , and boy it looks pretty !
It uses geo data to show where on Earth things are happening ; you can see stuff like users making new friends , or just overall actions and interactions on the site .
What warms our geeky hearts the most is the fact that they even included our Sun which is visible as you zoom out and scroll around the globe .
Real - Time Transportation System Visualization
This is an example of a real - time , dynamic , traffic data visualization system .
You can see animated vehicles actually moving through the 3D terrain ; the visualization also includes real - time traffic incidents , weather data , as well as buildings and structures .
Genealogy Motion Graphics
This project shows a visualization of a genealogy data set using Rhizome Navigation .
The graph in the video features more than 3300 persons and goes back in time to the author 's earliest ancestors , Icelandic settlers from the early 10th century .
Know of any other cool videos of data visualizations out there ?
Please , let us know in the comments !
With the slow down in the economy and the impending holiday season , everybody is likely to have a little spare free time .
Most freelancers do n’t do too well with free time and start scrambling for more clients , but what else can you do with that free time ?
Update Your Resume
I know this sounds bad , things get a little slow and you ’re supposed to start looking for a new job ?
No !
Your resume is a great way to reflect on what you ’ve done recently , and help you plan your future .
But you never know when having an up - to - date resume will come in handy .
You might even want to create an online resume , Emurse is a great place to create and post a resume .
Update Your Portfolio
Much like you resume your portfolio probably needs an update .
Not quite as drastic as updating your resume , but your portfolio is likely the first thing that an prospective client will look at .
An up - to - date portfolio is the key to finding new work .
I prefer to keep a portfolio on my own site , but if you prefer something hosted check out CarbonMade .
Update Your Social Profiles
Sites such as LinkedIn are a great way to find new work , but you have to make sure you keep your profiles updated .
Not only should you update your profile to reflect your work and any new work or training , but making sure you have added all your latest contacts will help expand your network into that next gig .
Getting testimonials from past clients on an independent website can go further than something you post on your own site .
Learn Something New
If you ’ve complained about not having time to learn Ruby on Rails or Django , what better time than now !
Whatever that buzzword compliant latest cool thing you ’ve been meaning to learn is , jump in and learn something new .
When the economy does recover you ’ll be happy you have all these new skills .
Read Some Books
No not another technical book , read a little fiction , even a little science fiction , but something unrelated to work .
Reading a little fiction is a good way to relax , but also helps to expand your horizons , and might give you a different perspective on your next project .
Head over to Amazon and pick something random to read .
I ’ve just started on the Twilight series .
Taxes
Yes its getting to the end of the year , and our favorite time of the year approaches , Tax time !
Why not get a head of the curve and get all your affairs in order .
It ’s not very glamorous work , but who knows what your schedule will look like closer to the time .
Personal Projects
If you ’ve had an idea for a web site , now is the time to act on it .
It does n’t mean you ’ll get the web site built and launched , but now is the time to start planning the web site , and who knows with the latest Agile development techniques maybe you will have time to get the site out to the public .
Most Inspired itself was started as a way for me to kill some free time , so you never know where things will end up .
Network
Take the time to shake some hands , maybe take a client out to lunch .
It is far more easier to get more work from a client , or by a referral from a client , than trying to find a new client .
We try and stay connected via email and instant messenger when we ’re busy with work , but now that you have some free time , a little face time goes a long way to cementing the relationships you have built with clients .
Recharge
Relax !
Take a little time to spend time with friends and family , or even some time for yourself .
Freelancers will often as a norm work more than the alloted 40 hours per week to work , take the downtime to recharge yourself for the next client project that runs over time and over budget ( they usually do do n’t they ) .
I ’m currently trying to kill two birds with one stone , launching a new personal project soon and using the opportunity to learn KohanaPHP .
What your you doing with your free time , or perhaps you do n’t have any ?

Drug Company Corruption Harms Children
" Joseph Biederman of Harvard may be the United States ' most influential doctor when it comes to determining whether their children are normal or mentally ill .
That 's why Iowa Sen .
Charles Grassley 's recent revelation that Biederman did not declare $ 1.6 million in drug company consulting fees is so important , scary and tragic .
Virtually all doctors who receive drug company money say they are not influenced , but every independent study examining the effects of such money says they are . "
-- Lawrence Diller , M.D in the San Francisco Chronicle , 7/13/08
Dear friends ,
The below article by respected UC San Francisco faculty member Lawrence Diller , M.D. , exposes blatant corruption and collusion between major drug companies and top pediatricians .
This cozy , profitable arrangement between big business , academia , and physicians causes harm to countless children around the world .
When profits are the primary driving force behind both research and the researchers in the health field , public health is endangered .
Help to spread the word about this important article so that we can work together to protect our children 's health and promote the needed reforms proposed by Dr. Diller .
With best wishes ,

Are Our Leading Pediatricians Drug Industry Shills ?
Lawrence Diller
Sunday , July 13 , 2008
As reported in the San Francisco Chronicle
Most parents have never heard of him , but Joseph Biederman of Harvard may be the United States ' most influential doctor when it comes to determining whether their children are normal or mentally ill .
In 1996 , for example , Biederman suggested that drugs like Ritalin might serve 10 percent of American kids for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder .
By 2004 , one in nine 11 - year - old boys was taking the drug .
Biederman and his team also are more responsible than anyone for a child bipolar epidemic sweeping America ( and no other country ) that has 2 - year - olds on three or four psychiatric drugs .
The science of children 's psychiatric medications is so primitive and Biederman 's influence so great that when he merely mentions a drug during a presentation , tens of thousands of children within a year or two will end up taking that drug , or combination of drugs .
This happens in the absence of a drug trial of any kind - instead , the decision is based upon word of mouth among the 7,000 child psychiatrists in America .
That 's why Iowa Sen .
Charles Grassley 's recent revelation that Biederman did not declare $ 1.6 million in drug company consulting fees is so important , scary and tragic .
If true , this scandal is yet one more stake in the heart of American academic medicine 's credibility with frontline doctors like me - and more importantly , with the parents of the patients I deal with every day .
American medicine , with psychiatry the most culpable , has fallen back to a time more than 100 years ago when doctor credibility was tantamount to the promotion of patent medicine .
Subsequent reforms severed ties between medical school doctors and the drug industry - and for decades there was a much more ethical balance between the industry and physicians .
Now once again , drug company money is corrupting medical practice and the maintenance of our country 's health .
In a market economy , both doctors and the companies are motivated by profit .
However , doctors '
Hippocratic oath and their personal / professional relationships with their patients attenuate the most crass aspects of a fee - for - service system .
In contrast , drug companies owe primary responsibility to their shareholders .
Of course these companies must operate within legal business and Food and Drug Administration restraints , but the drive to push such rules to the limit is implicit in any business .
Such a strategy is n't always beneficial when our children 's health is affected .
The Fortune 500 drug companies , by their sheer economic clout , have become the single most dominant influence in our health care system .
The ambiguities of children 's mental health and illness make child psychiatry the most vulnerable branch of medicine open to such influence .
In this climate , drug company research money , professional medical education and direct advertisements to parents tilt families and doctors to biologically brain - based solutions , rather than nondrug ( e.g. , parenting and education ) approaches .
That 's why we 're seeing famous ( or infamous ) Newsweek cover boys like Max , a 10 - year - old who has taken 38 psychiatric medications in his short , unhappy life .
Research funding must be directed to the needs of patients and their doctors - not to the bottom line of stockholders .
Drug companies can still make money , but it 's ethically immoral when stockholder profits trump children 's health needs ( as in the cover - up of negative studies of antidepressants in children ) .
More money must be directed toward head - to - head competition between existing generics and the new products , and toward more studies comparing nondrug or combination approaches to drug - only interventions for children 's problems .
Drug company funding of medical research is not going to end - nor should it entirely stop .
Yet a new set of federal rules dictating the transparency and direction of such funding is desperately needed to redress a dangerously corrupt system .
It 's not enough to simply have doctors more explicitly report their incomes from drug companies , though it is a very useful first step .
I remember about six years ago when I read a major article by the Biederman team on the advantages of a non-Ritalin drug pathway for ADHD .
On the same day , much to my dismay , I also heard him give a speech - for a Wall Street audience - promoting a new drug by Eli Lilly called Strattera .
Although Strattera turned out to be a bust both clinically and commercially for ADHD , I was still shaken that such a prominent researcher could be so brazen with his potential conflict of interest appearance .
The $ 1.6 million that Biederman did n't declare is only a small fraction of the full amount of research funding that his clinic receives from nearly a dozen companies that pay for not only the cost of running studies but also the salaries of the doctors involved .
Virtually all doctors who receive drug company money say they are not influenced , but every independent study examining the effects of such money says they are .
The leadership of Harvard 's psychiatry department is strangely silent or even defends Biederman .
These are good men with solid reputations both in drug and nondrug aspects of treatment .
Yet they know that their psychiatry department would not exist were it not for drug company money - considering the withdrawal of federal research dollars over the past 25 years and the meager reimbursements that psychiatrists receive for their services from insurance companies and Medi-Cal .
Sens .
Grassley , a Republican , and Herbert Kohl , a Wisconsin Democrat , have introduced the Physician Payments Sunshine Act , which will require more vigorous reporting and enforcement on payments ( anything more than $ 500 ) received by doctors from drug companies .
But in addition , we need laws to have the federal government , along with the major academic research centers , coordinate and direct the use of drug company money in medical research .
This is not pie - in - the sky wishing .
Such reform was precisely what the doctors of 100 years ago accomplished in this country .
Lawrence Diller , M.D. , practices behavioral - developmental pediatrics in Walnut Creek , CA , and is on the clinical faculty of UCSF .
He is the author of " The Last Normal Child " ( Praeger , 2006 ) .

Drug Company Corruption Harms Children
The idea of intelligent fundamentalists , like the theory of intelligent design , does not stand up to 30 seconds ' scrutiny .
I must , nevertheless , give credit to American evangelicals for showing belated glimmerings of sense .
After decades of blindly endorsing evangelical politicians from the born - again Carter to the born - again Bush , they at last appear ready to look for more than religious dogma in a candidate .
Richard Cizik , the Washington representative of the National Association of Evangelicals , has all but backed Obama .
' I 'm a conservative , but it does n't mean I 'm going to vote that way , ' he announced .
' I could disagree with Obama , and do , on same - sex marriage and abortion , but that does n't mean I 'll vote against him . '
Cizik has been criticised by the American conservative press , but his abandonment of faith in the Republican party may be a sign of a wider disillusionment .
Foreigners , who bought Michael Moore 's cartoon version of America as a land dominated by quasi - fascist bigots , may not understand why , but Christian conservatives have good reason to feel cheated .
The Republicans not only took their votes and left them with jobs that may vanish and homes the banks may repossess , but failed to deliver the conservative counter - revolution they promised .
After eight years of Bush , abortion is still legal and the gay marriage movement is marching on .
The congregations of Cizik's and other churches have every right to shrug their shoulders and vote Obama or give up on politics and stay at home .
Evelyn Waugh complained in 1951 that the British Conservative party had ' never put the clock back by a single second ' .
We will have to wait until the votes are in , but American evangelicals could say the same about today 's Republicans .
The fate of the creationists shows why .
Bush whipped up the futile passions of his supporters by encouraging schools to balance the teaching of the theory of evolution with the theory of ' intelligent design ' , which is nothing more than creationism dressed up in the language of pseudo - science to avoid America 's prohibition on religion in the classroom .
Creationists in Dover , Pennsylvania , took him at his word .
With the shameful , but I suppose inevitable , support of an English academic postmodernist , one Steve Fuller of Warwick University , they argued that truth was relative .
Teachers should not discriminate between evidence and superstition , but tell children that it was as reasonable to believe that a god - like intelligence designed life as to think that species evolved through undirected natural selection .
A Republican in the White House did them no good .
In September 2005 , Judge John E Jones ruled that they were trying to slip the Book of Genesis into science classes and came down against them .
Three years on from their defeat , and with the Democrats certain to dominate Washington , the hopes of the intelligent design movement appear dead .
But ideas do not die , they spread and mutate .
Creationism might be on the back foot in America , but it is blossoming elsewhere as Richard Dawkins discovered when Turkish readers told him they could no longer access his website .
Dawkins 's offence was to satirise Harun Yahya , the pen name of Adnan Oktar , the front man for a wealthy Islamic publishing house .
Its lavishly illustrated Atlas of Creation spends 500 pages comparing fossils with present - day species to argue that evolution never took place .
Dawkins looked at a picture of an ancient fossilised eel and a picture of what Yahya claimed was a modern eel and pointed out that it was in fact a sea snake .
Yahya went on to represent the immutability of God 's creation by claiming that a fossilised insect had survived unchanged for millions of years .
Unfortunately , the modern version of the caddis fly Yahya chose to illustrate his point was not a fly at all , but a steel fish - hook with a fake insect on top to lure fish on to the line .
Yahya is a joke , but few Turks are laughing .
Index on Censorship reported last week that the Turkish courts and the Islamist government were banning Turks from accessing YouTube and the hosting sites Blogger and WordPress for various moral and political reasons as well as richarddawkins .
net .
When Bianet , a Turkish human rights group , published a critical piece , Yahya told its journalists : ' This is an insulting article , take it off the internet or we will have you banned like Richard Dawkins . '
' On the one hand , fundamentalists say all they want is a debate , ' said Padraig Reidy of Index .
' But as soon as they get power , they close debate down . '
Westerners say that Yahya reminds them of American creationists .
The link is more solid than they know .
In Atlas of Creation , Yahya acknowledges his debt to Duane Gish from the Institute for Creation Research in Texas .
Gish has spent years arguing that the fossil record contains no evidence of species evolving and blustering whenever a palaeontologist contradicted him .
As a Muslim , Yahya did not need to accept the institute 's Protestant fundamentalist ' young - Earth ' doctrine - the notion that God made the world in 4004BC or thereabouts .
But he happily borrowed Gish 's equally idiotic delusion that today 's species cannot have evolved and must therefore be identical to their ancestors of tens or hundreds of millions of years ago .
Vast sums of probably Saudi money are fuelling the move of creationism across the Atlantic .
In Turkey and the Middle East , poor schools are grateful for Yahya's free books and scientists are becoming frightened of speaking out .
Last year , the Council of Europe warned that Yahya was also targeting schools in France , Belgium , Spain and Switzerland .
In Britain , academics talk of expelling mainly Muslim science students .
They do not make a fuss about it in case post - modern relativists in the mould of Steve Fuller accuse them of religious discrimination , but say , very quietly , that if religion stops their students accepting evolution , there is no point in them staying at university .
Maybe in a generation 's time , Americans will patronise Europeans as quasi - fascist bigots .
If we are to avoid their condescension , we must accept that creationism will not go down with the American conservative movement .
It is evolving and its opponents must evolve , too , if they want to defeat it .
YOU are an incredibly ignorant individual .
Your spelling and grammar are just this side of illiterate .
You have absolutely no concept of what " retarded " is .
You have left yourself open for being sued for libel , by implying that Gov. Palin appears at debates on crack .
You are just the sort of uninformed person that the Obomination crowd feeds on .
BTW , you 've been reported for rant .
Sometimes the language is not what needs fixing .
Consider the possibility of it being the user .
You see , in Ruby , there 's this " if x is not defined , define x " idiom that goes like this :
x ||= 1
I was sick of seeing that followed by x += 1 every time I used it .
I wanted to combine it into one line of x ||+= 1 . I spent a little time trying to figure out how to do that , or some acceptable alternative .
Then I realized that a ternary operator would get the job done on one line .
But I did n't really want the redundancy .
On top of that , I think ternary operators require too much thought to process , and I avoid them in favor of spelling it out .
If you do that , then each time you write hash [ key ] += 1 it will define a new key into the hash if key did not exist there before ( and the value there will be defaulted to 0 , then incremented ) , or it will increment it if it 's already there .
Perfect !
Except that the objects I wanted to have that power did n't have control of the hashes passed to them .
And I wanted to be able to receive strings and arrays with similar behavior in the same object .
Or so I thought .
The real problem was just that my thinking was attached and working within the particular object model I had already constructed .
The more I thought about it , the more I realized it was just wrong - this object should be constructing its own data structures , and it should be encapsulating them , and it should be providing methods to allow the outside world to use and manipulate .
This is not that new a concept :
It 's called object orientation .
Perhaps you 've heard of it .
Anyway , it ( re ) taught me a lesson that I see others forgetting ( or having never learned ) quite often :
Before deciding that the language needs fixing , first consider if you 're just trying to do something stupid or useless or redundant .
Sometimes the language is not what is broken .
I surmise that more often , it 's your programming that is in need of repair .
It 's such an obvious point , but one that seems so easily and often forgotten .
Hey !
Why do n't you make your life easier and subscribe to the full post or short blurb RSS feed ?
I 'm so confident you 'll love my smelly pasta plate wisdom that I 'm offering a no- strings - attached , lifetime money back guarantee !
The other day I thought I thought wanted an ||+= operator .

Tim Pope had an obvious and simple suggestion : define your hash with the default value of 0 .

Well , it 's coming up to the holidays and I 've started to make my list and fill it in .
As a starting point , I went through all the books and DVDs and gadgets I 'd reviewed on Boing Boing since last November and looked at what had been the best - sellers among BB 's readership , figuring you folks have pretty good taste !
As I was taking a walk down old review lane , I realized that many of you would probably be interested in seeing these lists too , so I 've turned them into a series of blog - posts that I 'll be sticking up , one per day , for the next week or so .
Today I 'm starting with kids ' media and media about kids and child - rearing .
Later this week , I 'll do fiction , nonfiction , comics and graphic novels , CDs and DVDs and gadgets and everything else , one a day .
Hope this helps you with your holiday shopping as much as it's helped me with mine !

Barack Obama leads John McCain by 10 points , 51 - 41 , among Colorado voters , according to an Insider Advantage / Poll Position survey released Thursday .
Other recent polls of Colorado voters have shown a much closer race .
The Insider Advantage poll surveyed 508 registered voters by telephone Wednesday and has a margin of error of 4.3 percent .
Two other Colorado polls released this week each had McCain up by 2 points , within the margins of error .
An American Research Group poll released Wednesday tallied McCain leading 46 - 44 , and a Rasmussen poll released Sunday had McCain ahead 48 - 46 .
Both polls , however , were conducted before a widely publicized swing by Obama through the state Monday and Tuesday , and before the economic turmoil that has changed the focus of the presidential campaign this week .
A National Journal poll poll conducted in Colorado and other swing states , also released Thursday , showed a neck - and - neck 45 - 44 Obama advantage in the state .
A week ago , the previous Insider Advantage poll showed a slimmer 49 - 46 Obama lead in Colorado .
Obama holds a commanding lead among all voters under age 65 in the most recent Insider Advantage poll , but trails McCain by 24 points among the oldest voters .
Obama also leads by an astounding 60 points among Hispanic voters in the Colorado poll .
Some people are claiming that Obama 's job package will cost $ 280,000 per job .
The actual cost is not trivial , but I do n't think that figure is correct ( it simply divides a proposed stimulus amount , $ 700 billion , by the stated job goal of 2.5 million ) .
I 've also seen the claim that the $ 700 billion number is simply pulled out of a hat , but that 's not right either , it 's based upon transparent calculations .
( The calculations follow along the lines of Krugman ) .
GDP last year was around $ 14 trillion dollars , and the labor force is in the neighborhood of 155 million people .
Suppose we expect a 3.5 % unemployment gap ( that is , we expect a shortfall of 3.5 % of 155 million , or 5.425 million jobs ) .
By Okun 's law - which states that a 1 % change in unemployment translates into a 2 % change in output - this means we expect a 7 % shortfall in output .
Now , 7 % of $ 14 trillion is , with rounding , a trillion dollars ( actually $ 980 billion , but close enough for government stabilization work ) .
The government expenditure multiplier is approximately 2.0 , so that means a $ 500 billion dollar stimulus package is needed .
[ That is , ( change in GDP ) = ( multiplier ) *( change in government spending , i.e. ( $ 1 trillion ) = ( 2.0 ) * ( $ 500 billion ) . ]
If we actually get the 5 million jobs the estimates say we will get , what is the cost per job ?
It is $ 490 billion divided by 5,425,000 , or $ 90,323 .
( Note that by targeting spending to places that have a high employment rate per dollar spent , we may be able to do even better than this . )
But this is GDP per job , it includes wages , rent , interest , and profit , it 's not the amount labor takes home .
About 70 percent of income goes to labor ( though the figure may be even smaller over the last few years given the change in the income distribution - I have n't checked recently - so I 'll use 70 % ; Update : I missed that Greg Mankiw used .67 plus a bit more to account for supervisors , see below , so .70 seems okay ) .
If we take 70 % of $ 90,323 , we get about $ 63,000 ( actually , $ 63,226 ) .
That 's less than a quarter of the $ 280,000 figure .
Now , the actual stimulus package numbers are larger than $ 500 billion , proposals for $ 600 or $ 700 billion are heard frequently .
That 's because extra has been added in to be sure the stimulus is large enough .
But this extra spending will also add to job creation , so this wo n't change the cost per job .
Greg Mankiw , who first reported the $ 280,000 figure , wonders why the figure is so high .
He says , looking at the multiplier formula , the answer must be that either the change in government spending is smaller than $ 500 billion , his first reason below , or the multiplier is smaller than the value of 2.0 used above , the third reason he gives .
The other possibility , the " low bar " in his second reason , is that the 2 % change in output to 1 % change in unemployment based upon Okun 's law overstates the actual employment change , and a lower value was used to arrive at the 2.5 million figure :
Logically , it must be one of three possibilities :
1 . The fiscal stimulus is going to be much smaller than is being reported .
2 . The new administration is setting a low bar for itself when it comes to job creation .
3 . The Obama team believes in very small fiscal policy multipliers .
Let me amplify the last point with a rough back - of - the - envelope calculation .
The average weekly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers is about $ 600 , or about $ 60,000 over a two - year period .
Granted , labor income is only about two - thirds of national income , and we have to add a few supervisors into the mix .
So let 's say each job created means $ 100,000 of extra national income .
If we are generating $ 100,000 of income with $ 280,000 of government spending , the multiplier is only 100/280 , or 0.36 .
By contrast , traditional Keynesian models suggest a multiplier closer to 2.0 .
Notice the average annual salary of $ 60,000 , that 's pretty close to the cost calculation of $ 63,000 above .
As to why the estimates differ , I do n't think the expenditure multiplier will change much - an increase in the savings rate would lower it , but there are reasons to increase saving and to decrease saving in a recession ( some people save for the rainy days ahead , others have no choice but to consume out of saving ) , and the multiplier would increase with a fall in the responsiveness of investment to changes in the interest rate as we enter a recession , and the latter change likely dominates ( to say this another way , crowding out is less of a worry ) .
So I doubt the multiplier has fallen , it 's more likely that it increased .
The remaining uncertainties are the size of the stimulus , and the coefficient characterizing Okun 's law .
I do n't think the coefficient of Okun 's law is 1.0 , that seems way too low given the estimates I 've seen , so the 2.5 million figure for job creation is likely just a safe , conservative statement of what they expect to accomplish .
That 's understandable since the estimates above are pretty rosy , and they still have to get a stimulus package through congress - the ultimate size of the package is unknown and not entirely their call - and overestimates of what they can do on the job front are not a good idea in any case .
That 's a lot of jobs to create , and it 's better to under promise and over deliver than to do the reverse .
Update : Ezra Klein :
What Will the Stimulus Buy ? : Over at the Motherblog , my colleague Tim Fernholz neatly dispenses with a bit of economics spin from Greg Mankiw .
My hunch is you 're going to hear Mankiw 's point a lot in the coming weeks , so it 's worth knocking it down .
He begins by looking at Obama 's intention to pursue a $ 700 billion stimulus measure and create 2.5 million new jobs .
Using an ellipsis that cuts through four paragraphs in the original article , he manages to make it seem as if the stimulus is a policy meant to simply create jobs .
He then does some back - of - the - envelope math and notes that this works out to approximately $ 280,000 per job .
Not a very good deal .
Fernholz responds :
Not all of the stimulus package is focused directly on job creation ... most economists
I 've spoken to and many reports I 've read predict that a big chunk of the stimulus -- tens of billions of dollars -- will include increased funding for things like food stamps , TANF , and unemployment insurance .
It will likely also include federal aid to states , much of which will be used to make up massive budget shortfalls on programs like medicare .
While that aid does n't directly create jobs , without it , states would have been firing public employees to balance their budgets , especially with the bond market as tight as it is .
None of those facets of the stimulus program directly create jobs , but they ease the pain for the millions of people losing jobs , preventing them from falling into deep poverty while the economy returns to course , and stimulate the economy in the aggregate .
Subtracting the cost of these kinds of aid from the total cost of the stimulus will probably make the cost - per - job figure seem more reasonable .
...
Actually , programs like food stamps and unemployment insurance do provide jobs ( or stop job losses which is the same thing ) by increasing aggregate demand .
So these types of effects are included in estimates of the job benefits from public spending .
I can see how jobs that are simply maintained may not be counted in as a new jobs in a job creation tally , but they should be and such effects are part of the estimates of how many jobs will be created due to a particular level of government spending .

However , since gold is a reactive mineral , these precious metal deposits are buried deep in the Earth ’s core .
Marianas Trench has been proposed as a nuclear waste dumpsite .
Oceanic trenches have long been proposed as nuclear waste disposal sites , since tectonic plate movements could theoretically push the nuclear waste into the Earth ’s mantle .
However , international law prohibits the dumping of nuclear waste in any ocean .
Tectonic plates also tend to cause megathrust earthquakes , which could be hazardous in the long run if nuclear waste was involved .
Russia is the biggest country in the world .

Eratosthenes invented geography in 3rd century BC .
Eratosthenes was not the first scholar to write about the Earth .
However , he was the first to correctly theorize and speculate most of the fundamentals we apply now .
He published his book Geography in two volumes .
The first volume compiled existing knowledge about geography , along with his theories on the validity of the claims .
The second volume explained his formula for calculating the circumference of the Earth .

The tropics determine a place ’s climate .
Have you ever wondered why some places experience snow , while some places do n’t ?
That question is answered by the tropic of Cancer and Capricorn .
The tropics are circles of latitude that mark different climate regions on Earth .
Tropical countries lie between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn , which is why it does n’t experience snow .
Now that ’s one of the geography facts to remember .
The Tropic of Capricorn is the southernmost latitude where the sun can be overhead .
Less than 3 % of the world ’s population lives south of the Tropic of Capricorn .
However , about 40 % of the population lives between the two Tropics in tropical countries .
The Tropic of Cancer is the northernmost latitude passed by the sun .
Countries within the Tropic of Cancer experience dry , warm weather – excluding the highlands of China and coastal areas that are prone to rainfall .
Places within this tropic have 2 seasons : dry summers reaching 45 °C and warm winters with lows of 25 °C .
The Association of American Geographers ( AAG ) established the 5 themes of geography .
The AAG created a guideline for teaching geography , separating its concepts into 5 main themes : location , place , human - environment interaction , movement , and region .
Definitely one of the essential geography facts .
Location has two main types .
When you think geography , location is probably one of the first things that come to mind .
The 5 themes of geography classify location into two kinds .
Absolute location is an exact location such as an address or coordinates .
On the other hand , relative location describes a location relative to its surroundings .
For example , if you ask your friend where they might be and they say they ’re a block away from the mall , that is their relative location .
Meanwhile , if they give you an exact address , that is their absolute location .
Place refers to the physical characteristics of a location .
You might confuse location with the place , since both words are used in the same context .
However , the 5 themes of geography draw a simple distinction : a place refers to a location according to its characteristics .
Physical characteristics define a place through its surroundings , such as mountains , rivers , beaches , climate , and biodiversity .
For example , if an expert describes a place as hot , sandy , and deserted , they are describing a place through physical characteristics .
Meanwhile , human characteristics refer to landmarks , livelihood , political systems , folklore , and the like .
Simply put , it describes the cultural identity of a place .
For example , China can be described as a communist , predominantly Buddhist place .

Movement refers to the distance traveled by humans in all categories .
Whether it ’s physical , technological , or social advancements , the 5 themes of geography define these shifts as movement .
Migration , channels of water in the oceans , and the expansion of phone reception through the world are all movements .
Regions divide places or locations according to common characteristics .
Regions are groups of places with the same characteristics .
Regions can vary in scale , from the regions of a city to the regions of the world .
The 5 themes of geography classify regions into three types .
Formal regions are official boundaries denoted by law , such as cities , states , and countries .
Functional regions are defined through their role to surrounding regions .
For example , the CNBC dubbed Virginia as the best state for business in 2019 .
Thus , in 2019 , Virginia was a functional business region .
Vernacular regions , on the other hand , group places according to informal definitions .
For example , we call a Texan accent “ Southern ” because Texas is recognized in America as the South .
The prime meridian dictates the time zones of countries .
Sir George Airy established the Royal Observatory of Greenwich as the prime meridian in 1851 .
The prime meridian is the longitude at the middle of the Earth .
Places to the west of Greenwich are an hour earlier than the Greenwich Mean Time ( GMT ) every 15 degrees , while each time zone towards the east is an hour later every 15 degrees .
Maps can tell actual distance according to map scale .
The scale on a map describes a ratio of the actual distance .
For example , a 1:1000000 cm scale map shows 1 centimeter is equal to 1 kilometer in actual ground distance .
The U.S. has the most states in the world .
U.S. geography is unique since it has the most states out of any country in the world , with 50 different states .
Asia is the world ’s biggest continent .
Asia takes up 30 % of the Earth ’s landmass , making it the largest continent in the world .
Not only is it the biggest , but it is also the most populated continent with 4,627,028,167 inhabitants as of 2020 .

However , it is the sixth - largest country in the world by total area , and the largest country in Oceania .
Everest is not the tallest mountain in the world .
People widely believe Mount Everest to be the highest peak in the world .
However , it is only the tallest mountain above sea level .
Mauna Kea in Hawaii actually stands 3,000 feet taller than Mt. Everest , if you count its submerged base .
Standing at 32,808 feet , Mauna Kea is the tallest mountain in the world .
Definitely one of the geography facts you did n’t expect .
Chimborazo is the closest peak to outer space .
At only 20,564 feet in height , Mt. Chimborazo is definitely not taller than Everest .
However , its location at the equator pushes it closer to space than Mt. Everest , at 29,035 feet .
Iceland grows 5 cm per year .
One of the coolest geography facts : Iceland expands 5 centimeters per year as the North American and European plates grow wider apart .
The Pacific Ocean shrinks each year .
As the Americas drift to the west , the Pacific Ocean shrinks 2 - 3 cm. Meanwhile , Asia and North America get closer each year .
Mexico City stands on a lake .
The Aztecs filled in Lago de Texcoco to create an island , which the Spanish conquistadors turned into Mexico City in 1521 .
Since most locals rely on the aquifer below the city for water , the city sinks 3.2 feet per year .
Over the last 60 years , it has dropped a total of 32 feet .

Dreadful Highlights in the History of Blasts
For most of us BOOM , KABLAM , KABLOOIE mean a mushroom cloud and a cute little animated turtle talking about ducking and covering – as well as the possible End Of All Life As We Know It .
But not every monstrous explosion began with J. Robert Oppenheimer saying " Now I am become Death , the destroyer of worlds " ...
Even putting aside natural blasts such as the eruption of Krakatoa ( which was so massive the sound of it was heard as far away as London ) , the Earth has still to be rocked by more than its fair share of man-made , non-atomic BOOMs .
Ship with 3,000 tons of munitions collides with pier loaded with explosives
One of the more terrifying non-nuclear explosions ever to occur was in 1917 up in Halifax , Nova Scotia .
Back in December of that year the Mont - Blanc plowed into another ship , the Imo , starting a ferocious fire .
Ten minutes later the Mont - Blanc went up , creating what is commonly considered to be one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in earth history .
The Mont -Blanc was a big ship carrying a lot of extremely dangerous cargo -- almost 3,000 tons of munitions bound for the war that was then tearing Europe apart .
What happened that morning , which lead to the blast and the nightmarish loss of life , reads like a textbook example of whatever could go wrong , did .
( image credit : Mysteries of Canada )
To avoid being torpedoed , the Mont - Blanc was n’t flying any dangerous cargo flags , so no one except for her crew knew her cargo was so dangerous .
When the fire got out of control , the Mont - Blanc ’s crew tried to warn as many people as possible – but they only spoke French and the language of Halifax was English .
Not realizing the danger , crowds began to form to watch the blaze .
The Mont -Blanc , on fire , also began to drift toward a nearby pier … that was also packed with munitions bound for the war .
When everything finally came together – the criminal negligence , the miscommunication , and worst of all the fire and the explosives – the blast was roughly equal to 3 kilotons of TNT .
The fireball roared up above the town and the shockwave utterly destroyed the town and everything within one mile of the epicenter .
Metal and wreckage fell as far away as 80 miles from the blast and the sound of the detonation was heard more than 225 miles away .
The explosion was so huge it generated a tsunami that roared away from the epicenter and then back into the harbor again , adding to the death and destruction .
It was n’t until days later that the true horror of what had happened was realized : Halifax was completely gone , erased from the face of the earth , along with every ship in the harbor and most of the nearby town of Dartmouth .
Approximately 2,000 people died from the explosion and another 9,000 were injured .
Unfortunately Halifax was n’t the first such explosives - related accident in 1917 .
Unbelievably , before the Mont - Blanc destroyed the town , 73 people were killed in the explosion of a munitions factory in Silvertown in West Ham , Essex .
The sound was heard as far away as 100 miles .
A year earlier , the Johnson Barge No.17 went up Jersey City .
Although only a few people were killed , the explosion managed to damage not only Ellis Island but also the Statue of Liberty .
There were many other blasts as well , but these are only a few of the more dreadful highlights .
" Trident " missile goes into a spiral - image by CNN , via
" A U.S. Navy " Trident " missile goes awry shortly after a test launch from a submarine off the coast of Cape Canaveral several years ago .
The missile exploded shortly after this photo was taken .
There was no injury to the submarine or its crew ...
The submarine captain , watching the test through the sub's periscope , was reported to have been mesmerized for several hours . "
Other massive explosive accidents
You ’d think after these nightmarish explosions , caution about things that go BOOM would have sunk in a bit , but the Second World War also saw more than its fair share of explosive accidents .
In 1944 , for instance , the SS Fort Stikine went up while docked in Bombay , India .
When her cargo went up , the blast killed 800 men and injured 3,000 .
The fire that followed took more than three days to control .
Also in 1944 , the UK experienced what is commonly considered the largest blast ever to occur on British soil when 3,700 tons of high explosives were accidentally detonated in an underground munitions store in Fauld , Staffordshire .
The explosion was so massive it formed a crater three quarters of a mile across and more than 400 feet deep -- and destroyed not only the base but a nearby reservoir ( and all the water in it ) .

One of the largest non-nuclear , man-made , blasts in the history of the world
But one of the biggest blasts – aside from the two atomic bombs dropped on Japan – was also one of the largest in human history , and one of the most tragic .
Once again in 1944 , on July 17 to be specific , munitions being loaded onto a ship in Port Chicago , California , ( very close to San Francisco ) detonated .
No one knows what exactly caused the blast , but the damage was biblical .
All in all , more than 5,000 tons of high explosives , plus whatever else was in the stores on the base and on any ships docked , was involved .
The explosion was so massive it was felt as far away as Las Vegas ( 500 miles distant ) and people were injured all over the Bay Area when windows were shattered by the immense pressure wave .

320 were killed immediately and almost 400 were seriously injured , but that ’s not the real tragedy .
Most of these men were African American and this single disaster accounted for almost 15 % of African American casualties during that war .
Still fearing for their safety , the remaining men , who had just spent three weeks pulling the bodies of their fellow sailors from the wreckage , refused to load any further munitions .
The Army , in a characteristic show of support , considered this an act of mutiny and court - martialed 208 sailors , sending an additional 50 to jail for 8 to 15 years .
Fortunately , the ‘ mutineers ’ were given clemency after Thurgood Marshall fought for them , though the final member only received justice in 1999 in the form of a Presidential pardon by President Bill Clinton .
Today in Port Chicago there ’s a marker on the spot and it states that the event was a step toward " racial justice and equality . "
And all it took was one of the largest non-nuclear , man-made , blasts in the history of the world -- and the deaths of 320 sailors .

Deeper ties between Team McCain , Freddie Mac RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday September 23 , 2008
Print This Email
This A day after aides to Republican presidential candidate John McCain lashed out at the press for reporting on connections between prominent campaign advisers and embattled mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae , Bloomberg News provides a new wrinkle to the story .
The lobbying firm of the man Republicans say John McCain has chosen to begin planning a presidential transition earned more than a quarter of a million dollars this year representing Freddie Mac , one of the companies McCain blames for the nation 's financial crisis .
Timmons & Co. , whose founder and chairman emeritus is William Timmons Sr. , was registered to lobby for Freddie Mac from 2000 through this month , when the federal government took over both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae .
The McCain campaign would n't talk to the financial news wire , but other Republicans told reporters Jonathan D. Salant and Timothy J. Burger that Timmons would be leading McCain 's transition team if he were elected in November .
The disclosure seems to further undercut McCain 's efforts to demonize the two lending giants and his attempts to tie their failure to Democratic candidate Barack Obama .
The Illinois senator is not without his own unfortunate connections to the firms , though .
Jim Johnson , Fannie Mae 's former CEO , ran Obama 's vice presidential search committee earlier this year until news of his involvement in scandal forced him from the position ; Johnson also has raised at least $ 200,000 for the campaign .
Timmons is not the only member of McCain 's inner circle to have benefited from the lobbying largess of the mortgage lenders .
On Monday , the New York Times reported that McCain 's campaign manager , Rick Davis , earned more than $ 30,000 a month when his Washington consulting firm ran an advocacy group established to stave of congressional attempts to regulate Fannie and Freddie .
That disclosure unleashed a bout of manufactured scorn from McCain 's top strategist -- and Karl Rove protege -- Steve Schmidt , who pronounced the Times " not by any standard a journalistic organization . "
No word yet on the McCain camp 's verdict regarding Bloomberg 's journalism .

The fourth anniversary of Christopher Reeve ’s death [ - ] of cardiac arrest at the age of 52 [ -] passed last week .
The 30th anniversary of the movie that made him a distinctively irresistible new star , “ Superman : The Movie , ” is approaching in December .
Anyone who followed his tragically disrupted but heroic career recalls that it included some haunting connections to this part of the country .
The riding accident that shattered Mr. Reeve ’s spinal cord occurred during a cross-country equestrian event in Culpeper , Va. , in May 1995 .
Washington had witnessed the auspicious Reeve debut as Superman and alter - ego Clark Kent during a national press junket that preceded the movie ’s theatrical openings in mid-December 1978 .
After missing earlier , impractical opening dates in the summers of 1977 and ‘ 78 , Warner Bros . was still racing the clock to prepare finished prints for a holiday season release .
“ Superman ” was never previewed in a customary , cautious fashion with unsuspecting test audiences .
A packed press screening at the Uptown ( then under the management of Circle Theatres ) became the movie ’s first exposure to a curious public .
That happy unveiling was followed a few days later by the “ official ” premiere , an invitational benefit for Special Olympics at the Eisenhower Theater in the Kennedy Center .
The Uptown showing proved a memorable event for my family .
Our eldest daughters , then 7 and 4 , were among the youngest members of the audience .
Our third daughter , a nursing babe in arms , probably was the youngest .
We were sitting in the last row on the left side of the auditorium , a location that made it easier for my wife to slip into the lobby if the baby got restless , a recurrent condition during the first sustained sequence , where the destruction of Krypton was being underscored by ear - splitting sound effects .
Richard Donner , the film ’s director , stood just inside the door throughout the screening , so he became an impromptu doorman for my wife during her exits and returns .
Once the galaxy - traveling plot reached Superman ’s small - town upbringing as Clark Kent , the baby was settling down and it was clear that the movie was nimble enough to switch styles from the portentous to the endearing and comic - heroic .
These proved the attributes that made it an enormous success in the winter of 1978 - 79 , not to mention an abiding pleasure to this day .
In the course of the interviews and archival material appended to Warner Bros. ’ two - disc DVD edition of the movie , leading lady Margot Kidder fondly remarks , “ I think it ’ll work forever . ”
I think she ’s right , and being there on the night the movie first demonstrated its appeal remains a vivid and cherished privilege .
At the time , I was especially glad that the “ Superman ” bet had worked out for Andrew Fogelson , who was supervising national publicity for Warners .
I had met him a few years earlier when he was the studio’s one - man advance team for a distinguished import , Jan Troell ’s “ The Emigrants . ” Mr. Fogelson was responsible for the ingenious “ Superman ” campaign that emphasized the slogan , “ You ’ll believe a man can fly . ”
In a way , the Fogelson team had underestimated the appeal of the movie ’s arduously contrived but ultimately beguiling flying illusions , which achieved a quality of romantic elevation and bliss that surpassed mere suspension of disbelief .
It ’s fun to see Mr. Fogelson turn up in the “ Making of … ” featurettes , recalling the famous slogan and explaining such shoptalk of the time as “ negative pickups , ” alluding to deals between distributors and independent producers rather than unsavory sexual encounters .
For selfish reasons , I ’m sorry that the DVD supplements ignore the Washington premiere , along with similar events that were staged in New York and London .
I believe Warners had camera crews on hand for the press conferences — and presumably for the Eisenhower gala , which I did n’t attend .
One of the amusing sideshows of the junket was Arnold Schwarzenegger , a ubiquitous presence at the hosting hotel although he was n’t a member of the cast .
At the time , he was Maria Shriver ’s beau and roughly seven years away from a date with movie stardom .
Assembled for a video release in 2001 , the supplements for “ Superman ” could use some updating and enhancing if a future anniversary edition is being contemplated .
Mr. Donner shares a commentary track with screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz , who was responsible for the final versions of a screenplay that began with Mario Puzo .
The filmmakers often call attention to how much special - effects technology had changed by the turn of the century , due to the triumph of computer - generated imagery ( CGI ) .
Completed about 15 years before the CGI transformation , “ Superman ” is now an invaluable monument to vintage effects work .
It drew on an expansive and inventive , but sometimes hit - and - miss , range of handcrafted techniques , from matte painting and model construction to pyrotechnics and optical deception .
The DVD set gives this tradition an appreciative farewell .
The recollections of Mr. Donner and Mr. Mankiewicz also enhance a number of famous scenes : Glenn Ford ’s simulation of the sudden demise of adoptive father Jonathan Kent ; the breathtaking scenic resonance achieved during subsequent interludes at a hilltop cemetery and the Kent farm as young Clark prepares to leave home ; the terrace interview between Lois Lane and Superman that becomes a preamble to their celestial cruise over New York City ; Superman ’s rescue of the kitty from a treetop in Brooklyn Heights .
Of course , it ’s impossible to resist such inside stuff as Mr. Donner ’s quip about Marlon Brando ’s reliance on hidden cue cards .
In the scene where the actor must muse at philosophical length to his infant son , resting in a tiny space capsule , the director confides , “ That kid ’s diapers were worth a fortune , because Marlon ’s dialogue was written on them . ”

Apple 's poaching of Mark Papermaster from IBM to run the iPod division is getting more dramatic by the day -- the court on Friday ordered him to stop working at Apple while it sorts IBM 's lawsuit against his hiring .
For his part , Papermaster ( seriously , what a great name ) says he left IBM with good intentions and that he kept his old company fully aware of what was going on before he was hired -- a statement supported by the fact that IBM let him keep working for two weeks after he accepted the Apple gig instead of escorting him out of the building .
We 'll see how this plays out -- although Steve personally handcrafts every iPod out of a kitten , he does lean on his exec staff to keep the Benz washed and waxed .

Several brokers who left recently said in interviews that they had talked to their clients before leaving and had made sure that most would follow .
When a broker leaves , banks select new brokers to handle the accounts .
Investors who want to follow their broker generally have to move their money on their own .
And some investors , disappointed with the market this year , may choose not to follow their brokers .
One of the latest broker defections was last Friday when a group of four Merrill advisers in Westport , Conn. , resigned to set up their own shop .
The four had worked at Merrill since the late 1990s and managed $ 1 billion .
Now they are trying to attract clients to their newly created firm , called the LLBH Group .
Merrill brokers were notified this Friday about Bank of America ’s plans to retain them .
Top earners will receive a cash grant equaling up to 100 percent of their recent annual production for Merrill , and they will be allowed to keep the money if they stay at Bank of America for seven years .
The other half of brokers , though , will receive far less  ranging from 10 to 20 percent of their production , depending on their length of service and other factors .
That could be about $ 40,000 for some advisers  not a lot by the standards of Wall Street payouts of even a year ago .
On the other hand , there might not have been any payments of this sort if Merrill had remained independent .
The number of Merrill ’s brokers was up in the third quarter , but its assets under management fell by $ 8 billion in the last two quarters , not counting market losses .
That implies that the brokers are managing less money and some may be trainees , said Mr. Hintz , the analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein .
There have also been net outflows of assets at Wachovia and Citigroup over the last two quarters .
Not just any broker can hang up a shingle and lure clients from a former employer .
The ones leaving tend to have decades of experience and clients who will come to a company run in the broker ’s name rather than a big bank’s .
Their new businesses , though , may not have access to as many alternative investments for their clients .
Brokers still far outnumber independent advisers , and banks will probably remain the training ground for new brokers .
There are just 10,000 to 15,000 independent advisers , fewer than Merrill ’s herd alone , and those independent brokers manage about $ 2.4 trillion in assets , according to a Citigroup report on the industry in September .
In walks these three girls in nothing but bathing suits .
I'm in the third check - out slot , with my back to the door , so I do n't see them until they 're over by the bread .
The one that caught my eye first was the one in the plaid green two - piece .
She was a chunky kid , with a good tan and a sweet broad soft - looking can with those two crescents of white just under it , where the sun never seems to hit , at the top of the backs of her legs .
I stood there with my hand on a box of HiHo crackers trying to remember if I rang it up or not .
I ring it up again and the customer starts giving me hell .
She 's one of these cash - register - watchers , a witch about fifty with rouge on her cheekbones and no eyebrows , and I knowit made her day to trip me up .
She 'd been watching cash registers forty years and probably never seen a mistake before .
By the time I got her feathers smoothed and her goodies into a bag -- she gives me alittle snort in passing , if she 'd been born at the right time they would have burned her over in Salem -- by the time I get her on her way the girls had circled around the bread and were coming back , without a pushcart , back my way along the counters , in the aisle between the check - outs and the Special bins .
They did n't even have shoes on .
There was this chunky one , with the two - piece -- it was bright green and the seams on the bra were still sharp and her belly was still pretty pale so I guessed she just got it ( the suit ) -- there was this one , with one of those chubby berry - faces , the lips all bunched together under her nose , this one , and a tall one , with black hair that had n't quite frizzed right , and one of these sunburns right across under the eyes , and a chin that was too long -- you know , the kind of girl other girls think is very " striking " and " attractive " but never quite makes it , as they very well know , which is why they like her so much -- and then the third one , that was n't quite so tall .
She was the queen .
She kind of led them , the other two peeking around and making their shoulders round .
She did n't look around , not this queen , she just walked straight on slowly , on these long white prima donna legs .
She came down a little hard on her heels , as if she did n't walk in her bare feet that much , putting down her heels and then letting the weight move along to her toes as if she was testing the floor with every step , putting a little deliberate extra action into it .
You never know for sure how girls ' minds work ( do you really think it 's a mind in there or just a little buzz like a bee in a glassjar ? ) but you got the idea she had talked the other two into coming in here with her , and now she was showing them how to do it , walk slow and hold yourself straight .
She had on a kind of dirty - pink - - beige maybe , I do n't know -- bathing suit with a little nubble all over it and , what got me , the straps were down .
They were off her shoulders looped loose around the cool tops of her arms , and I guess as a result the suit had slipped a little on her , so all around the top of the cloth there was this shining rim .
If it had n't been there you would n't have known there could have been anything whiter than those shoulders .
With the straps pushed off , there was nothing between the top of the suit and the top of her head except just her , this clean bare plane of the top of her chest down from the shoulder bones like a dented sheet of metal tilted in the light .
I mean , it was more than pretty .
She had sort of oaky hair that the sun and salt had bleached , done up in a bun that was unravelling , and a kind of prim face .
Walking into the A & P with your straps down , I suppose it 's the only kind of face you can have .
She held her head so high her neck , coming up out o fthose white shoulders , looked kind of stretched , but I did n't mind .
The longer her neck was , the more of her there was .
She must have felt in the corner of her eye me and over my shoulder Stokesie in the second slot watching , but she did n't tip .
Not this queen .
She kept her eyes moving across the racks , and stopped , and turned so slow it made my stomach rub the inside of my apron , and buzzed to the other two , who kind of huddled against her for relief , and they all three of them went up the cat - and - dog - food - breakfast - cereal - macaroni - ri ce-raisins - seasonings - spreads - spaghetti - soft drinks - rackers - and - cookies aisle .
From the third slot I look straight up this aisle to the meat counter , and I watched them all the way .
The fat one with the tan sort of fumbled with the cookies , but on second thought she put the packages back .
The sheep pushing their carts down the aisle -- the girls were walking against the usual traffic ( not that we have one - way signs or anything ) -- were pretty hilarious .
You could see them , when Queenie 's white shoulders dawned on them , kind of jerk , or hop , or hiccup , but their eyes snapped back to their own baskets and on they pushed .
I bet you could set off dynamite in an A & P and the people would by and large keep reaching and checking oatmeal off their lists and muttering " Let me see , there was a third thing , began with A , asparagus , no , ah , yes , applesauce ! " or whatever it is they do mutter .
But there was no doubt , this jiggled them .
A few house - slaves in pin curlers even looked around after pushing their carts past to make sure what they had seen was correct .
You know , it 's one thing to have a girl in a bathing suit down on the beach , where what with the glare nobody can look at each other much anyway , and another thing in the cool of the A & P , under the fluorescent lights , against all those stacked packages , with her feet paddling along naked over our checkerboard green - and - cream rubber - tile floor .
" Oh Daddy , " Stokesie said beside me .
" I feel so faint . "
" Darling , " I said .
" Hold me tight . "
Stokesie 's married , with two babies chalked up on his fuselage already , but as far as I can tell that 's the only difference .
He 's twenty - two , and I was nineteen this April .
" Is it done ? " he asks , the responsible married man finding his voice .
I forgot to say he thinks he 's going to be manager some sunny day , maybe in 1990 when it 's called the Great Alexandrov and Petrooshki Tea Company or something .
What he meant was , our town is five miles from a beach , with a big summer colony out on the Point , but we 're right in the middle of town , and the women generally put on a shirt or shorts or something before they get out of the car into the street .
And anyway these are usually women with six children and varicose veins mapping their legs and nobody , including them , could care less .
As I say , we 're right in the middle of town , and if you stand at our front doors you can see two banks and the Congregational church and the newspaper store and three real - estate offices and about twenty - seven old free - loaders tearing up Central Street because the sewer broke again .
It 's not as if we 're on the Cape ; we 're north of Boston and there 's people in this town have n't seen the ocean for twenty years .
The girls had reached the meat counter and were asking McMahon something .
He pointed , they pointed , and they shuffled out of sight behind a pyramid of Diet Delight peaches .
All that was left for us to see was old McMahon patting his mouth and looking after them sizing up their joints .
Poor kids , I began to feel sorry for them , they could n't help it .
Now here comes the sad part of the story , at : least my family says it 's sad but I do n't think it 's sad myself .
The store 's pretty empty , it being Thursday afternoon , so there was nothing much to do except lean on the register and wait for the girls to show up again .
The whole store was like a pinball machine and I did n't know which tunnel they 'd come out of .
After a while they come around out of the far aisle , around the light bulbs , records at discount of the Caribbean Six or Tony Martin Sings or some such gunk you wonder they waste the wax on , sixpacks of candy bars , and plastic toys done up in cellophane that faIl apart when a kid looks at them anyway .
Around they come , Queenie still leading the way , and holding a little gray jar in her hand .
Slots
Three through Seven are unmanned and I could see her wondering between Stokes and me , but Stokesie with his usual luck draws an old party in baggy gray pants who stumbles up with four giant cans of pineapple juice ( what do these bums do with all that pineapple juice ' I 've often asked myself ) so the girls come to me .
Queenie puts down the jar and I take it into my fingers icy cold .
Kingfish Fancy Herring Snacks in Pure Sour Cream : 49 ¢ .
Now her hands are empty , not a ring or a bracelet , bare as God made them , and I wonder where the money 's coming from .
Still with that prim look she lifts a folded dollar bill out of the hollow at the center of her nubbled pink top .
The jar went heavy in my hand .
Really , I thought that was so cute .
Then everybody 's luck begins to run out .
Lengel comes in from haggling with a truck full of cabbages on the lot and is about to scuttle into that door marked MANAGER behind which he hides all day when the girls touch his eye .
Lengel 's pretty dreary , teaches Sunday school and the rest , but he does n't miss that much .
He comes over and says , " Girls , this is n't the beach . "
Queenie blushes , though maybe it's just a brush of sunburn I was noticing for the first time , now that she was so close .
" My mother asked me to pick up a jar of herring snacks . "
Her voice kind of startled me , the way voices do when you see the people first , coming out so flat and dumb yet kind of tony , too , the way it ticked over " pick up " and " snacks . "
All of a sudden I slid right down her voice into her living room .
Her father and the other men were standing around in ice - cream coats and bow ties and the women were in sandals picking up herring snacks on toothpicks off a big plate and they were all holding drinks the color of water with olives and sprigs of mint in them .
When my parents have somebody over they get lemonade and if it's a real racy affair Schlitz in tall glasses with " They 'll Do It Every Time " cartoons stencilled on .
" That 's all right , " Lengel said .
" But this is n't the beach . "
His repeating this struck me as funny , as if it hadjust occurred to him , and he had been thinking all these years the A & P was a great big dune and he was the head lifeguard .
He did n't like my smiling -- - as I say he does n't miss much -- but he concentrates on giving the girls that sad Sunday - school - superintendent stare .
Queenie 's blush is no sunburn now , and the plump one in plaid , that I liked better from the back -- a really sweet can -- pipes up , " We were n't doing any shopping .
We just came in for the one thing . "
" That makes no difference , " Lengel tells her , and I could see from the way his eyes went that he had n't noticed she was wearing a two - piece before .
" We want you decently dressed when you come in here . "
" We are decent , " Queenie says suddenly , her lower lip pushing , getting sore now that she remembers her place , a place from which the crowd that runs the A & P must look pretty crummy .
Fancy Herring
Snacks flashed in her very blue eyes .
" Girls , I do n't want to argue with you .
After this come in here with your shoulders covered .
It 's our policy . "
He turns his back .
That 's policy for you .
Policy is what the kingpins want .
What the others want is juvenile delinquency .
All this while , the customers had been showing up with their carts but , you know , sheep , seeing a scene , they had all bunched up on Stokesie , who shook open a paper bag as gently as peeling a peach , not wanting to miss a word .
I could feel in the silence everybody getting nervous , most of all Lengel , who asks me , " Sammy , have you rung up this purchase ? "
I thought and said " No " but it was n't about that I was thinking .
I go through the punches , 4 , 9 , GROC , TOT -- it 's more complicated than you think , and after you do it often enough , it begins to make a lttle song , that you hear words to , in my case " Hello ( bing ) there , you ( gung ) hap - py pee-pul ( splat ) " - the splat being the drawer flying out .
I uncrease the bill , tenderly as you may imagine , it just having come from between the two smoothest scoops of vanilla I had ever known were there , and pass a half and a penny into her narrow pink palm , and nestle the herrings in a bag and twist its neck and hand it over , all the time thinking .
The girls , and who'd blame them , are in a hurry to get out , so I say " I quit " to Lengel quick enough for them to hear , hoping they 'll stop and watch me , their unsuspected hero .
They keep right on going , into the electric eye ; the door flies open and they flicker across the lot to their car , Queenie and Plaid and Big Tall Goony - Goony ( not that as raw material she was so bad ) , leaving me with Lengel and a kink in his eyebrow .
" Did you say something , Sammy ? "
" I said I quit . "
" I thought you did . "
" You did n't have to embarrass them . "
" It was they who were embarrassing us . "
I started to say something that came out " Fiddle - de - doo . "
It 's a saying of my grand - mother 's , and I know she would have been pleased .
" I do n't think you know what you 're saying , " Lengel said .
" I know you do n't , " I said .
" But I do . "
I pull the bow at the back of my apron and start shrugging it off my shoulders .
A couple customers that had been heading for my slot begin to knock against each other , like scared pigs in a chute .
Lengel sighs and begins to look very patient and old and gray .
He 's been a friend of my parents for years .
" Sammy , you do n't want to do this to your Mom and Dad , " he tells me .
It 's true , I do n't .
But it seems to me that once you begin a gesture it 's fatal not to go through with it .
I fold the apron , " Sammy " stitched in red on the pocket , and put it on the counter , and drop the bow tie on top of it .
The bow tie is theirs , if you 've ever wondered .
" You 'll feel this for the rest of your life , " Lengel says , and I know that 's true , too , but remembering how he made that pretty girl blush makes me so scrunchy inside I punch the No Sale tab and the machine whirs " pee-pul " and the drawer splats out .
One advantage to this scene taking place in summer , I can follow this up with a clean exit , there 's no fumbling around getting your coat and galoshes , I just saunter into the electric eye in my white shirt that my mother ironed the night before , and the door heaves itself open , and outside the sunshine is skating around on the asphalt .
I look around for my girls , but they 're gone , of course .
There was n't anybody but some young married screaming with her children about some candy they did n't get by the door of a powder - blue Falcon station wagon .
Looking back in the big windows , over the bags of peat moss and aluminum lawn furniture stacked on the pavement , I could see Lengel in my place in the slot , checking the sheep through .
His face was dark gray and his back stiff , as if he 'djust had an injection of iron , and my stomach kind of fell as I felt how hard the world was going to be to me hereafter .
Remember how over the weekend Hank Paulson was on all the bobblehead shows saying that the bailout should extend to foreign firms trading in the US and how he was going to put together a Coalition Of The Bankrupt with other major nations for his bailout plans ?
Europe 's not interested in buying toxic debt from sinking companies .
Ulrich Wilhelm , spokesman for Angela Merkel , the German chancellor , said there was no need for “ a measure along the lines of what has been decided in the US ” .
Peer Steinbrück , the German finance minister , also made clear after a telephone conference with his contemporaries in the G7 group of leading nations that Berlin did not need to set up a rescue package .
... The French government also said it did not plan to set up a toxic asset fund or contribute to the US scheme .
British officials said they had already instigated a special liquidity scheme , but like France and Germany they did not intend to pursue a toxic asset fund .
The European Commission made clear it was not planning any emergency measures .
That 's a wee bit of a problem for Paulson 's plan , and signals exactly how much confidence European governments have in it .
And the reason they have so little confidence in Hanks plan is simple - it wo n't solve the underlying problem which is that too many banks have sailed too close to the wind and are now insolvent .
Solving that problem would require recapitalizing those banks and getting credit flows unfrozen again - which would cost yet more untold hundreds of billions and would again reward bad actors for their sins but at least would help people other than the fat - cats at those major banks .
Without such a recapitalization , though , the light at the end of the tunnel is still the oncoming train of recession .
Speaking at the Reuters 2008 Restructuring Summit , Andrew Feltus , senior portfolio manager of an $ 8 billion high - yield fund at Pioneer Investments in Boston , said the remaining banks will dominate the market , which is " good for them , not good for the borrowers and not good for the overall economy . " ... According to bankruptcy data and management company AACER , in the eight months to August there were just over 40,000 U.S. commercial bankruptcy filings , compared with 43,000 for all of 2007 and 30,000 for all of 2006 .
" The rest of 2008 will remain robust for bankruptcies , as will 2009 , " said AACER president Mike Bickford .
" The generally poor availability of credit has definitely begun to have an impact on commercial borrowers . " ... In a survey released on Monday , but compiled in August , the U.S. National Small Business Association said 67 percent of respondents said their business had been affected by the credit crunch , up from 55 percent in February .
NSBA head Todd McCracken said the survey was particularly troubling because , unlike the February poll , it only included NSBA members " who tend to be larger and well established . "
" We had expected they would have less severe problems than we saw in February , " he said .
" But instead they face more difficulty getting credit .
And there 's no sign of a turnaround .
It 's rather alarming . "

Accused of letting impressionable students see pornographic pictures as she browsed the web in her classroom , former Connecticut school teacher Julie Amero dodged felony charges last Friday by agreeing to plead guilty to a single misdemeanor charge and surrendering her state teaching credentials , according to the Hartford Courant .
But if a soon - to - be released forensic report ( .pdf ) about her hard drive is accurate , Amero 's guilty plea is hardly justice – since the school computer had adware , the anti-virus software on the computer had been discontinued , and the technical testimony at her trial was amateurish and flawed .
Amero , a substitute teacher in Norwich , Connecticut , was arrested after students in her class reported that they 'd seen pornographic images on her computer screen on Oct. 19 , 2004 .
Amero said the computer would n't stop sending pop-ups and that she did n't know what to do with the computer .
In January 2007 , she was convicted of four felony pornography charges and faced up to 40 years in prison .
Computer security experts , including Alex Eckelberry of Sunbelt Software , read about the case and immediately suspected Amero was the victim of rogue software and an overzealous prosecutor .
He and a crack team of computer forensic experts examined the hard drive for the defense on a pro-bono basis .
Based on their March 2007 report , the judge in the case set aside the conviction in June 2007 — essentially granting Amero a new trial and raising hopes the prosecution would drop the case .
Threat Level received an advance copy of the report , which has n't been publicly released .
Among its findings :
The school 's IT manager told the jury that the anti-virus software had been updated with new virus definitions in early October , just days before the incident .
But according to the system ’s antivirus update log , signatures were last updated on Aug. 31 , 2004 .
Those signatures were from June 30 , 2004 , which was the last update Computer Associates ever made for that product .
The computer had no anti-spyware or firewall software .
It also lacked any pop-up blocking technology .
On Oct. 12 , 2004 , an adware program , newdotnet , was installed onto the system , likely at the same time someone installed a ' free ' Halloween screen saver .
The IT manager told the jury he did n't know if adware or spyware was on the computer , and the police 's forensic investigator falsely told them that there was no evidence of uncontrollable pop-ups .
In fact , the forensic report found pages that reloaded more than 20 times in a second .
The jury was told that one adult web page had a red link on it , indicating that Amero had clicked on it .
In fact , the computer she was using turned visited links a green color and the HTML on the web page specified that link be red for every visitor .
Prosecutors argued that Amero should have shut off the computer and by not doing so , endangered her charges at the Kelly Middle School .
Eckelberry , who led the tech team on Amero 's behalf , said in a blog post that Amero was n't in condition to endure another trial .
Amero pleaded guilty to a disorderly conduct charge and has to pay $ 100 fine .

Après Olivier Besancenot , Martine Aubry .
Selon LeParisien.fr , deux huissiers se sont présentés lundi 6 octobre à la mairie de Lille " pour présenter une sommation au nom de Martine Aubry " de la part de la société SMP Technologies qui distribue en France le pistolet Taser X - 26 .
Interrogée le 5 octobre dans l'émission Dimanche + sur Canal + pour savoir si elle envisagerait cet équipement pour les policiers municipaux de sa ville , la maire de Lille avait répondu : " Non certainement pas .
Pour plusieurs raisons .
D'abord c'est dangereux , 290 morts en Amérique du Nord . "
Selon LeParisien.fr , le directeur de SMP Technologies , a envoyé à Mme Aubry une sommation lui donnant un délai de quarante - huit heures pour " justifier les noms des 290 victimes dont elle a parlé " .
" Quand on postule aux plus hautes responsabilités , il faut donner les preuves de ce qu'on avance sinon cela s'appelle du charlatanisme " , poursuit - il .
Si elle ne donne pas les noms , nous l'attaquerons pour diffamation ou pour dénigrement de produit " , a - t - il expliqué .
La ville de Lille confirme avoir reçu l'injonction de la société parisienne SMP , rapporte le site Internet de La Voix du Nord .
Pour la mairie , le chiffre avancé par Martine Aubry est celui figurant sur le site d'Amnesty International .
" Martine Aubry étudie ce dossier depuis des mois , déclare la mairie .
Ce chiffre est avancé par la plus grande organisation internationale en matière de droits de l'homme .
On réfléchit à notre réponse à SMP .

Republican county clerk Robert Balink lied to Colorado College students , telling them that if they ’re from outside the state they could not register to vote if their parents claimed them as dependents on their tax returns .
It seems that Balink ’s shenanigans are being used by election officials in Virginia and South Carolina as well .
More from McClatchy Newspapers :
At a news conference in Colorado Springs , Democrats also criticized Robert Balink , the El Paso County clerk and recorder , who was a delegate to the Republican National Convention , for taking other steps they said would dampen voting by college students , who are expected to heavily favor Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama .
“ When election officials spread false information about who is eligible to vote and remove , not add , polling places , we need to be concerned that eligible voters will be denied their right to vote , ” said Pat Waak , chairwoman of the Colorado Democratic Party .
Balink issued a statement saying his office had misinterpreted state law and “ mistakenly published information that was incorrect . ”
This is just another tactic by Republicans to discourage college voters , many of whom have put great effort into the Obama campaign .
The manager issued a statement on the matter :
Liz Olson , the elections manager in Colorado ’s El Paso County , said that the office “ takes full responsibility for what ’s in that document .
Nobody told us to put anything in there . ”
Martha Tierney , an attorney for the Colorado Democratic Party , said she obtained emails showing that Balink ’s office sent a misleading flier to the Colorado College president ’s office to provide students with voter - registration information and urged its circulation on campus .
The flier stated : “ What this means is that if your parents still claim you on their income tax returns , and they file that return in a state other than Colorado , you are not eligible to register to vote or vote in Colorado . ”
They are pulling similar tactics in other states , part of which the NYT reported on back in September .
Greenbaum noted that Virginia ’s elections board recently revised language on its Internet site that discouraged students from registering after reports of a similar episode at Virginia Tech , in Blacksburg , Va .
The New York Times reported Sept. 8 that a local registrar had issued two releases that incorrectly suggested dire consequences for the university ’s students who registered to vote there , including the possibility they no longer could be claimed as dependents on their parents ’ tax returns .
The flap over students ’ voting rights comes after Democrats last week filed a lawsuit in Michigan , seeking a court order barring Republicans from using lists of people facing mortgage foreclosure proceedings as a basis for challenging their voting eligibility .
Michigan Republicans denied using foreclosure lists to cast doubt about voters ’ qualifications .
The Brennan Center for Justice has Student Voting Rights section .
Here is a portion of it .
The Twenty - Sixth Amendment gives 18 to 21 year olds a voice in our democracy .
Students who leave home to attend college should have the right to choose where they vote .
In most states it is possible for students to make this choice , but the laws governing voting eligibility can be tricky , confusing , or downright restrictive .
Students can be unfairly targeted by election officials or partisan challengers and often have trouble establishing residency where they live and attend school .
This guide explains the basic residency , registration , identification , and absentee voting requirements for student voters in each of the 50 states and the D.C .
I do n’t know what the law states pertaining to this issue , but I would hope there is at least a fine that can be imposed on Balink for doing this .
At this point , it ’s getting out of hand .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
As absentee ballots pour in from U.S. troops overseas , officials are voicing concerns that many of those votes wo n't be counted .
An absentee ballot from Arlington County in Virginia shows the names of the general election candidates .
" It 's dismal , " said Rosemary Rodriguez , who works for the U.S. Elections Assistance Commission , a non-partisan group .
" These are the voters that are in some cases preserving our liberties and out there with their lives on the line . "
Rodriguez estimates that in the last general election , only about 30 percent of overseas military ballots were actually returned and counted .
" It 's disenfranchising our military and frankly I think it 's very unpatriotic , " said retired Navy Lt. Melissa Cox Boss .
A part of the problem is that each state has its own rules for absentee voting , and those rules can change in the middle of an election season .
In Virginia , for example , the federal write - in ballot required a witness ' signature and address .
That proved confusing for soldiers overseas because there was no box provided for a witness address .
Rokey Suleman , the Fairfax County registrar , initially said he would have to discard 63 votes because voters neglected to provide a witness address .
" These ballots that are n't being met -- I can't accept as valid ballots at this point .
If the law changes , I welcome a review of the law .
I think the law is horrible , " he said .
Late Monday , Virginia 's attorney general agreed , saying all county registrars could ignore that part of the law .
Other areas , like Arlington County , refused to disqualify the absentee ballots that were filled out improperly , contributing to the the AG 's decision to intervene .
Another part of the problem is that delivering mail from a battlefield can be challenging , according to Rep. Kevin McCarthy .
McCarthy , R - California , says absentee ballots mailed from war zones are not getting to county registrars fast enough to be legally counted .
" With all the modernization that we have , we should be able to move these ballots , track them at the same time , bring the modernization and technology we have today to make sure our heroes across this world get treated fairly , " he said .
McCarthy said he is pushing a bill through Congress that would address these issues , but not in time for this election .
Overseas absentee ballots were at the center of the Florida recount during the 2000 presidential election between George Bush and Al Gore .
Bush aides and Republican surrogates blasted their Democratic rivals for having overseas absentee ballots disqualified in Florida counties , many for lack of postmarks .
Many of those ballots were presumed to have been from service members supporting Bush .
Joe Lieberman , the Democratic vice presidential candidate , denied that charge and said that the disputed votes deserve the " benefit of doubt . "
" [ Gore ] and I would never authorize and would not tolerate a campaign that was aimed specifically at invalidating ballots from members of our armed services , and I 've been assured that there were more absentee ballots from non-military voters that were ultimately disqualified , " he said during an interview on NBC's " Meet the Press . "
More than a month after the election , the Florida Supreme Court upheld two state court rulings that cleared the way to count thousands of ballots in predominantly Republican Seminole and Martin counties .

Last year ,
The New York Times reported that UPS managed to save 3 million gallons of gas in 2006 by altering the routes of delivery trucks to avoid left turns .
According to them , the company uses software called " package flow " to map out daily routes for drivers .
Clearly , the method or " algorithm " this software employs to design efficient routes has sizeable economic ( and greenhouse gas ) consequences .
And , not only is it far from perfect , but the general routing problem is so difficult that , well , if in the course of reading this article you happen upon an efficient solution , you will become immediately famous , at least among computer scientists .
The problem the UPS driver faces , generally speaking , is that of the " traveling salesman , " in which our hero seeks the shortest possible round trip route given a list of required stops .
Arising in road trip planning , school bus pickups , parking meter coin collection , power cable layout , and microchip design , it is not a new problem .
The famous 19th century Irish mathematician Sir William Rowan Hamilton , who at age 12 once defeated the notorious American " calculating boy " Zerah Colburn in an arithmetic - off , invented the " Icosian game , " in which players attempt to find round - trip routes through a twelve - sided figure such that each vertex is visited exactly once and no edge is visited twice ( Regarding the spin - off " Traveler 's Dodecahedron , " the puzzle museum website states , " the rules have been simplified and made much more attractive than the original . "
The puzzle museum also notes that the Icosian game is more of a puzzle than a game . )
Inspired by Hamilton 's early work and puzzle - making prowess , mathematicians in Vienna and Cambridge began studying the general form of the traveling salesman problem ( TSP for short ) in the 1930s .
In 1972 , UC Berkeley Professor Richard Karp published perhaps the most famous paper written to date in computer science , called " Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems . "
The point , broadly speaking , is that most problems that appear difficult to solve exactly most likely are .
Rather than proving that all kinds of problems have no easy solution , Karp gave a clever method for showing that many different sorts of problems are equivalent in a certain sense : if you provide a magic fast solver for hard problem A , Karp uses it to build a fast solver for hard problem B .
As a result , researchers are amassing an impressive set of hard problems , all reducible to each other , so that if anyone ever found a magic solver for just one of them , well , things would get pretty crazy .
A variant of the TSP , that of undirected Hamiltonian Circuits ( same Hamilton ) , was in Karp 's original list of 21 problems .
To understand what this means for the salesman , consider : A TSP with 5 cities has 12 possible routes ; with 10 cities there are 181,440 possibilities ; with 61 cities there are more possible paths than there are atoms in the universe .
Seriously .
In computer science terms , the solution space is exponential — adding one city roughly doubles the number of possible paths .
Karp 's result suggests that in general , determining the optimal path for the salesman is a matter of checking all those possibilities — though shortcuts may exist , none are likely to lift the exponential burden .
And though computers are growing more powerful , even IBM 's supercomputer , Blue Gene , which can perform a ridiculous 500 thousand billion computations per second , would have little hope of solving a 30 - city TSP by the brute - force approach .
Instead , computer scientists spend much time devising heuristics — approximate methods for dealing with intractable situations .
Here 's a simple heuristic for the traveling salesman : when trying to decide which stop to visit next on the tour , pick the closest remaining one .
While in many cases , this rule yields a route much less efficient than the optimal one , it works reasonably well on average .
Many papers have been written about more complex heuristics for the TSP .
For example , in 1997 Marco Dirigo used a simulated ant colony to explore the space of solutions , iteratively refining paths left by virtual ants ( virtual pheromones were also involved ) .
The TSP variant that UPS would like to solve is no Icosian puzzle game .
There are 95,000 trucks delivering packages every day , and each one needs a route assignment .
These routes are not independent : removing a stop from one means adding it to another .
The resulting problem is staggeringly difficult to solve exactly , and good heuristics are necessary .
The " no - left - turn " innovation is a heuristic that helps realize the difference between driving time and driving distance .
Or , as Jim Winestock , a UPS vice president in Atlanta , explains , " I know it drives my wife crazy , but I 've been known to pass up drug stores , three or four on the left - hand side of the road , just to get to the one on the right . "

You thought that $ 700 billion will be the US banks ’ toxic assets ?
It wo n’t – not by a long chalk .
There ’s another bunch of toxic mortgages just waiting around the corner , in 2010 and on , which will be just as bad , and hit more people in the US .
The graph above has been swimming around a bit ( here and here , particularly ) but it ’s worth reading the analysts ’ note it originated in .
( For a version of the graph with the axis in years , see the second link .
It ’s just as big and scary . )
The work comes in a Credit Suisse note titled “ Mortgage Liquidity du Jour : Underestimated No More ” ( that links to Scribd , where you can download it yourself and groan ) .
The timing is interesting – in March 2007 , who ’d heard of the credit crunch ?
It had n’t happened : those Bear Stearns funds had n’t turned sour .
So these people were miles ahead of the curve .
Too bad too few people listened to them .
( Let ’s hear it for Ivy L Zelman , Dennis McGill , Justin Speer and Alan Ratner .
Hope they ’ve kept their jobs – they at least deserve to . )
After walking you through the craziness of the US housing market , where people were fighting for market share , and damn the consequences – “ As one private builder indicated to us , in the past nine months anybody with a pulse that was interested in buying a home was able to get financing , which certainly helps explain the poor performance thus far of 2006 loan vintages ” – they look at the growth of “ exotic ” mortgage products .
You ’ve heard of subprime , of course , but probably not Alt - A – which is a step above subprime , typically ( in the past ) for people in the US who ’d had a mortgage go bad , or missed payments .
Alt - A exploded to become 20 % of the market in 2006 .
And there it lies in wait .
The analysts note :
The “ big brother ” of interest only mortgages is the negative amortization mortgage , which in recent years has gained popularity .
The neg - am mortgage , which is often used synonymously with “ option ARM ” , provides homebuyers with an extra payment option each month .
In addition to paying the fully amortized payment or just interest costs , an option ARM actually allows borrowers to make a “ minimum ” payment that is less than interest costs .
The minimum payment option results in a homebuyer actually having negative equity in their home , absent an increase in the value of the house ( i.e. the borrower owes more at the end of the month than it did at the beginning ) .
I actually had a “ mortgage ” like that once – in 1988 .
It was sold to me in the UK by Security Pacific , though it was n’t interest - only – there was an endowment attached ( thank God ; it ’ll mature some time in the next few years ) .
But it did let you not pay all the interest , which was then rolled into the principal ( the amount you owe overall , an on which interest is charged ) .
It seemed like magic – at first .
My first use of a spreadsheet was to model our payments ( I bought with a friend ) .
Abruptly I realised we were going to be in deep and hot water if we did n’t rapidly increase our payments .
And when interest rates shot up following the ERM debacle , it was suddenly time to get straight out of that mortgage .
But now meet our newest friend , the option ARM ( ajustable - rate mortgage ) :
Similar to an interest only mortgage , option ARMs only provide borrowers with these payment options for a finite timeframe , which sets the stage for a significant payment shock when payments are recast to the fully amortizing rate at the current interest rate level .
Depending on the amount and terms of the loan , monthly payments could increase in excess of 40 % upon rate reset on these types of mortgages .
Option ARMs are super toxic to borrowers .
That ’s all you need to know , really .
And if they ’re toxic to borrowers , they ’re toxic to lenders .
They ’re the light blue -y ones in the graph .
They do n’t even begin to show up until 2009 ( 24 months from the start of the graph in Jan 2007 ) .
As shown in Exhibit 29 [ one of the graphs ] , an estimated 23 % of total purchase originations in 2006 were interest - only or negative - amortization mortgages .
According to our private builder survey , interest - only and option ARMs represented 24 % of total home sales in 2006 , in - line with our market - wide estimates .
This was down slightly from the levels seen in 2004 and 2005 , most likely due to the decline in investors in high priced markets , as well as lenders tightening qualification standards
The trouble though is that while the subprime bomb has exploded , the option - ARM still has n’t .
People wo n’t be able to make the payments – especially if things are worse in the US than they are now .
( At the time of the note , the analysts were able to talk breezily about “ recovery ” as they looked past house price falls .
Nobody ’s saying that word now . )
Another point that a friend ( who ’s an IP lawyer who understands all these things as he works in the City and deals with thme ) is that in the US , a mortgage attaches to the property – not the person .
If you ’re in negative equity and you hand in the keys , you ’re not liable for the outstanding loan .
Sure , it will affect your credit score , which does affect your ability to get credit , but that ’s not the same as what you ’d have in the UK , where you ’d pretty much have to declare bankruptcy .
So things are even worse for the US banks and mortgage lenders than you might have been led to believe – and that ’s coming up in two years ’ time .
Ca n’t we reflate the housing market , some people wonder , by cutting interest rates ?
Mark Shuttleworth ( he flew to the moon , you know , and is behind Ubuntu ) says it ’s a solvency problem , not a liquidity problem :
Dramatic easing of interest rates will help to slow down the pace at which we have to deal with the bankruptcies , but they wo n’t change the cold reality of the situation , and they run the very real risk of making things worse by encouraging another round of speculation based on free money .
We are once again in a situation where the US discount rate is effectively a negative real rate of interest , as a gift to the banks , but staying there for any length of time puts us back into a state of addiction .
Next time we ’ll deal with credit default swaps .
Those make Alt - A ARMs look like a safe investment …

BANKS in the UK were fucked yesterday , after a landmark court ruling .
A High Court judge said the Office of Fair Trading can now take a good , long run-up at the banks and fuck them into the middle of next week .
Coming hard on the heels of the sub - prime loan crisis , the industry is now bracing itself for a shafting of absolutely humongous proportions .
Mr Justice Smith stressed his judgement did not necessarily mean the banks deserved to be fucked , but warned that a comprehensive humping was all but inevitable .
Julian Cook , an analyst at Donnelly - McPartlin , said : " Remember that bit in Raiders of the Lost Ark when the big , baldy German guy is punching Indiana Jones and then turns round to see the propellers coming straight towards him ?
That 's how fucked they are . "
Meanwhile , millions of account holders are looking forward to playing their part in fucking the banks .
Tom Logan , a sales executive from Lincoln , said : " They 've been charging me £ 35 every time I go 20 p overdrawn and then using my money to buy peice - of - shit American mortgages .
" There are simply no words to describe how much I am going to enjoy fucking them . "
Bank chief executives last night demanded an urgent meeting with the chancellor to ask if there is anything he can do to prevent the imminent fuck - fest .
A Treasury spokesman said : " Holy shit , they 're even more fucked than us . "

This speech was delivered at the Ron Paul Revolution March in Washington , DC , on July 12 , 2008 .
" If there be one principle more deeply rooted in the mind of every American , " Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1791 , " it is that we should have nothing to do with conquest . "
We are here today because our bipartisan governing elite and its media apologists have turned Mr. Jefferson on his head to America ’s detriment .
Today ’s leaders in both parties unrelentingly intervene in the affairs of other nations and regions , and , by all appearances , care not a damn about preserving America ’s independence .
These individuals aspire to be celebrated citizens of the world , believing that being an American citizen is a hum - drum affair best left to the rest of us who pay for their imperial aspirations and interventionist wars with our taxes and soldier - children .
When we celebrated Independence Day eight days ago , no party leader had the moral courage to tell Americans the truth , which is that in the last 50 years both parties have eviscerated our independence in regard to the single most important foreign policy issue — that is , the decision on whether or not to go to war .
Both parties , for example , have failed to move the United States to energy security since the first Arab - led oil embargo in 1973 .
Instead of freeing our economy from the Arab - held dagger that is pointed at its heart , American presidents — Democratic and Republican — have shamefully groveled , begging for more oil , from their energy - producing masters in Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , and other Muslim police states .
The same presidents have so enormously overspent the public treasury that they have put America further in the thrall of the Arab tyrants who buy an ever - increasing portion of our debt .
Because of this cowardly leadership , Americans find they have lost control of the decision of whether to go to war .
If anti-Saudi unrest in the kingdom ’s Eastern Province ever severely curtails oil production , U.S. soldiers and Marines will automatically deploy to secure the Saudi police state and restore production .
And the reality of automatic war for oil goes beyond the Arab world .
By 2012 , the United States will receive 20 - percent of its crude from Africa ’s Niger Delta and Gulf of Guinea .
If production in that region — which already is plagued by insurgent attacks — is ever significantly reduced , U.S. soldiers and Marines will be automatically deployed there to restore production .
And if you think the insurgencies being fought today in Iraq and Afghanistan are nightmares , just wait until our men and women are fighting in the Niger Delta ’s 27,000 square kilometers of swamp and forest .
We also have lost control of the peace - or - war decision because of our bipartisan elite ’s decision to involve America almost inextricably in the unending and unendable war been Arabs and Israelis .
Ignoring and even ridiculing the Founding Fathers ’ explicit guidance to avoid involving the United States in other peoples ’ wars , both parties have not only done so in the Middle East , but have blithely involved us in other peoples ’ religious wars .
Can there be any better definition of an insane foreign policy than the one that today finds the United States not only being involved voluntarily in someone else ’s war , but backing both of the major antagonists in that war — Israel and Saudi Arabia ?
By being the main financier and unquestioning protector of Israel , and the only protector of the fundamentally anti-American Saudi state , Washington has created a situation in which America will be drawn into the next Arab - Israeli war , no matter what the wishes or interests of the American people .
Having thus all but negated the ability of the United States to abstain from wars over oil and wars between Arabs and Israelis , our political elite has completed this axis of doom for Americans by their limitless zeal for democracy crusading overseas , a perversion of what America stands for that can only lead to war and more war .
Our elite ’s democracy - crusade in Iraq has destabilized the entire region , creating new threats to oil supplies and driving up their price .
It has cost American taxpayers nearly three - quarters of a trillion dollars , and killed 4,200 of their soldier - children and wounded 30,000 more .
A few more such missions accomplished in the democracy - building realm will bankrupt our nation .
And the still - present threat of another democracy - imposing war against Iran — which is a more democratic state than any of Washington ’s Islamofascist Arab state allies — would be a negative achievement of epic proportions .
War on Iran would be disguised as a campaign to liberate Iranians , but in reality would be nothing more than war to protect Israel .
Such a war , moreover , would unite the entire Muslim world — 1.4 billion Sunnis and Shia , if you are counting — in a jihad against the United States .
Our bipartisan governing elite , then , has brought Americans face - to - face with war at every turn :
Wars over oil ; wars over the religious conflicts of foreigners in which no genuine U.S. national interest at stake ; and wars to impose secular democracy on people who will resist it to the death .
This situation is surely the antithesis of what the Founders intended when they designed a constitutional system meant to limit the chance of an arbitrary government that inevitably leads to tyranny .
The Founders knew — and Americans must relearn — that there is no better definition of tyranny than one that finds an entire nation led into war by the negligence , personal beliefs , or even whims of a single individual — be he or she a king , a dictator , or a popularly elected president .
Americans must begin to reestablish their control over the decision to go to war by removing from office an interventionist elite that is ready to destroy the American republic and replace it with an expanding American empire .
The question , of course , is how to begin to draw back from the blank - check war commitments our leaders have given to foreigners ?
Let me suggest several ways .
We must accelerate conversion to alternative energies , expand nuclear power , and further exploit U.S. fossil fuel reserves .
Nothing should be allowed to deter the ingenuity and initiative of Americans from gaining energy self - sufficiency .
Demands for absolute protection for Arctic hares or shrimp - inhabited reefs , at the cost of dead Marines and soldiers , should be ignored .
Beyond oil , America has no national interests in the Arab Peninsula region — save the freedom of navigation , which the U.S. Navy can ensure — and as our energy dependence ends , this will be clear .
Self - sufficiency will allow America to stop protecting the Gulfs ’ tyrannies which now cloud our economic destiny , export religious hatred for us , and make our advocacy of freedom appear to be pure and even spectacular hypocrisy .
It also will end the current , cruel reality that sees some portion of the price U.S. parents pay at the pump flow from oil - rich Arabs to the Islamic insurgents who are their killing the soldier - children in Iraq and Afghanistan .
We must stay out of other peoples ’ wars , particularly their religious wars .
America now stands as an abject loser in the Israel - Hizballah conflict ; the Israel - Palestine war ; and the economic strangling of HAMAS ; indeed , America is in part losing to the Islamists because of its absolute backing of Israel and its blind - eye for the Saudis ’ blatant and aggressive jihad - spreading .
America must withdraw from this savagery .
No important aspect of American life or security would be negatively impacted if Palestine or Israel or both disappeared tomorrow , and we are tied to the Saudi tyranny only because of the cowardice of U.S. politicians .
Americans also must reject their political class ’s patently absurd contention that U.S. and Israeli national security interests are identical .
America is now shedding blood and treasure because our country ’s Israel - first citizens and their journals — men like Douglas Feith , Paul Wolfowitz , Norman Podhoretz , Victor Davis Hanson , James Woolsey , and such journals as the Weekly Standard , the National Review , Commentary , and the Wall Street Journal — provoked a hubristic war based on the idiot idea that a state could be created in Muslim Iraq that was not anti-Israeli .
These men severely and permanently compromised Israel ’s security from the moment the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq began .
Moreover , it is not a fixable situation because a potentially pro-Israel regime in Iraq exists only in the ahistorical and fervid imaginings of U.S. citizen Israel - firsters , who are , when all is said and done , Israel ’s worst and most lethal enemies .
The cost of unqualified U.S. support for Israel has heretofore been measured in the expenditure of dollars and political capital , and as such has been acquiesced in or ignored by Americans inured to their government ’s prodigal waste of national assets .
We now have transitioned into a situation where the cost of such support for Israel is being measured in the blood and lives of the children of American parents .
That cost will quickly become obvious , abhorrent , and utterly unacceptable to those parents .
We must force the Congress to end its supine abdication to the Executive of its sole power to declare war by electing representatives pledged to restoring constitutionality — and therefore sanity — to our war - making process .
Infamously , no Congress has declared war since December 8th , 1941 , and yet we have repeatedly seen the American people dragged into wars because one man and his advisers have decided it is the right thing to do .
Resolutions allowing the president to use military force offensively are cowardly acts that surrender constitutional prerogatives in a manner that allows senators and congressman to have it both ways : they can applaud the troops if the war goes well , or they can snipe at and undermine the president if a war goes belly up .
Our post - war history is littered with failed wars that were initiated by the president and which divided Americans amongst themselves .
Perhaps the restoration of the Founders ’ intent on the issue of war - making will allow us both to win wars abroad and not wage them against each other at home .
Finally , and most important , we must stop trying to spread democracy abroad by military , financial , humanitarian , or political intervention .
No young American should die for the insane goal of " giving the people of Iraq a possibility of embracing democracy , " a phrase used ad infinitum by President Bush and other Western leaders .
No small " r " republican government like ours has the right to spend the lives of its young in military crusades for such a patently unobtainable abstractions as giving liberty , justice , and democracy to foreigners .
U.S. foreign policy must revert to what it was before the historical anomaly called the Cold War gave license to U.S. politicians to become democracy - mongering interventionists .
Foreign policy defends who we are ; it does not and cannot define who we are .
Foreign policy need do only one thing : protect America so as to allow the domestic expansion of liberty , freedom , and equality of conditions .
If no additional foreigner ever votes in an election , Americans would be no worse off .
Washington ’s efforts to build democracies abroad has a track record of making America less safe , not more safe , and , may I ask , is there a better definition of pure waste , than spending the lives of our Marines or soldiers so Mrs. Muhammad can vote in an Iraqi or Afghan election .
The post -Cold War , democracy - crusading of U.S. administrations has impoverished us in treasure , blood , domestic political unity , and what has been called the " rightful influence of our republican example . "
We must return to the Founders ’ goal for America , to be , " the well - wisher of freedom and independence for all " but " the champion and vindicator only of her own . "
In closing , let me urge that none of us lose heart or fall prey to despair .
Though the dangers that confront our republic are many and dire , the future of America , as always , is in the hands of Americans .
All of those in attendance here today and the millions more listening or watching across this broad land know that the greatest danger America faces comes not from China , or from Russia , or from global warming , or from Islamic extremism , but rather it comes from the members of our own bipartisan governing elite .
There is not a nickel ’s worth of difference between President Bush and former president Clinton ; between Senator McCain and Senator Obama ; between Speaker Pelosi and Mayor Giuliani , or between any of the foregoing and their pro-empire , Israel - first cheerleaders at the Council of Foreign Relations , the National Endowment for Democracy , and the America - Israel Political Action Committee .
They are all rank and reckless interventionists , bent on involving America in other peoples ’ wars and content to see our republic destroyed by their ego - building and democracy - crusading military adventures overseas .
The greatest danger to the republic lies in the imperial ambitions of these men and women ; they are a mortal threat to the American people and all that they have built here in North America over the last 232 years .
And no one , may I say , has done more to alert his countrymen to this danger than that soft - spoken gentleman from Texas , Dr. Ron Paul .
In a campaign made luminous and memorable by this man ’s personal integrity , intellectual honesty and consistency , unwavering allegiance to the Founders ’ principles , and most of all , his limitless moral courage , Dr. Paul ’s efforts have created space in the public square for me and many others to stand and support him in favoring the best foreign policy for America , the foreign policy of non-intervention .
While there is much hard and lengthy work still to do , Dr. Paul has made a lasting start for all of us in the effort to reclaim our republic from the war - mongering hands of our interventionist elite .
Dr. Paul , as another patriot - insurgent named Thomas Paine once wrote , has found that " tyranny , like hell , is not easily conquered " but Dr. Paul has proven again and again that he is neither a summer soldier nor a sunshine patriot , but rather a man who knows " the harder the conflict , the more glorious the triumph " and who today , for his efforts against all odds , " deserves the love and thanks of man and woman . "
May God always bless Dr. Paul and may God also give us all the moral courage to carry on to success the campaign to destroy interventionism that he has so nobly begun .
Let me close by expressing my deep appreciation for the chance to speak here today , and let me leave you with the words Thomas Paine used to describe what it takes to make a successful revolution .
" I call not upon a few , but upon all , " Paine wrote in December , 1776 ,
not on this state or that state , but on every state ; up and help us ; lay your shoulders to the wheel ; better have too much force than too little , when so great an object is at stake .
Let it be told to the future world that , in the depth of winter , when nothing but hope and virtue could survive , the city and country , alarmed at one common danger , came forth to meet and repulse it .
Say not that thousands are gone , turn out your tens of thousands ; throw not the burden of the day upon Providence but " show your faith by your works , " that God may bless you .
It matters not where you live , or what rank of life you hold , the evil or the blessing will reach you .
The far and the near … the rich and the poor , will suffer or rejoice alike .
The heart that feels not now , is dead ; the blood of his children will curse his cowardice , who shrinks back at a time when a little might have saved the whole , and made them happy .
I love the man who can smile in trouble , that can gather strength from distress , and can grow brave from reflection .
It is the business of little minds to shrink ; but he whose heart is firm , and whose conscience approves his conduct , will pursue his principles unto death .
Paine closed this passage with words that could just as well have been spoken by Dr. Paul and which should be spoken by all of us :
I thank God that I fear not .
I see no real cause for fear .
I know our situation well , and can see the way out of it .
And the way out for America is , of course , the Founders ’ strict non-interventionist foreign policy that Dr. Paul so bravely champions .

COLUMBUS --
It is impossible to cross-check nearly 700,000 new or revised voter registrations filed this year without crashing Ohio 's registration system , Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner said Thursday .
She added that the entire system will have to be rebuilt after next week 's election so that fraud can be more easily detected .
Brunner said she discovered the system was too fragile to double - check the names , which her staff began trying to do earlier this month after the Ohio Republican Party sued the Democratic secretary to force her to check the registrations .
At the time , even as she fought the lawsuit and eventually won at the U.S. Supreme Court , Brunner said she was making an effort to cross-check the registrations against state driver 's license and federal social security records .
" I spoke too soon , " Brunner said during a press briefing on election day procedures for Ohio , again expected to be a closely watched state in the presidential election .
Earlier this month , Brunner told The Plain Dealer that a cursory review by her staff had found about 200,000 discrepancies in the newly filed or revised registrations since Jan .
1 . That does not mean each was a case of fraud , but could mean someone incorrectly jotted down a driver 's license or Social Security digit on the applications .
But the Ohio Republican Party suggested that some of those cases could amount to voter fraud and that Brunner , as the state 's top elections officer , was obligated to double - check the information .
Brunner argued that federal rules only require the state to have a system in place for double - checking registrations but do not require her to make the checks .
Brunner said in recent days she has consulted with contractors who have concluded that there is no way the current voter registration system can handle massive checks of newly registered voters .
Instead , Brunner said she was informed that each of the 700,000 registrations would have to be hand - checked one - by - one , which could not be completed before Tuesday 's election and which Brunner is not obligated to do .
Meanwhile , this week , the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it would not force Brunner to complete the checks and release names of newly registered voters with mis-matching information .
Republicans in Congress had made the unusual request , first asking the Justice Department directly and then asking President Bush to lean on the department .
Brunner said the Justice Department would need a court order to force her to complete the checks and release names and added that she has been assured that no such litigation will be filed before Tuesday .
In pledging to rebuild Ohio 's voter registration database , Brunner said she hopes to head off any future litigation on this matter .
The secretary also outlined a host of new election procedures that are different from 2004 , when Ohio 's election process was mocked for having long lines , broken voting machines and unprepared poll workers .
Brunner said her office has addressed each of those issues .
And she said anyone in line at 7:30 p.m. when polls officially close will be allowed to cast ballots .
Brunner said she expects an unprecedented 80 percent of Ohio's 8.3 million registered voters to turn out .
The push for early voting and absentee voting will help ease the Election Day crush of voters , she said .
The secretary figures about 25 percent of those who plan to vote will already have done so before Tuesday .
Brunner also said that Ohioans will probably go to bed Tuesday night still uncertain who voters here have picked to be the next president of the United States .
" People have said to me , ' Do we think that we 'll have all the final results in by election day ? '
That would be by midnight , " said Brunner .
" Probably not .
Will we have a good sense of what the overall results are in Ohio by midnight ?
I think we will . "
Here 's an early voting story from a medical student in Evansville , Ind . :
I squeaked in just before the 7 pm deadline to find two very frustrated poll workers and a line of a couple dozen people , due to problems with the computerized voting system not accepting people 's driver 's licenses .
It was taking about 7 - 10 minutes per person just to get the computer to accept them as valid and to print out their ballot , causing very long delays .
For me the most moving moment came when the family in front of me , comprising probably 4 generations of voters ( including an 18 year old girl voting for her first time and a 90 - something hunched - over grandmother ) , got their turn to vote .
When the old woman left the voting booth she made it about halfway to the door before collapsing in a nearby chair , where she began weeping uncontrollably .
When we rushed over to help we realized that she was n't in trouble at all but she had not truly believed , until she left the booth , that she would ever live long enough to cast a vote for an African - American for president .
Anyone who does n't think that African - American turnout will absolutely SHATTER every existing record is in for a very rude surprise .
There were about 20 people in front of me but remarkably not a single person left the room without voting over the 2 hours it took to get through the line .

For the past few days , I have been seeing signs that John McCain was n’t comfortable with the insinuations that Barack Obama is a Muslim or a terrorist , and this evening at a Minnesota town hall meeting , he defended Obama when one of his supporters called him an Arab terrorist .
The woman began her question with , “ I ’m scared of Barack Obama … he ’s an Arab terrorist … ”
She did n’t get a chance to continue because McCain grabbed the microphone out of her hand and said , “ No , no ma’am .
He ’s a decent family man with whom I happen to have some disagreements . ”
McCain did his usual stump speech , but it is clear that he came into Lakeville , MN ready to make a point .
He went out of his way to stress his respect for Obama , “ I respect Sen. Obama and his accomplishments . ”
The crowd booed .
McCain got angry and continued , “ I want EVERYONE to be respectful , and lets make sure we are . ”
It is looked like McCain definitely had an agenda to deal with these out of control smears .
A woman later said that she was afraid to raise her child in a world where Obama was president , and McCain replied , “ Well , I do n’t want him to be president , either .
I would n’t be running if I did .
But , you do n’t have to be scared to have him be President of the United States . ”

This shift in attitude has been building since Palin accused Obama of palling around with terrorist last weekend .
After the backlash on the Ayers attacks started the campaign stopped calling Obama and a terrorist and starting claiming that Obama had been dishonest about his association with Ayers .
Next came the statement telling his fellow Republicans to stop using Obama ’s middle name in attacks , and today , McCain defends Obama as a decent guy who nobody should be afraid of .
To a guy like McCain it is one thing to question an opponent ’s honesty and positions , but it quite different to call him a terrorist .
To McCain , honor is very important , and I think what he has been seeing this week in the crowds at his rallies was something that he was ashamed of .
What happened this evening was something that the John McCain of 2000 would have done .
Even though he got booed by his own crowd , he delivered some real straight talk .
All that being said , it seems like McCain is having trouble controlling some elements in his campaign , so I doubt that these Obama is a Arab terrorist smears will stop .
I think John McCain realizes something that these right wing zanies at his rallies do n’t .
He has absolutely no chance of winning this election , if his supporters push the Obama is a terrorist line .
McCain is fond of saying that he would lose an election to win a war , and tonight he revealed that he personally may be unwilling win an election dishonorably .

Rachael Moshman looks at the explosive rise in a student struggle that is challenging Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and his proposed cuts in education .
AN ESTIMATED 1 million people converged on Rome October 30 for a general strike against sweeping cuts in education proposed by Italy 's right - wing government .
Across the country , nine out of 10 schools were closed for demonstrations that day .
In Milan , 200,000 people hit the streets -- the largest demonstration in Milan since the first invasion of Iraq in 1991 .
Overtaking the city , high school collectives , university students and others filled the Piazza Duomo , with antiracist banners displayed prominently .
Some 5,000 students formed a sit-in in front of the Milan Stock Exchange .
Chanting , " We wo n't pay for your crisis , " participants pointed to the irony of riot cops protecting the financiers who contributed to the country 's economic crisis .
The struggle began when the Italian Minister of Education Mariastella Gelmini made a proposal for deep cuts to Italy 's public education budget .
It was the latest in a series of anti-working class measures by the right - wing government , including a harsh crackdown on immigrants .
Mass protests of Italian students in October shut most universities and took over city streets
The Gelmini law , however , sparked a strong response from students , teachers , parents and other concerned citizens , triggering a month of ongoing demonstrations against the law throughout Italy .
Hundreds of thousands have taken to the streets to demand a stop to attacks on funding for public education .
The Gelmini law , passed by the Italian Senate on October 29 , allows multi-billion euro cuts to public education over the next few years , putting up to 130,000 teachers ' and researchers ' jobs at risk , as well as eliminating resources for education and research .
The law also provides for the privatization of schools and the segregation of " foreign " students from their Italian peers .
While Gelmini claims the segregation will be positive for foreign children , allowing them to learn Italian , progressives on the left consider this policy another racist , anti-immigrant attack led by the newly elected conservative right government of Italy .
With the right in firm control of Italy 's legislature , some 162 Senators voted in favor of the Gelmini law , while 134 voted against it .
Leaders of center - left opposition Democratic Party are pushing for a national referendum to repeal the law .
The Democratic Party is the major player in the center - left Union coalition , which was swept out of office in April elections by Berlusconi and his posse of right - wing and fascist - friendly coalition allies .
A massive and growing student movement , however , has chosen to not rely on political parties to challenge Berlusconi 's attacks on public education .
Hundreds of thousands of students have been demonstrating in the streets and occupying schools -- not only to stop to the Gelmini law , but to protest the corruption and nepotism they see within the university system .
As classes started for elementary schools and high schools in September , angry and indignant reactions from teachers , students , and parents against the Gelmini Law triggered the first demonstrations .
On October 3 , a network of high school student collectives marched in the streets of many cities in Italy .
In October , classes started in the public universities of Italy , and a student movement quickly formed around opposition to the Gelmini law .
Italy faces a recession , spurred by the financial crisis centered in the U.S. While Berlusconi called the budget cuts a " rationalization , " and Gelmini promised to " bring seriousness and merit back to public schools , " a member of the General Confederation of Labor Unions ( CGiL ) stated , " These are not reforms , these are just budgetary cuts .
The government is destroying public schools and replacing them with a private system . "
Demonstrators quickly made the connection between their country 's budget concerns and their government 's attack on their hard - won rights to public education .
Their slogans are , " Cut resources to bankers and war missions , rather than to schools and universities ! " and " We are the coming society !
We are not the problem , we are the solution ! "
The student movement also stressed that it is an anti-racist movement and a " Nazi - free zone , " acknowledging their opposition to the Gelmini law 's segregationist provisions , but also their opposition to the neo - fascist elements active in Italy 's political scene .
ON OCTOBER 17 , a national strike called against the Berlusconi government adopted an anti-Gelmini law theme .
Three hundred thousand people marched in Rome .
A breakaway march of students outflanked the police , reached the Ministry of Education and successfully blockaded it .
In Milan , student marches swarmed throughout the city , forming blockades and paralyzing traffic .
Protesters put the Milan Education Department " under siege . "
In the next several weeks , actions and student marches continued to ripple across the country .
Students successfully occupied universities , forcing classes to be held outside .
In some cases , these classes have turned into all - night public assemblies , where students and citizens talk through the political ideas that support their actions .
Since the beginning of these actions , attendance at the assemblies has grown larger , as has participation in the movement against the Gelmini law overall .
On October 29 , when the Italian Senate voted to pass the Gelmini law , senators were forced to suspend the vote twice as thousands of students besieged their building , demanding the withdrawal of the decree .
While Berlusconi stated , " It 's a pity to see so many young people fooled and misled by the left , " the passage of the law was countered by thousands of students taking to the streets of Rome .
In the Piazza Navona , student demonstrators clashed with fascist student organizations , who attacked demonstrators carrying long sticks wrapped in the tri-colors of the Italian flag .
The fascists were beaten back , though , by demonstrators and were eventually arrested .
In Milan and Naples , students occupied train station platforms and blocked trains .
The general strike in the public education sector was called for October 30 , the following day .
Berlusconi has scheduled the final approval of the Gelmini law for November 29 .
In the meantime , the Italian left is witnessing a remarkable revival of popular action , just as organized left political parties are being forced to re-evaluate their strategy after their failure to defend a progressive agenda inside Italian parliamentary politics .
This new movement is capable of fighting the political trend that only months ago elected a right - wing government with fascist - leaning elements .
As the forces of the left and right square off , those of us watching from the outside should take inspiration .
The Italian students showed that large masses can be stirred to act against capitalist policies that hurt working class people .
The challenge for the left is to harness this outpouring of collective action into an organized movement that continues to resist racist and anti-worker policies with the strength of opposition that has been shown against the Gelmini law .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. regulators are working on a new federal program that could provide government guarantees for up to $ 600 billion of home mortgages to help prevent foreclosures , a source familiar with the discussions told Reuters on Wednesday .
The plan , being hammered out by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and the U.S. Treasury Department , could provide guarantees for up to 3 million at - risk mortgages , said the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the program is still being discussed .
The Treasury Department said on Wednesday that it is working with the FDIC and other policymakers on foreclosure - prevention measures but that no detailed plan has been reached .
“ We are working with the White House and through the policy process on a range of foreclosure - prevention options , ” said Treasury spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli , adding that the Treasury has not decided on a particular approach .
The White House also said no decisions have been made .
“ We ’re always reviewing proposals to help homeowners , ” said White House spokesman Tony Fratto .
The plan would provide federal guarantees to entice lenders to ease the terms of troubled mortgages -- something that lenders have been reluctant to do on a large scale so far .
The expected cost to the government would be a fraction of the value of the guarantees , as the intent of the program is to prevent defaults on home loans .
FDIC spokesman Andrew Gray said the agency has had productive conversations with Treasury about the proposal , but it would be premature to speculate on the parameters or details of a program .
The source said the government is aiming to announce the program in coming days .
The program would be managed by the FDIC and would be available to banks , savings and loans , investment funds , hedge funds and other mortgage holders , the source said .
It would encourage the lenders to rewrite the distressed mortgages , converting them into affordable plans .
FDIC Chairman Sheila
Bair told lawmakers last week that the existing $ 700 billion financial rescue plan gives the Treasury Department the power to use loan guarantees and credit enhancements to facilitate loan modifications and prevent avoidable foreclosures .
She told an international banking conference on Wednesday that the FDIC is “ actively engaged ” in talks with the Bush administration about the new program , which could provide economic incentives for lenders to modify distressed home loans into sustainable long - term loans .
“ Such a framework is needed to modify loans on a scale large enough to have a major impact ” and to get ahead of the curve on foreclosures , Bair said .
The source said that under the program , the government guarantees would include second loans on homes , such as home equity lines of credit , so that lenders would not lose any money in a mortgage modification .
The program would induce lenders to lower monthly mortgage payments through lower principal , term or interest rate , for a period that would likely be five years , the source said .

The mid-tier department store operator forecast fourth - quarter earnings of 90 cents to $ 1.05 , much lower than analyst expectations of $ 1.33 per share , according to Reuters Estimates .
The Plano , Texas - based company said it expects total fourth - quarter sales to fall 7 percent to 9 percent and sales at stores open a least a year , a key retail metric , to drop 9 percent to 11 percent .
Penney said it expects the rough economic conditions to continue well into 2009 .
Sales and profits have suffered in recent months and took a turn for the worse in October as shoppers focused on essential purchases because of falling housing values , tight credit and worries about job security .
Penney 's holiday warning is similar to those of Kohl 's Corp KSS.N and Nordstrom Inc JWN.N.
Both department stores reported sharply lower quarterly profits on Thursday and cut their forecasts for the rest of the year .
QUARTERLY PROFIT FALLS BY MORE THAN HALF
Penney ’s net income fell to $ 124 million , or 55 cents per share , for its fiscal third quarter , ended November 1 , from $ 261 million , or $ 1.17 cents per share , a year earlier .
Analysts had expected a profit of 54 cents on revenue of $ 4.34 billion .
Sales fell 8.7 percent to $ 4.32 billion , and sales at stores open at least a year , or same - store sales , fell 10.1 percent in the quarter .
Last week , Penney said October sales at stores open at least a year fell 13 percent .
Penney said quarterly inventory was 9 percent below last year ’s levels on a comparable store basis and gross margin fell to 38.5 percent of sales , compared with 39.7 percent in last year ’s quarter , as softer sales forced Penney cut prices to clear out merchandise .
Women ’s and children ’s apparel and family shoes sold best in the quarter , while home and fine jewelry continued to be weak .
Internet sales fell 0.3 percent , compared with an 11.8 percent increase in last year ’s quarter .
Penney said it had cash and short - term investments of $ 1.6 billion and long - term debt of $ 3.5 billion as of November 1 .
Penney shares have lost 56 percent of their value this year , more than the 35 percent drop this year in the Standard & Poor 's retail index .RLX .
The Effects of a Global Thermonuclear War
4th edition : escalation in 1988 by Wm. Robert Johnston
last updated 18 August 2003
INTRODUCTION :
The following is an approximate description of the effects of a global nuclear war .
For the purposes of illustration it is assumed that a war resulted in mid-1988 from military conflict between the Warsaw Pact and NATO .
This is in some ways a worst - case scenario ( total numbers of strategic warheads deployed by the superpowers peaked about this time ; the scenario implies a greater level of military readiness ; and impact on global climate and crop yields are greatest for a war in August ) .
Some details , such as the time of attack , the events leading to war , and the winds affecting fallout patterns , are only meant to be illustrative .
This applies also to the global geopolitical aftermath , which represents the author 's efforts at intelligent speculation .
There is much public misconception concerning the physical effects of nuclear war -- some of it motivated by politics .
Certainly the predictions described here are uncertain : for example , casualty figures in the U.S. are accurate perhaps to within 30 % for the first few days , but the number of survivors in the U.S. after one year could differ from these figures by as much as a factor of four .
Nonetheless , there is no reasonable basis for expecting results radically different from this description -- for example , there is no scientific basis for expecting the extinction of the human species .
Note that the most severe predictions concerning nuclear winter have now been evaluated and discounted by most of the scientific community .
Sources supplying the basis for this description include the U.S. Defense Nuclear Agency manual on nuclear weapon effects , scientific papers describing computer simulations of long - term effects published by groups ranging from the U.S. government to left - leaning scientific organizations , and research by a similar variety of groups on weapons characteristics and strategy .
1 July 1988 : Gorbachev is killed when his plane is attacked by a Stinger surface - to - air missile in East Germany ; military heads take control in Moscow , accuse the CIA of responsibility for the assassination , impose a news blackout in the U.S.S.R. , and send troops to East Germany and Poland to impose martial law .
15 July 1988 : West Germans propose intervention in East Germany following reports of violence there ; clashes occur along the border between the two Germanys ; NATO puts its forces in West Germany on alert .
19 July 1988 : A massive Soviet invasion of West Germany begins : NATO airfields are attacked by missiles with chemical warheads as tanks pour across the border .
U.S. nuclear forces are put on alert : Bergstrom Air Force Base ( AFB ) near Austin receives 4 B - 52 bombers dispersed from their home base .
31 July 1988 : With Soviet forces 200 kilometers ( km ) ( 120 miles ) inside northern West Germany , NATO issues a vague ultimatum to the U.S.S.R .
1 August 1988 : NATO nuclear weapon depots are attacked by conventional and chemical weapons ; ongoing naval combat claims a Soviet ballistic missile submarine in the Arctic Ocean .
4 August 1988 : NATO threatens the use of tactical nuclear weapons against Soviet forces advancing towards urban areas in western West Germany .
6:00 AM CDT 5 August 1988 : Soviet attacks begin against U.S. military satellites : two ground - based laser facilities are used to disable intelligence satellites in low Earth orbit and damage or harass sensors on those in higher orbits .
" Killer " satellites are launched and will reach target satellites over the next few hours .
Some of the Soviet civilian population is being moved to bomb shelters , subway tunnels , and out of cities .
In West Germany invading Soviet forces launch some tactical nuclear weapons against NATO forces .
10:00 AM CDT 5 August 1988 : NATO forces begin launching tactical nuclear weapons against Soviet forces in West Germany and bases in East Germany .
North Korea invades South Korea while launching chemical weapon strikes against U.S. and South Korean forces .
12:00 noon CDT 5 August 1988 : Nuclear hostilities on a global scale begin as the U.S.S.R. launches a preemptive strike .
Over 1,000 Soviet missiles -- carrying 5,400 warheads -- are launched as a counterforce strike against the U.S. and its NATO allies .
Current population figures are : Rio Grande Valley -- 690,000 ; Travis County - - 550,000 ; Texas -- 16,800,000 ; the United States -- 245,000,000 ; the world -- 5,150,000,000 .
12:05 PM CDT : Nuclear weapons are detonated aboard several Soviet satellites in low Earth orbit over the U.S. and other areas , generating electromagnetic pulses ( EMP ) .
This devastates electronics in these areas .
Most unhardened computers and related equipment are rendered useless , destroying communication , information , and power supply networks on a nationwide scale .
Transportation vehicles using electronics are inoperable .
Many satellites are disabled .
While few human casualties have occurred so far , much of the civilian elements of a continent - spanning society are devastated .
For most American civilians this is the only warning of the coming attack they will receive : no effective civil defense program exists .
U.S. strategic bombers begin leaving their bases .
This includes 25 B - 52s and 5 B - 1Bs in Texas , with four of these B - 52s leaving Bergstrom AFB near Austin .
These 30 bombers are carrying 400 nuclear bombs and missiles .
12:10 PM CDT : NATO missiles in Europe ( U.S. , British , and French weapons ) are launched against Warsaw Pact targets .
This includes U.S. Pershing II and Gryphon missiles , most of which were not yet retired under the INF treaty .
Soviet submarine - launched ballistic missile ( SLBM ) warheads begin reaching targets in Texas and other parts of the U.S.
Over the next 15 minutes 55 SLBM warheads succeed in reaching targets in Texas out of 74 launched ( the rest were on missiles that malfunctioned early in flight ) .
In Travis County , a 1.5 - megaton ( 1 mt equals the explosive energy of 1,000,000 tons of TNT ) warhead detonates 2.5 km ( 1.5 miles ) over Bergstrom AFB .
Over the next few minutes ten warheads , each between 200 kilotons and 500 kilotons ( 1,000 kt equals 1 mt ) detonate over Bergstrom and in a pattern extending 100 km ( 60 miles ) to the north , west , and east -- this in an attempt to destroy the four escaping bombers .
Each explosion produces a fireball which radiates intense light ( flash ) for about 10 seconds : all exposed combustible material ignites up to ranges of 3 to 9 km ( 2 to 5.5 miles ) ; second degree burns to exposed skin and fires are produced up to 6.5 to 18.5 km ( 4 to 11.5 miles ) away .
The atmospheric shock wave ( blast ) from each explosion causes partial or complete destruction of all buildings within 1.5 to 4.5 km ( 1 to 3 miles ) and causes moderate damage and 50 % injuries or deaths at 5.5 to 15 km ( 3.5 to 9.5 miles ) in the 10 to 40 seconds following detonation .
( These figures represent the variation among 200 - kt to 1.5 - mt warheads exploded in the air or on the ground . )
Severe damage and fires result in much of Austin .
Immediate nuclear radiation from the weapons being used is generally absorbed by the atmosphere before it reaches people surviving the flash and blast .
( This radiation is only important with small nuclear weapons such as the bombs dropped on Japan in World War II or the tactical nuclear weapons being used in Europe .
Delayed radiation from fallout is a different matter , however . )
12:15 PM CDT : The U.S. launches intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBMs ) against the U.S.S.R .
These are launched from underground silos in Montana , North Dakota , South Dakota , Wyoming , Colorado , Nebraska , and Missouri .
Some SLBMs are launched at this time as well .
12:25 PM CDT : The U.S.S.R. launches most remaining nuclear forces , attacking cities and other targets in the U.S. and Western Europe as well as mainland China .
Antiballistic missiles ( ABMs ) with nuclear warheads are being launched to defend Moscow from incoming warheads .
Throughout the U.S.S.R. several types of surface - to - air missiles ( SAMs ) are also being used against incoming nuclear warheads -- occasionally with success .
12:30 PM CDT : Soviet ICBM warheads begin reaching U.S. targets .
NORAD headquarters near Colorado Springs receives a few 20 - mt warheads : the ground shock produced by each one attains 7.3 on the Richter scale .
U.S. submarines begin launching SLBMs against the U.S.S.R .
In Texas , 80,000 people have already died .
Altogether , over 1,000 tons of debris from Soviet ballistic missiles will fall over the U.S. ; much will burn up in the atmosphere , but some larger objects will hit the ground with energy equivalent to their own weight in TNT .
12:35 PM CDT : Another wave of Soviet warheads arrives in Texas : 45 of the 53 ICBM warheads targeted in Texas actually detonate successfully .
In Travis County , a 550 - kt warhead detonates on the ground at the former site of Bergstrom AFB , adding to the devastation in Austin .
In the Rio Grande Valley , a 550 - kt warhead detonates on the ground at the Raymondville Coast Guard station and a second one two minutes later ; Raymondville is destroyed .
With Soviet warheads minutes away , Israel launches nuclear missiles and nuclear - armed aircraft against capitals and military targets of most other Middle Eastern nations .
12:50 PM CDT : A massive barrage by U.S. SLBMs mostly overwhelms the Moscow ABM system ; American , British , French , and Chinese nuclear warheads targeted within 100 km ( 60 miles ) of Moscow total over 500 .
About 200 reach their targets ( although only about 40 were lost to ABMs ) : while most Soviet leaders in underground shelters survive ( the primary goal of the local ABM system ) , most civilians in the subway tunnels and other shelters will die over the next few hours .
The Moscow area ranks with the six ICBM fields in the U.S. as the hardest hit areas of the world .
An average of 350 warheads detonate in each ICBM field , each producing a crater 350 m ( 400 yards ) across ; a total of 100,000 sq. km ( 40,000 sq. mi. ) is devoid of life .
Out of 1,000 ICBM silos , 100 still had ICBMs ; now six are left usable .
The nuclear weapons that have reached Texas so far were directed against U.S. military forces and capabilities .
Although this attack did not specifically target the civilian population , it has so far killed 800,000 and injured 3,000,000 people in Texas .
1:00 PM CDT 5 August : A third strike reaches Texas , with 146 warheads launched .
Two 750 - kt warheads detonate over Austin .
In the Rio Grande Valley , a 1.1 - mt warhead detonates over Brownsville , three 350 - kt warheads detonate around McAllen , and 550 - kt warheads are groundburst in Harlingen and at Cameron County Airport .
Massive fires and severe blast damage occur throughout all of these metropolitan areas .
This concludes most of the nuclear war in Texas : 273 warheads were fired at 233 targets , and 215 detonated successfully , with a total yield of 128 megatons ( about 40 times the explosive force of all conventional bombs and shells used in World War II ) .
In addition , about 5 off - course warheads struck randomly in Texas .
At this point 3,500,000 Texans have been killed .
2:00 PM CDT : About 5 % of the land area in Texas is burning .
In a few areas conditions permit firestorms to develop .
In contrast to the World War II atomic bombings in Japan , continuous fire areas sometimes cover hundreds of square km ( or sq. mi. ) , preventing survivors from escaping .
Fires cover about 700,000 sq. km ( 270,000 sq. mi. ) in the United States , 250,000 sq. km ( 100,000 sq. mi. ) in the U.S.S.R. and 180,000 sq. km ( 70,000 sq. mi. ) in Europe .
Scattered or continuous fires rage across more than one - third of the area of several states , including North Dakota , Ohio , New Jersey , Maryland , Rhode Island , Connecticut , and Massachusetts .
3:00 PM CDT : Intense naval combat between U.S. and Soviet ships and submarines includes the use of tactical nuclear weapons .
U.S. naval superiority has been offset by Soviet naval nuclear superiority : U.S. ships are being destroyed by nuclear cruise missiles and nuclear torpedoes .
By the end of the day the superpowers will have lost over 100 vessels altogether .
Since most major dams in the U.S. have been destroyed by nuclear explosions , flooding is progressing downstream from these reservoirs .
Some rivers particularly affected are the Missouri , Colorado , and Tennessee Rivers .
5:00 PM CDT : The mushroom clouds from nuclear explosions have drifted 100 to 300 km ( 60 to 180 mi. ) downwind , frequently forming the leading edge of large smoke plumes .
In the darkness beneath these plumes , temperatures have dropped noticeably .
Vaporized soil and other material , mixed with radioactive bomb residues , settles to the ground in areas where mushroom clouds pass overhead : this is fallout .
Immediately downwind of groundbursts , radiation from fallout may be severe enough for exposed persons to already suffer ill effects .
The black rain occurring beneath many clouds is radioactive -- sometimes enough to burn the skin after prolonged contact .
Smoke downwind of urban fires is also hazardous .
The blasts and fires have consumed 70 % of the world 's industrial capacity .
Toxic chemicals have been released in large amounts .
7:00 PM CDT : Soviet bombers are delivering weapons against U.S. cities and other targets , including high - yield bombs and long - range cruise missiles .
None of these targets are in Texas , however .
The largest individual weapons used in the war are a couple of 50 - mt Soviet bombs dropped in China : craters 2 km ( 1.3 mi. ) across are produced , and severe or moderate damage is produced in an area up to 100 km ( 60 miles ) across .
NATO and Warsaw Pact tactical nuclear weapons are being used by the hundreds along the front in West Germany .
Missiles and aircraft have been launched against most cities and military targets in Europe , and nuclear combat has degenerated to disorganized use of short - range systems , especially missiles and nuclear artillery shells .
U.S. Green Berets are crossing enemy lines carrying the smallest nuclear weapons to be used : these atomic demolition munitions are used to destroy bridges and similar targets and have explosive yields as low as 10 tons of TNT equivalent ( somewhat more than the truck bomb that destroyed the Marine barracks in Lebanon in 1983 ) .
9:00 PM CDT : Some bombers from Texas are delivering their weapons to Soviet soil , having survived Soviet air defense forces ( many using nuclear - tipped anti-aircraft missiles ) .
About half of the weapons carried by Texas bombers actually reach their targets ( amounting to 200 warheads with a total yield of 40 mt ) .
Nearly all of these weapons have selectable explosive yields , and usually a yield much lower than the maximum option is used .
Only ten of these bombers manage to reach friendly territory afterwards , and they are generally forced to make emergency landings : the U.S. , for instance , has less than 100 surviving runways capable of handling B - 52s .
12:00 midnight CDT 5/6 August 1988 : The nuclear exchange is generally over .
In the U.S. 5,800 warheads detonated totaling 3,900 mt .
Soviet and NATO weapons successfully used in Europe numbered 3,300 ( 1,200 mt ) ( excluding tactical weapons ) .
About 6,100 warheads ( most of them American , but some Chinese , British , and French ) exploded in the U.S.S.R. with a total yield of 1,900 mt .
Mainland China ( P.R.C. ) received 900 ( detonating ) warheads ( 1,300 mt ) from its northern neighbor .
Other areas receiving at least a dozen warheads include Canada , North and South Korea , Japan , Taiwan , Greenland , Puerto Rico , India , Israel , Australia , Guam , Cuba , Syria , and Egypt .
Hundreds of other nuclear weapons have been used in naval combat , in troop combat in West Germany and along the U.S.S.R./P.R.C. border , and in defending the Soviet Union from nuclear attack .
About 50 % of the global strategic and theater nuclear arsenal has been used .
About 10 % was launched but did not reach a target and 30 % was destroyed on the ground .
Altogether , World War III has involved the detonation of 18,000 warheads with a total yield of 8,500 mt .
Including tactical weapons , there were 67,000 nuclear weapons in the world a day ago ; now , there are 10,000 left .
In Texas 6,400,000 have been killed ( 38 % of its original population ) .
Of the 10,400,000 survivors , 3,000,000 have severe injuries and 2,000,000 have lesser injuries .
In the Rio Grande Valley 340,000 have been killed ( 49 % ) and 90,000 injured ( 13 % ) ; in Travis County over 400,000 are dead ( 75 % ) .
In the U.S. about 110,000,000 people have died altogether , with the 135,000,000 survivors including 30,000,000 injured .
In the U.S.S.R. about 40,000,000 have been killed out of a pre-war population of 285,000,000 .
Mainland China has had 100,000,000 killed out of a population of 1,090,000,000 .
Examples of other countries : United Kingdom , 20,000,000 killed ( out of 57,000,000 ) ; Denmark , 2,700,000 killed ( out of 5,100,000 ) ; Australia , 3,000,000 killed ( out of 16,000,000 ) .
In Mexico over 3,000,000 have been killed , mostly in cities on the border with the U.S. Throughout the world about 400,000,000 have died .
9:00 AM CDT 6 August : Survivors in urban areas are having little success at finding medical help .
For the United States as a whole , hospital beds in surviving hospitals total 80,000 , while severe injuries total 20,000,000 .
About 9,000,000 people in the U.S. have severe burns on much of their bodies , while only 200 beds in burn care facilities survive in the country .
Many remaining hospitals lack even emergency power , due to the EMP attacks .
The vast number of injuries force doctors and nurses to try to ignore patients that cannot be saved or have non-life threatening injuries .
Many survivors in urban areas are in the process of fleeing to neighboring areas in search of medical care and to escape fires ; this puts them in the open , often exposed to fallout .
Midnight CDT 6/7 August : Israel is being attacked by Egypt , Jordan , and Syria .
About one - third of Israel 's military forces survived the Soviet nuclear attack ; they are now occasionally using nuclear artillery shells against attacking troops .
Other Arab states are preparing to join the campaign .
The situation is tense between India and Pakistan : both nations have a handful of small atomic bombs , and India was attacked with Chinese nuclear weapons .
Meanwhile civil war is developing in South Africa and various other nations .
Early 7 August : Deposition of fallout in Texas is generally over with , and 80 % of the radiation that will result from this fallout has already been emitted .
Fire - produced pollutants are noticeable throughout the state -- including smoke , smog , and various hazardous chemicals -- with urban areas still burning .
In those parts of Texas affected by fallout , radiation sickness is already evident in many survivors , including symptoms of nausea , vomiting , and skin burns .
In a few small areas fallout has been severe enough to already have killed many of those exposed , by causing radiation damage to the central nervous system .
Survivors are having difficulty dealing with injuries , lack of food and medical help , and emotional shock .
The U.S. government is essentially gone , as well as most state governments ; only two state capital cities survive ( the missiles targeted on them malfunctioned ) .
The Rio Grande Valley is receiving refugees from Mexico -- survivors of devastated areas seeking help .
10 August :
The smoke clouds in the northern hemisphere are spreading to produce a band around the world covering the primary participating nations .
Large amounts of particles in the atmosphere include 1,500 million tons of dust , 25 million tons of smoke from vegetation , and 80 million tons of smoke from cities and other manmade sources .
This last type of smoke has the greatest impact : smoke from petroleum and petroleum products is particularly effective at absorbing sunlight .
Altogether , about 0.4 cubic km ( 0.1 cu. mi. ) of dust and smoke is in the stratosphere .
Typical sunlight levels in Texas are comparable to an overcast day ; in some areas , smoke from large continuing fires reduces mid-day light levels to that of twilight .
The average temperature in Texas is 22° C ( 72° F ) , compared to 29° C ( 85° F ) a week ago .
12 August : About 90 % of the radiation that will result from fallout in Texas has been emitted .
The average radiation dose in Texas is about 500 rem ; by comparison , a dose of 100 rem in less than a week causes radiation sickness in half of people exposed ; 50 % of people exposed to 450 rem in a short period will die within 30 days ; and a dose of 1,500 rem will kill nearly all people exposed within 10 days .
Persons who stayed indoors the whole week generally cut their dose by 70 % ; staying in designated areas of marked fallout shelters would reduce dosage by 99 % .
For the entire U.S. , the average dose in the open from fallout is 1,200 rem ; by comparison the average for the Soviet Union is 150 rem .
The difference comes from the larger average yield of Soviet weapons , the larger size of the Soviet Union , the frequently " dirtier " nature of Soviet weapons , and the fact that more Soviet warheads are exploded on the ground ( increasing fallout ) .
For Europe the average dose in the open is 500 rem .
This fallout is of course unevenly distributed : in the U.S. the dose exceeds 1,800 rem in about 8 % of the land area , and the dose exceeds 500 rem in about 1 % of the U.S.S.R .
In most of the areas affected by fallout , radiation is diminished sufficiently to be of little concern to people there .
However , areas downwind of nuclear strikes on nuclear power plants are still dangerous -- in some locations 100 km ( 60 mi. ) downwind of such strikes , radiation levels are high enough to kill in 2 days .
Radiation levels are still high enough to cause sickness from 2 - days ' exposure in areas up to 500 km ( 300 mi ) downwind of the ICBM fields .
Delayed fallout is being deposited throughout the northern hemisphere : this is from radioactive material launched into the stratosphere , falling over a larger area for months to come .
The health effect from this , however , will not be noticeable against the background of other problems .
20 August :
In the northern hemisphere , smoke in the lower atmosphere is subsiding ( although smoke in the upper atmosphere still absorbs much sunlight ) .
Unusual weather includes windy conditions in some coastal areas .
Fog has developed over the oceans and smog envelops the interior of North America and Eurasia .
Fallout from the northern hemisphere is now reaching the southern hemisphere .
Radiation levels there will peak at ten times the natural background levels -- this will not pose a health risk , but it produces fear in many countries .
Many persons suffering radiation sickness are now showing additional symptoms : hair loss and leukopenia .
( Those that survive to the end of the year will regrow their hair . )
Combat continues in central Europe , mostly without tactical nuclear weapons .
The position of the front is little changed , with forces on either side unable or unwilling to budge .
25 August :
The ozone layer has been cut in half over the northern midlatitudes .
In spite of this , nearly all of the Earth 's surface is receiving less solar ultraviolet radiation than before the war : smoke in the northern hemisphere blocks most sunlight , and as this smoke was initially injected into the atmosphere much ozone was displaced into the southern hemisphere .
This situation will change .
Disorganized forces from Iraq , Iran , and Libya are beginning to join the Arab battle against Israel .
North Korean forces have overrun many remaining cities in South Korea .
Civil war has developed throughout China : with much of the government and military wiped out by Soviet nuclear attack , surviving communist forces are under attack and ethnic conflicts are developing .
Tibet has declared independence .
Ethnic conflict is also breaking out among surviving populations in some parts of the Soviet Union and Europe .
Naval combat between NATO and Soviet vessels has slackened .
Before the war the U.S. had fifteen aircraft carriers ; three were destroyed in port on the first day and five more have been destroyed by Soviet naval nuclear weapons .
A number of submarines survive with ballistic or cruise missiles .
Hardly any satellites in Earth orbit are functioning .
EMP bursts disabled most civilian satellites .
Debris from anti-satellite attacks is dispersing and striking more satellites , while particle radiation from nuclear explosions above the atmosphere is trapped in the Earth 's magnetic field , making near - Earth space lethal to men and satellites for months or years to come .
1 September : Light levels and temperatures in the northern hemisphere have reached their lows .
Temperatures in the lower stratosphere ( an altitude of 10 km / 6 mi. , where most atmospheric smoke is ) are around 15° C ( 50° F ) -- this is 40° C ( 70° F ) warmer than normal .
At the ground , temperatures vary little with altitude ( mountains are sometimes warmer than adjacent lowlands ) , but they vary significantly with distance inland .
The interiors of North America and Eurasia are on average 10° C ( 18° F ) cooler than normal -- corresponding to normal temperatures for October or November .
In west and north Texas temperatures are around 17° C ( 62° F ) ; near the coast it is nearer 22° C ( 72° F ) .
In the midlatitudes of the northern hemisphere sunlight is 25 % or less of normal - - sometimes insufficient for net plant growth .
This helps reduce the formation of hurricanes this season .
At this point 9,000,000 Texans and a total of 140,000,000 Americans have died .
Mid-September 1988 : Epidemics are developing among surviving populations , particularly food poisoning , dysentery , and typhoid .
Displaced populations , including many injured , are particularly affected ; those with radiation sickness are particularly vulnerable , since radiation sickness involves damage to the immune system : susceptibility to disease for those is increased by a factor of 2 to 5 .
In some locations outbreaks of disease are a consequence of the use of biological weapons .
Early October 1988 : Many crops are withering throughout the midlatitudes in the northern hemisphere .
Sunlight , temperatures , and rainfall are all below normal ; in many areas concentrations of ozone , smog , and other pollutants in the lower atmosphere are still high enough to afflict plants ; and in restricted areas plants have suffered from fallout .
This is particularly true in the American Midwest .
About 200,000 se. km ( 80,000 sq. mi. ) in the U.S. is still radioactive enough to cause radiation sickness after two weeks ' exposure .
At this point about 580,000 have died in the Rio Grande Valley ( 84 % of the original population ) and 40,000 are injured ( 6 % ) ; of Travis County 's pre-war population , only 50,000 survive ( 9 % ) -- most of whom have fled to neighboring areas .
About 2,000,000 have died from fallout in Texas now , bringing the death toll to 10,000,000 .
Of the 6,800,000 survivors , 2,000,000 are injured and 2,000,000 are suffering radiation sickness ( these two groups overlap ) .
A total of 160,000,000 Americans have died , or 65 % of the pre-war population ; in the Soviet Union 90,000,000 have died .
The death toll in the United Kingdom is 30,000,000 and in Denmark is 3,300,000 .
World population is now 4,300,000,000 .
November 1988 : The ozone layer in the southern hemisphere is now 5 % depleted .
The effect of this will not be noticed , however , since it is less than natural variations .
December 1988 : Crop failures throughout the third world have caused famines in many areas and have also encouraged civil unrest .
India has collapsed into civil war .
Having devastated Israel , Arab nations are in chaos : the Middle East was heavily dependent on the Western nations economically .
Surviving Taiwanese forces are participating in the civil war in mainland China .
Some third world countries , particularly Latin American countries , are launching raids on U.S. coastal areas by sea .
These military task forces scavenge and steal what they can find , from raw materials and food to equipment for industrial , military , and agricultural use .
Surviving industrial facilities on the coasts , particularly the Pacific and Gulf coasts , are targeted .
A couple of raiding parties have visited the Port of Brownsville 's former location and surrounding areas but found little of interest .
In the United States , exposure is a serious problem ; the only source of heating for most survivors is wood fires .
March 1989 : Temperatures in the northern hemisphere are 4° C ( 2° F ) below normal on average .
This will shorten growing seasons and prolong agricultural disruptions .
Before the war Japan was heavily dependent on food imports ; now even fishing in neighboring waters is still unproductive .
In Japan 30,000,000 starved to death this winter .
Surviving Japanese military forces have waged attacks as far as Australia in search of food sources .
The Midwestern U.S. , formerly where most of the nation 's grain was produced , received the greatest share of the fallout from strikes on ICBM fields ; about half the rural population in this area escaped immediate effects but was killed by fallout .
With modern farming technology unavailable , farming this year will be subsistence farming .
The Mississippi River now reaches the Gulf of Mexico 300 km ( 200 mi. ) west of its former mouth .
Over the next few years much of former New Orleans will sink below sea level .
Some peat bogs in the northern Soviet Union ignited by the nuclear war are still slowly burning ; some will continue to burn for a couple of years .
April 1989 : Hundreds of thousands of Mexican refugees have come north hoping to find food .
The population of the southwestern U.S. was relatively concentrated in urban areas ; with these destroyed , Mexicans will soon represent a majority of the area 's population .
Violence often occurs when they encounter communities of survivors .
Communities in the U.S. faring better than average include survivalist communities in the Northwest and Mormon communities in the Utah area .
May 1989 : Radiation hazards from fallout - stricken areas continue to diminish .
In the U.S. about 10,000 sq. km ( 4,000 sq. mi. ) is still radioactive enough for two weeks ' exposure to cause radiation sickness .
Over 90 % of this area was contaminated by fallout from strikes on nuclear reactors .
This includes about 400 sq. km ( 150 sq. mi. ) in Texas .
July 1989 : Wildfires are recurring in the U.S. , Europe , and Asia .
Fires especially sweep through the vast areas where fallout killed vegetation .
This includes strips of land extending hundreds of km ( or mi. ) from strikes on nuclear reactor sites , often carrying radioactivity into the air again .
Since the war , natural processes have begun to restore the ozone layer .
In the northern hemisphere the ozone layer is 40 % depleted , although localized depletions have sometimes been worse .
The resultant increase in ultraviolet radiation has reduced plant growth and crop yields and made it easier to get sunburn .
In the southern hemisphere ozone depletion is still around 5 % .
August 1989 : Disease has ravaged the surviving population in the U.S. About 30 % of survivors have been afflicted with one or more of the following : dysentery , food poisoning , viral gastroenteritis , typhoid , influenza , and pneumonia .
These diseases have killed about 10,000,000 in the past year .
Bubonic plague has broken out , killing nearly 1,000,000 so far and spreading to Mexico .
Starvation is also a major cause of death : total food production in the U.S. in the past year was about 2 % of that for the previous year .
Famines are occurring throughout the third world - - not from nuclear winter but from the social and technological collapse of agriculture .
Much of the third world supplemented its agricultural capacity with fertilizers , insecticides , and food imports from the West .
Political chaos in many areas and disruption of supply networks has also disrupted production .
Food production in the third world in 1989 will be below half that of 1987 .
Surviving Americans now number 45,000,000 , including 4,000,000 Texans .
A few million surviving Americans are permanently sterile due to radiation exposure .
World population is now 3,300,000,000 .
August 1991 : The Earth 's atmosphere has been quite nearly purged of soot and dust .
Slightly cooler conditions persist due to large amounts of nitrogen oxides in the upper atmosphere .
The primary impact is slightly shorter growing seasons in northern areas .
Now that third world countries are recovering agriculturally and beginning to reduce famine , they are being stricken by epidemics .
Bubonic plague has spread to Latin America and is appearing in Europe .
Africa , which has been particularly ravaged by war and famine , is now seeing the spread of various diseases going unchecked by modern medicine .
December 1992 : Depletion of the ozone layer in the northern hemisphere is now only 15 % , which is less than natural variations before the war .
2000 : China , now under nationalist government , is trying to retake Manchuria ( which had declared independence after the war ) and Mongolia .
Other nations are sufficiently secure internally to launch invasions to acquire various resources .
2010 : Some people exposed to fallout after the war are now dying of cancer ; however , cancer as a cause of death among the survivors is minimal compared to other causes : disease , starvation , and exposure .
Chinese forces are operating in Southeast Asia , Japan , the Philippines , and particularly Siberia , where there is an influx of Chinese settlers .
2040 : Some areas that received fallout from strikes on nuclear power plants and above - ground nuclear waste storage facilities are still uninhabitable and will remain so for some time to come .
Genetic defects are found in as much as a few percent of the population born in the northern hemisphere after the war ; however , most are not noticeable or are not handicapping .
The more profound physical deficiencies are due to malnutrition .
Some of the surviving nations have emerged by now as major powers , including Australia , New Zealand , China , Argentina , and Brazil .

Return to Home .
Return to Nuclear Weapons .
We have made Linux ready .
Now let 's make the users ready too .
Part I .
I was lazily reading last OSnews when I got stuck into a link to this post by mr.akaimbatman .
It is just one of the bazillion articles / blog posts I 've read about what the Linux desktop would have to be .
But now I 'm tired , and so I rant .
After a long Windows - only experience , it 's two years I happily use Linux on the desktop 24/7 ( with the exception of the Windows XP box I still have to use at work ) , and it's two years I read this kind of articles .
These articles just get me sick .
They get me sick because they invariably miss the point .
They take a lot of myths about the lack of adoption of Linux on the desktop and they try to solve them with titanic scenarios of complete desktop environment / filesystem refactoring .
While there could be many nice individual ideas in their proposed solutions , they completely lack the sense of time and pragmatism .
The reason is simple .
All your super ideas about rebuilding the filesystem hierarchy of Linux or merging GNOME and KDE in a single , ultra-cool , ultra -easy desktop environment can be all the best you can think about ( most of time they 're not , but let 's give them a chance ) .
The fact is simply that , given the number of developers and the pace of development of open source software , when all this will happen - if it will happen - we will be already be light years behind other operating systems .
Period .
To make Linux a practical desktop solution for the masses we do not need to turn the guts of Linux and X upside down .
This is a sin of naivete .
We just need a little rational change of mind from the community , and a big effort from the software industry .
Let me explain .
It will take some post to do it , so prepare to read .
Ok ?
Well , start with
Part I .
I. Linux IS easy and ready for ( most of the ) desktop .
People must just learn its basics .
We who use Linux on the desktop do n't find it hard .
To me Linux is pretty easy when it comes to everyday tasks - even easier than WinXP .
So where 's the point ?
When John ' PC User '
Doe hears about Linux he usually hears a lot of enthusiastic geeks that assure him that Windows is shit and that Linux is the solution of all John Doe problems .
Then John Doe will reply " but I heard Linux is good on servers but not on the desktop " and geeks will point him on the latest - and - greatest Mandriva or SuSE .
Until now everything looks almost OK .
What will happen then ?
What will happen is that John Doe , assured that his new shiny Linux will be easy to use , will try to install and use it on his desktop or - much worse - on his laptop .
Then John
Doe will fill a hundred of forums asking for silly questions like " how do I install the drivers of the webcam I have on the webcam CD ? " or " how do I play my iTunes DRM - protected files ? " or " why does not my USB ADSL modem works ? "
More sooner than later most John Doe 's will throw the towel and return to Windows , hastily disgusted from Linux .
Now , the commonplace deduction is : John
Doe bad experience has shown that Linux is not ready for the desktop , because " this is hard , that is inconsistent , that else is awkward " .
Is this right ?
No .
It does n't mean Linux is perfect - it is absolutely not .
But this is not the reason John Doe finds Linux difficult or even unusable .
John
Doe did find Linux difficult to use becase he did not learn its basics .
He did not learn about it .
He never read the instruction manual .
When a friend asks me to introduce him into Linux , he almost always says " hey , help me install it , then I will learn it by myself " .
This will just lead them into troubles .
Most PC users have known just DOS and Windows , and just cannot think about something so different .
They expect a drive C : or a self - extracting , graphical installer just because they never have known anything else , not because it is intrinsecally easier .
What I answer to my John Doe 's that want to install Linux is : read documentation first .
Please understand to the last word : f i r s t .
This does not mean at all forcing them reading kilotons of man pages .
This means telling them the truth : that Linux is different from Windows , and that if they do not readily know the basic differences between the systems before the switch , they will be lost , not less than I would be lost if parachuted in the center of an unknown city .
Tell them to look on Google and the Wikipedia , to get familiar with the filesystem hierarchy , the distribution diversity , the meaning of magic words like " shell " , " kernel " , " window manager " , " mount point " , " package manager " and so on .
They do n't need to become gurus .
They just need simple , clear concepts like " X is the program that controls the graphics on Linux .
It is a separate program , not a part of the OS like in Windows .
X itself just controls the basics , but your desktop behaviour and appearance will depend on another program , that 's the window manager or desktop manager .
There are quite a few , you can try some of them and then pick up the one you like , so your desktop can fit your needs and tastes much better . "
Tell them even to look at screenshots of KDE and GNOME , so they will be already familiar with their new graphic environment .
Tell them the command line exists and that they do n't have to fear it .
Show them simple examples of how it works , and why it is more flexibile and fast than GUI alternatives for simple tasks like " how much space do I have on my partitions ? " .
Only once they will have some familiarity with Linux concepts , give them a live cd .
Tell them they can play with the live cd as much as they want , and they will understand the concepts they 're read about and can begin to " feel " Linux under their hands .
Most people will gladly listen and understand such explanations and will actively do it if politely but firmly advised it 's good for them to do so .
If they say " oh , I will learn it later , just install it " explain them that it 's nothing hard , but that they will be LOST if they do n't learn , and that it 's like to pretend to be able to drive a train just because you can drive a car .
If they still insist , well , advice them not to switch , or to prepare for pain .
I know what I say because I had the luck to be prepared to Linux with this approach .
When I first considered switching , I just wanted to download all Debian Woody CDs and install them .
A friend of mine ( the other dude writing on this blog , BTW ! ) warned me , pointed me to Knoppix and Mandrake and told me that things would have been easier by learning something before .
So I downloaded a bunch of tutorials about Linux , I bought a couple of Linux magazines and I spent a couple of weeks by googling and reading stuff .
Only after I felt ready to boot a Knoppix , and after some day spent by playing around with Knoppix I finally installed Mandrake 9.1 .
I remember I was almost disappointed by how easy the transition was , but I realized immediately it was so easy because I was already knowing the basics .
And when I see newbies ranting on forums about how bad Linux is , everyone realized they just did n't take the time / will to learn BEFORE installing .
Now to my corollary , point I.a :
I.a : Installing Linux applications is damn easy .
I sadly laughed when I read that he still thinks installing applications on Linux is hard .
This was perhaps true years ago , it is pure FUD now .
Let me say it clearly :
There 's nothing easier in XXI - century computing than installing Linux applications with a package manager .
I repeat with other words :
There 's nothing easier than an apt - get or an emerge that can be done on computers today .
There are a billion of potentially difficult or awkward things on Linux , but installing applications is not one of these .
In fact , strange as it may seem , I started using Linux and I continue to use it almost mainly for this precise reason .
With Linux I have literally thousands of applications that I can install instantly , free of charge and that I can trust because they are Open Source .
Do this thought experiment .
Imagine a world where Debian or Gentoo are the main operating systems of the planet , and where a new player - Windows - is struggling to conquer the desktop .
Now a newbie Windows user tries to install his favourite music player .
He is accustomed to XMMS , which he installed simply by ( 1 ) firing the command line ( 2 ) getting root and ( 3) typing " apt - get xmms install " , and now wants to install Winamp .
Imagine him knowing well his Debian - based distro but knowing almost nothing about Windows .
I 'm sure he will first look for a " Package manager " or " Software install " program on his Start menu and / or Control Panel .
He wo n't find anything useful .
He will try the command line , but nothing seems to come from there .
So he will look on the Internet what kind of package management Windows has ; he will find it is almost none .
Amazed and disappointed , he will eventually look for Winamp on the Internet and he will download it .
He will find himself with an executable file , something he has never associated with software packages .
He will eventually double - click it , and he will find an overwhelmingly annoying graphical install that will ask him silly questions like " where do you want to install me ? " , and he will stare in confusion by understanding that no /usr / bin exists on Windows .
If he 's clever he will eventually understand the logic of the process : he will find it also awkward and unnecessarily complex .
I expect also him quite upset when he will understand there 's no " emerge - Du world " that will help him upgrade all his software , but that he will have to do program - by - program , painfully .
So here 's explained the ridicule of this assertion by akaimbatman ( the author of the post linked above ) :
Package management is one of those concepts that seems great on the outset , but fails in practice .
The issue is that each package has a complex chain of dependencies unique to itself .
In order to be certain that a package is compatible with all installations , all combinations of installed packages must be tested !
As it is unlikely that anyone would go through so much trouble , the incompatibilities between packages accumulate , and before long the packaging system is rejecting new installs .
And that 's assuming that a graphical installer exists !
If a graphical installer does not exist , then life becomes even more difficult for the end user .
Instead of launching a GUI and selecting the applications he wants , the user must open a terminal and begin typing cryptic commands for which he has no training for .
Many proponents of packaging systems downplay these issues by stating that packaging errors do n't exist on system XYZ ( despite proof to the contrary ) , and that if the user is running Linux he should be " smart enough " to know how to use the command line .
Such statements are just silly .
Users want the computer to make their lives easier .
Any barrier thrown in their way will only drive them to a different platform .
Unfortunately , package managers still drive most Linux desktop distributions ..
You 're utterly wrong .
The packaging system is one of the biggest strenghts of Linux , because it makes installing application easy .
Take your Windows fellow and let him see you can start from zero to a fully Internet - aware desktop by typing something like " apt - get firefox gaim xchat thunderbird gftp amule install " instead that downloading and installing a thousand of separate applications from their respective web pages .
Oh , your friend does not like typing ?
Well , let him point - and - click on Guitoo or Mandrake graphic urpmi or something similar .
But do n't be ridicolous tellimg me that typing " emerge gaim " is difficult , please .
The fact the user has no training for typing " emerge foo " IS WRONG , not the package manager .
Users need to learn , THEN to use the system .
Would you click on an executable installer , if no one ever told you that 's the way to install software ?
Mr.akaimbatman for some reason also tells me that package managers do n't work , that they fail continuously .
This is pure FUD .
Packaging errors are incredibly rare , despite theorical arguments for the contrary .
In 2 years of Linux I just found one real package management error , in an obscure bioinformatic Gentoo ebuild .
Mailing the package maintainer solved the issue in 48 hours .
That 's what open source is for .
We should tell to newbie that want to switch how powerful are the package management systems of Linux .
Surely it would be nice to have them somehow unified ( but why do n't we write a wrapper around all three main package managers ?
It would be even easier , and transparent , and it would n't involve improbable revolutions ) .
But they work .
They are damn easy and powerful .
Tell our friends Linux is better , because of package management .
I.a.1. : Dealing with non-packaged applications
There is still the problem of applications not included as packages of your current distribution .
Finding software is still much easier than on Windows , because you can look for it on Freshmeat or Source Forge or on Savannah , that is , on centralized repositories .
The problem is installing tarballs .
There are solutions for this problem , that this time belong to the Linux community instead of the end user maybe , but they 're do n't require any massive rewriting of core components .
First solution , write a compiling packages helper .
This requires not much more than being a simple text - based and / or GUI - based thing that gently unpackages the tarball , executes " ./ configure " , " make " and " make install " ( or , better , " checkinstall " ) , and gently prompts any error encountered in a comprehensible way .
( Hey , I just found the Python project I was looking for to cut my teeth on ! )
This still requires advanced feedback from the end user if something goes wrong , or if customization is needed , but if everything is right it would be nothing harder than an apt - get or a double - click installer .
Second solution , distribute static binaries .
If dependency hell is your problem , this is perhaps the best solution .
I actually love the shared library concept , but I can see that has drawbacks .
For big , common libraries like GTK or QT , they can actually be something that the user do n't want to install properly , because he / she wo n't need them except than for one single app , and he / she wants to be sure that single app just works ( so we do n't want to go into things like " it works with GTK 2.2.3 but not 2.4.1 " ) .
For obscure , little dependencies it can be a hell to find them , and it 's sad many good apps fall into oblivion just because they depend on a bunch of libnotinstalledonanysystem .so .
Building static binaries would solve it : moreover static binaries will run happily compiled with their older libs if newer , not retro-compatible ones are already installed , allowing to avoid contorsionisms like installing KDE 2 libs on a KDE 3 system , for instance .
I think it would be foolish to install and distribute static binaries only , but they should be presented as an option by all free software developers ( and commercial too ) .
The second part of akaimbatman critics the filesystem hierarchy of Linux .
Here I declare :
I.b : The filesystem structure of Linux is no problem for the end user .
I can't see why the end user should see the directory structure of Linux as a problem ( or at least as a major problem ) .
Most of the time they will use only their / home directory , and that 's actually one of the things that makes Linux easier and friendlier than Windows .
They have no problem to know where is their program , because they will know it is almost always is /usr / bin / program , if they ever need to .
Again , it is simply matter of " hey , newbie Linux user , read about the Linux directory structure !
You will find it is really rational and simple : all general configuration files are in /etc , all everyday program binaries are in / usr / bin and so on " .
It is also much friendlier to know your cdrom drive is always / mnt / cdrom than an odd D : , E : or Q : .
Again , it is nothing hard if you take the time to understand it before actually using it instead of diving into it expecting that every OS on the planet must be a Windows clone .
All advices to change directory structure and all the GoboLinuxes of this world are plain useless , desperate attempts to make of Linux filesystem a fake Windows filesystem .
There 's nothing bad about both filesystems : they are just different , they need to be understood , and they are out of the user way most of time .
We can always try to improve a bit the current scheme , but in general it has nothing bad or awkward .
Init scripts structures ( SysV or BSD ) are surely something that can be improved in the sense of clarity and easiness , for example .
But for most part all criticism I 've read is basically " This is not Windows " , and as such is of no importance .
Ok , enough for now .
Of course there are things with Linux that are not good , but they 're simply not always the ones that are believed to ( and definitely NOT what akaimbatman thinks they are ) .
We 're just smashing some involuntary FUD here .
New chapters will follow .
