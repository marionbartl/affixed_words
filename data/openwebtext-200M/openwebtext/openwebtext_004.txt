In a classic case of News of the Weird , President Bush gave a press conference the other day to announce yet another central plan to deal with yet another disaster — this time an impending disaster , or so he claimed .
It seems that some birds are catching a flu called Avian Influenza or , more commonly , the bird flu .
It causes ruffled feathers and a drop in egg production .
It can kill a chicken in two days flat .
Scary .
The Chicken Littles at the White House got wind of this and decided to hatch a plan for dealing with the eventuality that it will wipe out whole cities inhabited by people .
That 's people , not birds .
He wants $ 7.1 billion from you and me , in emergency funding no less , to protect us from the wrath of this disease , which , he says , could sweep the country and kill 1.9 million people and hospitalize another 9.9 million .
Part of the money will go for " pandemic preparedness , " and part will go to individual states so they can cobble together their own plans for our health and well being .
As part of this plan , there is a website , pandemicflu.gov , which is also a helpful link if you have n't so far believed a word you have read .
Here you can click around and find the Mother of All Flu Reports : The National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza .
Be assured that " the federal government will use all instruments of national power to address the pandemic threat . "
That includes FEMA , the Department of Homeland Security , and a hundred other concrete palaces in DC .
In this report you will find what you must do : be " prepared to follow public health guidance that may include limitation of attendance at public gatherings and non-essential travel for several days or weeks . "
The government , meanwhile , will establish " contingency systems to maintain delivery of essential goods and services during times of significant and sustained worker absenteeism . "
Yes , we are really supposed to believe that the government will " maintain delivery " of " essential goods and services . "
Your job is to sit in your house and wait .
Let 's just say that government has a credibility problem here .
Also , the Bush administration has a role for the military to do for the flu what it did for terrorism in Iraq : " Determine the spectrum of public health , medical and veterinary surge capacity activities that the U.S. military and other government entities may be able to support during a pandemic . "
Remarkable what the military can do , from spreading democracy to liberating the oppressed to curing the sick — that is , when it is not making people sick or killing them for their own good .
Just to show that this is n't merely a perfunctory line , Bush went out of his way to defend the role of the military in his press conference .
" One option is the use of a military that 's able to plan and move , " he said .
" So that 's why I put it on the table .
I think it 's an important debate for Congress to have . "
Now , should this mass - death come about , our future would be rife with many uncertainties .
But one thing we can know for sure : any attempt by government to manage the crisis will add calamity to disaster .
It will be 9 - 11 plus New Orleans plus a few other amazing failures all rolled into one .
And the worst part of government failure will present itself : rather than make a mess of its own responsibilities , the government acts to prevent people from doing what they should be doing to deal with the crisis .
" Stop in the name of the law " is n't just a slogan from cop shows ; it is the sum total of everything the government does .
The Bush administration , however — which is supposedly staffed by people learned in the wisdom of classical - conservative thought and informed by revelation from America 's traditional religious heritage — is just darn sure that the government is the best and only means to handle a crisis such as this .
A dazzling display of absurdity and chutzpah — that 's what the Bush press conference on the flu was .
Even if the flu does come , and taxpayers have coughed up , the government will surely have a ball imposing travel restrictions , shutting down schools and businesses , quarantining cities , and banning public gatherings .
It 's a bureaucrat 's dream !
Whether it will make us well again is another matter .
And why should individuals on their own have no incentive to deal with disease ?
Why should the private sector have no reason to make cures available if they exist ?
Why are we to believe that the government would somehow do a better job at this level of crisis management than the private sector ?
None of these questions have been asked much less answered .
So I 'm reading along in The New York Times , and it casually says this : " This bird flu has infected about 120 people and killed 60 .
But the virus has yet to pass easily among humans , as is necessary to create a pandemic .
Experts debate whether it ever will , but most believe that a pandemic flu is inevitable someday . "
Well , as Roderick Long often says about such contingencies , anything can happen .
Men from Mars could land in capsules and plant red weed all over the world .
The question we need to ask is how likely is it and who or what should address the problem should it arise .
The World Health Organization provides a link to data about human infection .
It says the following : " Although avian influenza A viruses usually do not infect humans , several instances of human infections have been reported since 1997 . "
So we 've gone from hundreds of infections to " several . "
And when you look at the specifics , most were not human - to - human infections but people in closer contact with sick birds than most anyone ever is .
And even among them , most patients recovered .
For example : " A ( H9N2 ) infection was confirmed in a child in Hong Kong .
The child was hospitalized and recovered . "
In another case in Canada , infections resulted in " eye infections . "
Among those who did die , it was not a clear case of Avian , though the site offers the following odd phrasing : " the possibility of person - to - person transmission could not be ruled out . "
For this , we get a presidential news conference ?
As far as I can tell , the prospect of millions dying from bird flu is pretty remote .
If it does happen — and anything canhappen — why must government be involved at all ?
Economists might invoke a public - goods rationale : pandemic disease protection is a service that can be consumed by additional consumers at no additional cost and the beneficiaries cannot be excluded from the good once produced , and thus this service will not be produced in sufficient quantity in the private sector .
The point is so far flung that it makes a case for Randall Holcombe 's theory of the theory of public goods : " it is in the best interest of the those who run the government to promote public goods theory " and so the best way to understand the theory is as a justification for the legitimacy of the programs the government wants for itself .
It is a tool the government uses for its own benefit .
What about the private - sector alternative ?
It will manage it as well as can be expected .
The price of vaccines will rise and draw more producers into the market .
Businesses will establish their own rules about who can come and go .
Private charities will deal with sickness .
It is n't a perfect solution but it is an improvement on dispatching the Marines or having the government provide " essential goods and services . "
What 's more , the problem of the bird flu is n't even news , since the incidents of human infection are several years old .
Why does the Bush administration choose right now to make such a big showing of its preparations for mass death by bird ?
Could it be that it is running out of other pretexts for expanding power ?
Terrorism is getting boring , floods come only rarely , communism is long gone , the China " threat " is no longer selling , the Middle East is dull , Global Warming is just too silly , and people have gone back to ignoring most anything that comes out of Washington .
Meanwhile , the regime is desperate to be liked again , and forever relive its salad days after 9 - 11 .
That still leaves the question of why so many public health officials seem so hopped up about the bird flu , even though the data does n't come anywhere near supporting their frenzy .
The answer is buried somewhere in those gargantuan budget numbers .
Someone somewhere is going to get that $ 8 billion , and it is not going to be you or me .
What 's remarkable is how little comment the bird flu plan provoked .
We seem to have reached the stage in American public opinion where hysterical frenzies by government and totalitarian plans to take away all liberties are treated as just another day .
We see the president telling us to fork over billions , and we turn the channel .
Was it this way in the old Soviet Union or East Germany when the state newscasts went on every night about the march of socialism ?
Has crisis management become the great white noise of American life ?
It is a serious matter when the government purports to plan to abolish all liberty and nationalize all economic life and put every business under the control of the military , especially in the name of a bug that seems largely restricted to the bird population .
Perhaps we should pay more attention .
Perhaps such plans for the total state ought to even ruffle our feathers a bit .

ぼくが大学に入って間もなくアキバの雑居ビルにあるジャンク屋で店番をしていた頃，DOS/Vの普及でパソコンの価格が暴落し，消費税が5%になって客足もパタリと止まり，メモリとかも潰れた問屋からのフロア買いが横行して香港のスポット価格よりアキバの店頭価格の方が低いという無茶苦茶な状況になってたんだけど「あのいい歳して量販店の店頭でハッピ着てパソコン売ってるおっちゃんたち，20年くらい前は系列SI業者でRPGとかJCL使ってホスト運用してたんだぜ」とか店長にいわれて，あーIT業界というのはこうやってヒトを使い捨てにしていくのか．グループでずっと面倒みてくれるのは親切という気もするけど，恐ろしい世界だな，と思った．自分はどう生きれば，20年後にハッピ着て量販店の店頭で接客しているのではなしに，自分の経験を糧に，周囲から尊敬され，やり甲斐のある仕事にありつけているんだろうか，と悩み始めた．
間もなくジャンク屋は潰れ，僕は出たばかりのECサイトで汎用機＋UNIXサーバーからNTサーバーへの移行で運用コストを数分の一にするというコンサルティングの仕事をした．月に数十件しかないトラヒックを，Web系はCのCGI，ビジネスロジックは汎用機で処理するという無茶苦茶なシステムだったから，赤子の手を捻るようにコストを削減できたけども，何でもグループ会社の発注先にCが分かる奴，Cobolが分かる奴しかいなかったから，そんなヘンテコなシステムが出来上がったらしい．当時大学生だった僕が，発注先とそこを背後で操っている汎用機ベンダのSEを並べて片っ端から論破したら，ボスのところに発注先の社長から「コスト削減のために，ちゃんと新しい技術を勉強するから半年くらい待ってくれないか」と泣きが入った．それを聞いたボスは「君たちは他を知らないで，こちらをカモと思って不必要に何倍も高いシステムを売りつけたのか」と激怒してグループ企業である発注先を切り，ベンダ探しから僕が担当することになった．技術者としてのキャリアも，前の会社や今の会社とのコネも，よくよく考えてみるとこの仕事にはじまっていて，僕に全てを任せてくれた当時の社長には今も足を向けて眠れない．その仕事も一段落した頃，やっぱり自営コンサルという業態で背伸びし続けることの限界を感じて就職した．
前の会社では最初の1年くらいは不得手な仕事で修行をさせてもらったけれども，ネットバブルとか諸々あってサイトの立ち上げを何件かやった．だいたい，サイトが立ち上がるまでは誰もが僕に依存しているので権限が集中するのだけれども，立ち上がった途端に政治的に動く奴からねじ伏せられる．僕もガキだったし，オヤジたちと張り合いながら出来上がってしまったシステムをメンテするのは馬鹿馬鹿しいし，新しいサイトのことを考える方が楽しかったので，潔く身を引いた．会社からも暗にそうすることを求められていた．「君は引く手あまただけど，君の喧嘩相手はそこにしか居場所がないんだから」と．いわれた当時は理不尽だと思ったし，自分の好き勝手にやらしてもらえれば不具合は減って業績だって改善すると思ったけど，自惚れかも知れない．
ひどくしんどいSI仕事をこなした後に脱力して社内NEETとなり，1年くらい無線LANの研究をやったり，所長の代わりに役所の研究会に顔を出したり，ベンチャーを値踏みする手伝いとかをした．その後，いまの会社から僕に相談があり，真面目にやると重そうな仕事だったので会社で受けた．会社の財務は最悪な時期だったし，結構な数のエンジニアは暇しているのに，上長は暇なエンジニアが僕より5も10も年上だというので部下はつけてくれなかった．仕方なく暇してる年上の同僚を自分でみつけて仕事を頼んだ．仕事量を手加減して，彼の独立準備を手伝ったりもした．半年仕事して，先方からは契約を継続・拡大したいといわれたのだが，相変わらず部下をつけてくれる気配も給料を上げてくれる気配もないし，手伝ってくれた同僚も独立して僕に転職を促す始末で，彼とやはり転職した別の同僚から唆されるかたちで会社を見切って客であった今の会社に転職した．人事制度改革の対案を出すべく，人事について勉強しまくったのはこの頃だ．
転職先は外資という割には日本的な会社だった．潰れかかってた会社で従業員がまるで働かないところをみていた僕は，どんなに自分が仕事をサボってもびくともしない会社で，何故みな真剣に仕事するのかという疑問を持ってその会社に入った．けれども理由は簡単だった．指標を決めて，達成度に応じて確実に報いるという単純な仕掛け．仕事そのもののやりがいとかプライドとか，ビジョンの共有とか透明性とか．けどそれができるのは儲かっている会社だからだよね，努力指標と利益とが必ずしも連動しない訳で．それに，どんな会社，どんな仕掛けでも，働いているひともいれば働いていないひともいる．きっと世の中なんてそんなものなのだろう．
まだ入社して間もない頃，競合の旧式製品から自社製品に乗り換えさせる仕事を専門にしている米国本社のコンサルタントを呼んでセミナーを開く機会があり，酒の席で「日本ではシステムを担当する技術者のこだわりで，旧いシステムを簡単には捨てられない．彼らが新しい技術を習得する期間や費用を考えると，必ずしも割安といえないのではないか」と聞いたら「決まってるじゃないか．人材ごと入れ替えるんだよ．それを経営者に説得するのが僕らの仕事だ」といわれた．納得．簡単に人の首をすげ替えられるなら，システムもすげ替えられるよな．米国でうまくいっている方法が日本に当てはまらないのは，日米で雇用慣行や業界構造が違うからではないか，とか真剣に考え始めたのはこの頃からかな．
( まだあるけど後で書く )
とりとめもなく書き進んできたけど，だいぶ前から情報サービス産業で昔ながらの終身雇用・年功序列でやっていけるのだろうか．特に大手SI事業者でオープン系で儲かっていないことの背景に，オープン系の技術とか，それらの技術を価値づけるコスト計算の手法が，米国の雇用慣行を前提としていることで，そうでない仕組みでそういった技術を取り込むことが，ひどく高コストになっているのではないか，或いは技術者を使い捨てざるを得ない世界をつくっているのではないか，ということを考えている．
自分が使い捨てられるのが怖くて先に自分から会社なり組織に見切りをつけてしまうという生き方は決して問題の解決にはなっていないけれども，自分のことを自分でどうにかできるようになってから，時間をかけて世の中のことに目を向け，できることがないか試行錯誤しているところだ．

Craig Morris
Culture shock USA - 6th and last installment
I came back to Germany .
Since I moved here last in 1992 , Germans have been asking me why I stay and whether I even like Germany .
Usually , the question almost seems to insinuate that it must be hard for any foreigner to like this Germany .
Sometimes , it seems to me that Germans have so many complexes because of a 12 - year period that they unjustifiably feel that they have nothing to be proud of .
In contrast , Americans expect everyone to like it in the US .
Maybe that 's why I feel so strange when Germans ask me if I do n't want to go home .
One night , I was talking to the US soldier I dubbed Manta in part V ( Love it or leave it ) to protect his identity .
I 'll now give his wife the pseudonym Sandy in honor of the man behind Kentucky Fried Chicken , Colonel Sanders , who earned his fortune only after retiring at 65 with a measly monthly Social Security check .
Sandy and Manta wanted me to tell them how they could emigrate so they would n't have to work all their lives like all the other Americans without having anything to show for it except a bit of consumerism .
I warned them to be careful .
" Why ? "
Sandy asked .
" Do n't you like Germany ? "
" Of course I do , " I assured her , " it has little to do with Germany itself and everything to do with the status of foreigners .
Germany is definitely just as good as 30 or 40 other countries , but I do n't speak all of the languages in those other 30 or 40 countries that are just as good .
Do you speak a foreign language ? "
" A little bit of Spanish , " the two of them said .
" Good , that will help .
So you want to go to Spain ? "
" It does n't matter .
Italy would also be nice , " Manta said .
" Or France , " Sandy added .
" It certainly does matter , " I said .
" If you do n't speak the language at all , you can't be yourself .
You wo n't be able to show your humor and your personality for years .
You should be going out and spending time with the natives so you can learn their language , but you 'll get a headache after talking to them for 10 minutes at a party .
A whole night in the foreign tongue will feel like a college admission test .
Pretty soon , you 'll be spending all your time with all the other foreigners who are suffering the same fate . "
" Us Americans have it even harder in a way , because everyone all over the world wants to speak English with us .
You might not get much of a chance to learn the local language .
But we 're actually pretty fortunate , " I explained .
" I know a refugee from Iran who lives in Freiburg .
This guy witnessed a state - sponsored mass murder on the way home one evening .
He did n't even bother going home after that ; he went straight over the border .
He spent years in makeshift barracks in southern Germany with other asylum - seekers .
None of them spoke German , and the Germans did n't teach them any German , because it would just cost money , and in the end you did n't know who was gonna be sent home .
Now imagine having to prove to people whose language you do n't speak that you are on the run because you witnessed something that did n't even officially happen ... "
" It 's easy to criticize the natives because foreigners are not well integrated , but foreigners also put themselves in ghettos , " I continued .
" At some point , you find yourself surrounded by nothing but other foreigners , who also do n't have any friends that are n't foreign , and then everybody starts complaining about how hard it is to make friends with these cold , unfriendly natives .
I saw that go on for years in Germany and also thought it must be true because all the foreigners thought the Germans were not interested in us .
" Then I spent a year in France .
You think the foreigners in France spoke differently about the French ?
The Germans I met in France loved spending time with me because they could tell me exactly how they felt in their own native tongue .
You would n't believe how these Germans talked bad about the French !
You can never make friends with them , they 're not interested in foreigners anyway , and so forth .
Real integration is almost impossible even when the conditions in the country of your choice are good .
Both sides have to give it their all . "
" But you made it , did n't you ? "
Sandy asked me .
" You are integrated in Germany ? "
" You know , sometimes I do n't know myself .
I 'll always be a little bit different .
Let 's face it , nobody in the States asks me how I like it in the US .
But even 17 years after I first arrived here , the standard icebreaker in Germany still goes basically like this :
Nice new acquaintance :
What was your name again ?
Me : Craig
Nice new acquaintance :
So where are you from , Greg ?
Me : From the US .
Nice new acquaintance :
And what are you doing here ?
Me : I live here .
Nice new acquaintance :
Why is that ?
Do you like it here ?
I mean , most Americans ...
" I am then entertained with an informative lecture about the nature of my countrymen , accompanied by perplexed looks and repeated questions about whether I can really stand living in Germany . "
" So what gives ? "
Sandy asked .
" Germans do n't like Germany ? "
" You bet your pumpernickel they do , " I said , " they just ca n't admit it because of Hitler and all that .
They look down condescendingly upon us for walking around with the Stars & Stripes everywhere because they know that they are better than we are because they do n't act like they 're better . "
" Fascinating , " Sandy said .
" Wacko , " said Manta .
" But not half as bad as all of these idiotic Americans who do n't want to have the theory of evolution taught in schools .
We are all supposed to learn that God made the world 6,000 years ago ! "
If you can't read this sign , you are driving too slow .
George W. Bush took this exit a few years ago to speak at his Alma Mater .
He told the C students there not to lose heart : " You , too , can become president . "
The sign is said to predate Bush Jr. 's presidency .

" I know what you mean , " I stated .
" I was really furious back in 1994 when California decided to block access to the welfare system , schools , and other public facilities not only for illegal immigrants , but for a lot of legal aliens .
Everybody knows that we have lots of illegal immigrants .
We need them .
Nobody else wants to do the work they do .
But if they need us , we deny them public services . "
" Unfortunately , it 's not any different anywhere else , " I continued , " just the other way around because then we are the foreigners .
You are right to be upset about all the hypocrites who call themselves Christians in the US , but it 's still our country , and we still have rights .
As a foreigner , you do n't have any .
And then , the hypocrites are out to get you . "
" Even in Germany ? " Manta asked .
" Oh yea , " I said .
" In the 1990s , the political party that calls itself the Christian Democrats declared ' The boat is full ' when they were trying to reduce the number of foreigners entering the country .
And under the Christian Democratic government of Helmut Kohl , foreigners had to wait 15 years before becoming eligible for German citizenship .
The left - of - center government that took office in 1998 shortened that period to eight years .
Having said that , Germany 's immigration policy is not that bad compared to the rest of world outside the EU .
I just do n't understand why it always seems to be the people who call themselves Christians who are so strict with the foreigners .
But that 's the same in Germany and the US . "
" But then you should be able to get German citizenship after more than 11 years .
So what 's the problem ? "
Sandy asked .
" I would have to give up my US passport .
Officially , Germany says it does not allow double citizenship , but in practice this only applies to foreigners .
When Germans get their passports renewed , nobody ever checks whether they 've gotten a second passport in the meantime .
In the US , foreigners can get US citizenship after five years of residency , and they do n't have to give up their other passport .
Do n't expect to be treated like that abroad .
Then you wo n't be disappointed . "
" So do you have access to social welfare and all that as a foreigner in Germany ? "
Sandy asked .
The Dream Green Card that was n't
In 1998 , my five - year position at the University of Freiburg ended .
I resolved to try my luck in Freiburg and not go back to the States .
Strangely , in 1997 , when I signed the last extension of my contract , there was a clause stating that I intended to return to the US .
The reason was simple : the University did n't want a lawsuit .
At the time , people from the rest of the EU , who by that time were considered citizens everywhere within the EU , were going to court about such temporary positions because they claim they were being treated like foreigners .
Although a certain amount had been deducted from my paycheck as an unemployment contribution for five years , when I lost my job I was not eligible for unemployment benefits because my residency permit expired on the same day as my work permit and my contract with the University .
The people at the Labor Department told me they were more than willing to give me unemployment benefits , but first I had to be living here legally .
Then , when I went to have my residency permit extended , I was asked how I was going to pay my rent .
' Unemployment benefits ' was not the right answer .
Back then , Germany did not have a green card like the US or a carte de séjour like the French , but only separate permits for residency and work .
Every time I was offered any work anywhere , I had to go get a work permit from the local authorities .
If I got a job working for four hours a week in a town 15 minutes north of Freiburg , I would have to go there to apply for a work permit for just these four hours .
The Labor Department there would then first try to find an unemployed German who was willing to do that work .
If they had n't found one in a couple of months , I would get the permit .
And just because I had a work permit for those four hours just outside of Freiburg did n't mean that I could work another two in Freiburg .
In the 1990s , I repeatedly spent hours waiting along with all of the other foreigners to get a German official to talk to me .
But this time was not a complete loss .
I learned that the only people that German authorities treat better than Americans are EU citizens and " blood Germans " from Eastern Europe .
Foreigners from developing countries are treated the worst as they are generally suspected of being up to no good .
They probably want to stay in Germany !
( Unimaginable , I know , what else could they want but social welfare , the best that Germany has to offer ... what else is there to like here ? )
I resolved to tempt fate .
The friendly , understanding officials patiently explained to me one last time what the law said .
I explain to them that I was n't even going to consider waiting months to get a permit for each and every little job that was offered to me .
I demanded a combined work - and - residency permit à la green card or carte de séjour .
They could give it to me for a year , I told the officials , and I assured them that I was not planning to live off of welfare .
I was not here for free ride .
The officials put on their saddest faces and regretted to inform me that what I was asking them to do simply was not possible in Germany .
Their hands were tied .
" Then you 'll just have to deport me , " I said , " for I have never heard such nonsense and I am not about to obey the law . "
The poor officials had also never heard such nonsense .
They asked me to wait and disappeared for a moment .
A few minutes later , I was asked to talk to their superior in the next room .
He was curious to know why I wanted to live in Germany so badly .
Why did I like it here so much ?
He himself would love to live in the US , like most Germans .
( Keep in mind that this was in 1997 , before Bush took office .
Today , I am not so sure that very many Germans want to live in the US . )
I rattled on at length about culture versus consumerism , intellectual values versus materialism , social bonds instead of individualism -- the latter probably being exactly what no foreigner should ever say when applying for a residency permit .
Something impressed him .
It certainly was n't my sermon .
It must 've been my hard head .
He pulled out a piece of scratch paper and a pen and issued the " Green card " below , which , if push had ever come to shove , would never have done me any good , but at least the man got me out of his office for the next few months until I had a right to a permanent residency permit .
( I got my a permanent work permit to a half years later . )
My own personal ' Green Card ' on genuine scrap paper reads : " Permanent residency permit can be granted in February 98 .
Stipulations -- gainful employment and freelancing as usual .
Otherwise -- gainful employment as freelance teacher of English and translator , music teacher , musician , and choir director permitted .
" I was thus very disappointed , " I told Sandy and Manta , " when Germany came up with a combined permit for residency and work a few years later and even called it in German ' Green Card ' .
They wanted to get IT specialists from India to come work for them , but the Indians did n't fall for it .
They knew what the differences were between the American and the German green card .
The Germans wanted the Indians to go home no later than after five years .
Why would anyone bust their butt to learn German if you can't use it later because you get kicked out of the country ? "
" Wait a minute , " Sandy said with a sarcastic look in her eye as she stood in front of a shelf full of history books , " why should these Indians benefit from such a boss welfare system ?
I mean , their forebears were n't even there when German workers sat down with employers to demand their hard - earned rights ; instead , they were probably off somewhere not doing jack in some European colony ... "
12 September 2001
Since 1998 , I have often asked myself whether it was really such a good idea to subject myself to life as a foreigner just so I could get away from ... what ?
What do n't I like about the US ?
And is Germany any better ?
Back in 97-98 when I decided for Germany and against the US , I was very disappointed in my country .
Bill Clinton had basically done away with welfare starting in 1994 .
And although an overwhelming majority of Americans wanted to have a state health care system , the Democrats proved incapable of setting one up against the opposition of industry lobbies .
As a lecturer at the University of Freiburg from 1993 to 1998 , part of my job had been explaining my country 's political system .
Republican Senator Jesse Helms was appointed chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in 1994 .
He wasted no time making clear that he did n't want to waste any American money in " rat holes " in Africa .
So much for my country 's development policies .
I also introduced my German students to the longest - serving Senator ( 48 years ) : Republican Strom Thurmond .
Back during the civil rights movement , this man even switched parties to protest racial integration -- three decades after he had gotten a black woman pregnant .
I asked my German students what parties such people would be members of in Germany .
They all agreed that such people would be ' Republikaner ' in Germany : neo -Nazis .
And if a German politician ever said that German development aid should not be wasted in some African rathole , but that taxes should be lowered , my students felt that lots of Germans would take to the street to protest .
Americans never demonstrated against Jesse Helms ; they made him chairman of the committee responsible for development aid .
Among other things , it was such highfalutin political issues that kept me in Germany in 1998 , but starting on September 12 , 2001 everyday matters took over the spotlight again .
In 1998 , I withdrew my application for a position as Director of the Center for International Studies at a good university in the US .
I probably stood a good chance of getting the job : the professor who had been my first reader for my bachelor 's thesis had become a deacon at this university .
From 1998 to 2001 , I often asked myself if I had made the right decision .
After September 12 , 2001 , I felt sure that I had .
From Europe , Americans seemed to be blind with patriotism .
Organisation like the American Council of Trustees and Alumni ( ACTA ) published studies like " Defending Civilization : How Our Universities Are Failing America and What Can Be Done About It " , in which they railed against all professors and students who did not support Bush :
Rarely did professors publicly mention heroism , rarely did they discuss the difference between good and evil , the nature of Western political order or the virtue of a free society .
Indeed , the message of much of academe was clear : BLAME AMERICA FIRST .
ACTA was founded in 1995 by Lynn Cheney ( wife of the current Republican vice - president ) and Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman , who made history in 2000 when Al Gore chose him as his running mate , thus making him the first Jewish candidate for the White House .
At the end of 2001 , blacklists like Campus Watch began popping up so people could list the names of professors allegedly critical of Israel and hence pro-Arab , i.e. pro-terrorist .
On the website of the Students for Academic Freedom , people can still denounce professors who misuse their classrooms to propagate their own political beliefs .
This website is not , as the name might suggest , the product of concerns students , but rather the brainchild of David Horwitz , author of the book " Unholy Alliance : Radical Islam and the American Left " .
Mercy , mercy me
" They would have made life hell for you as the director of the abroad program , " I thought as I drove from Austin back to New Orleans .
As I went through the radio channels , I found several Christian stations preaching hate .
I kept thinking of talks I had had back when I lived in the states with " conservatives " who were against abortion , homosexuals , etc .
I listened to these people back then and took them seriously .
I asked them if it would n't be a good idea to concentrate on preventing violence in heterosexual marriages before we prohibit functioning relationships between homosexuals .
I asked them why an omnipotent and omniscient God needed humans to punish sins .
And I tried to make it clear to them that the whole point of the New Testament was a rejection of the Old : " Those without sin throw the first stone . "
I do n't know if I made anyone back then more compassionate .
Today , my countrymen seem to all be upset at each other .
Conservatives are persecuting liberals , and liberals are bad - mouthing conservatives .
Is anyone out there still able to have a calm , respectful discussion ?
There is also a lot of confusion .
The people who call themselves conservatives seem to be able to decide what is moral and what is not .
Environmental protectionists who literally want to " conserve " the earth are at a loss when it comes to getting their message across because their opponents are already called " conservative " .
But the so - called conservatives are the ones who want to use up the resources of the earth as fast as possible because the end of the world is near .
They have even come up with an Pindex to forecast its arrival .
Suddenly , a song by Mose Allison came on the radio .
Mose , my guru -- white bread from Mississippi , just like me .
A man who does n't let his lack of a real , booming blues voice like Willie Dixon 's stop him from singing the blues about the absurdity of the world .
As I cruised down the highway in southern Louisiana , his words from the days of the Vietnam War accompanied me :
I can't believe the things I 'm seeing
I wonder ' bout some things I 've heard
Everybody crying mercy
But they do n't know the meaning of the word
A bad enough situation
Is sure enough getting worse
Everybody crying justice
Just as long as there 's business first
The road trip was relaxing .
No Germans raced up from behind doing 120 mph and flashing their headlights for me to get out of the way .
In the US , we flash our headlights to tell oncoming traffic that there 's a cop ahead , not get a fellow traveler our of our way .
I was n't in anyone 's way .
We were all driving 85 mph .
Maybe the speed limit was 70 , maybe 75 , I was n't sure .
Who knows , who cares .
As long as we all drive too fast together , we are safe because the police can't stop everybody .
An 18 - wheeler even passed me up on the left ; it must 've been doing 90 .
Nobody was in more of a hurry than anyone else .
We all drove together .
Why do Americans limit their cooperation and their civil disobedience to speeding ?
The country has always been splintered .
Whites used to be told that blacks were subhuman .
Open season on niggers !
Racism was fostered so that poor whites and poor blacks would never even think of working together to defend all of the many interests they share against the rich people who run the country .
Better to let the white trash lynch a couple of niggers than have them vote us out of office ...
Every four years , politicians pull all of the old smoke and mirrors out of their hat : gay marriage , abortion , the fight against crime , etc .
They distract voters with issues that are controversial everywhere .
They divide voters up into little groups to prevent them from defend the most important interests they all share .
It is a scheme designed to get people to vote against their own interests .
Who shows mercy ?
Mose , can you help me here ?
Everybody crying peace on earth
Just as soon as we win this war
Departure
At the airport in New Orleans the next day , my head began spinning even though I had n't had anything to drink .
I said goodbye to my brother and walked to the terminal .
Passengers were soon being called to board by section : " Now boarding passengers in sections A and B . "
I got up and walked to the end of the line .
A group of some 20 Germans aged 30 - 45 was standing in front of me .
They were all holding boarding passes with a large letter F on them .
I overheard them discussing in German whose English was the worst .
They wanted to send that person up to the front of the line to try to get on board right away .
The others said they would follow along behind .
" You bastaaaaards ! " something screamed inside me .
My head , already spinning , was now dizzy with outrage .
" How dare you come into my country and not respect our ways !
Ever heard of integration ?!
You know exactly how things work here , but you can't wait like everybody else , no , you have to sit in the plane longer than everyone else ! "
" Do n't get on board , " I suddenly heard a voice say in my left ear .
I turned and saw a tiny creature floating in the air .
" Lucifer ! " my Bible Belt soul gasped .
But then I seemed to recognize the creature .
Mose , is it you ?
Have you finally come to tell me what to do ?
But no , it was Ralph Nader .
" Stay here , Craig .
You 've done your best over there , but they are not your people .
You have n't bought a book in a store in years if you could order it online because you can't stand the elbow mentality of Germans .
Germans will never be able to stand in line , Craig , forget it .
And they drive you crazy on the autobahn !
You are constantly looking in the rearview mirror to make sure some environmentally conscious German is not coming up behind you flashing like a Christmas tree doing 120 .
And what do Germans say when they want to get by you ?
' Achtung ! ' ( warning ! ) or ' Vorsicht ! ' ( careful ! ) , but not ' Verzeihung ' ( excuse me ) .
You are just in their way .
So get outta there .
" Craig , your country needs obsessive weirdos like you who spend their leisure time looking into the lies the government tells and shouting the truth from the mountaintop .
I am 81 .
Chomsky is 76 .
If all the Americans who have been thinking about leaving since November actually do so , who is going to be left behind to keep the neoconservatives in check ?
And do n't forget the good food here !
We have more than bread ! "
" Get in the plane ! " I heard two voices shouting in my right ear .
Two tiny creatures were floating in the air .
It was my four - year - old daughter and seven - year - old son in Germany .
" Daddy , you 've been gone too long .
Do n't listen to that idiot !
You 're just having delusions of grandeur .
Mom 's never gonna play along with that , and you know it .
You belong here with us .
Stop thinking it's better on the other side -- you 're just making excuses !
Only you can make you happy , and no one can make you unhappy if you do n't let them -- is n't that what you 're bringing back with you from New Orleans ( Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans ? ) ?
" Daddy , the Germans are meister complainers .
Come back , and bring the frontier spirit from Texas with you ( Die Definition von " Pioniergeist " ) !
Forget all those highfalutin goals ; learn do deal with what life doles out - like a real frontiersman !
You just spent 30 days in the States trying to show Americans what the Germans do better .
Come back , and bring the best from the States with you .
Take the best from both worlds ! " ( Craig Morris )
The Linux desktop is about to get a 3 - D makeover courtesy of Novell .
Novell is contributing a new graphics subsystem called " Xgl " and the associated " Compiz " compositing manager to the granddaddy of all Linux and UNIX windowing infrastructures , X.org .
The move may well herald in a new era of graphics power for Linux and according to Novell has already garnered the interest of the principal graphics chips vendors , Intel , ATI and Nvidia .
Xgl enables *nix systems to fully take advantage of 3 - D acceleration hardware .
Xgl according to Novell 's description is the X server architecture layered on top of OpenGL .
The new enhancements enable a long list of capabilities for Linux that include improved 3 - D capabilities and more fluid " fancy " desktop animations and transitions .
From a technical perspective it is a pluggable modular architecture that is intended to easily allow developers to take advantage of its capabilities .
" Now Linux has a world - class totally modern graphics system that will last us for the next decade , " Nat Friedman , vice president of Linux desktop engineering at Novell told internetnews.com .
Friedman is well known in the desktop Linux community , having co-founded the GNOME project and its commercial offshoot Ximian ( later acquired by Novell ) .
The Xgl effort is not however GNOME specific .
By working with X.org , Novell is targeting the most fundamental of all * nix graphics components .
As opposed to Microsoft Windows , where Windows is the only graphical windowing environment , Linux has many , the two most popular , though , are KDE and GNOME .
" This is the right place to put it technically , " Friedman explained .
" The X windowing system lies beneath KDE and GNOME .
All users , both GNOME and KDE , can take advantage of it . "
According to Friedman , the approach is to use the existing X framework and just add 3 - D features .
" So all your existing apps work out of the box , even an old 1985 X application will work . "
Up until 2004 , X.org was somewhat overshadowed by XFree86 , but now for the most part is the uncontested standard utilized in almost all Linux and UNIX distributions .
X.org is well known for its stability and long release cycles .
Friedman noted however that so far Xgl has been well received by X developers .
And think that adoption of Xgl into the mainstream X.org release will happen sooner than most would expect .
Novell will actually ship the Xgl enhancements with its next desktop product , Novell Desktop 10 , which is set for a May / June release .
Xgl may also prove to be the solution to a long - standing complaint of many : the lack of full 3 - D hardware acceleration drivers for Linux .
Friedman explained that Xgl relies on the drivers to already be on the users systems and if the users do n't already have the video drivers none of this stuff will work .
" This will help to create an impetus for the vendors to have great driver on Linux , " Friedman said .
" Intel , ATI and Nvidia , we have engineering co-operation from each of those companies they 've each seen XGL and have responded very positively .
" As a result of seeing what we 've done they 've all stepped up to the table and said we 're going to help with the drivers and make the drivers work even better than they do now . "
My article 10 Reasons You Should Never Get a Job has quickly become very popular , so I figured it would be nice to write something about the realities of self - employment as well .
Since there are so many myths about self - employment ( especially among lifelong employees ) , a good place to start would be to dispel some of those myths .
I started my first business right after graduating college ( I graduated in Dec 1993 ) and have been continuously self - employed since then .
The only time I was ever an employee was during college , when I worked six months as a part - time retail sales associate .
1 . Self - employed people have to work really long hours .
Many self - employed people work longer hours than employees .
Some enjoy their work so much they want to put in long hours .
Some set up their businesses in such a way that their physical presence is necessary for income generation .
Either way it ’s a choice though because you ’re the one who decides how to set things up .
Many self - employed people start businesses where they get paid only while they ’re working , such as an attorney who opens a law office and bills his / her clients at a certain hourly rate .
When the attorney is at home , s/he generates no income .
But there ’s no law of self - employment that says you have to start a business that only generates income while you ’re working .
If you start a business like this , you ’re really just creating a job for yourself .
I prefer to think of self - employment in terms of systems building .
You build income - generating systems that generate income for you , systems you own and control .
It ’s like you own the golden goose , and it does the work of laying the golden eggs .
So working long hours is largely a symptom of the type of business you create as well as your personal choice .
If you do n’t like working long hours , you certainly do n’t have to .
2 . The only reason to build a business is to sell it .
This is a favorite statement of Michael Gerber , author of The E - Myth Revisited and various other E - Myth books .
While you can certainly build a business to sell or to take public , you can also build a business to keep .
In fact , it ’s perfectly valid to build a business , run it for a while , and then simply kill it .
As a self - employed person , you ’re free to build whatever kind of business you want .
You ’re the boss .
If you want to build a business to sell , go for it .
If you just want an income source that does n’t require you to get a job , that ’s fine too .
There ’s no rule that says you have to build a business that ’s a monument to human greatness .
Many people enjoy serial entrepreneurship .
They start a business , run it for a certain time , and then either sell it or close up shop .
Then they repeat the process .
You can also run multiple businesses at the same time .
This might sound too complicated , but once you ’ve been running a business for a decade or more , it ’s not that hard to repeat the process and spawn another one .
Such variety can be fun if you do n’t overdo it .
3 . Self - employment is much riskier than getting a job .
Security is a result of control , and self - employment gives you far more control over your income than you have with a regular job .
When you ’re self - employed no one can fire you or lay you off .
Which is more secure — owning your income stream or leasing it ?
Ownership obviously .
If you need to make extra cash quickly , that ’s very tough to do as an employee .
But as an owner who controls all the business assets , you have the ability to rechannel resources to increase income in a pinch .
Having control makes a huge difference .
Employees take the biggest risk of all .
You learn how risky it is when you unexpectedly hear the words , “ we ’re letting you go , ” while the owners enjoy the spoils of record profits .
4 . Self - employment means putting all your eggs in one basket .
Ask yourself this :
How many people would have to turn against you to shut off all your income ?
For employees the answer is usually one .
If your boss fires you , your income gets turned off immediately .
Whether or not it ’s justified is irrelevant — you suffer a total loss of income regardless of the reasons .
Now that ’s putting all your eggs in one basket .
With self - employment , however , you can more easily diversify your income streams and thereby reduce your risk .
You have the control necessary to make this happen .
Generating different types of income from thousands of customers is a lot more secure than receiving only one paycheck .
Together Erin and I receive about 10 different types of income , including direct sales , third party sales through distributors , ad revenue , royalties , affiliate income , consulting fees , etc .
Even if our single biggest source of income were turned off immediately , we ’d still be fine .
5 . Being self - employed is stressful .
What ’s stressful is not being able to make ends meet , whether you ’re an employee or self - employed .
But given the same standard of living and income , I think self - employment is less stressful because you enjoy more control .
Not having control over your time and your life is stressful .
When you have the freedom to say no , you can more easily control your stress .
Self - employment can be very low - stress if you decide to make it so .
You can turn your office into a relaxing place to work .
You can set your own hours .
If you notice the onset of stress , you can take time off to relax .
No one can force you to do anything you do n’t want to do .
6 . The customer is always right .
If you ’re self - employed , feel free to fire customers that cause you grief .
Some customers just are n’t worth having .
Erin and I have interacted with thousands of customers over the past 11 years , and nearly all of them have been great .
But every once in a while , we ’ll turn a customer away and refuse to accept any more business from that person .
We rarely find it necessary to do so , but it does happen .
I can handle criticism just fine , but what crosses the line for me is when a customer becomes obnoxiously rude , insulting , or threatening .
Some people think that if they behave like jerks , any business will bend over backwards to help them .
But my customer service motto is : no civility , no service .
If you ’re self - employed , there ’s no need to do business with people who think it ’s their privilege to treat you like dirt .
You wo n’t enjoy having such customers , and you wo n’t enjoy the types of referrals they send you .
Besides , it ’s a lot of fun to refer these people to your competitors .
7 . Being self - employed is lonely .
Many employees think they enjoy a rich social life when all they do is hang out with their co-workers .
That ’s fine for starters , but it can get pretty stale after a while .
On the contrary I think it ’s easier for self - employed people to recognize the need for social activities outside their work .
At the very least , this may be motivated by the desire to network and to learn from other business owners .
There ’s no need to be isolated and lonely if you ’re self - employed as long as you take the time to pursue other social outlets .
Personally I love hanging out with other self - employed people .
Such people have a certain energy and proactivity that I rarely see in employees .
A regular job provides some built - in socialization , but if you think about it , you ’ll see that it ’s very limited .
An employee can be fired for excessive socializing on the job .
But a self - employed person can socialize freely at any time of day .
Self - employment can be wonderful in the early stages of dating , especially if you ’re both self - employed .
When Erin and I started dating , I would often pop over to her house in the morning and spend half a day with her .
This allowed our relationship to progress more quickly , and after three months we moved in together .
Sure I did n’t work as hard during that time , but self - employment gave me the freedom to put my social life ahead of my work .
8 . Self - employed people have to do everything themselves .
Self - employed people may be responsible for making sure everything gets done , but it ’s usually foolish for them to do everything themselves .
That would be way too much work .
Erin owns and manages VegFamily Magazine , but she does n’t do the work of publishing each issue herself .
She has a staff of writers who create the content and a managing editor that oversees the details of each issue .
Erin designed and created the system , but other people run it for her .
You do n’t even have to design your own system if you can leverage someone else ’s .
I generate advertising income from this site , but the vast majority of ads are served up by Google Adsense .
I do n’t sell the ads or deal with the advertisers —
Google handles all of that .
If I had to sell every ad myself , that would be insane … way too much work for me to handle alone .
9 . Self - employment is too complicated .
Self - employment can seem complicated because there ’s a lot to learn in the beginning , such as accounting , taxes , payroll , legal issues , insurance , etc .
It does take a while to learn the basics , but most of it is n’t particularly difficult .
Just get yourself a good book on the subject , and you ’ll be off to a great start .
I recommend picking up a copy of Small Time Operator .
Do n’t let the initial learning curve get you down .
You only need to learn this info once … and only for your first business .
If you start a second business later , you ’ll be up and running much more quickly .
If you set things up right , the ongoing maintenance of a business does n’t have to be a nightmare .
10 .
You need lots of money to start a new business .
That depends on the business .
You can start an online business for very little cash since domain names and web hosting are dirt cheap .
We ’re talking less than $ 100 to cover the whole first year .
I used about $ 20 K of my own money to launch my games business in 1994 , but I learned my lesson because the money went way too fast .
So when I started this personal development business , I decided to do it as cheaply as possible .
I spent only $ 9 ( to register StevePavlina.com ) , and I required that any other expenses would have to come out of revenue .
I did n’t make any money the first 4 months , but after 22 months the business is now earning about $ 9000 / month .
I ’m pleased with this result , but I ’m not that far along in my plans yet , so this is by no means the end .
I ’m not suggesting that any idiot can kick - off a decent self - employment income for the price of a movie ticket — you did notice this site is called “ Personal Development for Smart People , ” did n’t you ?
The point is simply that you do n’t need to pour your life savings into your first business .
You do , however , need an intelligent way to provide value to people .
The nice thing about an online business is that you can create value ( like an article ) for a fixed time investment , and technology can deliver that value millions of times over without costing you any extra time or money .
You invest a little time in the initial value creation , but you get paid for the ongoing value delivery .
Technology does most of the work for a cost that ’s virtually zero , but you get paid for its results ( significantly more than zero ) .
In contrast to self - employed people , employees do n’t normally get paid for their ongoing value delivery .
They get paid a flat rate or a one - time commission while their employer reaps the ongoing rewards indefinitely .
Employees are very generous to their employers .
Try it for yourself
Hopefully I ’ve helped dispel some common myths of self - employment .
Such irrational fears are n’t representative of the reality .
Of course the only way to really understand self - employment is to experience it yourself .
I ’ve met quite a number of self - employed people in my life , but I ’ve never heard any of them say that becoming self - employed was a mistake and that they wished they ’d gotten a regular job instead , even if the business did n’t do well financially .
Self - employment is a powerful vehicle for personal growth , and often the greatest value comes from the skills and self - knowledge you gain along the way .
Like many other self - employed people , I ’d sooner give up all my businesses than the lessons I learned from building them .

One of America 's most experienced astronauts has denounced the space shuttle as a deathtrap and accused US space officials of stifling all concerns raised about its safety .
The revelation comes as America prepares to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Challenger disaster .
Seven astronauts were killed on 28 January 1986 , when their shuttle exploded 73 seconds after take - off .
Veteran astronaut Mike Mullane 's outburst therefore comes at a deeply embarrassing time for the Nasa .
Apart from dealing with the Challenger anniversary , it is now struggling to save its remaining space shuttles so they can complete the international space station .
However , all three - Discovery , Atlantis and Endeavour - are still grounded because engineers have not yet fixed insulation problems that doomed Challenger 's sister craft , Columbia , in 2003 .
' It 's the most dangerous manned spacecraft ever flown , ' said Mullane , who took part on three shuttle missions before retiring in 1990 .
' It has no powered - flight escape system ...
Basically the bail - out system we have on the shuttle is the same bail - out system a B - 17 bomber pilot had in World War II . '
It was this lack of ejector seats that ensured the deaths of Challenger 's astronauts .
Such a powered escape system could have blasted them from their stricken ship and saved them .
' That was the true tragedy of Challenger .
Nothing was learnt .
Only janitors and cafeteria workers at Nasa were blameless in the deaths of the Challenger seven , ' said Mullane .
' Columbia was a repeat of Challenger , where people had a known design problem and launched anyway . '
Mullane added that astronauts deserved some share of responsibility for not pursuing safety issues more doggedly .
It is estimated that it now costs Nasa $ 5bn a year to pay for the 16,000 engineers who maintain the fleet - even if none of them actually flies .
As a result , the bill for designing , building and launching the shuttle has now topped $ 150 billion .
Engineers point out that the craft has been responsible for putting the Hubble space telescope and the International Space Station into orbit .
However , each craft has thousands critical components .
A failure of any of these will doom a craft .
On Challenger , it was a seal on a solid rocket booster .
On Columbia , it was piece of loose insulation foam .
' You walk in terrified of doing anything that might jeopardise your one chance to get to space , ' Mullane said in an interview to promote his new book , Riding Rockets .
' It 's not like other jobs , where if you get frustrated you can go in to your boss and say " Shove it ! "
You can't do that at Nasa because there 's no other place to go fly shuttles . '
The three remaining shuttles are supposed to retire in 2010 after completing construction work on the orbiting space station , which has been operating with a skeleton crew of two since the Columbia disaster .
Why Did We Buy Kiko ?
a lot of little reasons
one big reason
The Calendar Function
very
The Important Question
now
good for sure ?
This Situation and Tucows
much
Other Benefits
Global User-base
Mobile Integration
Nice AJAX Implementation
Conclusion
now
On August 26th , 2006 , Tucows was the winning bidder in the widely discussed ( Techmeme eBay auction of the web - based calendar application Kiko
While there are , I 'll cover a few of them in a moment , there is reallywhy we bought Kiko .
We needed the functionality , quite desperately , inside of our email platform and it was going to take us a long time to get it .
Especially at the level of sophistication Kiko has .
Most webmail platforms have a calendar but very few of them are ever used .
It is quite simply a crappy user experience .
We as users have a problem with shared calendar inside of Tucows and because we are a mixed - desktop environment we are not able to go with the expensive - frustrating - functional Exchange Server solution .
At times there have been real pushes for this internally but I have pushed back and insisted that anything we do with a shared calendar be open standards .
There is not much .
We all believe that a calendar is aimportant function in the messaging suite for small businesses .
Given that people do n't want to maintain separate services for personal and business use , and because the line between personal and business services is getting blurrier , we felt this functionality was a big hole for us .
So why did n't we build it ?
Well the short answer is we have so many things to do in general and so many exciting things to do with email in particular that it was just not going to be possible until at least Q2 of next year and even then the plan did n't really excite anyone around here .
It looked sort of like the next - gen of our current offering .
Had this not come up we would have probably stayed the course and looked to catch a break .
When it did , we quickly went through a simple calculus .
What would we pay to have a kick - ass AJAX - based calendar available
When I am dealing with quick , complicated decisions I really like to boil them down to a simple abstract construct .
Yes there are a huge number of shadings around that question but at its simplest that is the essence of the decision .
What was the value to Tucows of the time and the certainty ?
Of being in the market with this functionality six to twelve months earlier than otherwise ?
What was the value of having it beEven if we threw it away in six months ( not that we plan to do that ) ?
What I can tell you for certain ( and you 'll be able to hear more details in an upcoming podcast ) is that it was more than we paid ! of Kiko to a buyer and much of it was both accurate and confirming .
Justin and Emmett ( see them being interviewed by Alan Wilensky here and here ) were absolutely right in determining that Kiko was a feature not a business .
We think they were absolutely right in assessing that integration with email was key and that the greatest value here was to someone with a suite of services to integrate with .
We felt that this was going to be 2 - 3 man-years of work and they confirmed that .
All of this made us more comfortable in the short period of time that we had to make our decisions .
There were also some interesting facts that were specific to Kiko that made it work for us .
It was clear from their posts and such that Justin and Emmett were no longer passionate about the calendar space and were excited to do something else .
They felt , and we agree , that this was worthmore with them along for the ride .
Probably by a factor of ten .
It would have then attracted a completely different type of buyer .
We would not have paid that premium for the people .
Not that they are n't worth it .
Just that our financial calculus was different .
This probably kept some of the natural buyers out of the process .
We also did not need a huge base of retail users .
They are nice and we will provide them with a great home but if this had been much of a success outside of Mike 's 53,651 it probably would have attracted more financial buyers or domainers and the price might have ended up more than we were willing to pay .
It is worth noting here ( and we also talk more about this in the podcast ) that there was clearly interest in the domain name and the traffic .
We will certainly monetize that as it is a space we know well , but we also may choose to sell the name off as it is not core for us .
Either way it is another place where we , more than most / all other buyers who would be interested in the calendar functionality , will be uniquely able to take advantage of the assets .
In a nutshell , this was the kind of deal where we were buying exactly what they were selling .
That makes for good business and , by the way , is too infrequently the case with Internet services .
As we dug deeper there were a number of other little benefits that made this seem like a great fit and got us comfortable pushing ourselves a bit on the spend .
I will call out a few of these , but this list is not exhaustive : -
For some the non-US customer set and things like language support may not have been seen as benefits .
For us they were a very nice addition .
Our business is extremely global with customers in over 110 countries .
We have a large European business and a large South American business .
We have plenty of customers in Asia .
The customers and languages that come along with Kiko are a nice benefit for us . -
Kiko has a very impressive set of mobile carriers they integrate with .
We were blown away when we dug into this .
It will be nice to have that functionality for the calendar .
It will be even nicer to have an existence proof for making the rest of our services more mobile .
We are just starting to experiment with mobile around the edges of our business and this will help things along . -
Kiko is a very nice use of AJAX , especially in a lot of the underlying thinking .
To me , that is not about technology , but about making a web app behave more like a desktop app .
Learning how this worked within Kiko and having to maintain this code base will be very good for the rest of our services .
Again , there is a nice broad application of a benefit to be taken advantage of .
First and foremost this was about better / faster .
We were able to get a key feature done well , and done .
In my view we were lucky with a number of the small things that made this happen .
The people were not part of the deal which held down value for one group of buyers .
The retail user base was real but not too large , which held down value for another group of potential buyers .
There were also a number of side benefits which are important in any good deal .
The global user base and language support , the mobile integration and the nice use of AJAX are three examples .
All in , we are quite excited about this , we thank Justin and Emmett for all their hard work , we look forward to giving the existing customers an ever - improving user experience and look forward to bringing a great shared calendar to the millions of end-users and thousands of partners who use Tucows services today .
robert hahn a darn good web developer
Building User - Programmable Websites
One of the things that I immediately picked up on when I studied Representational State Transfer ( REST ) was the notion that you could apply Object Oriented terminology to URI ’s quite easily .
Assuming that http://roberthahn.ca/ was a prompt , URI fragments such as book / search seemed to be pretty obviously an object / method call .
In other words , if you were to see this in program code , you ’d probably see book .
search ( ) .
With that realization , I saw a couple of avenues were thought experiments could be conducted .
The first avenue that I ’d like to discuss is whether it ’s considered legal to actually write object / method calls in the URI .
I have n’t properly finished this research , but my first look through RFC 3986 seems to suggest that while characters such as parentheses are reserved , whether they need to be encoded depends on the scheme that you are using .
As far as I know , parentheses do not require encoding for the http scheme .
Ok , so what does that buy me ?
That question segue ’s neatly to my second avenue of research .
How could I write programs with URI ’s ?
If want to design an OO interface to your application , you ’d realize that the only thing to do is to predefine a set of objects and methods , and expose the API to prospective URI hackers , which I ’ll dub ‘ yurihackers ’ .
So : Let ’s consider a hypothetical developer , Alex , building a web enabled address book for me , and wants to build some kind of API for people who will be using this .
For the purpose of the exercise , I ’m setting aside any considerations about how user - friendly writing OO syntax is , because I ’m talking to you - the - developer here .
If I ’m leaving anything as an exercise to the reader , figuring out how to make this user - friendly will be it .
We ’re going to start small , and we ’ll basically talk about three kinds of data this address book will store .
Those would be names , addresses , and phone numbers .
Alex decides to set up three URI - queriable objects : Person , Address , and Phone .
He then adds a basic set of methods for these objects , and , for the sake of keeping this post less long than it already is , preloads my addressbook data , into the database .
NOTE : all the URI ’s you ’ll see DO NOT work - this is a hypothetical example , ok ?
Excited to have at last a web based , programmable addressbook , I try out a search :
http://roberthahn.ca/Phone.find(area_code=519)
And I get a list of phone numbers in the 519 area code .
Hmm … I think I ’m going to need that .
Let ’s save it :
http://roberthahn.ca/p=Phone.find(area_code=519)
So far , since I ’m typing all this into a browser , the natural response would be formatted as HTML .
What if I wanted it formatted in Atom ?
http://roberthahn.ca/p.atom
This search engine is pretty dumb .
As I said , I just get a list of phone numbers that matched my criteria - no names , no addresses .
In fact , the search method is so dumb , it just does a literal substring match of the term 519 to the area code field in the database .
This level of dumbness is exactly what I want , since Alex has thoughtfully provided me with tools to process my own search results in a way that I find relevant to me .
Realizing that the 519 area code will include numbers local to London , Ontario , and Waterloo , ON , I ’m thinking that it would be good to filter down that list so that I ’m only seeing Waterloo phone numbers .
Let ’s try something :
http://roberthahn.ca/w=Address.find(city=Waterloo)
And we get a bunch of Waterloo addresses .
No phone numbers though .
Thankfully Alex added a Results object with some handy methods , like ‘ match ’ :
http://roberthahn.ca/pw=Results.match(p,w)
And what we ’ll get back are a list of phone numbers matched up to their addresses .
Obviously an explanation is owed at this point , but I ’d really like to get the people ’s names first , then spit out the results as a tab delimited format .
http://roberthahn.ca/n=Names.find_all
http://roberthahn.ca/npw=Results.match(n,pw)
http://roberthahn.ca/npw.tdf
Ok , so let ’s talk about what ’s going on .
If you have any experience building web apps , the first thing is obvious : you have to involve a session cookie or this whole exercise is pointless .
The next thing to realize is that if I make an assignment like this : n=Names .
find_all then i’d have to store that string in a database , linked to the session , so that if I might need n later on , the server will have a way to find out what it represents .
Outputting data to different formats really should be a straightforward exercise if you ’ve built your app in such a way that the view logic is separated from the business logic , and that the same view logic is applied to different file formats .
One of the best known apps that play with this idea is blosxom , which has been one of my favourite blogging tools for a long time .
As long as you have the necessary format files prepared , all you need to do to use them is change the file extension on the URI .
The Results. match ( ) object is probably the most interesting aspect to this because what ’s being enabled is the possibility of accessing an object not linked to a database for the purpose of processing search results in a useful way .
This object works simply by examining the arguments passed to it , and looking up the assignments in the saved set of searches for that user ’s session .
Once the assignments are found , they are then processed so that Results. match ( ) has a set of data to work with .
It should be pretty easy to dream up other methods to add to the Results object that would further improve it ’s usefulness .
There perhaps is only one more gotcha left in this idea - how can we parse these URI ’s in a sane way ?
Regex ’s are obviously out of the question .
The inspiration for the answer came to me from this article at perl.com : Lexing Your Data - in short , build a Lexer parser designed to tokenize your URI ’s and turn them into something your application can use .
I have n’t yet had the time to realize these thought experiments as working code , but the notion seemed interesting enough that I wanted to share it first .
If you see some problems with this , please let me know .
If you do n’t get it at all , I ’d like to hear that too .
And if you build something , let me see how you did !
This weekend Amnesty International is holding a conference in London which brings together the biggest gathering of former " war on terror " detainees .
Around 25 former inmates at Guantánamo Bay are attending and speakers will include former detainees from the UK , Russia and Afghanistan .
Ahead of the three - day conference , Amnesty conducted interviews with four former Guantánamo detainees and transcripts of these are below .
You can also listen to audio files of the first and second interviews .
The first interview is with Moazzam Begg , one of nine British men who were held at Guantánamo Bay .
He was seized in Islamabad in February 2002 by the CIA and initially held at Bagram airbase in Afghanistan for around a year .
He was held in Guantánamo until January 2005 , when he was released without charge .
At Bagram he says he saw two people beaten to death by guards ; one guard told him how it was necessary for them to " dehumanise " detainees to cope with working there .
The second interview is with Ustad Badruzzaman Badr , from Afghanistan , who was arrested with his brother , journalist Abdurraheem Muslim Dost , at their home in Pakistan in November 2001 .
They were held by the ISI , Pakistan 's intelligence service , before being handed over to the Americans .
Both were released from Guantánamo Bay at the end of last year .
The third interview is with Airat Vakhitov , one of eight Russian detainees .
He was held in solitary confinement at Bagram in Afghanistan for a year before being transferred to Guantánamo , from where he was released in 2004 .
The final interview is with Rustam Akhmiarov , another Russian who was also released last year .
Transcripts
[ At Bagram airbase in Afghanistan ]
The guards had put barbed wire at the back of the cages or the cells where we 'd use that area as the latrine .
This detainee had apparently been able to push the barbed wire through and crawl out and run out - completely confused as to whether he 's going left or right or where he was going to go in his orange suit .
So the guards caught him and they beat him literally to death .
After which they dragged him in front of all the cells which were there and that 's when I saw his body .
They took him to the medical room which was also opposite the cell where I was and they closed the doors .
After that there was a whole series of doctors and medics and officers running in and rushing about .
And eventually they carried his body out on a stretcher with the blanket covering his face and all we could se were the beaten soles of his feet that were visible .
I spoke to one of the soldiers who used to get along quite well with me and he told me exactly what he'd done , why he'd done it and how he 'd done it .
This soldier I 'd met in Kandahar and he was one of the few who used to speak to me quite regularly and I was so amazed that he was so candid about telling me how he'd done this and why he'd done this and why he felt it was completely justified and almost vindicated himself by the fact that he 's telling me .
When people say , " How did you manage ? "
Well sometimes I did n't manage .
Sometimes I exploded myself and broke up everything and fell about , cried , smashed my head against the wall .
But that was a rarity .
Generally I tried to be a controlled and as calm as possible .
One important thing to me was dignity and self control and self respect .
They had definitely taken my freedom and my ability to be free , but what they could n't do was to take away my dignity , and that 's what I held on to .
When they handed out Korans to us in Bagram I remember seeing the Americans passing them through the airlocks and throwing them onto the ground .
People might think that well , its just a book , but if you believe like you do as a Muslim that this is the unadulterated revealed speech of God and it is the most sacred thing that a Muslim would have in his house .
To see them do that for me brought about a sense of complete desperation , that I can't do anything about this and them for the other Afghans and various other prisoners it was intolerable .
And it was of course part of the dehumanising process again .
And one of the guards there of that unit told me when I used to have discussions with them , that when we see you people we can't look at you as human beings .
Our psyche does not allow us to do that - because if we did we would n't treat you this way .
It 's easy for us to dehumanise you .
First of all most of you guys do n't speak the same language .
Secondly , you look different .
Thirdly , you 're dressed different .
Fourthly , you 're in cages and we 're out here with the guns .
The use of torture has in the 21st century become a topic of debate .
Should we or should we not .
And I think that it 's just such a terrible statement ... on the state of us as human beings on the planet today .
The people who claim to be the upholders and defenders of freedom are debating now whether it is legitimate to use torture .
After all of what the world has been through arguing against the fact .
And if it does in one way or another become legitimised , either mental torture or physical or psychological , which has been clearly used by several countries , then I think the world will spiral into something that nobody will be able to control .
People have been held there [ Guantánamo ] for four years now , almost .
What possible intelligence value could they be giving after all this time - even if there was any to begin with ?
So I would say categorically that not only should the United States close the place down .
I think people should be repatriated .
Those people who have committed crimes should be charged .
Those people who have not should be released and should be compensated - if it 's possible to compensate people for the time and for the physical and mental torture that they 've had to suffer all of this time .
Actually in the beginning when we were in Bagram and Kandahar and in cells of ISI , we suffered a lot .
We have been kicked out , we have been kicked by the feet of soldiers .
We have become naked ; they have taken our naked pictures .
They have shaven our beards and they have insulted us in different ways .
The way they were taking us to interrogation in Kandahar was really insulting and we suffered a lot and we had no shower for three months in Bagram and Kandahar and the same way for two and a half months in cells of ISI in Peshawar .
The way we were taken and flown from Peshawar to Bagram , and from Bagram to Kandahar and from Kandahar to Guantánamo Bay was really torturing , we suffered a lot .
They tied us with plastic handcuffs and it really hurt us and the most terrible thing was when they took us from Kandahar to Guantánamo .
We had goggles on our head and had masks and we were blinded there and it was a very long flight of 24 hours .
What happened to us ...
It is just torturing us mentally right now and when I just think about Guantánamo , I think about Kandahar , I think about Bagram I think about the cells of ISI , I cannot forget the night we were arrested and we left our children crying without reason .
We have n't been criminals , we have n't done anything wrong .
We have been journalists , we have been scholars , we have been intellectuals , we have been reporters and editors you can see the library here .
I can draw it for you this is the whole block you can see .
You know and there were two rows , in each row there were 24 cells and then there was another row of 24 cells .
You can see and each cell was 180 centimetres in length , and the width and the height was 180 centimetres .
It was the place where we had to sleep , where we had to offer our prayers , where we had to go to the bath and that was the whole thing we had in our life .
We had to stay here for a long time and after every three days and sometimes after every five days we had to go out for 20 minutes and some people for 30 minutes if we were not on punishment .
But those who were on punishment had to stay there for longer times - for a month , two or three without coming out .
Actually we could n't get our messages from home and our families could n't receive our messages up to almost one year and a half .
The first time I received our message through Red Cross .
I wrote my first message in Kandahar but it arrived home after 8 months and we received our first message after one year and most of the messages were coming through Red Cross and they used to censor and erased just those lines which they did n't like - you can see these .
I want to go to that conference [ Amnesty 's ] because we want to impart and to give the details to the rest of the world and we want to inform the world so it does not happen again .
So the right thing is done to those innocents who are still in detention and punishment for those who are really guilty .
I mean keeping this information secret and not telling the world would be a dishonesty an intellectual dishonesty and we want to tell the world and it's very important .
It 's just many people are waiting for us to listen and to know what was going on there and what happened and what were the results .
The torture was basic .
In order to cause discomfort they switched on the air conditioning and closed the door to the room .
The chain was covered with frost .
Before the investigation we were held in the isolation ward for ten days to a month .
During this time continuous beatings and insults took place .
Concerning our transfer from Kandahar to Guantánamo : it was a very cruel journey .
We were all chained , attached to the seats .
We were wearing headphones , blacked out glasses and respirators , making breathing almost impossible .
People were continually losing consciousness because of the respirators .
The headphones caused high pressure on the head , almost causing a hole , and all of that caused a lot of pain .
We were put into an American detention centre at Kandahar air base .
Every one of us suffered from torture and humiliation .
The beatings became a routine .
Isolation wards , unsanitary conditions and we were sleeping on the sand in the winter .
This humiliation was bringing us to our knees .
The torture we were subjected to include beatings and systematic provocations to try and make the detainee break some instructions .
And when that happens a special team is called - they would run into the cell , beat and chain him up .
During the interrogations they left you in a cold room for a few weeks .
Isolation wards are a good example .
We were n't given anything to lie on - no carpet .
All of us have problems with our kidneys because we slept on the iron with air conditioning on .
It was freezing cold .
The ceilings began to be covered with condensation from the cold .
We were held like that for months .
I was in the isolation ward for five months .
I consider the biggest humiliation I have suffered is the stigma that the Americans gave to me .
The life - long brand of terrorist , extremist , which I received in Guantánamo has stayed with me since being extradited to Russia .
We have to expose to the public these crimes of the system speaking out for all of the international community , few people have taken the opportunity using legitimate or other methods and people are starting to understand what happened .
Some people on behalf of the whole community say that Muslims are the terrorists , bandits and killers .
I face insults in the streets .
It is the fault of a group of people who speak out on behalf of the world 's Islamic Uma .
I think not all people share the point of view of Bush 's administration .
Not all Muslims share the opinion of Osama Bin Laden or Zarkowi .
There is an attempt to cause tension between two big civilizations and we became the victims of this war , we were caught in the middle .
The subject of type inference for dynamically - checked languages came up in the Buried Treasure thread .
A question was raised in that thread having to do with why static type inference in these languages is difficult .
Since there 's a nascent body of literature which addresses that question , here are a few links to articles and papers about type inference for Python .
A nice overview can be found in Localized Type Inference of Atomic Types in Python , a Master 's thesis by Brett Cannon .
The whole thesis is relevant , but for an overview of the issues , see Chapter 3 , " Challenges of Inferring Types in Python " .
Chapter 4 summarizes previous attempts involving static inference in Python , including Psyco ( previously on LtU ) and Starkiller .
The limitations of these attempts are briefly addressed .
Type inference solutions for Python invariably involve restrictions to make the problem tractable .
The above paper focuses on " inferring atomic types in the local namespace " .
Another approach is described in Aggressive Type Inference , by John Aycock .
Aycock makes an important observation :
Giving people a dynamically - typed language does not mean that they write dynamically - typed programs .
The article offers a type inference approach which exploits this observation .
( If the meaning of the above quote is n't clear , I recommend reviewing our mammoth three - part thread on the subject , " Why type systems are interesting " , part I , part II , and part III . )
The PyPy implementation of Python in Python ( previously on LtU ) uses a restricted subset of Python , called RPython , to implement parts of the language .
RPython is sufficiently static to be able to support full - program type inference .
It is not a " soft " inference approach , and is not designed to be used with ordinary Python programs .
The paper Compiling dynamic language implementations covers the approach used for static analysis of RPython .
The PyPy Coding Guide , starting at section 1.4 may also be useful .
( It may be interesting to note that the PyPy approach is very similar to that used previously for Scheme 48 .
The core of Scheme 48 is implemented in PreScheme , a subset of Scheme that supports full - program type inference . )
Finally , Guido van Rossum has a number of blog entries on the subject of adding optional static typing to Python :
If anyone knows of any other good treatments of type inference in Python or similar languages , please post links here .

Can you teach someone to care ? »
How to create a non-fiction bestseller
Yes , book sales are way down across the board in tech books ( actually all books , but tech books especially ) , but that does n't mean the market 's gone .
It does mean there are far fewer guarantees of success , though .
Even those who still have tech jobs are probably having to pay for books out of their own pocket , unlike the days when employers let us login to Amazon to click and buy with abandon .
So you can't just get something out there and expect it to sell , even if it is on the hottest topic , and even if you do have an established name and reputation , and even if your publisher is committed -- with marketing bucks and a plan - - to making a hit .
But what prompted me to write this is a disturbing trend toward viewing technical books as a crap shoot .
A big gamble .
You roll the dice and assume that most books wo n't be bestsellers , but hey -- you might get lucky .
Luck has nothing to do with it !!
( Well , I 'll qualify that : luck is a factor if you 're writing about a new , unproven topic because you 're trying to get a jump on the market , and you 're betting on the fact that the topic / technology will take hold . )
First , a disclaimer for those who do n't know me : I 'm a relative newcomer to books , ( two years ) , and what I 'm about to say conflicts with what many of the most experienced people in this industry are suggesting .
However , my partner Bert and I have five current bestsellers -- which is extremely rare in the tech book world today -- and all of these books are still in their first editions ( correction , we just released a second edition of one of our books ( Head First Java ) , and it 's just starting to show up in bestseller lists , so temporarily at least , we have six bestsellers , although the second edition will eventually cause the first edition to drop out ) .
In fact , every book we 've put out has been an instant bestseller , and taken over the top slot in its category .
But that 's not the amazing part .
The amazing part is that we 're not good writers , and we are n't established " names " .
But we refuse to believe that we just keep getting ridiculously lucky .
We 're making our living on this , so we can't afford to leave it to chance .
We believe there 's a formula , and that almost anyone can follow it .
Oh yes , one more disclaimer : the word " bestseller " does n't necessarily mean " big bucks " , because the total size of the market has dropped so low .
( I 'll say a little more on the numbers later . )
But a " bestseller " today does mean the difference between a book that does n't even earn back its advance , and one that gives you and your publisher a nice steady source of income long after you 've finished it and moved on to something else .
The formula ?
It 's multi-part .
What to do and what not to do .
First , do n't listen to this advice from Dave Taylor ( although you should listen to virtually everything else he says ... they guys knows frickin ' everything about everything , and has written way more books than we have .
This is the only area where I violently disagree with his advice ) :
" ... do n't go into writing a technical book with the expectation that you 'll make any money .
... unlike the heyday of the late 1990's , a technical book that sells 5,000 copies is considered a success in the industry today .
So why write a technical book ?
One good reason is because it's a great calling card , a demonstration that you 're a thought leader in your field and an expert on the subject . "
I hear this same thing everywhere from virtually every other tech book author I know , see , or read about .
It 's a trap !
I hardly know where to begin , but I 'll try ...
1 ) It 's unethical .
Unless you 're self - publishing , you are risking your time ( and opportunity costs ) while your publisher is risking real money .
Your publisher is not in business solely to help you pursue your career goals and build a better resume .
Would you willingly and enthusiastically go into business with someone who said , " well , it 's not like it 's going to make any money , but at least it 'll be good on my resume . " ?
But that 's what you 're asking your publisher to do .
And believe me , the downturn has hurt these folks hard .
Our main publisher is O'Reilly , and we feel like we 're in a partnership with them .
We want them to do well because it benefits everyone .
They 're a fabulous , innovative publisher interested in getting knowledge from one person and spreading / sharing it to others .
I believe that doing a book with the attitude that " it is n't going to make money , but it 'll help me " is taking advantage of the publisher .
There are lots of people at O'Reilly we care about who have jobs they 'd like to keep .
( Same with Osborne / McGraw - Hill , who published our very first book . )
But let 's say you do n't care about the publisher , and maybe you 've even heard they have a reputation for ripping people off at every turn .
That 's not our view , but it might be valid for publishers we do n't know anything about .
So there 's a far more important reason to not have this attitude , and it's the one that affects you the most :
2 ) It 's self - fulfilling .
If you go in with the attitude that you 're doing it solely for your reputation , and not to have it earn out , it dramatically increases the chances that this is exactly what you 'll get .
A book that does n't ( or barely ) earns back its advance .
We 've met many tech book authors who say they 've written multiple books that have never earned back their advance .
That is beyond our comprehension .
Given that these folks usually have way more real talent than we do , what 's the difference ?
For one thing , we had n't actually heard that advice when we started .
We were too ignorant to know that this is supposedly the reality , so we went in with the attitude of , " OK , we plan on earning back our advance and having this book do well , so what can we do to help guarantee that this happens ? "
This is dramatically different from asking , " I ca n't expect this to make money , so what can I do to make sure it helps my career / reputation . ? "
We asked a different question , and got a different answer .
But there 's more to it than that .
It 's not just that doing - it - for - the - resume is n't as likely to produce a successful book ... writing a book with the motivation of enhancing your reputation is more likely to HURT the book .
I wo n't go into all the details , but I said a lot about this in an earlier post , Users Should n't Think About YOU .
The main problem is this : the more focused you are on demonstrating how smart YOU are , the less likely you are to help the READER feel / become smart .
And that 's a formula for hurting sales .
The more you make the book about how much you know , the less you have something the reader can benefit from .
We write our books from virtually the opposite perspective -- we do n't care what they think about us .
All we care about is that they have an " I Rule ! " experience , and that can come only from them truly learning and understanding in a meaningful , efficient , and enjoyable way .
We care about their life , more than we care about anything else .
And that is the formula .
The downside ( if you care about it ) is that approaching books this way wo n't do as much for your reputation .
On any given day , we usually have five of the top ten bestselling Java books .
On many days , we have the top five bestselling Java books .
Yet , virtually nobody in the Java world thinks of us as The Java Experts .
No , they think of us as the people who 've written the books that have helped me learn this well , and actually made it easier and even enjoyable ... "
They do n't think of us as the experts .
But they thank us for helping THEM become experts .
And that 's the rest of the formula .
Because when they start talking , and they will , they 'll tell their friends , co-workers , and everyone else they talk to online that they know more because of your book .
And that carries a lot more weight than telling their friends that you , the author , sure know your stuff .
So here 's the formula :
The Author Kicks Ass : The book might earn out .
The Reader Kicks Ass : Bestseller .
Have I oversimplified ?
Of course .
But not as much as you might think .
I will put some assumptions / qualifiers on this just for completness :
1 ) The topic must be of interest to enough people .
I can't expect to earn out on a book about " Blogging to improve your bowling scores . " ( although Robert Scoble just might be able to pull that one off .
The rest of us could n't : )
2 ) The publisher keeps the book available .
Besides the authors who keep claiming you can't expect to have a bestseller , I also disagree with publishers who claim that a book 's success today is about the publisher 's marketing reach combined with the author 's following .
That can help , sure , but you can see from my graphic that I put those things on the weakest end of the factors contributing to a bestseller .
( Yes , I 'm even disagreeing with the publisher who ( to use the cliche ) has forgotten more about this business than I 'll ever know . )
But where the publisher is especially monumentally important is in keeping the book in stock .
And apparently that is no easy task .
The publisher 's reputation with the booksellers is vitally important , and this is where a great publisher can really make a big difference .
Key publishers like O'Reilly , Wiley , Pearson , etc. can make sure that once word gets around about your book , people can get their hands on it !
Now , there are some books , especially consumer books and those purchased by older / less - web - aware folks for whom discovering it in the store is the most important factor , but I 'm not really addressing that .
I 'm talking about technically - oriented books likely to be bought by those who are connected to one or more online communities in such a way that if word spreads about a book , they 're likely to hear it .
3 ) The author knows , or learns , how to show the reader what the reader needs and wants .
There are some skills here , of course , but the most important one is n't writing !
I 'd put writing skills fairly low on the list , assuming some baseline capability equivalent to , say , a sophomore in high school who might get a B in basic grammar / writing .
The most important thing is in teaching / communication / information design .
And that 's a lot of what we talk about in this blog .
( But in another post , I 'll offer more resources if you 're still looking to improve in these areas . )
And perhaps the best advice I can give to our authors is to simply not go into some kind of " writer mode " .
Most people who have a subject they want to communicate , could explain it just fine to a colleague over lunch , with a pencil , a napkin , and a conversation .
But something gets lost when they try to " write " about it , especially if they 're trying to impress others with their serious level of expertise .
Say it in your book almost exactly the way you 'd explain it to a friend , and you 're way way way up the curve .
And finally , the most important assumption :
The author genuinely , deeply , truly cares about enhancing the lives of the reader .
So , creating a bestseller is not such a big wild - ass gamble .
And the best news is that it 's a win for everyone if you follow that formula .
The publisher does n't bleed money on the book , the author is well - compensated for the time they spent , the reader 's life is improved through your work , and -- most importantly - - you get the indescribable joy of knowing that you made someone 's day / week / job / even life a little brighter .
And if you follow this formula , they 'll tell you !
Once again , let this be my huge thank - you to all our readers who take the time to write and tell us how they feel about the book ( good and bad , although -- gotta tell you -- we prefer the good ; ) ) or that they passed the exam , got a new job , or even just that they found themselves smiling while reading about a technical topic , and how they were delighted and surprised by that .
YOU are why we do this , and having the books be bestsellers means we get to continue .
Wow , I could n't possibly enjoy my work more !
( And thanks to O'Reilly for sharing this attitude and making this possible . )

This is it .
When I hired speakers for conferences I looked at people who shared themselves and their knowledge .
You nailed it .
I hope our book nails it too .
If not , we 'll know about it up front cause our readers will point out when we 're not doing well .

Just freaking " wow " ...
Or as Tom Peters would put it ...
WOW !!!
This is why I'm on O'Reilly 's list to review everything in the Head First series .
Armed with a HF book about a particular subject , I * do * feel like I can * kick ass * .
It 's also the reason I 've pushed this book hard in my intro Java sessions when I speak , and why it 's always the first title gone .
I 'm glad you exist , Kathy ...

Thomas , you 're a not - small part of * why * we exist .
As our brave early adopter and well - respected reviewer / speaker , you played a key role in helping evangelize the book to an audience we did n't even know existed .
The one really important thing I did n't put in this blog ( but will do a whole post on ) is that there * is* a bootstrapping process for getting the book out there .
It has to start somewhere , and a big part of getting the word out is getting it to the right people early on .
People who have listeners of their own .
Lots of people trust you , Thomas , so it * means * something when you recommend one of our books .
Thanks !!
And Robert , I can't wait for your book : ) [ p.s .
I was always more fond of the " Blog or Die " title , so I 'm glad your publisher picked that one . ]

I 've enjoyed reading your blog for a while now .
This particular post seems to warrant a commment .
Of the two approaches to getting published , the one you critique and the one you advocate in its place , yours is clearly the preferrable place to stand .
There is though the tiny problem of how few writers will be able to write best sellers .
This is built into the structure of ranking books by how many copies they sell .
It is , by design , a " winner take all " model .
And much like the situation in which every talented teenage basketball player is n't going to become Michael Jordan or Tim Duncan , writers have to , at the end of the day , find viable niches .
The substance of what I hear you saying still applies though , which I believe is :
Pick a strategy that is about really winning and not simply settling for the " a half loaf is better than no loaf " approach that conventional wisdom would advise , and beware especially of advice that urges settling for a half loaf , but delivers no loaf at all .

Kathy , I applaud your logic , but ...
I think writing a book for reasons other than money is perfectly valid .
I certainly am not in it for the money , even if I 'm currently talking to publishers .
I like to think of the book idea as similar to a blog i.e. an opportunity to " spread pollen " .
Posted by : hugh macleod | Feb 26 , 2005 7:35:05 PM
Ah ...
Hugh , I agree -- I 'm not suggesting that money is the * reason * to do the book .
The reason that leads to a bestseller is " enhancing the reader 's life " .
But I am saying that it 's usually a bad idea to go into it with the attitude that it * wo n ' t* make money .
You said : " ... opportunity to spread pollen " .
That 's very different from " ... opportunity to make a bigger name for myself . "
And that difference is EVERYTHING .
If your book is a bestseller , that means more pollen , and the chance to ( if you want ) do more .
We figure we have a LOT of " pollen " ( passion ) we 'd like to keep spreading , and because the books are bestsellers , we 're able to keep doing it .
Your book , Hugh , has a message that a lot of people want -- and need -- to hear .
Why * not * go into it with the attitude that it can be a bestseller ?
( which , by the way , does n't seem like it 's gonna be much of an issue ; )
Is that so different from what you might suggest to your clients ?
I 'd say , " Do [ whatever it is that you make / do / sell ] for the right reasons -- give your users something real to believe in -- and the money to keep doing that will be a natural result . "
Do n't do it for the money ; do it to involve more people in the conversation .
A bestseller means a lot more people at the party having a great time : )

hi Kathy
i am in love with HF books , i have all the four books and i read them all the time .
You are abosultely right - the books make me feel smarter , confident , and educated .
Reading HF java i came away thinking one thought - someone finally figured out how to explain technical concepts to mere mortals .
Thanks so much !!
keep the books coming - i am looking forward to a head first web services with java - there are way too many non-reader friendly books in that space

I dunno ... the word " Bestseller " kinda short circuits my brain ...
I associate it with celebrity cookbooks , " Chicken Soup For The Soul " franchises and ( ugh ! ) the literary novel market .
Every now and then an excellent book comes along and surprises that market ( " Tuesdays with Morrie " , or " Trainspotting " , for example ) .... but for every " Tuesdays " there 's a 15 dozen " Bridges of Madison County " or " The Da Vinci Code " .
I see publishers as middlemen .
I see there are people who already want my book , and people who will want it once they see it in front of them .
Reaching these people is my reponsibility - it 's my job , first and foremost , not the job of some big city marketing ninja .
So my question to a publisher is always going to be the same , namely , " How are you going to make my job easier and what 's your cut ? "
Do n't get me wrong ; I 've made lots of mistakes and false starts over the years .
Education is expensive etc .
But I do think a major hindrance to first - time authors trying to break into publishing is their own mis-delegation of responsibilty to these hypothetical whizz - kids in New York who ( a ) they 've never actually met in person and ( b ) do n't actually give a damn about them .
What 's that line I like to use ?
" Power is never given .
Power is taken " ...?
That 's what I 'm talking about .
I appreciate your vote of confidence for " How To Be Creative " .
We 'll see what the market says , once it 's printed and hoisted onto trucks .

As someone who has written several books ( all but one made back their advance ) I would interpret your message as a suggestion to publishers to avoid certain demographics of writers .
Those who consult as part of their day job are motivated by increasing their own self worth .
It is all about return on investment and making change on book sales is secondary .
Maybe publishers should focus on authors who work for Fortune 500 enterprises .
They have nothing to sell per-say like consultants or CTOs of software companies , are n't required to be published like university professors and for the most part would only write in the spirit of giving back to the community .
I would also ask for the acknowledgement of the fact that some people have talent for writing books tend to not be ones that could make a lot of money in consulting .
The inverse tends to also hold true .

Post that all writers , not only technical writers , should find useful .
On the lighter side , It reminds me of the time when no one would publish my book and I was worried .
When my friend Brig Mukhtar foud out about the cause of my worry , he asked , " do you have any bank ballance , any thing you can sell or any assent that you can liquidate . "
My answer was of course NO .
He siad , " You are already leading a poor life , go get loan and publish . "
I did just that .
I am happy that I did that .

This was an excellent post and covers lots of points that authors ( first time or otherwise ) can take to heart .
I 'd like to add one more .
I 've gotten 6 books published .
I never actually got an advance as I was working for Aetna then Microsoft and never thought to ask for one .
The single most important thing I worried about as a writer / author was hearing the following from my young daughters :
" Daddy , why is your book in this pile for a dollar ? "
Now THAT was motivation .

Kathy ,
I 've written 50 - something non-fiction books ( 11 in sociology and 40 something on computers ) , and while what you say is wonderfully encouraging , and I 'd say the right way to go about things , I still do n't have a clue as to why things work well or not with books .
Your books ( Head First series ) are brilliant because they get inside my head and lead me to understand complex issues -- and you make it fun .
I used to think that the closer I was to a novice programming wise , the better the book .
I could joke around with the reader and get inside her head because I was her head shortly before I wrote the book .
On one level that was ( and still is ) true , but now I realize that I wish I could have that same closeness to the reader and be a more sophisticated programmer .
My first computer book sold over 100,000 copies in 6 months , and my second sold 350,000 copies in the same period of time .
At the time I was new to programming ( about 2 years worth ) but I was able to make that connection .
Other books that I thought did the same thing , failed to spark ( and sparkle ) .
Then I tried something new , and got lucky and took the first royalty check and bought an airplane .
The second edition of the same book went south .
The others became a blur , some doing great , some ok , and some pretty bad .
However , tapping into the reader 's passion , and I think the absolute fun in learning , is the way to go .
Every now and then I can make that connection -- even trying to do so every time .
As for bestsellers , they 're important , especially for the publisher whose investment in you is important .
But trying to write a bestseller may not be the best way to write one .
Marketing wonks have the goofiest ideas that are at best based on what has gone before them -- I do n't believe that the Head First approach was from the brain of a marketer .
The wonderful ( and original ) DOS for Dummies has become a creepy series that lost the connection to the reader that the original forged .
Enough of this .
I will end with my favorite quote -- from the crystal mind of Dorothy Parker .
When asked if she liked to write , she replied , " No. I like to have written . "
Same here .

Very much enjoyed your perspective on achieving best sellers .
I 've had significant success developing a
variety of training and non-fiction products ( courses ,
seminars , workshops , books , videos , etc... ) and you
are certainly correct in pointing out the critical factor
of putting the reader first .
Find a compelling subject , understand exactly the sorts
of questions and reasons why your market asks those
questions makes the task of writing non-fiction so much
easier than other genres .
Great article - there is much traditional thought on
writing non-fiction that seems to have undergone perpetual
mis -direction , your article begins to unravel the truth .
Posted by : Jeff | Sep 6 , 2005 7:32:35 PM
It is fantastic .
The guide for writing best seller is available on line .
It is more than 100 % correct that readers enhancement must be kept in mind for writting a book .
I can not undersatnd that why anybody should write book and publisher publish it just for the sake of publication .
Book must be written for others .
It is correct that ideas should be original and personal .
One must have lived with these ideas for sometime .
He must have sleeped with these ideas peacfully .
He must have grown and prospered with those ideas for sometime .
Then only it is worth putting in the form of a book and making them available to people .
I have lived with such ideas for 20 years .
I have written in the book form .
It has come up very interesting that is what I feel .
They all are very useful for all the readers who are going to read them .
Being in the country like India , I am searching a publisher for last four months .
Till now I have not been able to search one .
But the day I get them , I believe that the book will be hit .
In developing country like India , any such new ventures takes lot of efforts and time .
That is not good for the nation .
The country must come out of these limitations .
Hope , the situation will improve in the days to come .
I am available at kamekish@yahoo.com , it would be pleasure to respond .
Thanks

Multi-tasking affects the brain 's learning systems , and as a result , we do not learn as well when we are distracted , UCLA psychologists report this week in the online edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" Multi - tasking adversely affects how you learn , " said Russell Poldrack , UCLA associate professor of psychology and co-author of the study .
" Even if you learn while multi- tasking , that learning is less flexible and more specialized , so you cannot retrieve the information as easily .
Our study shows that to the degree you can learn while multi-tasking , you will use different brain systems .
" The best thing you can do to improve your memory is to pay attention to the things you want to remember , " Poldrack added .
" Our data support that .
When distractions force you to pay less attention to what you are doing , you do n't learn as well as if you had paid full attention . "
Tasks that require more attention , such as learning calculus or reading Shakespeare , will be particularly adversely affected by multi-tasking , Poldrack said .
The researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to examine brain activity and function , a technique that uses magnetic fields to spot active brain areas by telltale increases in blood oxygen .
Participants in the study , who were in their 20s , learned a simple classification task by trial - and - error .
They were asked to make predictions after receiving a set of cues concerning cards that displayed various shapes , and divided the cards into two categories .
With one set of cards , they learned without any distractions .
With a second set of cards , they performed a simultaneous task : listening to high and low beeps through headphones and keeping a mental count of the high - pitch beeps .
While the distraction of the beeps did not reduce the accuracy of the predictions -- people could learn the task either way -- it did reduce the participants ' subsequent knowledge about the task during a follow - up session .
When the subjects were asked questions about the cards afterward , they did much better on the task they learned without the distraction .
On the task they learned with the distraction , they could not extrapolate ; in scientific terms , their knowledge was much less " flexible . "
This result demonstrates a reduced capacity to recall memories when placed in a different context , Poldrack said .
" Our results suggest that learning facts and concepts will be worse if you learn them while you 're distracted , " Poldrack said .
Different forms of memory are processed by separate systems in the brain , he noted .
When you recall what you did last weekend or try to remember someone 's name or your driver 's license number , you are using a type of memory retrieval called declarative memory .
( Patients with Alzheimer disease have damage in these brain areas . )
When you remember how to ride a bicycle or how to play tennis , you are using what is called procedural memory ; this requires a different set of brain areas than those used for learning facts and concepts , which rely on the declarative memory system .
The beeps in the study disrupted declarative memory , said Poldrack , who also studies how the types of memory are related .
The brain 's hippocampus -- a sea- horse - shaped structure that plays critical roles in processing , storing and recalling information -- is necessary for declarative memory , Poldrack said .
For the task learned without distraction , the hippocampus was involved .
However , for the task learned with the distraction of the beeps , the hippocampus was not involved ; but the striatum was , which is the brain system that underlies our ability to learn new skills .
The striatum is the brain system damaged in patients with Parkinson disease , Poldrack noted .
Patients with Parkinson's have trouble learning new motor skills but do not have trouble remembering the past .
" We have shown that multi- tasking makes it more likely you will rely on the striatum to learn , " Poldrack said .
" Our study indicates that multi- tasking changes the way people learn . "
The researchers noted that they are not saying never to multi-task , just do n't multi-task while you are trying to learn something new that you hope to remember .
Listening to music can energize people and increase alertness .
Listening to music while performing certain tasks , such as exercising , can be helpful .
But tasks that distract you while you try to learn something new are likely to adversely affect your learning , Poldrack said .
" Concentrate while you 're studying , " he said .
###
The research is federally funded by the National Science Foundation ( http://www. nsf. gov/ ) and the Whitehall Foundation ( http://www. whitehall. org / ) .
Poldrack noted that other research shows that talking on the phone badly impairs the ability to drive a car .
Co-authors are Karin Foerde , a UCLA graduate student in psychology , and Barbara Knowlton , UCLA associate professor of psychology .
About UCLA
California 's largest university , UCLA enrolls approximately 38,000 students per year and offers degrees from the UCLA College of Letters and Science and 11 professional schools in dozens of varied disciplines .
UCLA consistently ranks among the top five universities and colleges nationally in total research - and - development spending , receiving more than $ 820 million a year in competitively awarded federal and state grants and contracts .
For every $ 1 state taxpayers invest in UCLA , the university generates almost $ 9 in economic activity , resulting in an annual $ 6 billion economic impact on the Greater Los Angeles region .
The university 's health care network treats 450,000 patients per year .
UCLA employs more than 27,000 faculty and staff , has more than 350,000 living alumni and has been home to five Nobel Prize recipients .

ぬいぐるみのボタンを押すと、ぐずっていた赤ちゃんがケロっと泣きやむ――画期的なベビー用品「赤ちゃんけろっとスイッチ」をタカラトミーが発売する。にわかに信じがたい話だが、その効果が本当なら赤ちゃんのぐずり泣きに悩まされている全国のパパ・ママにとっては朗報だろう。
外観は、いたって普通のぬいぐるみ。しかし中の“音ユニット”には、日本音響研究所とのコラボレーションにより開発された「ぐずり解消メロディ」が入っている。日本音響研究所といえば、タカラ（当時）が「バウリンガル」を共同開発したことでも知られるが、赤ちゃんのぐずり泣きに注目したのは、あの「タケモトピアノ」のCMが発端だったようだ。
俳優の財津一郎さんが独特の調子で 「ピアノ売ってちょーだい」と歌い、全身タイツのお姉さんたちがくねくねと踊りまくる。西日本で知らない人はいない、とてもシュールなCMだ。いつしか、このCMが流れると泣いていた赤ん坊がピタリと泣きやむという噂が広まり、人気番組「探偵！ナイトスクープ」が取り上げたことで有名になった。
このとき、解析を担当したのが日本音響研究所の鈴木松美氏。解析の結果、財津一郎氏の声が赤ちゃんの好む440Hz付近にあることにくわえ、「音がランダムで飽きない」「本能的に振り向く音が多い」「音楽の途中でリズムが変わる」などのポイントが赤ちゃんの注意を引くことが分かった。日本音響研究所は研究を続け、「キラキラ星」をベースにオリジナルの“ぐずり解消メロディ”を制作。乳幼児向け玩具を多く販売していたトミー（当時）と商品を共同開発することになった。
商品の企画開発者である同社ベビープリスクール事業部戦略開発チームの外澤志麻主任は、ちょうどその頃、育児に追われており、サンプルを実際に使って驚いたという。「ぐずっているときは、何をしても無駄で本当に困っていました。しかし、サンプルから音楽が流れると、けろっと泣きやむ。これは“ 使える” と思いました」。
開発中には50人程度のモニター調査を行い、ぐずり解消メロディの効果を検証した。詳しい調査結果は公開されていないものの概ね良好で、個人差はあるものの生後3カ月から1歳半程度の赤ちゃんに効果があった。また、ぬいぐるみにディズニーキャラクターを採用することが決まると、ぐずり解消メロディに「イッツ・ア・スモール・ワールド」が追加された。
実際に “ ぐずり解消メロディ ” を聴いてみると、途中で急に曲のテンポが変わったり、合いの手のように動物の鳴き声が入ったりと確かにユニークだ。「赤ちゃんは、大人に比べて非常に好奇心が強いものです。このメロディには、赤ちゃんの好む音にくわえ、途中で急にテンポが変わったり、動物の鳴き声などの効果音が入ったりと、さまざまな要素の組み合わせで興味を引きます」（同社フロンティア事業本部ベビープリスクール事業部ベビー企画チームエキスパートの並木高夫氏）。
「 赤ちゃんによって個人差はありますが、音楽が流れ始めるとそちらに気をとられ、それまで泣いていたことを忘れてしまうようです。実際に赤ちゃんが音楽を注意して聴くようになるのは結構成長してからなのですが、中には音楽に合わせて踊り出す赤ちゃんもいました」（外澤氏）。

[ Jun. 29th , 2006 | 02:09 am ]
The American Caliban
When I was a young child in the long - ago 1970s , computers were used for something called Data Processing .
Data Processing was done with large machines the size of cars or at least major appliances .
In order to make use of it , a customer would bring a problem to a person called a Systems Analyst , who would help the customer understand how Data Processing might help .
Then the customer and the Systems Analyst would come up with a plan on how to get the customer 's work done .
The Systems Analyst would bring the customer 's problem into the Data Processing place , and give it to computer programmers .
Along with other helpful people called Punch Card Clerks and Computer Operators , the programmers would produce software that helped the customer .
After that , when the customer had more data to be processed , it could be dropped off at the Data Processing place , where the Punch Card Clerks would put data in the software , and the Computer Operators would make sure the machines worked , and then finally the data would be all processed and given back to the customer in a neatly rubber - banded set of printouts on fanfold paper .
In the 1990s it was discovered that everything had changed .
A customer could often mash fingers on keys and make the data process right there at the desk , without visiting the Data Processing people .
Computers were interactive and talked right back to people , so that dropping off data and picking up printouts was n't necessary .
And worst of all , customers could talk directly to programmers , it was discovered , and tell them what they wanted , and these new quick interactive computers could give results very fast .
The programs were then given to the customers who took them off and used them in their own offices .
So the Punch Card Clerks and the Computer Operators and the nice person at the desk who took the data and gave back the printouts were no longer useful , and they had to go home and stop working at the Data Processing place .
Worst of all , the Systems Analysts lost their jobs too .
They were expensive people , since almost all of them were old programmers with experience who had been promoted .
They were all fifty years old and not retrainable and did n't know much about PC computers or other new things .
Their entire function had been removed , and suddenly their $ 60 K jobs vanished .
So all the System Administrators went home from the empty Data Processing places and sat in their imitation redwood veneered dens in their suburban homes and stared at the wall and drank highballs and then shot themselves in the head with large - caliber handguns .
It turns out that the computer programmers should n't talk to customers after all .
They are very optimistic people , for whom everything is almost done all the time .
They often refuse to finish things or write down how they work .
And they can be mean and weird and not very easy to understand , so that customers become frightened and angry and do n't want to talk to the optimistic people who do n't finish things and snort a lot and wear fedoras indoors .
Things like this happened during the 1990s a lot , and many customers did n't want to have any software if they had to talk to the computer programmers .
It was time to bring back Systems Analysts .
But they were all dead , because they had shot themselves in the head with large caliber handguns in their imitation redwood veneer dens .
So we have Project Managers now .
They are different from Systems Analysts in that they are 30 years old instead of 50 , they do not live in imitation redwood paneled dens , and they never did know how to program computers .
They drive VW Passats and smoke marijuana and use lots of buzzwords , and they are very good at making customers feel comfortable .
Many of them enjoy jam band music and are engaged to people named Chad or Alyssa .
They do a lot of the same things the Systems Analysts did , so that the customers get their software but do n't have to talk to the programmers after all , because that was a bad idea .
They tell the programmers when things have to be done , figure out on their own how long things will take , and dress much better than the programmers .
And that 's the story of how Project Managers were made .

再帰関数は再帰するときに自分自身を名前で呼ぶのが普通である。
これをなんとかして名前を使わず、関数そのものを呼ぶように させたい。
求めかた
まず単純な fact ( 階乗 ) を以下に示す。言語 は
Scheme である 。
( define fact ( lambda ( n ) ( if ( zero ? n) 1 (* n ( fact (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ) )
ここから名前をなくすために、まず普通に書いた fact と同じ中身の 関数を返す関数を作る 。
( define fact - maker ( lambda ( ) ( lambda ( n ) ( if ( zero ? n) 1 (* n ( fact (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) )
fact 呼び出しも引数にしてくくりだしてしまう。
( define fact - maker ( lambda ( proc ) ( lambda ( n ) ( if ( zero ? n) 1 (* n ( proc (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) )
しかしこれをどう呼び出せばいいだろう。
( fact - maker 5 )
ではまずい。関数が返って終わりだ。
再帰し続ける限り ( 呼び出しが続く限り ) fact が必要なわけだから、 引数に fact - maker が必要だ。また最初の一回だけでなく fact - maker は 常に 「 次 」 の関数に引数として fact - maker を渡し続けないといけない。 と考えると、まず一発目の呼び出し は
( ( fact - maker fact - maker ) 5 )
でなければいけないし 、fact - maker の中身の proc 呼び出しの ところでも同じく ( proc proc ) でなければならない 。
( define fact - maker ( lambda ( proc ) ( lambda ( n ) ( if ( zero ? n) 1 (* n ( ( proc proc ) (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) )
これで ( 1 ) 関数の生成 ( 2 ) 呼び出し ( 3 ) 次の引数に fact - maker を渡す、 の三つが連鎖して行われるようになり、正常に値を求められる。
しかしこれではまだ fact - maker という名前が残っているし、 必ず ( proc proc ) と書かなければいけないのも悔しい。 ( fact (- n 1 ) ) だったところを単純に fact を引数化して ( proc (- n 1 ) ) と書き換えれば済むようにしたい。そこで今度は ( fact - maker fact - maker ) 自体を生成する関数を作ることを 考えよう。これには 、
(f 5 )
と
( ( lambda ( x ) ( f x ) ) 5 )
の評価値が同じであるという技を使う。 ( この二つの違いはと言うと、上のほうが「即座に」値を求めている
のに対して下は lambda をかますことで評価を少し先送りしていることだ。 評価される時期は ( Schemeでは ) 異なるが、λ抽象としての評価値は同じである)
この技を適用すると 、
( ( proc proc ) real - arg )
この式は次のように書きなおせる。
( ( lambda ( arg ) ( ( proc proc ) arg ) ) real - arg )
だから fact - maker は次のように書き直しても評価値は同じだ 。
( define fact - maker ( lambda ( proc ) ( lambda ( n ) ( if ( zero ? n) 1 (* n ( ( lambda ( arg ) ( ( proc proc ) arg ) ) (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
ここで proc ではなく最初から今展開した lambda を引数にとる ようにすれば、この部分を外に出して階乗計算部分だけ残すことが できる。関数名は fact0 に、引数名は proc から f に変えよう 。
( define fact0 ( lambda ( f ) ( lambda ( n ) ( if ( zero ? n) 1 (* n ( f (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ;; くくりだされた部分 ( fact - maker いっこぶん ) ( lambda ( proc ) ( fact0 ( lambda ( arg ) ( ( proc proc ) arg ) ) ) )
ところで、わざわざ lambda でくくって出すのではなく ( proc proc ) を そのまま抜き出してはいけないのだろうか。これは、いけない。実際 やってみると無限ループに陥る。そもそもやりたいことは ( proc proc ) が f の 「中 」で評価されることであって、( proc proc ) をそのまま抜き出すと f の 「外 」で評価されてしまう。
あとは呼び出し側の ( fact - maker fact - maker ) を修正すればいい。 fact - maker 一個分に相当する表現はわかっているから、それを 二回書いてリストにするだけだ 。
( ( lambda ( proc ) ( fact0 ( lambda ( arg ) ( ( proc proc ) arg ) ) ) ) ( lambda ( proc ) ( fact0 ( lambda ( arg ) ( ( proc proc ) arg ) ) ) ) )
さらに fact0 は名前なのでくくりだせる 。
( lambda ( f ) ( ( lambda ( proc ) ( f ( lambda ( arg ) ( ( proc proc ) arg ) ) ) ) ( lambda ( proc ) ( f ( lambda ( arg ) ( ( proc proc ) arg ) ) ) ) ) )
これで完成である。 あとは fact0 をあわせればうまくいく 。
; ; ; 名前を付けただけ ( define Y ( lambda ( f ) ( ( lambda ( proc ) ( f ( lambda ( arg ) ( ( proc proc ) arg ) ) ) ) ( lambda ( proc ) ( f ( lambda ( arg ) ( ( proc proc ) arg ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ;;; 自分自身を受け取る fact ( define fact0 ( lambda ( f ) ( lambda ( n ) ( if ( zero ? n) 1 (* n ( f (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( Y fact0 ) 5 ) ; 答えは 120

Analysis finds e-voting machines vulnerable WASHINGTON 
Most of the electronic voting machines widely adopted since the disputed 2000 presidential election " pose a real danger to the integrity of national , state and local elections , " a report out Tuesday concludes .
There are more than 120 security threats to the three most commonly purchased electronic voting systems , the study by the Brennan Center for Justice says .
For what it calls the most comprehensive review of its kind , the New York City - based non-partisan think tank convened a task force of election officials , computer scientists and security experts to study e-voting vulnerabilities .
The study , which took more than a year to complete , examined optical scanners and touch - screen machines with and without paper trails .
Together , the three systems account for 80 % of the voting machines that will be used in this November 's election .
While there have been no documented cases of these voting machines being hacked , Lawrence Norden , who chaired the task force and heads the Brennan Center 's voting - technology assessment project , says there have been similar software attacks on computerized gambling slot machines .
" It is unrealistic to think this is n't something to worry about " in terms of future elections , he says .
The report comes during primary season amid growing concerns about potential errors and tampering .
Lawsuits have been filed in at least six states to block the purchase or use of computerized machines .
Election officials in California and Pennsylvania recently issued urgent warnings to local polling supervisors about potential software problems in touch - screen voting machines after a test in Utah uncovered vulnerabilities in machines made by Diebold Election Systems .
North Canton , Ohio - based Diebold did not return calls for comment .
The company , a major manufacturer of e-voting machines , said earlier this month that security flaws cited in its machines were theoretical and would be addressed this year .
The new threat analysis does not address specific machines or companies .
Instead , it " confirms the suspicions about electronic voting machines that people may have had from individual reports " of problems , Norden says .
Among the findings : • Using corrupt software to switch votes from one candidate to another is the easiest way to attack all three systems .
A would - be hacker would have to overcome many hurdles to do this , the report says , but none " is insurmountable . " •
The most vulnerable voting machines use wireless components open to attack by " virtually any member of the public with some knowledge and a personal digital assistant . "
Only New York , Minnesota and California ban wireless components .
•
Even electronic systems that use voter - verified paper records are subject to attack unless they are regularly audited .
•
Most states have not implemented election procedures or countermeasures to detect software attacks .
" There are plenty of vulnerabilities that can and should be fixed before the November election , " says David Jefferson , a Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory computer scientist who served on the task force .
" Whether they will or not remains to be seen . "
The report said state election officials could improve voting - machine security if they conduct routine audits comparing voter - verified paper trails to the electronic record and ban wireless components in voting machines .
" A voting system that is not auditable contains the seeds of destruction for a democracy , " says Rep. Rush Holt , D - N.J. , a chief sponsor of a bill to improve electronic - voting security .

Core Wars Genetics : The Evolution of Predation John Perry ( jperry@cs.ucla.edu )
I. Introduction
The domain of binary biology , or binology , has enough interesting properties that there is truly no need to go outside of its bounds to provide good A - life experiments .
Processes can be born , die , move , reproduce , communicate , and do a host of other things without having to stretch to doing things like smelling .
The abundance of computer viruses and worms demonstrate the ability of processes to take on characteristics of life .
In fact , these programs are lifelike enough to scare computer users into taking precautions against them as they would against any parasite .
This raises an important issue in the field of binology .
If we are to study processes which may potentially run amok ( and in fact unpredictable behavior is something we often hope for ) , we must be careful not to affect other people 's processes lest we follow the fate of Robert Morris .
One way to keep our experiments leashed is to work on an isolated computer .
The problem with this is that a computer with no hard disk , no network , and no other users that is still reasonably powerful is a hard thing to come by .
A more reasonable way to maintain control is to run our experiments in a controlled environment which is still quite like the overall environment .
Core Wars is one such environment .
II .
Core Wars as a Binological Model
instructions DAT - a data value , non-executable .
MOV - move data from one address to another ADD - add two values and store in the second location SUB - subtract two values and store in the second location CMP - compare two locations and skip an instruction if they contain identical information JMP - unconditional jump to some address JMZ - jump to some address on the condition of some data value being zero JMN - jump to some address on the condition of some data value being non-zero SPL - split into two processes , one starting at the next address and one at a specified address DJN - decrement some data value and jump to some address if the value decremented is now zero addressing modes # - immediate $ - direct @ - indirect < - indirect with predecrement illustration 1 : the Redcode instruction set
Depending on how one wishes to apply it , Core Wars is capable of providing a wide variety of different kinds of A - life experiments .
Steen Rasmussen [ 1990 ] altered the rules slightly and came up with a self - contained evolutionary environment , sort of a binary version of the primordial soup experiment .
A potential result of this type of experiment would be to determine whether reproduction or metabolism tends to evolve first within a random coreworld .
That is , to find out if delineated programs with some function develop first , or auto - associative clusters of code .
Bill Buckley has shown various reactions between warriors , and involving warriors which degenerate to strange attractors over time .
This type of experiment shows that Core Wars warriors are capable of behavior much like the biological process of ontogeny .
Both of these types of experiment use a Core Wars arena as a closed world { 2} , or in other words the whole experiment goes on within the realm of the arena , however it is defined .
An alternative is to view the Core Wars arena as an open world , or more specifically as the visible part of some larger system .
The larger system I have in mind is an evolutionary process .
By applying a genetic algorithm to warrior populations , it should be possible to evolve warriors which perform some desired task .
The most obvious task to attempt to evolve in this domain is survival .
That is , start with randomly generated code and attempt to evolve programs that will thrive in a Core Wars arena .
This survival could be with no other opponent , with a fairly benign opponent , or even with an opponent that is rather savage .
Each of these conditions of the evolution would likely cause different survival strategies to come about .
For my project , I wanted to go one step further .
Rather than evolving something which may have ended up as prey for some other warrior , I chose to evolve a predator .
John Holland , among others , has spoken of a biological arms race ; my goal is to create the world 's first binological arms race .
III .
Evolution in Core Wars
One difficult problem with applying genetic algorithms to Core Wars consists of choosing the level of the gene .
As in biology , it is n't clear what the optimal size is for the smallest information carrying unit of genetic code .
Three distinct levels present themselves as viable candidates for the level of the binological gene :
The bit , the instruction , and the meta - instruction .
By meta - instruction , I am simply referring to an abstract chunk of code which has some function which will show up at the phenotype level .
In biological genetics features like ' blue eyes ' , or ' eight legs ' , or ' black feathers ' would be an example of a meta - instruction , and in fact this is the level at which most work in biological genetics is done .
A binological meta-instruction should consist of more than one instruction since most interesting things that can be done by a computer can't be done by one instruction .
An example of the meta- instruction level with respect to Core Wars is something like ' copy block ' or ' DAT bomb ' { 3} .
The researchers on the Tracker project chose the bit as the gene level .
They could do this because they were representing FSA 's and neural networks , which are fairly robust .
Thus it was difficult if not impossible to generate creatures that would n't execute at all .
In Core Wars and other assembly languages it is much easier to generate illegal code , as changing a single bit can easily create an illegal instruction .
Furthermore , in the initial tracker project the ants were represented by 40 bits , thus allowing 2^40 possible creatures .
In Core Wars , each instruction is 40 bits long , so the space of creatures is considerably larger , depending on how many instructions one allows per warrior ( see appendix A for calculations of the size of the space of my experiment ) .
The best justification for the bit as the gene level of binology is that it is truly the smallest unit of information that one can change on a computer .
On the other hand , single bits are n't always critical in a functional sense on computers .
Changing a bit in an unused data field may make no difference in how the instruction at that address executes , or in the functional performance of the program .
The instruction level is the smallest level of binological representation which assures functional distinction in the phenotype .
For this reason , I chose this level to be the genes in my experiments , but I allow mutations at a sub - gene level .
In other words , when two warriors are being mated , the instruction level is the level of crossover , although mutation works at a bit level .
The Tracker project researchers suggested that assembly language is not robust enough for this type of experiments , but I have to disagree .
Not even humans have achieved a 100 % survival ratio , so why should the things that we 're evolving have that advantage ?
I propose that a high death rate in fact more closely resembles biological life .
Certainly I may evolve a high number of warriors that die after executing only a few instructions , but do n't babies occasionally fall victim to crib - death ?
And yes , two excellent warriors may happen to spawn a warrior that is n't nearly as complex or effective , but do n't birth defects ( mongolism , for example ) still exist in humans and other animals ?
My point is that genetics has never been a very clean process and it will probably always be generating bitter fruit as well as good .
Another problem to consider is how to go about fitness testing .
Obviously it can be done by a MARS , but what is the best thing to fight the evolving warriors against ?
The most realistic thing to do , in an evolutionary sense , is to fight all of the warriors of each generation against each other .
In this way , all warriors would be fighting other warriors of approximately the same evolutionary complexity , and hopefully comparable fighting skills .
Dawkins would like this scheme , since it would have no obvious evolutionary goal .
The problem with this is that it is a fairly slow process , as nature has shown us , and it also requires a great number of battles .
An alternative is to fight all of the warriors against a common opponent , preferably one with fairly good fighting skills .
A previous entry in the Core Wars tournament would be a likely candidate .
This should be considerably faster , both because the number of battles at each generation will be less and because there will be a clear evolutionary goal .
Contrary to what Dawkins might say , this is a realistic strategy since many biological animals in our world have to learn to deal with man- made opponents ( dodging cars , avoiding electric fences , etc. ) .
The next thing to consider is which warrior to choose .
If we choose a warrior that is too weak or too strong it wo n't be useful .
Every warrior gets the same fitness score if they all win or all lose .
It would be better to fight two or three warriors at varying levels of strength , thus allowing the genetic warriors to vary more widely in their fitness scores .
Furthermore , this may keep them from evolving a strategy which is only useful against one specific warrior .
On this same point , it may help to vary some of the warriors between generations , hopefully to provide added diversity of strategies .
In terms of the fitness score itself , it can use the same formula which is used for the tournament : 3 points per win and 1 point per tie { 4} .
This type of fitness scoring has a side effect that it evolves survival as well as predation .
This is actually very helpful , since a program which attacks well , but can't survive is n't as good as one that attacks well and can survive .
IV .
Experiments Conducted
In addition there was a very small percent chance ( .05 % , to be exact ) of mutation for each instruction being copied .
Whereas mutation in Tracker consisted of simply flipping a bit , it was a much more complex process in my experiment .
After discussing this with a few people who had done some similar work , I ended up allowing a small random chance ( 5 % ) of each bit in the instruction to be flipped .
Since there are 40 bits in an instruction , this means that I should have expected about 2 bits to have been flipped in an average mutated instruction .
Holland [ 1975 ] suggested that a dominance change operator could be used reduce the damage done by generation of illegal instructions in situations like this , but I felt that it would n't significantly harm the experiment to allow a few illegal instructions to be generated , since they would only be fatal to the specific warrior containing that instruction , and only if it executes the instruction .
I did all of these described genetic manipulations directly on object code files , but if I want to clarify what a particular piece of code is doing , I can always disassemble it into Redcode source code .
In future experiments there are some things I may change , like the fact that warriors only live for one generation , but in general the paradigm I used is practical because it was easy to understand and apply .
Experiment 1 : the tournament warriors
It turned out to be worse than I thought .
I did the experiment on an IBM PC , which allows a maximum of 200 normal files in a directory .
After this , it allows files to be created in that directory , but it actually stores them all in one file , which slows down their access time considerably .
Since my program generated 1000 warriors for a population , this was very costly in terms of time .
Moreover , my method of fitness testing was n't very successful as well .
I could n't very well run each warrior against every other warrior , as this would amount to 999,000 battles , and I knew this .
My proposed solution was to test the warriors in smaller groups , and then test the ones that had done well in these smaller groups against each other .
I started a round of fitness testing at about 10:00 the first night , and when it was still running in the morning and was only about 2/3 complete , I knew I was in trouble .
I ended up by doing fitness testing by choosing pairs of warriors , competing them , and taking down the results by hand .
I did this for two generations of 80 warriors tested per generation , and then I ran out of time .
I took the two best warriors from the second generation , named C19 and C25 ( child 19 and child 25 ) , and entered them in the tournament .
The results of the tournament were about what I expected ; the two genetic warriors did n't win .
But surprisingly , they did n't finish in last place either .
Actually they placed second and third to last , but this means that they both beat a program that was written by a human who deemed it worthy of entry in the tournament .
Furthermore , C19 beat one of the warriors that made it to the finals in a battle .
This was notable performance for the first genetic warriors ever entered in the tournament , but not nearly as good as I had hoped to achieve .
This experiment was useful in a few ways , mainly as a critical review of my methods for the experiment which in general were crisis motivated and fairly poor .
I used this information to improve my methods for the second experiment , and the results were much better .
One of the bad methods was that my inadequate allocation of time did n't allow me to generate and test large enough populations .
Eighty warriors per generation is not nearly a large enough sample size to even make a dent in the space I am exploring , and it also does n't allow for sufficient variation between populations , somewhat like inbreeding in humans .
Another problem came from my choice of warriors to seed the 0th generation .
Since these warriors were significantly different in their design , they did n't tend to breed well , it was a bit like breeding dogs and sponges , or apples and scorpions .
This meant that there were a vast number of progeny that were non-functional ( i.e. that died after executing only a few instructions ) .
Experiment 2 : the better warriors
I changed the method of fitness testing to test all of the warriors of each generation against a few known warriors , thus allowing me to do larger population sizes of 1000 warriors per generation .
Two warriors which I chose to be used in testing all generations were selected for how they did in the 1990 International Core Wars tournament .
QUARTER2 finished fourth to last , and thereby was chosen to provide an easy kill for the warriors .
I felt this was necessary to get the early generations off the ground , and it worked out rather nicely .
WANG1 was one of the finalists in the tournament ( the finals results are n't out yet ) , and thus it was chosen to sort of play king of the mountain .
Warriors that tied or defeated WANG1 would have to have something going for them .
By battling WANG1 and QUARTER2 against each generation , I provided a consistent yardstick against which successive generations could be measured .
Additional warriors I used for fitness testing included two past winners of the International Core Wars Tournament ( FERRET and COWBOY ) and three of the other four finalists from this years tournament ( PWRBOMB , HYPRAY , and RNDMFIRE ) .
All five of these other warriors were to play a similar role to that of WANG1 , and also to help distinguish between the good and the very good warriors .
By varying which additional warriors competed against the genetic warriors each generation I hoped to evolve more robustness , and greater variety of strategies .
Fitness testing still took a long time to run however , each generation taking about 24 hours to test .
In addition , although the testing was done by the computer , I had to go through the results of the battles by hand , calculate the fitness scores ( 3 points per win and 1 point per tie ) , and determine which warriors would be the lucky parents for the next generation .
This was somewhat time consuming , so I only completed three generations by the time of the writing of this paper .
This is an ongoing project however , and I expect to complete ten to twenty generations before I make any bold statements about the validity of the experiment .
I selected the top 10 % of each generation to be allowed to reproduce , but this was partially an ad hoc process , since there was n't a clear line to break at in most cases between about the top 5 % and 20 % .
In other words , in each generation some warriors did very very well , and many warriors did just pretty well .
To do tie breaking between the ones that only did pretty well , I had to use arbitrary methods of choosing , which usually meant battling them against each other and watching for warriors which were particularly effective against their sibling warriors .
V. Results and Conclusions
On observing some of the later battles I noticed that a sort of speciation occurred .
There were large numbers of certain types of warriors and then a few novel types .
One type of warriors would deteriorate to a single instruction that was executing ( probably a JMP $ 0 , which just jumps to itself ad infinitum ) .
I called this species the hiders .
This strategy gained many ties against warriors that bombed at uneven intervals throughout memory , since they had trouble finding the one location in memory where their opponent was .
Programs that copy themselves around the arena often copied themselves over one of these warriors , and the hider then comes out of its hiding place and mimics the other program .
Hiders tended to get many ties , but only won by some strange chance , like as a side effect of mimicry .
Hiders are particularly susceptible to be killed by warriors that bomb consecutively through memory .
A species that does that very thing are the ones that I have named blind - bombers .
These warriors bomb furiously through memory , usually with a DAT bomb .
If placed close behind a program like FERRET or RNDMFIRE one of these programs could strike quickly and get a kill , but if a program moves out of the way a blind - bomber will eventually bomb around the whole space ( which addresses as a modulus ring ) and kill itself .
A variant of this species which my program evolved is the imp { 5} blind - bomber .
This amazing little program not only bombs consecutively with an imp , but it also evolved an imp stomper to catch the imps it creates .
The fact that it evolved cooperative processes in such a small number of generations is quite a feat .
Another variant of the blind bomber is the blind - JMP - bomber , which bombs consecutively through memory with some sort of jump instructions .
This sounds simple enough , but it caused a few problems for some of the " yardstick " warriors , and also produced unusual battles .
They were probably only unusual to me because this is not a commonly used strategy for human - programmed warriors .
So far , I am pleased with the results of the second experiment and I hope that future generations turn out to be as interesting and enlightening as the first three .
VI . Future Work
One possible experiment would be to test for preadaptation by using only one opposing warrior to test against for many generations and then change the opponent .
It would be interesting to see if the programs that evolved in this situation developed a specific strategy for their long term opponent , and if so , how long they retained any of that strategy after said opponent was gone .
Other interesting experiments would be to attempt to evolve movement or self - reproduction .
The problem with these potential experiments is how to go about fitness testing for self - reproduction or movement .
Perhaps movement could be forcibly evolved by a certain kind of opposing warrior , but self - reproduction is not that simple .
A feature which could enhance the power of this type of Core Wars experiments would be a disassemler .
The speed of my experiments and the size of the population could be vastly increased if I were to run the experiments on a more powerful machine ( say for example a CM2 ) .
This would also generate a whole new set of problems to be solved like how to run the fitness testing in parallel and how to represent an 8 K arena ( 8 K 40 bit words , that is ) in the 8 K bit memory space of each cell .
On the positive side , though , 200 generations in an hour sounds much better than 4 generations in a week .
With a space as large as the one that I am exploring in this experiment , the additional size and speed should be a vast improvement in terms of area of space searched .
If I can get fairly complex warriors in only 3 generations on an IBM PC , just imagine what kind of warriors could be evolved with a CM2 .

Minimum Average Maximum I. Instruction mix of warriors of minimal , maximal , and average size : Initial DATs 0 5 9 Instructions 10 20 30 Final DATs 0 5 9 II .
Number of possible warriors of minimal , maximal , and average size : a ) By number of bits : 2^400 2^1160 2^1848 b)
By legal instructions only : 2^390 2^1140 2^1818 c)
What I actually allowed : 77^10 x 2^300 77^20 x 2^920 77^30 x 2^1476
a) By number of bit -
In this case , the DAT instructions at the beginning and end will have 36 bits of unspecified information ( 4 of the bits indicate a DAT ) and the general instructions will have 40 bits of unspecified information , so :
MIN - 10 instructions @ 40 bits / instr = 400 bits of unspecified data => 2^400 possible warriors
AVG - 10 DAT instructions @ 36 bits / DAT = 360 bits + 20 instructions @ 40 bits / instr = 800 bits = 1160 total bits of unspecified data => 2^1160 possible warriors
MAX - 18 DATs @ 36 bits / DAT = 648 bits + 30 instructions @ 40 bits / instr = 1200 bits = 1848 total bits of unspecified data => 2^1848 possible warriors
b) By legal instructions only - This restriction merely removes certain instruction types which are impossible .
Specifically , there cannot be an immediate addressing mode for the A - fields of the JMP , SPL , DJN , JMZ , or JMN instructions or the B - fields of the ADD , SUB , or MOV instructions , since the former specify addresses to store data at and the latter specify addresses to branch to .
The size of the A - field and B - field are each 16 bits , thus there are 32 bits of data per instruction .
DAT and CMP instructions -
2 different opcodes = 2
36 bits free = 2^36
=> 2 x 2^36 = 2^37 legal DAT or CMP instructions
JMP , SPL , DJN , JMZ , and JMN instructions -
5 different opcodes = 5
3 possible modes for A - field = 3
2 bits for mode for B - field + 32 bits of data = 2^34 => 3 x 5 x 2^34 = 15 x 2^34 legal branching instructions
ADD , SUB , and MOV instructions -
3 different opcodes = 3
3 possible modes for B - field = 3
2 bits for mode for A - field + 32 bits of data = 2^34 => 3 x 3 x 2^34 = 9 x 2^34 legal writing instructions
So for considering all possible legal instructions , there are a total of 2^37 + 15 x 2^34 + 9 x 2^34 = ( 8 + 15 + 9 ) x 2^34 = 32 x 2^34 = 2^39 legal instructions
MIN - 10 instructions @ 2^39 legal instructions = ( 2^39 ) ^10 => 2^390 possible warriors
AVG - 10 DATs @ 36 bits / DAT = ( 2^36 ) ^10 = 2^360 20 instructions @ 2^39 legal instructions = ( 2^39 ) ^20 = 2^780 => 2^360 x 2^780 = 2^1140 possible warriors
MAX - 18 DATs @ 36 bits / DAT = ( 2^36 ) ^18 = 2^648 30 instructions @ 2^39 legal instructions = ( 2^39 ) ^20 = 2^1170 => 2^648 x 2^1170 = 2^1818 possible warriors
c ) What I actually allowed - in addition to the restrictions to generate legal instructions , I also restricted the size of the A and B fields to ( - 8192,8192 ) since the size of the space I 'm working in is 8192 , and thus larger values would be redundant by modulus .
This allows a total of 28 bits for the A and B data fields .
DAT & CMP : 2 opcodes = 2
28 bits of data field + 4 bits of addressing modes = 2^32 => 2 x 2^32 = 2^33 practical DAT or CMP instructions
JMP , SPL , DJN , JMZ , and JMN :
5 opcodes x 3 A - field modes = 15
28 bits of data field + 2 bits of B - field modes = 2^30 => 15 x 2^30 practical branching instructions
ADD , SUB , and MOV :
3 opcodes x 3 B - field modes = 9
28 bits of data field + 2 bits of A - field modes = 2^30 => 9 x 2^30 practical writing instructions
Therefore , considering all possible instructions , we have : 2^33 + 15 x 2^32 + 9 x 2^30 = ( 8 + 60 + 9 ) x 2^30 = 77 x 2^30 practical instructions
MIN - 10 instructions @ 77 x 2^30 practical = ( 77 x 2^30 ) ^10
=> 77^10 x 2^300 possible warriors
AVG - 10 DATs @ 32 bits / DAT = 2^320
20 instructions @ 77 x 2^30 possible instructions = ( 77 x 230 ) ^20 => 2^320 x 77^20 x 2^600 = 77^20 x 2^920 possible warriors
MAX - 18 DATs @ 32 bits /DAT = 2^576
30 instructions @ 77 x 2^30 possible instructions = ( 77 x 2^30 ) ^30 => 2^576 x 77^30 x 2^900 = 77^30 x 2^1476 possible warriors
These figures are slightly misleading .
They represent the number of possible warriors of a particular size , but I weighted my choices so that the range of the data fields of the branching and writing instructions tended to be smaller .
In other words , an instruction that branches is more likely to branch a short distance than a long one , and an instruction that accesses data ( either read or write ) , is more likely to access local data than data which is far away .
I did n't have to do this , but I felt it would make programs that were more likely to have looping structures , and were also more likely to be self modifying .

{ } I was careful not to use the term closed system here , since Steen 's system constantly pumped new random data into the system , thus maintaining an influx of energy in to the system .
{ } Here , ' copy block ' means copying a block of data from one location in memory to another location and ' DAT bomb ' means copying DAT instructions throughout memory .
Both of these are things which are commonly done by warriors .
{ } To be true to Holland 's definition of a genetic algorithm , this value could be normalized by dividing by the maximum value to get a number between 0 and 1 , but I chose not to do this .
My method was actually considerably more ad hoc , and it will be described later .
{ } An imp consists of the single instruction " MOV $ 0 $ 1 " .
This instruction , if executed by a process , will copy itself to the next location in memory .
Then on the next clock cycle , the process will execute that copy and move itself ahead again , and so on .
This is the smallest moving program in Core Wars .
A -G-E-Y-S-V-P-T-S and n-e-g-j-w-a-h-r-x
then if a " crossover " is done at the 3rd gene , they will produce the following pair of child programs :
A - G- E-j-w -a-h-r-x and n-e-g-Y - S- V- P-T-S
The other common reproduction operation is mutation .
In mutation , some piece of one of the child warriors is altered slightly .
Thus if mutation was also applied on the first child in the previous example , the resulting children may look like :
A - G-F-j-w-a-h-r-x and n-e-g-Y - S- V- P-T-S
The object in GAs is to start off with " ramdom " code and to let the GA evolve code to perform a desired task .
Since programs are rewarded for how well they perform on the desired task , each " generation " tends to do better overall on the desired task .
Amazon has decided to relocate its customer service centre to Cork in a bid to take advantage of stronger language skills in Ireland .
The workforce in perennial joke - butt Slough does n't have the necessary polyglotism required to deal with calls from all over Europe , it says .
Headquarters will stay in Slough , but 90 call centre and support staff face relocation .
Combined with expansion , the move will create up to 450 jobs on Cork 's Airport industrial estate .
European customer services chief Jim Adkins offered the FT a banal explanation for getting the movers in : " As our business has grown , and as we have expanded the categories of products we offer , we need to expand our customer service support as well . "
A dearth of French and German speakers is behind the shift to Cork .
A 2005 European Commission poll revealed the UK lags behind its near neighbour in language skills , with just 30 per cent of the population able to converse in a second tongue , to the Irish 's 41 per cent .
The news can only make things worse for Slough - long regarded as Britain 's most depressing place to live and visit .
The BBC recently took pity on the wretched setting for The Office by sending a team of " happiness experts " to cheer the place up in its series " Making Slough Happy " .
For the uninitiated , John Betjemen 's poem " Slough " sums up the ambient despair rather eloquently . ®

Astonishing view of one of the cities most beautiful church is on fire right now , August 25th , 2006 .
People reported they heard a “ boom ” , probably terrorist action is suspected .
Also it is raining now , and the view is realy apocalyptic .
We hope youll choose one of these books to read this summer , as a reminder that UC Berkeley is a vital intellectual community that generates and debates fascinating and important ideas .
Borrowing from Professor Richard Mullers popular course ,  Physics for Future Presidents ,  this year we have chosen the topic  Books for Future Presidents . 
We have asked faculty from all over campus to recommend books that future leaders of any group countries , cities , companies , organizations , community groups should be sure to read .
Youll see that the suggestions range widely : history , poetry , fiction , hints for travelers , to name a few .
There is surely a title on this list that youll enjoy reading .
You may find them in bookstores , and all are available in the Berkeley campus libraries .
Welcome to Berkeley .
We re sending you something that you dont need to figure out , fill out , or even respond to .
Every summer , we send new UC Berkeley freshmen a list of books suggested by various people on campus .
This is not an official list , or even a list of required reading .
It s just for you to enjoy as you wish .
HERE ’S AN IDEA for a reality TV show .
Call it “ Aliens . ”
The contestants will be drawn from the U.S. Congress .
To start , they ’ll have their credit cards , cellphones , computers and cars confiscated .
Next , they ’ll be sent -- with their families -- to live in rural villages and urban shantytowns in poor countries .
Each will be assigned a menial job in his new home , for which he will receive a dollar a day .
Most members of Congress wo n’t last more than a few episodes , of course .
Their kids will quickly lose the puppy fat that comes from a hearty American diet and instead gain the bloated tummies that characterize children with nutritional deficiencies .
This development will frighten off the faint of heart .
The remaining contestants will be given the opportunity to compete in an even tougher game .
They ’ll be instructed to make their way to a distant country , but they wo n’t be provided with money , a passport or transportation .
Hardships along the route will include fording flood - prone rivers , crossing dangerous deserts on foot and evading the armed gangs of smugglers and traffickers who will attempt to rob , rape and kidnap them .
Advertisement
Contestants will then have to covertly cross a border into a country guarded by armed agents .
Those who make it will then have to find food , shelter and employment in a place where they do n’t know the language and are in constant danger of being detected , detained and deported by the authorities .
The only jobs available to them will be low - paying and often backbreaking labor .
What ’s the prize , you ask ?
Any contestants who manage to survive a full season will be offered the opportunity to draft a new immigration reform bill for the United States .
“ Aliens ” would have an enormous natural audience in the two - thirds of Americans polled who disapprove of Congress ’ job performance .
And one thing ’s for sure :
The resulting immigration reform bill would look nothing like the reform bill under consideration in Congress .
Advertisement
Both House and Senate versions of the bill share the same punitive spirit .
At the moment , being in the U.S. unlawfully is a civil violation , not a crime .
But current versions of the bill would make it a felony , resulting in possible prison time as well as deportation .
Both versions of the bill would also criminalize many forms of humanitarian assistance to illegal immigrants .
The House version , for instance , makes it a felony for anyone to “ assist ” an unlawful immigrant to “ reside or remain ” in the U.S .
This means that a church volunteer who serves hot meals to illegal immigrants could end up in prison .
Such punitive provisions are mean - spirited and foolish .
But many of our elected leaders are so busy measuring the border for a new barbed - wire fence that they never stop to seriously consider alternatives to cracking down on illegal immigration .
Here ’s a radical idea : Instead of spending the $ 206 billion the Center for American Progress estimates it would take to implement a five - year policy designed to detect , prosecute , imprison and deport people found here unlawfully , what if the U.S. stopped trying to punish all illegal immigrants ?
We need border security , and we should take action against any person whose behavior poses a serious threat to public safety .
But there ’s no need to be so punitive toward the ordinary economic migrants who find their way into the U.S .
Advertisement
Although most people assume that any slackening in efforts to enforce immigration laws would lead to a rapid influx of illegal immigrants , damaging the U.S. economy , there ’s little reason to believe this would actually happen .
Look at the European Union ’s recent experience .
After poorer Eastern European states were admitted to the EU in 2004 , many Western Europeans feared an influx of cheap labor that would push local workers out of jobs .
But the evidence suggests the xenophobes got it backward .
In February , the European Commission released a study concluding that far fewer Eastern Europeans than expected had sought jobs in the three EU member states -- Britain , Ireland and Sweden -- that have completely opened their labor markets .
These three states mainly saw “ positive effects ” of increased immigration from Eastern Europe , including “ high economic growth , a drop of unemployment and a rise of employment . ”
Even when it means facing hardship , most people prefer to remain in their home countries , surrounded by family and compatriots who share their language and culture .
Those desperate and courageous enough to leave in search of a better life far away are the exception , not the rule .
Advertisement
And our economy benefits from their presence .
As the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has pointed out , illegal immigrants are “ working hard and performing tasks that most Americans take for granted but wo n’t do themselves . ”
As far as I ’m concerned , anyone brave and determined enough to walk here from Guatemala deserves admiration , not hostility .
Are there any " good " reasons to not shop at Wal - Mart ?
We have been given plenty of " bad " reasons by the likes of not only New York Times columnist Paul Krugman and Sojourners magazine , but also our friends at Chronicles and The American Conservative magazines , who are parroting the far left .
According to them , Wal - Mart destroys jobs , puts mom & pop operations out of business , is anti-union , pays low wages , exploits its workers , practices predatory pricing , destroys small towns , is too big , sells too much junk , does n't provide health insurance to all of its employees , and , when all else fails , buys too much from " Red " China .
This is all bunk , of course , but still , " good " reasons can be given for not shopping at Wal - Mart , just like " good " reasons can sometimes be given for not doing business with any company or shopping at any particular store .
Ultimately , however , these " good " reasons all come down to personal preference .
There are no universal norms that can be applied here .
I live in a Wal - Mart town .
I am within a very short driving distance of three Wal - Marts , and can , if necessary , easily drive to four others in 30 to 45 minutes .
I can , therefore , speak with much experience under my belt ( and in my wallet ) about shopping at Wal - Mart .
I even worked there once , part time , to supplement my other part time income while I was in college .
That being said , my family and I do not buy everything at Wal - Mart .
Even though Wal - Mart is certainly " the incredible stuff machine , " it does not sell everything — at least not yet .
But I do shop there enough to make me an expert witness to the fact that there are " good " reasons not to shop there .
Here are ten of them .
Good reason # 1 : Crowds Wal - Mart is usually crowded .
If you do n't like crowds , then you probably should n't shop at Wal - Mart .
However , the same thing could be said about trying to get into a good restaurant on Friday night — at least in Pensacola , Florida .
Do you want to save money but do n't like crowds ?
Most Wal - Marts are open 24/ 7 .
Get there early in the morning or late at night .
If you are in a hurry to shop on your way home from work , then fight the crowds or go somewhere else .
Good reason # 2 : Parking Although Wal - Mart has one of the largest parking lots of any one store , it can be tough to find a parking space on a Saturday afternoon .
Many of the open spaces are quite some distance from the store .
With gas prices as high as they are , no one wants to burn up their precious gas circling the parking lot at Wal - Mart looking for a parking space .
The solution ?
Shop at another time or get some exercise and walk the distance from the parking spots that are the farthest out .
You needed to loss some weight anyway .
If you do n't want to go to Wal - Mart during the week or you would rather not get some exercise , then shop somewhere else — the parking lot at K - Mart is usually empty .
Good reason # 3 : Carts
When Wal - Mart gets really busy , the shopping carts disappear fast .
There is nothing more frustrating than to park at the far end of the Wal - Mart parking lot , walk the distance up to the store , and then find that there are no shopping carts .
Well , aside from going to another store , there is a solution .
There are always shopping carts in the parking lot that can be brought up to the store as you walk from the back of the parking lot .
And besides , with a shopping cart , you do n't have to carry your returns — just put them in the buggy .
If there are no carts to be found and you do n't wish to wait for one , then go somewhere else this time or every time .
Good reason # 4 : Lines Lines and Wal - Mart go hand - in - hand .
There is a line of cars waiting to turn into the parking lot .
There is a line of people filing out of the store that you have to stop and wait for as you drive by the front of the store .
There is a line of people at the deli getting their meat and cheese sliced .
There is a line of people at the checkouts .
There is a line of people at the return counter .
The worst line is the line of people waiting to get the oil changed in their car ( if their Wal - Mart has a tire and lube department ) .
If someone does n't like lines ( like me ) , then he probably should n't shop at Wal - Mart .
The solution ?
Do n't shop at Wal - Mart during peak times — go to Dollar General or Target .
Still adamant about shopping at Wal - Mart ?
Bring a book to read while you are waiting in line .
I always drop off my truck , van , and SUV ( I have n't driven a car for years ) to avoid waiting in line .
Do n't have a book or time to wait in line ?
Spend an extra $ 10 and get your oil changed at a mom & pop quick lube .
Good reason # 5 : Cashiers Although Wal - Mart has a multitude of checkouts , there is often a shortage of cashiers to man the checkouts .
My pleas to the four supervisors standing around to get some additional cashiers usually go unheeded .
True , I rarely have to wait at K - Mart .
However , I do n't like shopping at K - Mart — that is why I shop at Wal - Mart .
So , what 's the solution ?
See good reason # 4 .
Good reason # 6 : Inventory Although each Wal - Mart has thousands of feet of shelves , sometimes they are empty .
At the Wal - Mart I usually shop at , first it was pineapples , and then it was pinto beans — every time we went in the store the shelf was empty .
Granted , we were looking for the Wal - Mart brand of pineapples and pinto beans , but still , we expected the shelves to be full of inventory .
If someone is tired of empty shelves at Wal - Mart , then he can go somewhere else .
But there is a reason that the shelves are always full at some other store — no one is shopping there .
If full shelves for every item are more important to you than low prices and full shelves for most items , then by all means shop somewhere else .
Good reason # 7 : Selection I 'll be the first one to admit , it is annoying to go back to Wal - Mart a few weeks after a purchase and look for the same item only to find that it is no longer carried or has been replaced by something else that is similar , but not what I wanted .
But I am not dumb enough to think for a minute that I am entitled to be able to purchase the same identical item — even on the next day .
If you do n't like Wal - Mart for this reason then take your business elsewhere .
Good reason # 8 : Self - checkout registers I like self - checkout registers .
However , I like them better when they work .
The self - checkout registers at the Wal - Mart nearest my house always seem to be either closed or suffering from some glitch that entails tracking down the cashier who oversees them .
This is really a minor problem , however , since no one is forced to use the self - checkout registers .
These registers are far outnumbered by the regular ones with live cashiers .
But for those who insist on using the self - checkout registers , other stores have them as well and would be glad to have the extra business .
Good reason # 9 : Prices Contrary to popular opinion , the prices at Wal - Mart are not always the lowest .
Milk , for example , can always be purchased cheaper somewhere else — at least where I live .
But is it really worth the time and the gas to pick up something at another store for a lower price when the same identical item can be purchased while you are already in Wal - Mart ?
Not usually .
Good reason # 10 : Getting Help Looking for someone in charge of a particular department at Wal - Mart who has not left early and is not on break ?
You might want to think about it — a long time .
I know this is not true in every department at every Wal - Mart , but it invariably happens when you need some information in a hurry .
This may be a " good " reason not to shop at Wal - Mart for a particular item , but certainly not to boycott the store altogether .
If it bothers you that much then take your business elsewhere .
If you still prefer the " bad " reasons for not shopping at Wal - Mart then by all means do n't shop at Wal - Mart .
Just quit citing your bogus reasons as if they were facts .
Wal - Mart has never caused any firm to go out of business .
Wal - Mart can't close down any store but one of its own .
It is the customers who no longer do business with a company or shop at a particular store who put that company out of business or closed that store .
Wal - Mart has never caused any person to become unemployed .
Wal - Mart can't cause anyone to be unemployed except its own employees .
If Wal - Mart treats its employees so badly , why do so many thousands of Americans work there ?
Are they too stupid to know that they are being exploited by greedy capitalists ?
Do they not know that they are earning subsistence wages ?
Are they not smart enough to know that their health is in jeopardy because they lack health insurance ?
Why is it that the people so concerned about how Wal - Mart treats its employees do n't work for the company ?
No one is forced to work or to shop at Wal - Mart .
The employees of Wal - Mart vote in favor of the company with their feet when they show up for work .
The customers of Wal - Mart vote in favor of the company with their wallet when they do their shopping .
Whatever your reason , if you do n't like Wal - Mart , then do n't shop there and do n't work there .
And if it makes you feel better , do n't live in any town that has a Wal - Mart store .
Just do n't expect us to do likewise .
Do n’t throw that old PC away just yet , it still has some life in it yet .
No matter how bad your old PC is it can always be used as a router , and your old router as a switch .
All you need is two nic cards for it .
Originally I did this on a Pentium 3 with 256 MBs of memory .
I had that setup for around 6 months before the computer finally died .
Never quite figured it out but it was either the processor or the mother board .
But anyways on with the show .
I will be setting this up on an AMD 3200 XP processor with one gigabyte of memory , an nForce 2 chipset and 450 gigs of hard drive space .
The Linux distribution I ’m using is going to be Gentoo Linux .
Assuming you ’ve already got the system setup and running correctly we will start with kernel configuration .
Do n’t freak out it ’s not that hard to do .
cd /usr / src/linux
make menuconfig
You should be at a screen with a few options .
Navigate the screen as follows :
Networking -->
Network options --> [*]
TCP / IP networking <*> IP : advanced router Scroll down about to [ *]
Network packet filtering ( replaces ipchains )
Star it hit enter and go to IP : Netfilter Configuration [*]
Connection tracking ( required for masq / NAT ) <*> FTP protocol support <*> IRC protocol support [*]
IP tables support ( required for filtering / masq / NAT ) <*>

Ingress Qdisc Device Drivers Network device support [ *]
PPP ( point - to - point protocol ) support <*> PPP filtering <*> PPP support for async serial ports <*> PPP support for sync tty ports <*> PPP Deflate compression <*> PPP BSD - Compress compression <*> PPP over Ethernet
Click exit all the way out until it asks you to save .
Click yes to save and in terminal type :
make && make modules_install
Yup you ’re officially compiling the kernel .
Get some food or something because depending on your system it might take a while :) .
When that is done compiling , copy the binary to / boot with :
cp arch/i386/boot/bzImage /boot/kernel-2.6.17-gentoo-r5
Obviously you ’ll need to use the name of your old kernel , as that might not be the name of yours .
Now from here the steps are different depending on how you connect to the internet .
I use cable so I do n’t have to worry about PPPoE .
I ’ll go over a cable setup first .
If you do n’t have it already you will need dhcpcd .
emerge dhcpcd
Then you ’ll need to make another interface for your second nic by using a symbolic link , and make them all start on boot .
ln -s net .lo /etc/init.d/net.eth1
rc-update add net.eth1 default
rc-update add net .eth0 default
If you ’re using DSL / PPPoE you ’ll need to do this : ( Straight from gentoo handbook )
# nano /etc/ppp/pap-secrets
# client server secret
“ vla9h924 ” * “ password ”
# nano /etc/conf.d/net
Tell baselayout to use adsl for your eth1 :
config_eth1= ( “ adsl ” )
user_eth1=( “ vla9h924 ” )
( Replace ‘ vla9h924 ’ with your username and ‘ password ’ with your password )
Next you ’ll need to configure your LAN and WAN interface .
I used eth1 as WAN and eth0 as LAN .
To do this we need to configure /etc/ conf.d/net
For a dynamic or even semi static ( Comcast users ) :
config_eth1=( “ dhcp ” )
Static IP : ( From gentoo manual never used a static IP )
config_eth1= ( “ 66.92.78.102 broadcast 66.92.78.255 netmask 255.255.255.0 ” )
routes_eth1= ( “ default gw 66.92.78.1 ” )
And finally both users must add :
config_eth0 = ( “ 192.168.1.1 broadcast 192.168.1.255 netmask 255.255.255.0 ” )
Almost done , all we need is a firewall to protect us since we are wide open on the internet , and some NAT rules to forward traffic .
cd /etc/init.d/
wget https://cyber-knowledge.net/blog/extras/firewall
wget https://cyber-knowledge.net/blog/extras/natrouting
chmod 700 natrouting
chmod 700 firewall
rc-update add firewall default
rc-update add natrouting default
Double check those scripts to make sure everything is correct for your LAN / WAN in there .
Hook up the cables so that the one coming from your modem is in the WAN port , and the one from your LAN port is going into the LAN port of a switch or your old router .
Usually the WAN port on a switch is separated from the rest .
If you plug more LAN cables in to that switch , all computers will have internet .
If you ’re using your old router make sure you change your old routers IP to 192.168.1.2 or something before using it as a switch .
Reboot your computer and everything should start fine .
The WAN interface should have gotten an external IP while the LAN should have gotten 192.168.1.1 .
If not , restart your modem by unplugging it and plugging it back in .
Then restart the WAN interface by doing :
/etc/init.d/net.eth1 restart
Hopefully it worked that time .
Keep in mind all PCs you hook up to the network will now have to be configured to use a static IP address .
For more information on that see the Microsoft website .
Some hints while doing it .
The IP can be 192.168.1.100 through .255 .
The default gateway is 192.168.1.1 .
Your subnet mask should fill in automatically .
The name server can be found in /etc / resolv.conf of your router or you can use 4.2.2.1 .
With all luck you have internet and a much faster router : D. Have fun , and comment if this worked for you or you had any issues .

DI : Who started Tiny Love , and what is it 's history ?
TL : Tiny Love was founded 15 years ago , in 1991 , by Shoshi and Isaac Oren , who owned a chain of retail stores for children product and decided to expand into the developmental toys field .
DI : What is the toy - development process and creative process like at Tiny Love ?
TL : Much like everybody else , we start with an idea .
The idea can come either from inside : from the management , the art director , an account manager who receives requests and input from his clients , or from outside : students that participate in a Tiny Love sponsored course for example .
We make a point out of fostering relationships with design schools , design students and young designers , and they reward us with fresh ideas .
There are two factors that come into play in the toy development process : one , it 's important to us to be innovative and pioneering in terms of redefining the boundaries of existing toy categories and even in terms of creating new categories altogether , so we try to invest our creative energies in these directions .
Second , maybe the most important aspect of our toys is the 7 elements system we developed that make sure the toy provides the baby with the appropriate developmental values .
The 7 element system , in short , provide the parent a point of reference as to the different stages of development the baby should go through , and the ways to encourage her in achieving them .
Our website offers an extensive explanation of the 7 elements system , including cross-sections by age , if you would like to read more about it .
This is where our in - house developmental psychologist gets in the picture .
She reviews the toy thoroughly to make sure it is up to par vis -à - vis the developmental values it supplies , and the age group it is intended for .
We also use other experts such as a physiotherapist and an occupational therapist that contribute their professional knowledge to the features and general usability of the toy .
DI : What recent research work have you found inspiring ?
TL : There are more than a few examples where our products relate directly to recent studies in child development .
One example would be our DVD MAGIQ product that responds to the increasing need in mitigating young children exposure to television .
In recent years a growing number of studies point to the " couch potato problem " : children are watching too much television and becoming more and more passive , a phenomenon that has a host of harmful physical and emotional consequences .
In the face of this reality , new research works have established the distinction between passive and active viewing as well as the latter 's potential benefits for children , for example " Growing up with Television – The Small Screen in the Lives of Children and Adolescents " ( Open University Press , 2002 ) , by Professor Dafna Lamish of Tel Aviv University ’s Media Studies Dept .
Our DVD MAGIQ product is design to encourage active viewing in children and babies , by creating a real interaction between the child and a toy animal that is synchronized to respond to the DVD program .
This technique can potentially change the entire paradigm of watching television by transforming it into a more dialogical activity .
Another example is our new Activitot series that encourage babies to spend time on playing on their tummies , in response to research that found that babies that did not spend enough time on their tummies did not develop as well as those who did .
DI : What advice do you have for people who would like to make developmentally - informed toys ?
TL : Working in Tiny Love one realizes that people come with good ideas all the time .
The difficult part is to get from that good idea to the part where you actually has a toy to sell .
You need to go through a complicated development and production process , and you need to market and sell your product .
So , our advice for making developmentally - informed toys is : come to us with your brilliant ideas , and we 'll put it to work in our tried and true system .
In Rousseau 's day , very little was known about the science of cognitive development .
But even then , it was clear that " child 's play " is not mere distraction or lazy pasttime - in fact , it is a critical process in how children discover the world and eventually become capable of thinking like adults .
The past 50 years have seen an explosion of research on the mechanisms underlying brain and cognitive development , but only recently has this work begun to inform the kinds of early - life experiences we give our children .
Specifically , " enriched play " is a relatively new concept , gaining traction across the research landscape : as detailed in this post , this is an active area of research at the MIT Media Lab , the Human - Computer Interaction Lab of the University of Maryland , and in the Craft Technologies Lab at the University of Colorado , Boulder .
To learn more about this " enriched play " movement in the consumer world , I sent a series of questions to Tiny Love - a company specializing in developmental toys for the consumer market .
Thanks to Shiri Percinger - Cohen for this opportunity to take a peek inside Tiny Love Toys .

The ravenous giant rabbit , named after the famed Wallace and Gromit character , is reported to have ripped up dozens of prize - winning leeks and turnips .
Now growers in Felton , near Morpeth , have drafted in licensed gamekeepers with air rifles to halt the rampage .
But animal welfare workers have called for the animal to be trapped instead .
Four gardeners described the rabbit as having one ear larger than the other .
The main clues are oversized paw prints and sightings of what growers claim to be a cross between a hare and a rabbit .
It 's been taking huge bites out of cabbages , carrots and turnips ... it 's a hungry fella
Marksman Brian Cadman
A small group of allotment holders have now clubbed together to hire two air rifle marksmen with orders to shoot to kill .
Grower Jeff Smith , 63 , said : " This is no ordinary rabbit .
We are dealing with a monster .
" It is absolutely massive .
I have seen its prints and they are huge , bigger than a deer .
It is a brute of a thing . "
Mr Smith , who has kept an allotment for 25 years , added : " We have two lads here with guns who are trying to shoot it , but it is clever .
" They never see it .
There were big rabbits in the 1950s and 1960s before pesticides were introduced , but not like this . "
Marksman Brian Cadman , 17 , said : " We 've been told to shoot on sight , but we 've not had much luck yet .
" You can see what it 's been eating .
" It 's been taking huge bites out of cabbages , carrots and turnips .
It 's a hungry fella . "
The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ( RSPCA ) urged the growers to set a humane trap for the animal and release it elsewhere .

Functional GUIs with F# - .NET FRINGE Presentation
How do you write a GUI app in a functional programming language that prefers immutability ?
From Visual Basic on we have been taught how to compose interactive UIs using events and mutable properties .
Is there any other way ?
The answer is , yes , indeed there is .
Not only can you build UIs using functional concepts , but I will argue that the architecture of such an app is more modular and more robust than the standard architecture resulting from objects sending messages to each other .
This talk is an introduction to the fringe world of functional programming using F# and will have information useful to both beginners and practitioners .
Excited for FRINGE
It ’s been too long since we ’ve had an open source .NET conference .
Since monospace / monkeyspace imploded , we ’ve been left with just Xamarin ’s Evolve .
And while I love Xamarin , and Evolve is glorious , it ’s just not the same thing as the free - wheeling brain fest of an OS conference .
Only at an open source conference do I get to see free thinkers unabashedly demo’ing their latest library or idea without having to bend it to a corporate initiative .
It ’s liberating and exciting !
Introducing NGraphics
Many moons ago I created a cross platform library for rendering vector graphics called CrossGraphics .

Study : People think their emails are twice as funny as they really are
Think that email you ’re sending off to your coworker is pretty funny ?
According to a recent study ( PDF link ) , the odds are that she ’ll find only half as funny as you do .
A trio of business scholars ran an interesting experiment :
They took a bunch of people and had them write emails in various tones of voice , including “ sarcastic ” and “ funny ” .
Then they sent them to a handful of recipients .
It turns out that the recipients were frequently unable to correctly read the tone that the writer intended : Only 56 % were able to accurately figure out that an email was sarcastically phrased .
Things fared even worse with humor .
The email writers were asked to compose a funny email , and to rate it on an ascending scale of 1 to 10 — both in terms of how funny they thought it was , and how funny they predicted their readers would find it .
On average , the writers rated their own hilarity level at 8.16 , and predicted that readers would find them a laff - a- rific 7.27 .
In reality , the stone - faced recipients thought the emails were only 3.55 funny .
Obviously , there are a couple of conclusions here .
Either a ) people are crappy writers ; b ) people are crappy readers ; or c ) a subtle mixture of the two governs all online communiations , ensuring that we have no clue what the hell anyone else is trying to say .
Nor is this problem solely limited to email ; as the authors note :
Although our focus here has been on e-mail miscalibrations , we believe that the overconfidence we have documented here likely characterizes a wide range of rapidly emerging media types .
Chat room , instant messaging , text - based gaming environments — all have been touted for their superiority to asynchronous text media such as e-mail because of the dynamic nature of the discourse and ability to provide rapid feedback …
In fact , we suspect the synchronous and rapid nature of these mediums may actually increase the rift between senders and receivers .

Development History
Some 12.3 percent of all babies -- 499,008 infants -- were born prematurely ( less than 37 weeks gestation ) in 2003 , according to the report released by the National Center for Health Statistics ( NCHS ) .
That 's up from 12.1 percent ( or about 480,000 babies ) in 2002 -- and an increase of more than 30 percent since the government began tracking premature births in 1981 .
The prematurity rate was 9.4 in 1981 ; it has increased every year since then except for slight dips in 1992 and 2000 .
" Prematurity is the number one killer of newborns .
We see from these latest statistics that the prematurity crisis in this country continues to intensify , and the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina will only make it worse , " said Dr. Jennifer L. Howse , president of the March of Dimes .
" Babies are dying and those who survive are too often left with devastating consequences -- such as cerebral palsy , mental retardation , learning problems and blindness . "
The March of Dimes began its multi-year campaign to address the growing rate of premature birth in 2003 .
The campaign educates women on the signs and symptoms of premature birth , and supports more research into the causes of premature labor .
One of the goals of the campaign is to help the nation reach the goal set by the U.S. Public Health Service of reducing the rate of premature birth to 7.6 percent by 2010 .
The NCHS report , entitled " Births Final Data for 2003 " appeared in the National Vital Statistics Report , volume 54 , number 2 .
The March of Dimes is a national voluntary health agency whose mission is to improve the health of babies by preventing birth defects , premature birth and infant mortality .
Founded in 1938 , the March of Dimes funds programs of research , community services , education , and advocacy to save babies .

CES Opinion
Anyone the least bit concerned about DRM ( digital rights management ) technology would likely have been put off by Google co-founder Larry Page 's ho -hum approach to revealing the company 's new proprietary media locks .
And with good reason .
" We have our own DRM that we 're using , " Page said , during a keynote at CES .
" We 'll be open to other things , but ( creating our own ) seemed like the easier thing to do . "
Google 's DRM will make its first appearance as part of a new video downloading service .
Page revealed that customers will be able to buy TV shows from CBS , NBA basketball games and a host of other content with Google serving as the delivery broker for the video .
This move mimics other technology companies - most notably Apple - which have struck deals with large media houses to send video over the web for a fee .
Along with the service , Google has also released its own , slick video player .
None of this is bad or surprising when examined from Google 's perspective .
The ad broker has every right to push on with new businesses and use its might , prestige and hype to secure prominent partnerships with the likes of CBS .
And , heck , if Apple and Microsoft can create DRM systems , then why ca n't Google ?
You can , however , see a crisis evolving for internet users and consumers .
Apple has a very locked down DRM system that revolves around iTunes and iPods only .
Microsoft has a lot of partners for its DRM , making it look open and like a standard .
Of course , the MP3 players and services that support Microsoft have n't garnered near as much interest as Apple 's rival offerings .
So , Microsoft is n't really a standard at all but rather a small , less closed garden .
Meanwhile , Real Networks comes off as a type of neutral player that also has its problems by not being promoted on the iPod and by relying more on a music rental service than a booming per song shop like iTunes .
Now , you can add Google DRM and Google Video to this mess .
We might be less nervous about Google 's DRM revelation if it provided more information on the technology .
Page refused to say anything beyond the two sentences above , and played off the whole DRM thing as no big deal .
We also can't locate much of anything about Google DRM on the company 's corporate web site or fantastic blogs .
Perhaps your Googling skills are better than ours , and we welcome aid .
Is Google DRM simply a mechanism for protecting the videos of its partners and making sure they get paid for their content ?
Or is it much broader than that ?
How will it work with Microsoft's DRM , Apple 's DRM and Real 's DRM ?
Will it extend to music ?
If so , what will the limitations be on how often you can copy songs or how many devices can store the tunes ?
Google says that one of its corporate goals is to " do no evil . "
Has n't it just crapped all over that objective by entering the race to weigh down our culture with cement bricks ?
That last query may be over - dramatic .
But , then again , it might not be .
Google has a long history of keeping its technology mechanisms and intentions private .
It wo n't say a lot about how Page Rank works .
It 's never provided a policy on how it picks Google News stories .
Heck , it wo n't even let Register reporters visit the company 's campus , and one of our staff lives right down the street .
Having one of the world 's largest and currently most powerful IT companies announce that it has constructed a new DRM system and then not reveal a single detail about the technology is just plain unacceptable .
Many of you – who have become obsessed with the god you call Googlor – will no doubt suck down Google 's DRM with pride .
Hopefully , some of you will be more careful and force the company to answer a few questions first .
CBS might make the TV shows , but we all share the culture . ®
An MIT researcher has a vision : Four hundred huge offshore wind turbines are providing onshore customers with enough electricity to power several hundred thousand homes , and nobody standing onshore can see them .
The trick ?
The wind turbines are floating on platforms a hundred miles out to sea , where the winds are strong and steady .
Today 's offshore wind turbines usually stand on towers driven deep into the ocean floor .
But that arrangement works only in water depths of about 15 meters or less .
Proposed installations are therefore typically close enough to shore to arouse strong public opposition .
Paul D. Sclavounos , a professor of mechanical engineering and naval architecture , has spent decades designing and analyzing large floating structures for deep - sea oil and gas exploration .
Observing the wind - farm controversies , he thought , " Wait a minute .
Why can't we simply take those windmills and put them on floaters and move them farther offshore , where there 's plenty of space and lots of wind ? "
In 2004 , he and his MIT colleagues teamed up with wind - turbine experts from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL ) to integrate a wind turbine with a floater .
Their design calls for a tension leg platform ( TLP ) , a system in which long steel cables , or " tethers , " connect the corners of the platform to a concrete - block or other mooring system on the ocean floor .
The platform and turbine are thus supported not by an expensive tower but by buoyancy .
" And you do n't pay anything to be buoyant , " said Sclavounos .
According to their analyses , the floater - mounted turbines could work in water depths ranging from 30 to 200 meters .
In the Northeast , for example , they could be 50 to 150 kilometers from shore .
And the turbine atop each platform could be big -- an economic advantage in the wind - farm business .
The MIT - NREL design assumes a 5.0 megawatt ( MW ) experimental turbine now being developed by industry .
( Onshore units are 1.5 MW , conventional offshore units , 3.6 MW . )
Stable enough for towing
Ocean assembly of the floating turbines would be prohibitively expensive because of their size : the wind tower is fully 90 meters tall , the rotors about 140 meters in diameter .
So the researchers designed them to be assembled onshore -- probably at a shipyard -- and towed out to sea by a tugboat .
To keep each platform stable , cylinders inside it are ballasted with concrete and water .
Once on site , the platform is hooked to previously installed tethers .
Water is pumped out of the cylinders until the entire assembly lifts up in the water , pulling the tethers taut .
The tethers allow the floating platforms to move from side to side but not up and down - - a remarkably stable arrangement .
According to computer simulations , in hurricane conditions the floating platforms -- each about 30 meters in diameter -- would shift by one to two meters , and the bottom of the turbine blades would remain well above the peak of even the highest wave .
The researchers are hoping to reduce the sideways motion still further by installing specially designed dampers similar to those used to steady the sway of skyscrapers during high winds and earthquakes .
Sclavounos estimates that building and installing his floating support system should cost a third as much as constructing the type of truss tower now planned for deep - water installations .
Installing the tethers , the electrical system , and the cable to the shore is standard procedure .
Because of the strong offshore winds , the floating turbines should produce up to twice as much electricity per year ( per installed megawatt ) as wind turbines now in operation .
And because the wind turbines are not permanently attached to the ocean floor , they are a movable asset .
If a company with 400 wind turbines serving the Boston area needs more power for New York City , it can unhook some of the floating turbines and tow them south .
Encouraged by positive responses from wind , electric power , and oil companies , Sclavounos hopes to install a half - scale prototype south of Cape Cod .
" We 'd have a little unit sitting out there and ï¿½ï¿½ï¿ ½could show that this thing can float and behave the way we 're saying it will , " he said .
" That 's clearly the way to get going . "
This research was supported by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory .

Siberia feels the heat
It 's a frozen peat bog the size of France and Germany combined , contains billions of tonnes of greenhouse gas and , for the first time since the ice age , it is melting
A vast expanse of western Sibera is undergoing an unprecedented thaw that could dramatically increase the rate of global warming , climate scientists warn today .
Researchers who have recently returned from the region found that an area of permafrost spanning a million square kilometres - the size of France and Germany combined - has started to melt for the first time since it formed 11,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age .
The area , which covers the entire sub-Arctic region of western Siberia , is the world 's largest frozen peat bog and scientists fear that as it thaws , it will release billions of tonnes of methane , a greenhouse gas 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide , into the atmosphere .
It is a scenario climate scientists have feared since first identifying " tipping points " - delicate thresholds where a slight rise in the Earth 's temperature can cause a dramatic change in the environment that itself triggers a far greater increase in global temperatures .
The discovery was made by Sergei Kirpotin at Tomsk State University in western Siberia and Judith Marquand at Oxford University and is reported in New Scientist today .
The researchers found that what was until recently a barren expanse of frozen peat is turning into a broken landscape of mud and lakes , some more than a kilometre across .
Dr Kirpotin told the magazine the situation was an " ecological landslide that is probably irreversible and is undoubtedly connected to climatic warming " .
He added that the thaw had probably begun in the past three or four years .
Climate scientists yesterday reacted with alarm to the finding , and warned that predictions of future global temperatures would have to be revised upwards .
" When you start messing around with these natural systems , you can end up in situations where it 's unstoppable .
There are no brakes you can apply , " said David Viner , a senior scientist at the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia .
" This is a big deal because you can't put the permafrost back once it 's gone .
The causal effect is human activity and it will ramp up temperatures even more than our emissions are doing . "
In its last major report in 2001 , the intergovernmental panel on climate change predicted a rise in global temperatures of 1.4C - 5.8C between 1990 and 2100 , but the estimate only takes account of global warming driven by known greenhouse gas emissions .
" These positive feedbacks with landmasses were n't known about then .
They had no idea how much they would add to global warming , " said Dr Viner .
Western Siberia is heating up faster than anywhere else in the world , having experienced a rise of some 3C in the past 40 years .
Scientists are particularly concerned about the permafrost , because as it thaws , it reveals bare ground which warms up more quickly than ice and snow , and so accelerates the rate at which the permafrost thaws .
Siberia 's peat bogs have been producing methane since they formed at the end of the last ice age , but most of the gas had been trapped in the permafrost .
According to Larry Smith , a hydrologist at the University of California , Los Angeles , the west Siberian peat bog could hold some 70bn tonnes of methane , a quarter of all of the methane stored in the ground around the world .
The permafrost is likely to take many decades at least to thaw , so the methane locked within it will not be released into the atmosphere in one burst , said Stephen Sitch , a climate scientist at the Met Office 's Hadley Centre in Exeter .
But calculations by Dr Sitch and his colleagues show that even if methane seeped from the permafrost over the next 100 years , it would add around 700 m tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere each year , roughly the same amount that is released annually from the world 's wetlands and agriculture .
It would effectively double atmospheric levels of the gas , leading to a 10 % to 25 % increase in global warming , he said .
Tony Juniper , director of Friends of the Earth , said the finding was a stark message to politicians to take concerted action on climate change .
" We knew at some point we'd get these feedbacks happening that exacerbate global warming , but this could lead to a massive injection of greenhouse gases .
" If we do n't take action very soon , we could unleash runaway global warming that will be beyond our control and it will lead to social , economic and environmental devastation worldwide , " he said .
" There 's still time to take action , but not much .
" The assumption has been that we would n't see these kinds of changes until the world is a little warmer , but this suggests we 're running out of time . "
In May this year , another group of researchers reported signs that global warming was damaging the permafrost .
Katey Walter of the University of Alaska , Fairbanks , told a meeting of the Arctic Research Consortium of the US that her team had found methane hotspots in eastern Siberia .
At the hotspots , methane was bubbling to the surface of the permafrost so quickly that it was preventing the surface from freezing over .
Last month , some of the world 's worst air polluters , including the US and Australia , announced a partnership to cut greenhouse gas emissions through the use of new technologies .
The deal came after Tony Blair struggled at the G8 summit to get the US president , George Bush , to commit to any concerted action on climate change and has been heavily criticised for setting no targets for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions .

Do n’t blame me for the fact that competent programming , as I view it as an intellectual possibility , will be too difficult for ‘ the average programmer ’ , you must not fall into the trap of rejecting a surgical technique because it is beyond the capabilities of the barber in his shop around the corner .
Programming something even half decent requires considerable intellectual ability .
That ’s not all there is to it , but if you ’re not smart , it will be much harder for you to be a decent programmer .
We ’re mostly in denial about this and would like to believe that programming can be done by anyone or can be made somehow unnecessary .
It ’s the opposite view we take to managerial or executive ability , where we pay through the node for talent .
Yet it ’s been known since we started building software that some programmers are much better than others .
Maybe all disciplines are like this , but it is very obvious in programming .
Naturally this intelligence makes people who do n't have it uncomfortable , particularly if that person is supposed to lead or organize very smart people to do something that they do n't fully understand , even though that person is probably better paid , more socially equipped and has nothing to worry about .
As with meat - markets this is not something we like to talk about a lot .
It ’s not egalitarian and intelligence is something we ’re sensitive about culturally .
But consider that it ’s not controversial to say being a good musician or athlete requires a level of ability , some of which is innate .
Or that our educational systems are based around being ranked smarter than the next person anyway .
So we should get over ourselves a bit and accept the fact the good software requires more than stringent process ; it requires well - above average intelligence to create it .
The statements that make people mad are the ones they worry might be believed .
I suspect the statements that make people maddest are those they worry might be true .
Addendum
I have recieved a few emails and comments suggesting that anyone can become a good programmer with sweat and dedication .
Here 're my personal feelings :
anyone
even better
If you found this interesting , you may want to read
I do n't believe thatcan become a good programmer with dedication , practice , and experience .
In case you have n't guessed from the third quote above , my interest is not in whether there is an innate talent involved with programming , but in people 's state of denial .
Let 's look at what it means to improve and to be good .
I suppose there 's some room for argument about whether almost any infant or toddler , if exposed to the right stimuli , can become a good programmer .
Our knowledge of genetics and early brain development is primitive .
However , by the time people reach their teen years , I believe that much of their potential has been established .
With dedication and practice , people can improve almost anything , however in most fields this improvement shows diminishing returns .
It may be aymptotic , so in theory they may eventually become a good programmer or a chess master , but in practice this may take longer than the number of productive years available .
With respect to everyone who has emailed to say that anyone can be a great programmer , how many of you play Bridge or Chess ?
These are fields where no serious practitioner believes that round the clock study and fanatic devotion will take you to the top : winning requires both potential and the will to fulfill that potential .
Likewise , how many of you who write or email play a musical instrument and especially compose music ?
Many people have fanatic devotion to practice , yet every generation yields remarkably few geniuses that will stand the test of time .
Why do people consider fields like Bridge , Chess , Athletics , and Music different from programming ?
I think the salient distinction is that we habitually consider games like Bridge , Chess and Athletics very competetive .
And if you 're paying close attention , we consider Classical Music and Jazz equally competitive , if not more so ( where do you think we got the word " Diva " ? ) .
When something is competitive , it 's irrelevant how good you can become through practice .
If someone else can becomewith the same amount of practice , you will be unable to surpass them .
Of course , you can still surpass those that do n't study , practice , or learn from their mistakes .
That 's important .
But if the field is desirable enough that there are a significant number of innately talented people willing to study , practice , and learn , then only those with innate talent will occupy the top spots .
I believe that if programming jobs were more demanding and that if the industry were more competitive , we would rapidly lose all pretensions to egalitarianism .
But what do I know ?

From Molyneux to a new view -- a functioning ecosystem in SL
In the beginning , Linden Lab created the heavens and the earth , but the sky was empty and the land was barren .
The trees were green but did not grow , the sun and wind passed overhead but did not affect them .
Then Laukosargas Svarog came upon this and said , Come , let us make clouds so that they can be borne upon the wind .
She did , and it was good .
Then Laukosargas said ,
Let these clouds cast rain upon the ground , and where the land is marshy , let marshy flowers bloom , and where the land is open , let open flowers bloom .
And let the sun shine upon these , and where the sun shines brightest , let them grow more , and where it shines least , let them lay fallow .
This she also did , and it was good .
Seeing this , Laukosargas said ,
Let bees fly amongst these flowers to pass their seed between each other , and thus be fruitful and multiply .
Then she said , Let there be birds to feast upon the seeds , lest these flowers be too fruitful and multiplicitous .
This she did as well , and it was likewise good .
Then her computer crashed .
And that was not so good .
" My main machine has blown up ! " Laukosargas announced shortly after giving me a tour of the miniature world she created .
And since her replacement computer was too slow to meaningfully interact in Second Life , the goddess had to put her creation on pause for awhile .
The result of a year 's work , Laukosargas Svarog 's island of Svarga ( direct portal here ) is a fully - functioning ecosystem , adding life or something like it to the verdant - looking but arid pallette Linden Lab offers with its world .
It begins with her artificial clouds , which are pushed along by Linden 's internal wind system .
" If I was to turn off the clouds the whole system would die in about six hours , " she tells me .
" Turn off the bees and [ the plants stop ] growing , because nothing gets pollinated .
And it 's the transfer of pollen that signals the plants to drop seeds .
The seeds blow in the wind , and if they land on good ground according to different rules for each species , they grow when they receive rain water from the clouds .
It 's all interdependent . "
Looking more like an African princess than a deity , Laukosargas and one of her angels met me by a small campfire site in Svarga , and explained some of the inner workings of her world , and what drove her to create it .
One of the peculiarities of software development is how rapidly knowledge becomes obsolete .
Dan Appleman cited a parable from Lewis Carroll 's Through the Looking Glass which illustrates this wonderfully :
The Queen propped her up against a tree , and said kindly , ' You may rest a little now . '
Alice looked round her in great surprise .
' Why , I do believe we 've been under this tree the whole time !
Everything 's just as it was !'
' Of course it is , ' said the Queen , ' what would you have it ? '
' Well , in our country , ' said Alice , still panting a little , ' you 'd generally get to somewhere else -- if you ran very fast for a long time , as we 've been doing . '
' A slow sort of country ! ' said the Queen .
` Now , here , you see , it takes all the running you can do , to keep in the same place .
If you want to get somewhere else , you must run at least twice as fast as that !'
DNA – the long , thin molecule that carries our hereditary material – is compressed around protein scaffolding in the cell nucleus into tiny spheres called nucleosomes .
The bead - like nucleosomes are strung along the entire chromosome , which is itself folded and packaged to fit into the nucleus .
What determines how , when and where a nucleosome will be positioned along the DNA sequence ?
Dr. Eran Segal and research student Yair Field of the Computer Science and Applied Mathematics Department at the Weizmann Institute of Science have succeeded , together with colleagues from Northwestern University in Chicago , in cracking the genetic code that sets the rules for where on the DNA strand the nucleosomes will be situated .
Their findings appeared today in Nature .
The precise location of the nucleosomes along the DNA is known to play an important role in the cell ’s day to day function , since access to DNA wrapped in a nucleosome is blocked for many proteins , including those responsible for some of life ’s most basic processes .
Among these barred proteins are factors that initiate DNA replication , transcription ( the transfer of genetic information from DNA to RNA ) and DNA repair .
Thus , the positioning of nucleosomes defines the segments in which these processes can and ca n’t take place .
These limitations are considerable : Most of the DNA is packaged into nucleosomes .
A single nucleosome contains about 150 genetic bases ( the “ letters ” that make up a genetic sequence ) , while the free area between neighboring nucleosomes is only about 20 bases long .
It is in these nucleosome - free regions that processes such as transcription can be initiated .
For many years , scientists have been unable to agree whether the placement of nucleosomes in live cells is controlled by the genetic sequence itself .
Segal and his colleagues managed to prove that the DNA sequence indeed encodes “ zoning ” information on where to place nucleosomes .
They also characterized this code and then , using the DNA sequence alone , were able to accurately predict a large number of nucleosome positions in yeast cells .
Segal and his colleagues accomplished this by examining around 200 different nucleosome sites on the DNA and asking whether their sequences have something in common .
Mathematical analysis revealed similarities between the nucleosome - bound sequences and eventually uncovered a specific “ code word . ”
This “ code word ” consists of a periodic signal that appears every 10 bases on the sequence .
The regular repetition of this signal helps the DNA segment to bend sharply into the spherical shape required to form a nucleosome .
To identify this nucleosome positioning code , the research team used probabilistic models to characterize the sequences bound by nucleosomes , and they then developed a computer algorithm to predict the encoded organization of nucleosomes along an entire chromosome .
The team ’s findings provided insight into another mystery that has long been puzzling molecular biologists :
How do cells direct transcription factors to their intended sites on the DNA , as opposed to the many similar but functionally irrelevant sites along the genomic sequence ?
The short binding sites themselves do not contain enough information for the transcription factors to discern between them .
The scientists showed that basic information on the functional relevance of a binding site is at least partially encoded in the nucleosome positioning code :
The intended sites are found in nucleosome - free segments , thereby allowing them to be accessed by the various transcription factors .
In contrast , spurious binding sites with identical structures that could potentially sidetrack transcription factors are conveniently situated in segments that form nucleosomes , and are thus mostly inaccessible .
Since the proteins that form the core of the nucleosome are among the most evolutionarily conserved in nature , the scientists believe the genetic code they identified should also be conserved in many organisms , including humans .
Several diseases , such as cancer , are typically accompanied or caused by mutations in the DNA and the way it organizes into chromosomes .
Such mutational processes may be influenced by the relative accessibility of the DNA to various proteins and by the organization of the DNA in the cell nucleus .
Therefore , the scientists believe that the nucleosome positioning code they discovered may aid scientists in the future in understanding the mechanisms underlying many diseases .

There are a lot of gross candies in this world .
A lot .
I did n’t realize the level of grossness that candy has sunk to .
We at Candy Addict decided to compile a list of the Top 10 grossest candy we could find .
We searched high and low for gross candy and came up with a long list .
We then each ranked the grossness of each and compiled our results to bring you the Top 10 .
These are n’t gross flavors of candy ( like black licorice or peach ) , but gross in their appearance or what they are trying to represent / simulate .
Gummi worms and snakes may have frightened the kids of yesteryear , but today ’s kids get some serious grossness from things like candy poop , vomit , snot , bugs , and ear wax .
There is no doubt that your Top 10 list of gross candy would be different than ours .
You may think bugs are grosser than snot or ear wax .
We may not .
It was interesting just to see the differences in how the three of us at Candy Addict ranked the candy .
For reference , we ’ll provide a links page at the end so you can buy any of the items we mention – just in case you really want to .
So , enough with the introduction , let ’s get to the Top 10 Grossest Candies .
Grossest Candy # 10 – White Chocolate Maggots
Why are these so gross ?
I think it ’s because they are white and therefore actually look like maggots – and maggots are gross .
Really gross .
I get the willies just thinking about maggots and the rotting flesh / garbage / food they go along with .
Plus , these are made of white chocolate , which is gross too .
Grossest Candy # 9 – Hose Nose
This is a candy dispenser that looks like a nose that you strap to your face .
It oozes candy slime and they encourage you to stick out your tongue and catch the drips from the nose .
Some of the slogans : “ It ’s not what you think ” , “ candy slime filled ” , “ drippy ” , and “ catch it on your tongue ” .
Yes , snot is gross and this candy encourages you to eat candy snot .
Grossest Candy # 8 – Sour Flush Candy
The candy in this is nothing special – it ’s powdered candy ( like Pixy Stix ) and a lollipop .
It ’s all about the presentation though .
The powdered candy comes in a realistic plastic toilet and the lollipop is flat on the end so it looks like a toilet plunger .
Lick the plunger then dip it into the toilet to get some candy on it .
Yum !

Taiwan says its copy of Tamiflu is cheaper and quicker to produce
Taiwan officials said they had applied for the right to copy the drug - but the priority was to protect the public .
Tamiflu , made by Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche , cannot cure bird - flu but is widely seen as the best anti-viral drug to fight it , correspondents say .
Bird flu has killed at least 60 people in Asia since December 2003 .
Scientists fear the lethal H5N1 strain of the virus could combine with human flu or mutate into a form that is easily transmissible between humans , triggering a flu pandemic .
Several countries have asked Roche for the right to make generic copies of Tamiflu .
' Cheaper , faster production '
Taiwan will produce six kg of its version of Tamiflu - enough , according to the government , to renew its stocks .
The government has said it will not market the drug commercially .
H5N1 BIRD FLU VIRUS
Principally an avian disease , first seen in humans in Hong Kong , 1997 Almost all human cases thought to be contracted from birds Isolated cases of human - to - human transmission in Hong Kong and Vietnam , but none confirmed
Q&A : Avian flu
Production of the drug on a small scale has already started .
A top health official said Taiwan had demonstrated its goodwill to Roche in talks - and the country hoped it would eventually secure permission to copy the drug .
" We have tried our best to negotiate with Roche , " Su Ih - jen told Reuters news agency .
" It means we have shown our goodwill to Roche and we appreciate their patent .
But to protect our people is the utmost important thing , " he said .
A generic version of the drug produced by the island 's National Health Institute is said to be 99 % akin to the Tamiflu produced by Roche .
Officials say they can make their version of the drug more quickly - and at a lower cost - than Roche does .
Although Taiwan has not had a serious outbreak , the virus has killed thousands of poultry - and scores of people who came into contact with the birds - in nearby countries .
It has also now spread to Europe , with the latest possible case reported in an imported parrot in the UK .
Random Numbers
A sequence of pseudo random numbers can be generated by a computer algorithm , such as the Linear Congruential Method .
Such sequences are not random , since each number is completely determined from a set of numerical seeds .
The sequences " appear " to be random , however , and are useful in calculations and simulations .
The following Java applet demonstrates random number generation with the Linear Congruential Method .
You can change the multiplier ( a ) , modulus ( m ) , and the initial seed ( I ) .
The algorithm produces random numbers between 0 and 1 .
You can see the distribution of 5000 random numbers develop as they are produced , by pressing the Run button .
You may also choose from three ways to show the random number distributions :
1D : shows the frequency distribution of all random numbers as a histogram divided into 20 bins from 0 to 1 .
2D : pairs of random numbers are used to define the coordinates of points in a plane .
3D : groups of three random numbers are used to specify the coordinates of points in 3 dimensional space .
By dragging the mouse on the picture you can rotate your viewpoint .
Dragging the mouse while holding down the shift key allows you to zoom in and out .
The initial choices of multiplier and modulus are that of the RANDU generator , distributed by IBM in the 1960's .
Only after it was widely distributed was it noticed to have a serious problem when generating 3 dimensional points .
See if you can see the Marsaglia effect in the 3D view , by rotating your viewpoint .
Better behaviour results with a different multiplier , such as 69069 .

HOW TO READ A DIFFICULT BOOK Traveling around the country I find that more and more people have an urge to pry into such difficult subjects as science , philosophy , religion , economics and political theory .
More often than not , however , this urge soon dries up .
People find that the book which they open with high hopes of enlightenment turns out to be beyond their grasp .
Actually , any book intended for the general reader can be understood if you approach it in the right way .
What is the right approach ?
The answer lies in one important rule of reading .
You should read a book through superficially before you try to master it .
Look first for the things you can understand and refuse to get bogged down in the difficult passages .
Read right on past paragraphs , footnotes , arguments and references that escape you .
there will be enough material which you can immediately grasp ... even if it is only 50 percent or less - that will enable you to understand the book in part .
A variation on the method of giving a book a first superficial reading is the technique of skimming .
You will never get from skimming what reading and study can give you , but it is a very practical way of dealing with the mass of books available to you .
By skimming you can get , often with surprising accuracy , a general sense of the contents of a book .
For skimming or reading , the following steps are a good way to begin giving a book the once - over .
Look at the title page and preface and note especially the sub - titles or other indications of the scope and aim of the book or the author 's special angle .
Study the table of contents to get a general sense of the book 's structure ; use it as you would a road map before taking a trip .
Check the index for the range of subjects covered or the kinds of authors quoted .
When you see terms listed that seem crucial , look up the passage .
You may find the key to the author 's approach .
Now you are ready to read the book or skim through it , as you choose .
If you vote to skim it , look at the chapters which contain pivotal passages or summary statements in their opening or closing pages .
Then dip into a page here and there , reading a paragraph or two , sometimes several pages in a sequence .
Thumb through the book in this way , always looking for the basic pulse beat of the matter .
One word of warning :
If you use this approach and start to skim through a book , you may end up discovering that you are n't skimming it at all .
You are reading it , understanding it and enjoying it .
When you put the book down , it will be with the realization that the subject was n't such a tough one after all .

EXPERIMENTAL WEATHER MODIFICATION BILL FAST TRACKING FOR PASSAGE IN U.S. SENATE & HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
U.S. Senate Bill 517 and U.S. House Bill 2995 , a bill that would allow experimental weather modification by artificial methods and implement a national weather modification policy , does not include agriculture or public oversight , is on the “ fast track ” to be passed in 2006 .
This bill is designed to implement experimental weather modification .
The appointed Board of Directors established by this bill does not include any agricultural , water , EPA , or public representatives , and has no provisions for Congressional , State , County , or public oversight of their actions or expenditures .
Weather Modification may adversely impact agricultural crops and water supplies .
If the weather is changed in one state , region or county it may have severe consequences in another region , state or county .
And who is going to decide the type of weather modification experimentation and who it will benefit or adversely impact ?
This experimental weather modification bill will impact residents across the United States not just in California .
Many current and ongoing weather modification programs ( 80 listed by NOAA in 2005 ) , including the one in Wyoming that is designed to increase the snowpack , may be diverting rainwater away from Oklahoma and Texas , two states that are currently fighting fires caused by a lack of rainfall .
We have no idea what the unintended consequences of the Wyoming action or other experimental weather modification programs might be now or in the future .
In addition to the experimental weather modification programs listed by NOAA , there are both private and ongoing government sponsored atmospheric testing and heating programs underway in Alaska and across the United States .
Alaska Senator Stevens recently received $ 50 million in funding for Alaska ’s atmospheric heating program .
All of these unregulated , private , government , and public weather modification programs , may also have unintended synergistic effects .
Senate Bill 517 does not address these issues but intends to implement more experimental weather modification programs without a national debate or public oversight .
Artificial weather modification can impact all of us by reducing water supplies , changing agricultural crop production cycles , reducing crop production , and water availability .
Since most experimental weather modification programs use chemicals released into the atmosphere the public could be subjected increasingly toxic or unknown substances that could adversely impact agricultural crops and trees .
Trimethyl Aluminum ( TMA ) and barium are just two of the toxic chemicals used in recent atmospheric heating and testing programs according to NASA .
The Alaska H.A.A.R.P. atmospheric heating program may have the capability of changing the Jet Stream which could also change our weather .
Many private weather modification companies admit that precipitation effects may be positive or negative .
Fog dispersal programs , using dry ice , liquid nitrogen , liquid propane or silver iodide may improve visibility while adversely impacting Redwood Trees along the California coast by depriving them of needed water they derive from the fog .
The increasing use of varied chemicals like aluminum ( coupled with increasing air pollution ) , can severely impact tree health by depriving trees of water and nutrients normally absorbed through their root systems .
The December 2005 Popular Science Magazine discussed a plan to use an oil slick to stop hurricanes without noting the adverse environmental impacts of the oil used to cover the ocean .
Popular Science also noted that a private company , Dyn- O - Mat , plans to purchase jets to drop thousands of pounds of a water absorbing chemical powder ( unknown substance ) , into hurricanes to absorb moisture that may dissipate hurricanes .
There is no agriculture oversight or public hearings to determine the consequences of this and other actions or to monitor or prevent adverse impacts of this chemical once it falls on the surface of the ocean or on land .
Alaska and other areas across the United States are beginning to feel the impacts of climate change .
Enormous changes are being seen in the declining health of native plant and tree communities in many areas across the United States .
NASA noted in an October 2005 newsletter that increasingly persistent contrails are “ … trapping warmth in the atmosphere and exacerbating global warming … ” NASA goes on to note that : “ … Any increase in global cloud cover will contribute to long - term changes in Earth ’s climate .
Likewise , any change in Earth ’s climate may have effects on natural resources … ”
Global dimming and the persistent contrails , that produce man-made clouds , may have serious impacts on crop production .
A recent corn crop study in Illinois shows that cloud cover reduces corn crop production while direct sunlight increases production .
In addition , increasing man-made clouds may reduce the effectiveness of solar panels .
Gil Smolin , an Avian Bird Flu expert , noted on the Ron Owens Show on KGO Radio ( January 5 , 2006 ) , that the flu was spread more quickly in the winter when there was a “ lack of sunlight ” .
Would man-made clouds be contributing to the lack of sunlight which might cause the Avian Bird flu to spread more quickly at other times of the year ?
Experimental weather modification programs could also exacerbate this problem by changing climate patterns , increasing man-made cloud cover , and changing our weather and climate patterns .
Senate Bill 517 does not address any of these important issues .
Its sole purpose is to establish an experimental weather modification policy without any agriculture or public oversight of private , military , and government programs .
Without oversight or public hearings agriculture , our natural resources , and watersheds may be negatively impacted .
And who will be responsible to determine the synergistic effects of these programs or pay for unintended disasters created by this experimentation .
If these programs change growing seasons and interrupt the pollination process crop losses could be substantial exacerbating economic losses .
Please contact all of your elected local , state and federal officials to stop this bill in its present form .
This bill needs to have appropriate agriculture and public oversight , with public hearings included , prior to any more experimental projects .
We need a national dialogue on this subject before more experimentation takes place .

In 1995 , she became a certified U.S.D.A. Farm Service Agency Crop Loss Adjustor working in more than ten counties throughout California .
Many crop losses throughout the State can be attributed to weather related causes .
Rosalind has a BA degree from Sonoma State University in Environmental Studies & Planning ( ENSP ) , with emphasis on agriculture and crop production .
Rosalind Peterson was born and raised on a working farm in Redwood Valley , California .
The weather was the foremost factor in determining whether or not our tree crops produced fruit and nuts .
Between 1989 and 1993 Rosalind worked as an Agricultural Technologist for the Mendocino County Department of Agriculture .
After leaving Mendocino County she took a position with the USDA Farm Service Agency as a Program Assistant in Mendocino , Sonoma , and the Salinas County Offices .
The first successful protest rally against U.S. Senate Bill 517 was held in Los Angeles , California on March 23 , 2006 .
The second successful educational forum and demonstration rally opposing U.S. Senate Bill 517 was held in Phoenix , Arizona on Saturday , April 29 , 2006 .
The Agriculture Defense Coalition is now moving their message east across the United States toward Washington , D.C .
Concerned grassroots citizens are involved in this educational protest movement to protect agriculture from unwise experimental weather modification programs .
“ We , the people , simply will not accept this reckless experimenting on our weather and are fighting the passage of this bill in order to protect agricultural crop production and our water supplies . ”
“ Science ” has many meanings , but one common meaning is “ the scientific method ” which is a principled method for investigating the world using the following steps :
Form a hypothesis about the world .
Use the hypothesis to make predictions .
Run experiments to confirm or disprove the predictions .
The ordering of these steps is very important to the scientific method .
In particular , predictions must be made before experiments are run .
Given that we all believe in the scientific method of investigation , it may be surprising to learn that cheating is very common .
This happens for many reasons , some innocent and some not .
Drug studies .
Pharmaceutical companies make predictions about the effects of their drugs and then conduct blind clinical studies to determine their effect .
Unfortunately , they have also been caught using some of the more advanced techniques for cheating here : including “ reprobleming ” , “ data set selection ” , and probably “ overfitting by review ” .
It is n’t too surprising to observe this : when the testers of a drug have $ 109 or more riding on the outcome the temptation to make the outcome “ right ” is extreme .
Wrong experiments .
When conducting experiments of some new phenomena , it is common for the experimental apparatus to simply not work right .
In that setting , throwing out the “ bad data ” can make the results much cleaner … or it can simply be cheating .
Millikan did this in the ‘ oil drop ’ experiment which measured the electron charge .
Done right , allowing some kinds of “ cheating ” may be helpful to the progress of science since we can more quickly find the truth about the world .
Done wrong , it results in modern nightmares like painkillers that cause heart attacks .
( Of course , the more common outcome is that the drugs effectiveness is just overstated . )
A basic question is “ How do you do it right ? ”
And a basic answer is “ With prediction theory bounds ” .
Each prediction bound has a number of things in common :
They assume that the data is independently and identically drawn .
This is well suited to experimental situations where experimenters work very hard to make different experiments be independent .
In fact , this is a better fit than typical machine learning applications where independence of the data is typically more questionable or simply false .
They make no assumption about the distribution that the data is drawn from .
This is important for experimental testing of predictions because the distribution that observations are expected to come from is a part of the theory under test .
These two properties above form an ‘ equivalence class ’ over different mathematical bounds where each bound can be trusted to an equivalent degree .
Inside of this equivalent class there are several that may be helpful in determining whether deviations from the scientific method are reasonable or not .
The most basic test set bound corresponds to the scientific method above .
The Occam ’s Razor bound allows a careful reordering of steps ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and step ( 3 ) .
More “ interesting ” bounds like the VC - bound and the PAC - Bayes bound allow more radical alterations of these steps .
Several are discussed here .
The Sample Compression bound allows careful disposal of some datapoints .
Progressive Validation bounds ( such as here , here or here ) allow hypotheses to be safely reformulated in arbitrary ways as experiments progress .
Scientific experimenters looking for a little extra flexibility in the scientific method may find these approaches useful .
( And if they do n’t , maybe there is another bound in this equivalence class that needs to be worked out . )
" Using Statistics to Cause Spammers Pain "
Update September 5 , 2006 : I was surprised to see this article come up on : I was surprised to see this article come up on reddit today .
It seems it has been rediscovered , and my failure to put a date on this article ( since corrected ) made it look new .
This was written in 2003 and I presented the idea and my experiences with it at the 2004 Spam Conference .
The project itself is no longer active .
The spam environment has changed significantly since 2003 , strengthening arguments against this approach .
Still , it 's a fun idea that might work . :)
Thanks for your interest .
- Marty Ever since Paul Graham published " A Plan for Spam " in August 2002 ( prerequisite reading for this article ) , a lot of people have spent a great deal of time applying statistical methods to automatically classify email messages as spam .
Generally , spam identification is a hard problem to solve given that the definition of spam can differ from person to person .
Messages erroneously classified as spam , known as " false positives , " are pretty much intolerable , which further compounds the problem .
Statisitical classifiers show great promise in this area as they are able to automatically adjust to handle personal definitions of spam .
The odd false positive shows up from time to time , but these become few and far between as the local statistical model continues to improve .
These classifiers already come in many forms .
There are POP3 proxies , IMAP proxies , mail file processors , and even classifiers built directly into mail clients .
I use POPFile ( a naïve Bayesian classifier in a POP3 proxy ) at home with great success .
Some work better than others , but with a little training , they all seem to work pretty well .
Unfortunately , they have a common shortcoming :
They do n't cause the spammers any pain .
And we all want to cause spammers pain .
None of these classifiers are capable of causing the spammers any pain because the spammer is long gone by the time the classifier has the opportunity to process the message .
What we need is a way to use the classifier against the spammer while the spammer is still connected .
All the classifiers I 've seen operate on one message at a time .
In essence , an e-mail message goes into the classifier after it has been received by the mail server , and a " spamminess " indicator ( a number between 0 and 1 representing the probability that the message is spam ) is returned .
I suggest that , with some modification , these holistic classifiers could be converted into incremental classifiers - enabling some pretty neat stuff .
An email message would be fed to the incremental classifier one piece ( or token ) at a time .
After analyzing each piece , the classifier would respond with a classification of the message so far , providing a running probability that the message is spam .
Now imagine that your SMTP server has been provided with an incremental classifier .
You now have a real - time indicator that a message is likely spam _while the spammer is connected_ .
The Idea Now we have moved identification of spam to the time of its receipt .
But how can the SMTP server best use this knowledge ?
I propose that the running probability from the classifier be used to throttle the connection with the offending server .
If an incoming message looks like spam [ 1 ] , the connection could be slowed dramatically , consuming the spammer 's resources and wasting their time [ 2 ] .
This would transform the server into a sort of dynamic tarpit , in which the spamminess of the incoming message affects the viscosity of the tar [ 3 ] .
As the spam probability goes up , the socket speed goes down [ 4 ] ...
If enough of these dynamic tarpits were in place ( or just a handful were placed in the right places ) , the spammers ' mail software would bog down , reducing the rate at which they can send messages , in turn reducing the fees they can charge their customers .
If these tarpits were ubiquitous , they could completely change the economics of spam , creating a scarcity of bandwidth experienced only by spammers .
Ouch . :)
Early detection of incoming spam could be used to create an artificial scarcity of bandwidth experienced only by spammers .
Of course , this does n't eliminate the problem presented by careless or uninformed sysadmins who provide open relays ; spammers going through open relays would n't feel a thing .
But the sysadmins that provide those services certainly would .
It is n't too far - fetched to imagine that they might start to notice the effect on their server when all of its outbound SMTP connections are slowed to a crawl .
TarProxy
So now I 'm implementing such a tarpit as an SMTP proxy , dubbed " TarProxy . "
As a proxy , it wo n't require anyone to replace their mail server .
My goals for TarProxy are that it must be : Free :
It 's no good unless it 's everywhere ... or at least in lots of places .
TarProxy is Open Source Software released under a BSD - style license and available on SourceForge ( see project page for details ) .
Platform Independent : TarProxy is written in Java , so it runs on Linux , Windows , Solaris , OS X , and any other operating system with a Java Virtual Machine available .
Pluggable : there 's still a lot of experimentation taking place to determine what statistical functions and token extraction algorithms are most effective .
It would be foolish to commit to any single one in TarProxy ; indeed , the more such algorithms exist , the harder it will be for spammers to adapt .
The classifier and tokenizer are therefore separate pluggable modules .
Special adapter modules are available to communicate with existing classifiers that are not written in Java .
Even More Pluggable : more experimentation will be necessary to determine what kind of throttling behavior is appropriate ; in a nutshell , given a spam probability , how fast should the mail be accepted ?
The throttle is also a pluggable module .
Even More Even More Pluggable : Because it is the connection that is tarpitted , and not an individual message , different strategies will be tested to assign a spamminess value to connections .
Some possible strategies are : average spamminess / message , spamminess / byte , spamminess of current message only .
These are also implemented as pluggable modules .
Tolerant of False Positives : TarProxy by default never prevents legitimate mail from being received .
This is achieved through the simple strategy of never preventing any mail from being received .
The default configuration throttles connections down to a minimum that will still result in the eventual delivery of all mail .
Of course , users are free to change this .
Moderately Scaleable : I do n't expect TarProxy to be something the engineers at HotMail can just drop into their system , but I do intend for it to perform sufficiently well for production use at small & medium - sized companies .
Smart Enough To Know It Should Back Off : TarProxy should never tarpit so many connections that it can't receive legitimate mail .
It is therefore configurable to allow a set number of unthrottled connections .
For example , if 100 simultaneous connections are permitted , and 10 unthrottled connections are permitted , then the 90 " spammiest " connections will be tarpitted .
If all of its connections are consumed , the spammiest connections ( above a threshold value ) can be dropped as well .
Verbose in its Logging : Given the pluggable approach described above , quite a few combinations of strategies are possible .
TarProxy provides great detail in its logs in order to allow analysis of strategies .
An alpha release of TarProxy is expected to be available soon - probably in the third week of March .
How can you help ?
TarProxy can certainly benefit from code review and contributions .
There 's a skeletal project page up now where updates will be published , and code will be available via SourceForge if you 're willing and able to help in those areas .
If you 've written a classifier , the project page will describe the interfaces expected of incremental classifiers by TarProxy .
These interfaces are designed to make the adaptation of existing classifiers as easy as possible ; if they present any problems for you , please let me know .
If you 're not yet using any of the great client - side mail classification tools out there already , start doing so to build your corpus and provide those developers with feedback .
Notes
The corpus used by the classifier should either be the same corpus used on the client side ( by applications such as POPFile ) , perhaps even based on the intended recipient of the message , or perhaps an aggregate corpus for all users of the mail server .
Using a single shared corpus gives spammers an easy tool to use for testing their messages .
Technically , what I 'm describing does not require that the classifiers be incremental - a system could simply accept a message in its entirety , determine its probability of being spam , and wait for a computed amount of time before acknowledging the message .
I suspect , however , that this approach would be easily detected by spamming software and therefore not waste enough of their time .
Their mailers could give up quickly and move on to other victims .
The altruism of holding on to connections as long as you can without impacting the flow of " good " mail is critical to this system 's success , so any clues that you 're running such a server should be kept to a minimum .
The tarpit concept is not new ; probably the best - known tarpit program is LaBrea , which uses the technique of providing incredibly slow connections to remote servers with no business connecting to it , such as those that have performed a port scan to find open mail relays or to infect other machines with Code Red.
LaBrea is different from what I 'm describing here because it relies on the assumption that there 's NO legimate reason to connect to it , and does not base its behavior on the content of the data it receives .
Because of its effectiveness in handling open relay searches and slowing down malicious code in general , it 's a valuable tool that should be considered a complement to what 's described in this document .
A far simpler approach , and one that I suspect would be far less effective , would be to ungracefully terminate connections from mail servers sending messages that appear to be spam .
This would create a huge false positive problem - you would never receive any emails that are erroneously marked as spam .
And dropped connections do n't inflict pain on the spammer .

" I think business in general is filled with instances of paradox .
The most basic , obviously , is that the best way to maximize your profit is to make profit a secondary concern and focus primarily on your customer .
There are other instances too .
It is easiest to borrow money when you do n't need it .
A " good " strategy is actually defined in large part by your ability to execute it .
Selling is really less about convincing customers to buy your product and more about identifying the customers that naturally want it .
After thinking through all of this I am left the question embodied in the title of this post .
Is paradox the new paradigm ?
What I mean is , will future business success depend on the ability of managers and leaders to embrace paradox ?
Will they succeed by hold in their minds two contradictory ideas , each of which can be applied when necessary ?
I think so .
By embracing paradox , managers will lose the absolutist , half - truth thinking that ignores the context so pertinent to business decisions .
These seeming paradoxes often exist in the first place only because we try to apply business rules across all contexts . "
" The wiring on an aircraft is complicated .
To ﬁgure out where everything goes would take a long time .
But if you studied it for long enough , you could know with ( near ) certainty what each electrical circuit does and how to control it .
The system is ultimately knowable .
If understanding it is important , the effort to study it and make a detailed diagram of it would be worthwhile .
So complicated = not simple , but ultimately knowable .
Now , put a crew and passengers in that aircraft and try to ﬁgure out what will happen on the ﬂight .
Suddenly we go from complicated to complex .
You could study the lives of all these people for years , but you could never know all there is to know about how they will interact .
You could make some guesses , but you can never know for sure .
And the effort to study all the elements in more and more detail will never give you that certainty .
So complex = not simple and never fully knowable .
Just too many variables interact .
Managing humans will never be complicated .
It will always be complex .
So no book or diagram or expert is ever going to reveal the truth about managing people .
But do n’t panic .
We can manage people if ... "
" I have noticed something very strange about engaging in discussions ( and even disagreements ) with people .
The more you disagree with them , taking the other side in an argument , the more vehemently they push their original point of view .
However , if you do n't disagree , but restate their point in an exaggerated form , they often back down , or at least tone down their original statement . "
" Researchers asked some residents of an area to accept and display a small 3 - inch sign that said “ BE A SAFE DRIVER ” .
Almost all did .
Two weeks later , the researchers sent another representative around to ask both this group and another group of residents that had not received the first contact to allow a large billboard saying “ DRIVE CAREFULLY ” on their front lawns .
As part of the request , they were shown a picture of a nice house almost completely obscured by a very large , poorly lettered sign with that message .
Eighty - three percent of the residents who had not received the first request refused , but 76 % of those who had accepted the small sign agreed to placement of the large one ! "
Change is doing something different , but known in the current context .
Innovation is doing something different , but unknown in the specific context .
What do Rob May , Wayne Gretzky , David Maister , and a player to be named later in the post have in common ?
Read on !Rob wonders if Paradox Is The New Paradigm .
You should go read the whole thing ; there 's lots more cogent thought in Rob 's post .
agree with Rob 's condemnation of ignoring context when applying new concepts , but there 's more to the problem than that .
In my recent Mr. T post , I discussed the difference betweenandproblems .
In the book More Space , Johnnie Moore defines the two as follows : ( Yes , that 's a tease to get you to read the rest ! )
Henceforth here at Spooky Action , we will usedefinitions for the termsand .
They define adifference between types of problems and systems .
The difference is important because you can 'tcomplex systems .
It 's a mathematical impossibility .
The Conant - Ashby Theorem : " Every good regulator of a system must have a model of that system . " leads to the Law of Requisite Variety : " That the available control variety must be equal to or greater than the disturbance variety for control to be possible " , which is to say , that the control mechanism of a thing must be more complex than the thing being controlled .
To continue with Johnnie 's airplane metaphor , the autopilot system has to have greater control variety than the plane itself .
The analogy to business is that managers often want to see new initiatives aswhen they are in fact , and thus design complicated systems to manage the change .
Which usually fail miserably in very short order when they encounter a circumstance outside of the control model .
The problem with designing control mechanisms for organizational change management is that the system being controlled consists of theis the epitome of a complex system .
Of course , as Johnnie notes , if we abandon the idea ofcomplex systems and focus on intelligentlythem , we 'll have greater success .
One man who understood this well was Air Force Col .
John Boyd , the father of the Observe - Orient - Decide - Act ( OODA ) loop .
His essay , Destruction and Creation weaves together Godel 's Incompletess Theorem , Heisenberg 's Indeterminacy Principle , and the Second Law of Thermodynamics ( tendency to entropy ) to show that the only way to deal with complex system is one of constant observation and reaction to that system .
A diagram of the OODA loop looks like this :
The first step , observation , comprises collection of data .
For us people , that comes through our senses .
The second step , orientation , involves analyzing the observed data and .
The diagram 's model of orientation is oversimplified , but the concept of needing to synthesize the new data into all of our existing models is a key one .
The third step , decision making , includes forming alternative courses of action and then selecting one or more to act upon , which leads to the final step ... Acting , in which we do something and then go back to step one to observe resulting changes .
With lots of feedback and feed forward .
Hopefully you 're not sitting there thinking " Um...okay ... so what ? " , because we can do all kinds of fun things with this model .
Boyd did all kinds of fun things byhis opponents ' OODA loops .
There 's an old saying that " no battle plan survives first contact with the enemy " .
Once engaged , everyone involved , from lowly private to five - star general , is running their own OODA loop .
There are lots of ways toOODA loops .
You could use stealth technology to disrupt your opponent 's observation capabilities , or you could use terrain to restrict your opponent 's ability to act .
What Boyd taught was that an inferior force could triumph by " getting inside " its enemy 's OODA loop ; youyour opponent 's orientation capabilities .
Well - disciplined armies have well - instilled standard tactics and orientation / decision models to go with them .
Traditionally , the lower level the unit the simpler the model - with orders to escalate decision - making to the next level of command whenever a situation outside the model is encountered .
Of course , this escalation has a time and communcation cost , so if you can keep changing the situation faster than the enemy can orient , you effectively cut off their ability to act in a coherent manner .
Cognitive dissonance leads to panic and chaos and surrender .
Too bad this is the effect many management initiatives have on the employees !
Getting inside OODA loops works in all walks of life : " A good hockey player plays where the puck is , a great hockey player plays where the puck is going to be " .
Wayne GretzkyWant to try disrupting someone 's OODA loop yourself ?
Try Maister ' Exaggeration Ploy
Try it .
It works !
Of course , you do n't want to abuse other people 's OODA loops , but people have been doing it for centuries .
Several years ago Robert Cialdini wrote a fascinating book entitled " Influence : The Psychology of Persuasion " .
You need to read this book .
Cialdini spent time infiltrating different groups of swindlers , peddlers , and con artists to see if they used a common set of principles to unduly influence people .
He found that they use six .
He then discusses experiments testing these principles that are truly shocking .
In one What 's funniest about the book is that people reading it can invariably recall times when they themselves fell prey to the same ploys .
Many of the models we use to orient ourselves in the world are hard - wired , such as Cialdini 's principles and 400 other Human Universals , but many others ( as indicated in Boyd 's diagram ) are cultural or results of previous experiences .
We all have our own unique collections of models , or as Charlie Munger more eloquently called it : a lattice of models .
Who is Charlie Munger ?
He 's Warren Buffett 's partner and alter ego .
Years ago he coined the term " lattice of models " to describe how superior investment decisions came from applying principles created in other areas , such as the hard sciences .
It 's hard to argue with his results ; he 's made billions with the approach .
I think this approach applies generally to innovation .
Fouro recently asked me to define the difference between change and innovation for our upcoming book .
Since I had OODA on the brain , I posited this :
If my competitors are all using some " rest practice " , and I decide to implement it , that 's change .
If I decide to start an " OilChangeMobile " service for third - shift workers , because all the oil change shop are closed during their lunch breaks , that 's innovating ( it might be a good innovation or a bad one , but it 's more than just change ) .
Does that seem like an insightful distinction ?
Back to Rob 's " Paradox is the New Paradigm " .
Paradox will always be the paradigm for innovators , the people willing to do the extra work in observing their circumstances and orienting themselves using the fullest context .
But there will always be a large crowd that for expediency 's sake will not do the extra work , and thus there will always be a ready market for consultants selling the " next big thing " .
British scientists are at loggerheads with US colleagues over a controversial plan to work alongside oil companies to hunt for fossil fuel reserves in the Arctic .
The US Geological Survey is lining up a project with BP and Statoil to find oil and gas in the Arctic Ocean , under the auspices of a flagship scientific initiative intended to tackle global warming .
But the head of the British Antarctic Survey , which coordinates UK activity at the poles , has said he is " very uncomfortable " with the idea and has questioned its ethical and scientific justification .
Tackling climate change and working out how it will affect the Arctic and Antarctic is a central theme of International Polar Year ( IPY ) - a high - profile project to start next spring that involves thousands of scientists from 60 countries .
The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet and last September saw the lowest extent of sea ice cover for more than a century .
Scientists say the temperature there could rise by a further 4C - 7C by 2100 , and the Arctic Ocean could be ice - free in summer by 2060 .
Documents on the IPY website show that BP and Statoil , a Norwegian company , are " significant consortium members " on a USGS proposal to assess " energy resources in the circumarctic area including oil , gas , coalbed methane and methane hydrates " .
Geologists estimate that a quarter of the world 's undiscovered oil and gas reserves lie under the Arctic , and analysts have predicted a 21st - century goldrush to tap them as the Arctic Ocean 's ice cover retreats .
Chris Rapley , the director of the British Antarctic Survey , said : " I would be very uncomfortable with a project that simply was out to log the hydrocarbon reserves of the Arctic as a geological activity .
I do n't think that fits very comfortably within either the scientific guidelines or the ethical underpinning of the IPY . "
Launching the polar year initiative last month , Professor Rapley said the scientists would work on projects " that will tackle the urgent environmental issues " because " rapid climate change is already impacting local peoples ... and it is only a question of time before the wider consequences become apparent " .
The Inuit people have filed a lawsuit against the US government claiming that greenhouse gas pollution is damaging their livelihoods .
Experts have warned the only realistic way to prevent dangerous climate change is to curb carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels .
The USGS proposal has been approved by scientists organising the IPY , but Prof Rapley plans to question its suitability at a committee meeting this week in Cambridge .
" If it was in the context of how are we going to manage the inevitable move towards extracting these resources from the Arctic in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way then I think that would be fair game , " he said .
" There is an argument that it is much better to work with companies that are considering how to exploit these resources rather than taking a somewhat prissy position .
But there are some things that are ethically in , and some that are ethically out . "
Suzanne Weedman of the USGS said : " This is very much a part of what we do .
Our responsibility is to assess the undiscovered oil and gas using geological information . "
She said the plan built on a project called the Arctic Energy Assessment , which is part of its World Energy Project - a global attempt to map untapped hydrocarbon fuel reserves .
Oil companies including ExxonMobil , Amoco , Conoco , Texaco and PetroCanada are listed as members .
Ms Weedman said oil companies had helped fund the World Energy Project - which had a budget of $ 2 m ( £ 1.1 m ) last year - but insisted they had no say on how the money was spent and had not been involved in research .
No company had contributed funds directly to the Arctic Assessment , though some had donated data as in - kind support .
" If you look at the objectives of International Polar Year , one of them is to assess the impact of these changes on people who live in the Arctic .
Knowing about the energy resources might be very interesting because there is the potential of development in the Arctic .
That 's not for us to decide , but it is the reality . "
A Statoil spokesman said : " It is not unnatural that our kind of contribution is close to our activity , and that is finding and developing resources . "
The company was working on a gasfield in the Barents Sea , he said , but it had " no concrete actions " elsewhere in the region .
BP said it was not using the research to prospect in the Arctic and that geological surveys could be misleading : " Very often it 's intended to get you an indication , not necessarily of oil in a particular place , but what there might be in adjacent areas .
You only find oil and gas if you actually drill . "
Smallest Plane in the World
Most people seem to be infatuated with the biggest or the fastest .
I have the opposite question .
What is the smallest plane in the world ?
- question from Justine Sullivan
However , we will assume that this question is asking about the smallest manned plane in the world , or the smallest plane flown with a human pilot aboard .
Even this category can be confusing since it could possibly include vehicles like hang gliders or ultralights , but we will limit our discussion to more conventional airplane types .
This definition leaves us with three primary sets of aircraft designers who have competed against each other to build and fly the " world 's smallest plane " since the end of World War II .
The first plane to be so titled was known as the Wee Bee .
The diminutive plane was designed , built , and flown by Ken Coward , William Chana , and Karl Montijo in San Diego , California , during the late 1940s .
Just over 14 ft ( 4.25 m ) long and with a wingspan of only 18 ft ( 5.5 m ) , the Wee Bee was powered by a 30 - hp piston engine and could carry a maximum of 200 lb ( 90 kg ) , including the pilot and fuel .
Weight was kept to a minimum by having the pilot lay in a prone position atop the fuselage .
Several views of the Wee Bee
Only one example of the unusual Wee Bee was built , making its first flight in 1948 .
The Wee Bee was later placed on display at the San Diego Aerospace Museum but was lost in a fire that swept through the museum in 1978 .
A replica has now taken the place of the destroyed original .
The creators of the Wee Bee also formed a small company called Bee Aviation , or Beecraft , that went on to build a larger version called the Honey Bee .
With a wingspan of 28 ft ( 9.5 m ) , the Honey Bee could carry a single pilot in a more comfortable and conventional seated position .
Following in the footsteps of the Wee Bee was an even smaller plane called the Stits Junior .
Designed by Ray Stits and Martin Youngs , the Junior was rebuilt from the components of a surplus World War II Taylorcraft L - 2 .
The Junior was around 11 ft ( 3.4 m ) in length and had a wingspan that varied between 8.8 and 9.3 ft ( 2.7 to 2.8 m ) over the course of three different modifications .
Power was provided by a single piston engine ranging from 36 to 75 - hp that gave the Junior a top speed up to 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) .
Stits Junior compared to a Taylorcraft L- 2
Also competing against Stits to build the world 's smallest plane during the 1940s was Wilbur Staib , an engineer living near Los Angeles .
Believing he could build a plane even smaller than the Junior , Staib set out to design and build a tiny monoplane called the Little Bit .
Only 11 ft ( 3.4 m ) long and with a wingspan of just 7.5 ft ( 2.3 m ) , the Little Bit weighed a mere 390 lb ( 177 kg ) empty .
Unfortunately , the plane was never successfully flown and was dismantled as a " hazard to the life and limb of Wilbur Staib . "
The parts of the Little Bit were later reused in a biplane with a 13 ft ( 4 m ) wingspan .
However , Staib 's challenge only encouraged Stits and co-builder Robert Starr to build a new plane even smaller than the Junior or the Little Bit.
Known as the Sky Baby , this new plane differed from earlier entries into the arena by adopting a biplane design instead of a monoplane .
This change allowed the wingspan to be reduced even further to just over 7 ft ( 2.1 m ) .
With a maximum length under 10 ft ( 3 m ) , the Sky Baby weighed just 452 lb ( 205 kg ) empty and 666 lb ( 302 kg ) fully loaded .
Its 65 - hp piston engine gave the Sky Baby a maximum speed of 185 mph ( 300 km / h ) .
Pilot Robert Starr flew the Sky Baby at air shows from April to November of 1952 , and the plane was donated to the National Air and Space Museum in 1972 .
The Sky Baby is currently exhibited at the Experimental Aviation Association AirVenture Museum in Oshkosh , Wisconsin .
Stits Sky Baby
The Sky Baby remained unchallenged as the world 's smallest plane until the 1980s when its former pilot , Robert Starr of Phoenix , Arizona , built the Bumble Bee .
The Bumble Bee biplane was heavier than the Sky Baby at 547 lb ( 248 kg ) empty and 725 lb ( 329 kg ) loaded .
However , its dimensions were otherwise smaller with a length under 9.5 ft ( 2.9 m ) and a wingspan of just 6.5 ft ( 2 m ) .
As a result , the Guinness Book of World Records considered the Bumble Bee to be the smallest plane in the world following its first successful flight on 28 January 1984 .
Powered by an 85 - hp piston engine , the Bumble Bee was capable of 180 mph ( 290 km / h ) .
Starr Bumble Bee
Not to be outdone , Ray Stits ' son Donald set out to recapture the title by building an even smaller monoplane called the Baby Bird .
At 11 ft ( 3.4 m ) in length , the Baby Bird was longer than the Bumble Bee but had a smaller wingspan of 6.25 ft ( 1.9 m ) and weighed less at only 250 lb ( 115 kg ) empty .
Its 55 - hp piston engine gave the Baby Bird a maximum speed of 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) when it first flew at Camarillo , California , on 4 August 1984 .
Pilot Harold Nemer completed 35 flights aboard the Baby Bird by the time it was retired in 1989 .

However , Robert Starr believed he could go even smaller and completed a new Bumble Bee II in 1988 .
Though still heavier than the Baby Bird with an empty weight of 396 lb ( 180 kg ) , the overall dimensions of the Bumble Bee shrank even further to 8.8 ft ( 2.7 m ) in length and a mere 5.5 ft ( 1.7 m ) wingspan .
Its 85 - hp piston engine made possible a maximum speed of 190 mph ( 305 km / h ) .
Starr Bumble Bee II
Unfortunately , the first flights of the Bumble Bee II on 8 May 1988 proved a mixed success .
Starr was able to make several passes over the airfield demonstrating the plane could fly and earning his place in the record books , but the attempt nearly cost Starr his life .
While at an altitude of about 400 ft ( 120 m ) , the Bumble Bee II suffered an engine failure and fell from the sky .
The plane was completely destroyed in a crash that left Starr seriously injured , though he later made a full recovery .

85 - hp Continental C-85 190 mph
Perhaps hoping to prevent further life - threatening crashes in this battle of the small , the Guinness Book decided to credit both Stits and Starr with world records .
The Stits Baby Bird is considered the world 's smallest monoplane while Starr 's Bumble Bee II is the world 's smallest biplane .
Although the Bumble Bee II was tragically lost , the original Bumble Bee is on display at the Pima Air & Space Museum in Tucson , Arizona .
Like his father 's Sky Baby before it , Donald Stits ' Baby Bird is also on display at the EAA AirVenture Museum .
As tiny as these planes were , they were all built of conventional construction materials like aluminum .
Recent advances in composite materials that provide the same strength as metals yet weigh far less may make it possible for a future innovator to build an even lighter and smaller plane .

Today ’s
Web is platform independent and is now available on mobile , notebook , and on various different devices .
There is huge increase in the use of web hosted applications , which has started the era of using software as service .

The patterns for web site design services come with features :
First comprehensive collection of Web Application Design Patterns , including patterns for Web 2.0 applications !
Web 2.0 is basically a 2nd generation of technology and is a transition of web to web applications .
It consists of interactive content and provides a new way to find , collect and share the information with others on internet .
Web 2.0 development enables better use of the core enterprise application .
Enables readers to design interfaces faster and have more rationale for the solutions they choose .
The user interface is the part of a computer and its software that people can see , hear , touch , talk to , or otherwise understand or direct .
The user interface has essentially two components : input and output .
Includes over 10 K patterns , extensive notes on reuse and extension of patterns , as well as “ anti- patterns ” in the following areas :
Web App access :
Web apps are basically software ’s or programs that are coded in HTML and web browser ‘s script , mostly , JavaScript .
Web application can be of many types and serve different purposes and functions .
Some of them are simple like a message board or a guest sign - in book on a website that help the website visitors in interacting and communicating with the website owner and some are complicated , such as a word processor or a spreadsheet .

I could n't help but make a joke with the title , because it 's seemingly right on the money .
You see , Google is getting ready to take the wraps off of a new service called Google Base .
If it can be posted online , it would appear that they would , in fact , prefer it belong to them .
At least , they 'll store it for you and make it searchable .
" Yahoo : What you say ? "
Rumors surrounding this service have been spreading over the past few days , and a handful of people have managed to catch the site when it 's up ( it 's currently down ) .
It is not known when Google will officially launch the service , although they are holding a special invitation - only event today .
Here 's the text off of the front page of the site :
Google Base is Google 's database into which you can add all types of content .
We 'll host your content and make it searchable online for free .
Examples of items you can find in Google Base : • Description of your party planning service
• Articles on current events from your website
• Listing of your used car for sale
• Database of protein structures
You can describe any item you post with attributes , which will help people find it when they search Google Base .
In fact , based on the relevance of your items , they may also be included in the main Google search index and other Google products like Froogle and Google Local .
Just what does Google have in mind ?
The last sentence there really speaks to what they 're after : eBay , Craigslist , and classified ads .
Users will be able upload all kinds of items for sale , and you 'll be able to geo - locate them , compare them , and search them via Google .
Think about it .
When using eBay or Craigslist , how often do you think " I wish I could search this with Google " ?
Recall , too , that Google has a payments service in the works .
If we grant that , then let 's think about the next level : a Google Base API of sorts .
If Google remains the middle man , it 's great for Google .
Ergo , an API that would allow other sites to use Google Base could really generate a great deal of traffic .
There 's another level to this as well .
By letting people post nearly anything , Google will get their hands on a massive database of items that have been given user - created attributes .
Google then can use that data to try and generate a kind of universal tagging schema for information and items , which could then be used to classify information across the net .
Far fetched ?
Google is already trying to do that with information layout via Google Site Maps .
Google has briefly commented on Google Base in a statement :
" This is an early - stage test of a product that enables content owners to easily send their content to Google .
Like our web crawl and the recently released Google Sitemaps program , we are working to provide content owners an easy way to give us access to their content .
We 're continually exploring new opportunities to expand our offerings , but we do n't have anything to announce at this time . "
So the waiting , and the speculation , begins .
There 's not much more to see right now , but Wouter Schut managed not only to see the service live ( I saw the front page , but that 's it ) , but he ventured in and took additional screenshots .
Ghost ship discovered in the Italian waters
A ghost ship was discovered in the Italian waters near the shore .
Coastguards spotted a double - mast 22 - meter sailing ship cruising around near the Porto Rotondo resort but not giving any signs of life .
Ghost ship discovered in the Italian waters
The vessel had no name and no flags .
It also appeared to be free of any crew members , or any living thing at all for that matter .
To add to the mystery Italian media sources reported that ships of this kind are not registered anywhere in Sardinia .
And besides , no one has seen anything like it in all Italy .
After searching the ship ’s cabins coastguards discovered French maps of North African seas , a flag of Luxemburg , Egyptian food leftovers and a wooden tablet in bad Italian that said “ Bel’ Amica ” ( with only one “ l ” instead of two ) , which translates into English as “ Beautiful Friend . ”
The ship ’s appearances point to the fact that it is very old but it seems to maintain ideal condition nonetheless .
However , there is no indication that anyone had tried to rebuild the ship .

THE first thing to greet a visitor to the Oslo headquarters of Schibsted , a Norwegian newspaper firm , is its original , hand - operated printing press from 1856 , now so clean and polished it looks more like a sculpture than a machine .
Christian Schibsted , the firm 's founder , bought it to print someone else 's newspaper , but when the contract moved elsewhere he decided to start his own .
Although Schibsted gives pride of place to its antique machinery , the company is in fact running away from its printed past as fast as it can .
Having made a loss five years ago , Schibsted 's activities on the internet contributed 35 % of last year 's operating profits .
News of Schibsted 's success online has spread far in the newspaper industry .
Every year , says Sverre Munck , the executive vice - president of its international business , Schibsted has to turn away delegations of foreign newspaper bosses seeking to find out how the Norwegians have done it .
“ Otherwise we 'd get several visits every month , ” he says .
The company has used its established newspaper brands to build websites that rank first and second in Scandinavia for visitors .
It has also created new internet businesses such as Sesam , a search engine that competes with Google , and FINN . no , a portal for classified advertising .
As a result , 2005 was the company 's best ever for revenues and profits .
Unfortunately for the newspaper industry , Schibsted is a rare exception .
For most newspaper companies in the developed world , 2005 was miserable .
They still earn almost all of their profits from print , which is in decline .
As people look to the internet for news and young people turn away from papers , paid - for circulations are falling year after year .
Papers are also losing their share of advertising spending .
Classified advertising is quickly moving online .
Jim Chisholm , of iMedia , a joint - venture consultancy with IFRA , a newspaper trade association , predicts that a quarter of print classified ads will be lost to digital media in the next ten years .
Overall , says iMedia , newspapers claimed 36 % of total global advertising in 1995 and 30 % in 2005 .
It reckons they will lose another five percentage points by 2015 .
Even the most confident of newspaper bosses now agree that they will survive in the long term only if , like Schibsted , they can reinvent themselves on the internet and on other new - media platforms such as mobile phones and portable electronic devices .
Most have been slow to grasp the changes affecting their industry — “ remarkably , unaccountably complacent , ” as Rupert Murdoch put it in a speech last year — but now they are making a big push to catch up .
Internet advertising is growing rapidly for many and is beginning to offset some of the decline in print .
Newspapers ' complacency is perhaps not as remarkable as Mr Murdoch suggested .
In many developed countries their owners have for decades enjoyed near monopolies , fat profit margins , and returns on capital above those of other industries .
In the past , newspaper companies saw little need to experiment or to change and spent little or nothing on research and development .
Set in print
At first , from the late 1990s until around 2002 , newspaper companies simply replicated their print editions online .
Yet the internet offers so many specialised sources of information and entertainment that readers can pick exactly what they want from different websites .
As a result , people visited newspaper sites infrequently , looked at a few pages and then vanished off to someone else 's website .
Another early mistake was for papers to save their best journalists for print .
This meant that the quality of new online editions was often poor .
Websites hired younger , cheaper staff .
The brand 's prestige stayed with the old medium , which encouraged print journalists to defend their turf .
Still today at La Stampa , an Italian daily paper owned by the Fiat Group , says Anna Masera , the paper 's internet chief , print journalists hesitate to give her their stories for fear that the website will cannibalise the newspaper .
For most newspaper companies in the developed world , 2005 was miserable
For the past couple of years , however , newspapers have been thinking more boldly about what to do on the internet .
At its most basic , that means reporting stories using cameras and microphones as well as print .
The results can be encouraging .
America's Academy of Television Arts & Sciences has introduced a new Emmy award for news and documentaries on the internet , mobile phones and personal media players .
Five of the seven nominations for this September have gone to reports by nytimes.com and washingtonpost.com .
It also means being more imaginative .
In the late 1990s , the early years of the Wall Street Journal 's website , one of the paper 's journalists came up with the novel idea of posting online a 573 - page document that backed up an article .
“ It was n't the most compelling content , ” remembers Neil Budde , its founding editor and now general manager of news at Yahoo ! , an internet portal .
But it was a start .
Now newspapers have a better idea of what works online .
This is not always traditional journalism as taught in journalism school .
Brian Tierney , who became owner of the Philadelphia Inquirer after Knight Ridder sold it last year , noticed that a popular item on the paper 's website has been a video of Mentos mints causing a 2 - litre bottle of Diet Coke to explode into the air .
“ We should do more of that , ” he says .
More newspaper companies are likely to treat their websites as a priority these days .
“ Before , newspapers used their second - and third - rate journalists for the internet , ” says Edward Roussel , online editorial director at Britain 's Telegraph Group , “ but now we know we 've got to use our very best . ”
Many companies are putting print journalists in the same room as those who work online , so that print writers are working for the website and vice versa .
Some insist that this is a mistake .
“ It is completely wrong not to separate web and paper operations , ” says Oscar Bronner , publisher of Der Standard , a daily paper in Austria .
Print journalists do n't have time to reflect and analyse properly if they also have to work for the website , he argues .
Running to stand still
How impressive are the results of these online experiments ?
At lots of newspaper companies , internet advertising is growing by at least 30 % a year , and often more .
At la Repubblica in Italy , for instance , the paper 's website gets about 1 m visitors a day , nearly double the circulation of the printed paper .
The value of online ads grew by 70 % in the first half of 2006 .
For the first three months of 2006 , the Newspaper Association of America announced that advertising for all the country 's newspaper websites grew by 35 % from the same period in 2005 , to a total of $ 613 m .
But to put that in perspective , print and online ads together grew by only 1.8 % , to $ 11 billion , because print advertising was flat .
At almost all newspapers the internet brings in less than a tenth of revenues and profits .
At this point , says Mr Chisholm , “ newspapers are halfway to realising an audience on the internet and about a tenth of the way to building a business online . ”
The big problem is that readers online bring in nowhere near the revenues that print readers do .
All but a handful of papers offer their content free online , so they immediately surrender the cover price of a print copy .
People look at fewer pages online than they do in print , which makes web editions less valuable to advertisers .
Gavin O'Reilly , president of the World Association of Newspapers in Paris , says that print readers are much more valuable than online readers , who use newspaper websites in a “ haphazard and fragmented way ” .
Vin Crosbie , of Digital Deliverance , a consulting firm , recently estimated that newspapers need between 20 and 100 readers online to make up for losing just one print reader .
Many newspaper bosses would say this is too pessimistic : one British paper , for instance , reckons that one print reader is worth ten online .
But even that is a daunting multiple .
Newspapers today concentrate on only two parts of the market for internet advertising .
They earn little or nothing from internet search , which is bigger than either display or classified ads .
Especially in America , newspapers rely heavily on classified ads online and have fewer display ads , says Mr Crosbie .
Elsewhere , the pattern may be reversed , but newspapers still lack a broad base of internet - advertising revenue ; for instance , Juan Luis Cebrián , chief executive of Grupo PRISA , the owner of El Pais , says the Spanish newspaper is enjoying strong growth in display advertising , but has few online classified ads .
On the other hand , newspapers ' websites have higher profit margins than print does , because they have no newsprint or distribution to pay for .
The Wall Street Journal is one of the few papers that charges for its content online .
Others may follow suit , especially if growth in advertising slows .
The online business model is still in flux , argues Richard Zannino , chief executive of Dow Jones & Company , publisher of the Wall Street Journal .
The average price of ad space in the printed paper is now only three times higher than on Wall Street Journal Online , says Mr Zannino , compared with six to seven times for the industry as a whole in America .
He expects the relative price of an internet ad to rise .
The secret of making money online , according to Schibsted , is not to rely on news aggregators like Google News and Yahoo !.
Three - quarters of traffic to the websites for Schibsted 's VG and Aftonbladet comes through their own home - pages and only a quarter from other websites .
“ If visitors come from Google to stories deep in the paper and then leave , ” explains Mr Munck , “ Google gets the dollars and we get only cents , but if we can bring them in through the front page we can charge € 19,000 [ $ 25,000 ] for a 24 - hour banner ad . ”
In spite of this , most newspapers still depend on news aggregators .
Readers online bring in nowhere near the revenues that print readers do
The danger for newspapers is that all their efforts on the internet may only slow their decline .
Doing the obvious — having excellent websites and selling ad space on them — may not be enough .
The papers with the best chance of seeing their revenues grow are those experimenting with entirely new businesses online and off .
Some are launching profitable new ventures that are only indirectly related to journalism .
Schibsted , for instance , has started an online slimming club , called Viktklubben.se , using its Aftonbladet newspaper brand .
Viktklubben.se charges its 54,000 members € 50 each every three months .
The Telegraph Group in Britain uses the Daily Telegraph to sell readers everything from goose - down pillows to Valentine 's Day topiary baskets to insurance .
The division now contributes close to a third of the firm 's total profits , according to an executive at the company .
“ Newspapers will have to get into new businesses and extract more value from their audience , ” says Paul Zwillenberg , global head of media and entertainment at OC&C Strategy Consultants in London .
Examples like these are fairly rare , though .
Most newspaper companies still insist that producing high - quality journalism and distributing it in new ways will be enough to keep them growing .
It 's the journalism , stupid
Consultants advising newspaper groups argue that they need to adjust their output .
Research into the tastes of mainstream newspaper readers has long shown that people like short stories and news that is relevant to them : local reporting , sports , entertainment , weather and traffic .
On the internet , especially , says Mr Chisholm , they are looking to enhance their way of life .
Long pieces about foreign affairs are low on readers ' priorities — the more so now that the internet enables people to scan international news headlines in moments .
Coverage of national and international news is in any case a commodity often almost indistinguishable from one newspaper to the next .
This impression is exacerbated as papers seek to save money by sacking reporters and taking copy from agencies such as Reuters .
“ Our research shows that people are looking for more utility from newspapers , ” says Sammy Papert , chief executive of Belden Associates , a firm that specialises in research for American newspapers .
People want their paper to tell them how to get richer , and what they might do in the evening .
Few newspaper companies like to hear this and they tend to ignore the research they have paid for .
Most journalists , after all , would rather cover Afghanistan than personal finance .
But some are starting to listen .
Gannett , the world 's biggest newspaper group , is trying to make its journalism more local .
It has invested in “ mojos ” — mobile journalists with wireless laptops who permanently work out of the office encamped in community hubs .
Morris Communications , based in Augusta , Georgia , recently launched a new home - delivered free paper for Bluffton , a fast - growing area of Beaufort , South Carolina , called Bluffton Today , with a page of national news , one of international and the rest “ hyper- local ” .
Its website has pictures and blogs from readers and detailed community information .
“ Back in the 1940s and 1950s papers used to be full of what we call ‘ chicken - dinner news ' — the speakers at civic clubs and whose daughter won a blue ribbon in canoeing , ” says Will Morris , the firm 's president .
“ But then newspapers started to lose touch with their readers . ”
The more adventurous newspaper companies , like Morris Communications , are showing themselves willing to embrace content and opinions from readers .
Rather like OhmyNews , a Korean “ citizen - journalism ” operation that many people think heralds the future for news - gathering , Schibsted exhorts its readers to send information and photographs .
When a mentally disturbed man ran amok and killed people on a tram in Oslo in 2004 , it was a reader with a mobile - phone camera who sent VG its front - page picture of the arrest .
At Zero Hora , a Brazilian paper owned by RBS Group , the circulation department asks 120 readers what they think of the paper every day and Marcelo Rech , the editor , receives a report at 1 pm .
“ They usually want more of our supplements on cooking and houses and less of Hizbullah and earthquakes , ” says Mr Rech .
Still more changes to the content and form of newspapers are likely as businesspeople gain power at newspaper firms .
“ You wo n't be able to have many sacred cows ... Newspaper companies will have to become more commercial , ” says Henrik Poppe , a partner in McKinsey .
Some leading titles , including the Wall Street Journal , have recently decided to put advertisements on the front page for the first time .
For the moment , the trend towards greater commercialism is most evident in America , but is likely to spread elsewhere as newspaper companies struggle financially .
At the Philadelphia Inquirer , Mr Tierney , a former advertising executive , shocked people by announcing that he would bring in an advertising person to redesign the paper — traditionally a task strictly for editorial .
In future , businesspeople are likely to insist that newspapers adopt practices that are already standard in other industries .
Mr Tierney , for instance , says it is unreasonable to expect everyone from the age of 18 to 88 to buy the same product .
The industry needs to sell papers for different age and demographic groups , he says .
The most shocking development for traditional newspapers has been the wild success of free dailies , which like the internet have proved enormously popular with young people .
Roughly 28 m copies of free newspapers are now printed daily , according to Metro International , a Swedish firm that pioneered them in 1995 .
In markets where they are published , they account for 8 % of daily circulation on average , according to iMedia .
That share is rising .
In Europe they make up 16 % of daily circulation .
Metro calculates that it spends half the proportion of its total costs on editorial that paid - for papers do .
In practice that means a freesheet with a circulation of about 100,000 employing 20 journalists , whereas a paid - for paper would have around 180 .
Metro's papers reach young , affluent readers and are even able to charge a premium for advertising in some markets compared with paid - for papers .
“ The biggest enemy of paid - for newspapers is time , ” says Pelle Törnberg , Metro 's chief executive .
Mr Törnberg says the only way that paid - for papers will prosper is by becoming more specialised , raising their prices and investing in better editorial .
People read freesheets in their millions , on the other hand , because Metro and others reach them on their journey to work , when they have time to read , and spare them the hassle of having to hand over change to a newsagent .
Some traditional newspaper firms dismiss free papers , saying they are not profitable .
Carlo De Benedetti , chairman of Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso , publisher of la Repubblica , for instance , says that Metro loses money in Italy and that other freesheets are struggling .
Globally , however , Metro has just become profitable .
Consultants say that lots of traditional newspaper companies are planning to hold their noses and launch free dailies .
In France , for instance , Le Monde is planning a new free daily , and Mr Murdoch 's News International is preparing a new free afternoon paper for London , to be launched next month .
Deciding whether or not to start a freesheet , indeed , perfectly encapsulates the unpalatable choice that faces the paid - for newspaper industry today as it attempts to find a future for itself .
Over the next few years it must decide whether to compromise on its notion of “ fine journalism ” and take a more innovative , more businesslike approach — or risk becoming a beautiful old museum piece .
In his posting titled Reading the Google Tea Leaves , Tristan compares various product offerings from Google against those of the " big three " ( AOL , Microsoft , and Yahoo ! ) and concludes :
Google does innovate in some spaces but has largely innovated in order to gain entry in markets that already existed .
As a rule of thumb , they 've been very smart at breathing new innovations in those markets .
However , their competitors are generally quick to notice and are catching up .
I 've been giving a much shorter verbal version of his post for many months now .
Typically when I 'm interviewing someone or talking to random folks who are trying to figure out this industry we 're in .
They 'll ask a question like " what do you think Google is doing ? " or " where is Google really headed ? "
My answer is this : Google is trying to build Yahoo 2.0 .
It 's really that simple .
If they press me for details on this theory ( that only happens about half the time ) I say that it's as if someone decided to re-invent more and more of Yahoo 's popular services in random order , giving them a fresh user interface , less historical baggage , and usually one feature that really stands out ( such as Gmail 's storage limit or Google Talk 's use of Jabber ) .
When Google Calendar and Google Finance ( more in a future post ) finally show their faces , I suspect they 'll follow the same pattern .
They 'll look like someone sat down and thought " I 'm starting with a clean slate , so how would I build a modern version of Yahoo !
Calendar , with a newer and more interactive UI , one killer feature , and fixing the various things we 've learned since Yahoo !
Calendar launched many years ago ? "
A few people have recently told me that I 'm not " stirring the pot " enough on my blog anymore .
I assume that by " stirring the pot " they mean " talking trash about Google " , so maybe this counts ?
Or maybe it 's not trashy enough ?
Anyway , what 's your theory ?
Is Tristan right ?
Am I right ?
Will Microsoft try to build Yahoo 3.0 in 24-36 moths when their newfound " services " vision finally trickles down through the ranks ?

In recent years our papers have brought you a great deal of information the White House never intended for you to know — classified secrets about the questionable intelligence that led the country to war in Iraq , about the abuse of prisoners in Iraq and Afghanistan , about the transfer of suspects to countries that are not squeamish about using torture , about eavesdropping without warrants .
As Robert G. Kaiser , associate editor of The Washington Post , asked recently in the pages of that newspaper : " You may have been shocked by these revelations , or not at all disturbed by them , but would you have preferred not to know them at all ?
If a war is being waged in America 's name , should n't Americans understand how it is being waged ? "
Government officials , understandably , want it both ways .
They want us to protect their secrets , and they want us to trumpet their successes .
A few days ago , Treasury Secretary John Snow said he was scandalized by our decision to report on the bank - monitoring program .
But in September 2003 the same Secretary Snow invited a group of reporters from our papers , The Wall Street Journal and others to travel with him and his aides on a military aircraft for a six - day tour to show off the department 's efforts to track terrorist financing .
The secretary 's team discussed many sensitive details of their monitoring efforts , hoping they would appear in print and demonstrate the administration 's relentlessness against the terrorist threat .
How do we , as editors , reconcile the obligation to inform with the instinct to protect ?
Sometimes the judgments are easy .
Our reporters in Iraq and Afghanistan , for example , take great care not to divulge operational intelligence in their news reports , knowing that in this wired age it could be seen and used by insurgents .
Often the judgments are painfully hard .
In those cases , we cool our competitive jets and begin an intensive deliberative process .
The process begins with reporting .
Sensitive stories do not fall into our hands .
They may begin with a tip from a source who has a grievance or a guilty conscience , but those tips are just the beginning of long , painstaking work .
Reporters operate without security clearances , without subpoena powers , without spy technology .
They work , rather , with sources who may be scared , who may know only part of the story , who may have their own agendas that need to be discovered and taken into account .
We double - check and triple - check .
We seek out sources with different points of view .
We challenge our sources when contradictory information emerges .
Then we listen .
No article on a classified program gets published until the responsible officials have been given a fair opportunity to comment .
And if they want to argue that publication represents a danger to national security , we put things on hold and give them a respectful hearing .
Often , we agree to participate in off - the - record conversations with officials , so they can make their case without fear of spilling more secrets onto our front pages .

Working from home can take some adjustment , particularly if you have always worked in an office or other type of environment before .
Whilst it can be great to be surrounded by home comforts , it is also easy to get distracted .
Here are some tips to help you to be productive and stay focused when w...
GCC 4.1 Release Series
Changes , New Features , and Fixes
The latest release in the 4.1 release series is GCC 4.1.2 .
Caveats
General Optimizer Improvements
GCC now has infrastructure for inter-procedural optimizations and the following inter-procedural optimizations are implemented :
Profile guided inlining .
When doing profile feedback guided optimization , GCC can now use the profile to make better informed decisions on whether inlining of a function is profitable or not .
This means that GCC will no longer inline functions at call sites that are not executed very often , and that functions at hot call sites are more likely to be inlined .
A new parameter min-inline - recursive - probability is also now available to throttle recursive inlining of functions with small average recursive depths .
Discovery of pure and const functions , a form of side - effects analysis .
While older GCC releases could also discover such special functions , the new IPA - based pass runs earlier so that the results are available to more optimizers .
The pass is also simply more powerful than the old one .
Analysis of references to static variables and type escape analysis , also forms of side - effects analysis .
The results of these passes allow the compiler to be less conservative about call - clobbered variables and references .
This results in more redundant loads being eliminated and in making static variables candidates for register promotion .
Improvement of RTL - based alias analysis .
The results of type escape analysis are fed to the RTL type - based alias analyzer , allowing it to disambiguate more memory references .
Interprocedural constant propagation and function versioning .
This pass looks for functions that are always called with the same constant value for one or more of the function arguments , and propagates those constants into those functions .
GCC will now eliminate static variables whose usage was optimized out .
- fwhole - program -- combine can now be used to make all functions in program static allowing whole program optimization .
As an exception , the main function and all functions marked with the new externally_visible attribute are kept global so that programs can link with runtime libraries .
GCC can now do a form of partial dead code elimination ( PDCE ) that allows code motion of expressions to the paths where the result of the expression is actually needed .
This is not always a win , so the pass has been limited to only consider profitable cases .
Here is an example : int foo ( int * , int * ) ; int bar ( int d ) { int a , b , c ; b = d + 1 ; c = d + 2 ; a = b + c ; if ( d ) { foo ( &b , &c ) ; a = b + c ; } printf ( " %d
" , a ) ; } The a = b + c can be sunk to right before the printf .
Normal code sinking will not do this , it will sink the first one above into the else - branch of the conditional jump , which still gives you two copies of the code .
The can be sunk to right before the .
Normal code sinking will not do this , it will sink the first one above into the else - branch of the conditional jump , which still gives you two copies of the code .
GCC now has a value range propagation pass .
This allows the compiler to eliminate bounds checks and branches .
The results of the pass can also be used to accurately compute branch probabilities .
The pass to convert PHI nodes to straight - line code ( a form of if - conversion for GIMPLE ) has been improved significantly .
The two most significant improvements are an improved algorithm to determine the order in which the PHI nodes are considered , and an improvement that allow the pass to consider if - conversions of basic blocks with more than two predecessors .
Alias analysis improvements .
GCC can now differentiate between different fields of structures in Tree - SSA 's virtual operands form .
This lets stores / loads from non-overlapping structure fields not conflict .
A new algorithm to compute points - to sets was contributed that can allows GCC to see now that p-> a and p->b , where p is a pointer to a structure , can never point to the same field .
and , where is a pointer to a structure , can never point to the same field .
Various enhancements to auto-vectorization :
Incrementally preserve SSA form when vectorizing .
Incrementally preserve loop - closed form when vectorizing .
Improvements to peeling for alignment : generate better code when the misalignment of an access is known at compile time , or when different accesses are known to have the same misalignment , even if the misalignment amount itself is unknown .
Consider dependence distance in the vectorizer .
Externalize generic parts of data reference analysis to make this analysis available to other passes .
Vectorization of conditional code .
Reduction support .
GCC can now partition functions in sections of hot and cold code .
This can significantly improve performance due to better instruction cache locality .
This feature works best together with profile feedback driven optimization .
A new pass to avoid saving of unneeded arguments to the stack in vararg functions if the compiler can prove that they will not be needed .
functions if the compiler can prove that they will not be needed .
Transition of basic block profiling to tree level implementation has been completed .
The new implementation should be considerably more reliable ( hopefully avoiding profile mismatch errors when using - fprofile - use or - fbranch - probabilities ) and can be used to drive higher level optimizations , such as inlining .
The - ftree - based - profiling command - line option was removed and - fprofile - use now implies disabling old RTL level loop optimizer ( - fno - loop - optimize ) .
Speculative prefetching optimization ( originally enabled by - fspeculative - prefetching ) was removed .
New Languages and Language specific improvements
C and Objective - C
The old Bison - based C and Objective - C parser has been replaced by a new , faster hand - written recursive - descent parser .
Ada
The build infrastructure for the Ada runtime library and tools has been changed to be better integrated with the rest of the build infrastructure of GCC .
This should make doing cross builds of Ada a bit easier .
C++
ARM - style name - injection of friend declarations is no longer the default .
For example : struct S { friend void f( ) ; } ; void g( ) { f( ) ; } will not be accepted ; instead a declaration of f will need to be present outside of the scope of S .
The new - ffriend - injection option will enable the old behavior .
will not be accepted ; instead a declaration of will need to be present outside of the scope of .
The new option will enable the old behavior .
The ( undocumented ) extension which permitted templates with default arguments to be bound to template template parameters with fewer parameters has been deprecated , and will be removed in the next major release of G ++.
For example : template < template < typename > class C> void f( C < double > ) {} template < typename T , typename U = int > struct S {} ; template void f( S < double > ) ; makes use of the deprecated extension .
The reason this code is not valid ISO C++ is that S is a template with two parameters ; therefore , it can not be bound to C which has only one parameter .
Runtime Library ( libstdc + + )
Optimization work : A new implementation of std:: search_n is provided , better performing in case of random access iterators .
Added further efficient specializations of istream functions , i.e. , character array and string extractors .
Other smaller improvements throughout .
Policy - based associative containers , designed for high - performance , flexibility and semantic safety are delivered in ext / pb_assoc .
.
A versatile string class , __gnu_cxx :: __versa_string , providing facilities conforming to the standard requirements for basic_string , is delivered in < ext / vstring .h > .
In particular : Two base classes are provided : the default one avoids reference counting and is optimized for short strings ; the alternate one , still uses it while improving in a few low level areas ( e.g. , alignment ) .
See vstring_fwd.h for some useful typedefs .
Various algorithms have been rewritten ( e.g. , replace ) , the code streamlined and simple optimizations added .
Option 3 of DR 431 is implemented for both available bases , thus improving the support for stateful allocators .
, providing facilities conforming to the standard requirements for , is delivered in .
In particular : As usual , many bugs have been fixed ( e.g. , libstdc++/13583 , libstdc++/23953 ) and LWG resolutions put into effect for the first time ( e.g. , DR 280 , DR 464 , N1780 recommendations for DR 233 , TR1 Issue 6.19 ) .
The implementation status of TR1 is now tracked in the docs in tr1.html .
Objective - C++
A new language front end for Objective - C++ has been added .
This language allows users to mix the object oriented features of Objective - C with those of C ++.
Java ( GCJ )
Core library ( libgcj ) updates based on GNU Classpath 0.15 - 0.19 features ( plus some 0.20 bug - fixes ) Networking
The java.net .
HttpURLConnection implementation no longer buffers the entire response body in memory .
This means that response bodies larger than available memory can now be handled .
( N) IO NIO FileChannel.map implementation , fast bulk put implementation for DirectByteBuffer ( speeds up this method 10 x ) . FileChannel.lock ( ) and FileChannel.force ( ) implemented .
XML gnu.xml fix for nodes created outside a namespace context .
Add support for output indenting and cdata - section - elements output instruction in xml.transform .
xml.xpath corrections for cases where elements / attributes might have been created in non-namespace - aware mode .
Corrections to handling of XSL variables and minor conformance updates .
AWT GNU JAWT implementation , the AWT Native Interface , which allows direct access to native screen resources from within a Canvas 's paint method .
GNU Classpath Examples comes with a Demo , see libjava / classpath / examples / README .
awt.datatransfer updated to 1.5 with support for FlavorEvents .
The gtk + awt peers now allow copy / paste of text , images , URIs / files and serialized objects with other applications and tracking clipboard change events with gtk +
2.6 ( for gtk + 2.4 only text and serialized objects are supported ) .
A GNU Classpath Examples datatransfer Demo was added to show the new functionality .
Split gtk + awt peers event handling in two threads and improve gdk lock handling ( solves several awt lock ups ) .
Speed up awt Image loading .
Better gtk+ scrollbar peer implementation when using gtk+ >= 2.6 . Handle image loading errors correctly for gdkpixbuf and MediaTracker .
Better handle GDK lock .
Properly prefix gtkpeer native functions ( cp_gtk ) .
GdkGraphics2D has been updated to use Cairo 0.5.x or higher .
BufferedImage and GtkImage rewrites .
All image drawing operations should now work correctly ( flipping requires gtk+ >= 2.6 ) Future Graphics2D , image and text work is documented at : http://developer.classpath.org/mediation/ClasspathGraphicsImagesText
When gtk + 2.6 or higher is installed the default log handler will produce stack traces whenever a WARNING , CRITICAL or ERROR message is produced .
Free Swing
The RepaintManager has been reworked for more efficient painting , especially for large GUIs .
The layout manager OverlayLayout has been implemented , the BoxLayout has been rewritten to make use of the SizeRequirements utility class and caching for more efficient layout .
Improved accessibility support .
Significant progress has been made in the implementation of the javax .
swing .
plaf.metal package , with most UI delegates in a working state now .
Please test this with your own applications and provide feedback that will help us to improve this package .
The GUI demo ( gnu.classpath.examples.swing .Demo ) has been extended to highlight various features in our Free Swing implementation .
And it includes a look and feel switcher for Metal ( default ) , Ocean and GNU themes .
The javax.swing.plaf.multi package is now implemented .
Editing and several key actions for JTree and JTable were implemented .
Lots of icons and look and feel improvements for Free Swing basic and metal themes were added .
Try running the GNU Classpath Swing Demo in examples ( gnu.classpath.examples.swing .Demo ) with : - Dswing.defaultlaf=javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicLookAndFeel or - Dswing.defaultlaf=javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalLookAndFeel
Start of styled text capabilites for java .
swing .
text .
DefaultMutableTreeNode pre-order , post - order , depth - first and breadth - first traversal enumerations implemented .
JInternal Frame colors and titlebar draw properly .
JTree is working up to par ( icons , selection and keyboard traversal ) .
JMenus were made more compatible in visual and programmatic behavior .
JTable changeSelection and multiple selections implemented .
JButton and JToggleButton change states work properly now .
JFileChooser fixes . revalidate ( ) and repaint ( ) fixes which make Free Swing much more responsive .
MetalIconFactory implemented .
Free Swing Top - Level Compatibility .
JFrame , JDialog , JApplet , JInternalFrame , and JWindow are now 1.5 compatible in the sense that you can call add ( ) and setLayout ( ) directly on them , which will have the same effect as calling getContentPane ( ) .add ( ) and getContentPane ( ).setLayout ( ) .
The JTree interface has been completed .
JTree s now recognizes mouse clicks and selections work .
BoxLayout works properly now .
Fixed GrayFilter to actually work .
Metal SplitPane implemented .
Lots of Free Swing text and editor stuff work now .
Free RMI and Corba Andrew Watson , Vice President and Technical Director of the Object Management Group , has officially assigned us 20 bit Vendor Minor Code Id : 0x47430 ( " GC " ) that will mark remote classpath - specific system exceptions .
Obtaining the VMCID means that GNU Classpath now is a recogniseable type of node in a highly interoperable CORBA world .
GNU Classpath now includes the first working draft to support the RMI over IIOP protocol .
The current implementation is capable of remote invocations , transferring various Serializables and Externalizables via RMI - IIOP protocol .
It can flatten graphs and , at least for the simple cases , is interoperable with 1.5 JDKs .
org.omg .
PortableInterceptor and related functionality in other packages is now implemented :
The sever and client interceptors work as required since 1.4 .
The IOR interceptor works as needed for 1.5 .
The org.omg .
DynamicAny package is completed and passes the prepared tests .
The Portable Object Adapter should now support the output of the recent IDL to java compilers .
These compilers now generate servants and not CORBA objects as before , making the output depend on the existing POA implementation .
Completing POA means that such code can already be tried to run on Classpath .
Our POA is tested for the following usager scenarios : POA converts servant to the CORBA object .
Servant provides to the CORBA object .
POA activates new CORBA object with the given Object Id ( byte array ) that is later accessible for the servant .
During the first call , the ServantActivator provides servant for this and all subsequent calls on the current object .
During each call , the ServantLocator provides servant for this call only .
ServantLocator or ServantActivator forwards call to another server .
POA has a single servant , responsible for all objects .
POA has a default servant , but some objects are explicitly connected to they specific servants .
The POA is verified using tests from the former cost.omg.org .
The CORBA implementation is now a working prototype that should support features up to 1.3 inclusive .
We invite groups writing CORBA dependent applications to try Classpath implementation , reporting any possible bugs .
The CORBA prototype is interoperable with Sun 's implementation v 1.4 , transferring object references , primitive types , narrow and wide strings , arrays , structures , trees , abstract interfaces and value types ( feature of CORBA 2.3 ) between these two platforms .
Remote exceptions are transferred and handled correctly .
The stringified object references ( IORs ) from various sources are parsed as required .
The transient ( for current session ) and permanent ( till jre restart ) redirections work .
Both Little and Big Endian encoded messages are accepted .
The implementation is verified using tests from the former cost.omg.org .
The current release includes working examples ( see the examples directory ) , demonstrating the client - server communication , using either CORBA Request or IDL - based stub ( usually generated by a IDL to java compiler ) .
These examples also show how to use the Classpath CORBA naming service .
The IDL to java compiler is not yet written , but as our library must be compatible , it naturally accepts the output of other idlj implementations .
Misc Updated TimeZone data against Olson tzdata2005l .
Make zip and jar packages UTF - 8 clean .
" native " code builds and compiles ( warning free ) on Darwin and Solaris .
java.util.logging .
FileHandler now rotates files .
Start of a generic JDWP framework in gnu / classpath / jdwp .
This is unfinished , but feedback ( at classpath@gnu.org ) from runtime hackers is greatly appreciated .
Although most of the work is currently being done around gcj / gij we want this framework to be as VM neutral as possible .
Early design is described in : https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/java/2005-05/msg00260.html
QT4 AWT peers , enable by giving configure -- enable - qt - peer .
Included , but not ready for production yet .
They are explicitly disabled and not supported .
But if you want to help with the development of these new features we are interested in feedback .
You will have to explicitly enable them to try them out ( and they will most likely contain bugs ) .
Documentation fixes all over the place .
See http://developer.classpath.org/doc/
New Targets and Target Specific Improvements
IA-32/x86-64
The x86 - 64 medium model ( that allows building applications whose data segment exceeds 4GB ) was redesigned to match latest ABI draft .
New implementation split large datastructures into separate segment improving performance of accesses to small datastructures and also allows linking of small model libraries into medium model programs as long as the libraries are not accessing the large datastructures directly .
Medium model is also supported in position independent code now .
The ABI change results in partial incompatibility among medium model objects .
Linking medium model libraries ( or objects ) compiled with new compiler into medium model program compiled with older will likely result in exceeding ranges of relocations .
Binutils 2.16.91 or newer are required for compiling medium model now .
RS6000 ( POWER / PowerPC )
The AltiVec vector primitives in < altivec.h > are now implemented in a way that puts a smaller burden on the preprocessor , instead processing the " overloading " in the front ends .
This should benefit compilation speed on AltiVec vector code .
are now implemented in a way that puts a smaller burden on the preprocessor , instead processing the " overloading " in the front ends .
This should benefit compilation speed on AltiVec vector code .
AltiVec initializers now are generated more efficiently .
The popcountb instruction available on POWER5 now is generated .
The floating point round to integer instructions available on POWER5 + now is generated .
Floating point divides can be synthesized using the floating point reciprocal estimate instructions .
Double precision floating point constants are initialized as single precision values if they can be represented exactly .
S/390 , zSeries and System z9
Support for the IBM System z9 109 processor has been added .
When using the - march=z9 - 109 option , the compiler will generate code making use of instructions provided by the extended immediate facility .
option , the compiler will generate code making use of instructions provided by the extended immediate facility .
Support for 128 - bit IEEE floating point has been added .
When using the - mlong - double - 128 option , the compiler will map the long double data type to 128 - bit IEEE floating point .
Using this option constitutes an ABI change , and requires glibc support .
option , the compiler will map the data type to 128 - bit IEEE floating point .
Using this option constitutes an ABI change , and requires glibc support .
Various changes to improve performance of generated code have been implemented , including :
In functions that do not require a literal pool , register % r13 ( which is traditionally reserved as literal pool pointer ) , can now be freely used for other purposes by the compiler .
More precise tracking of register use allows the compiler to generate more efficient function prolog and epilog code in certain cases .
The SEARCH STRING , COMPARE LOGICAL STRING , and MOVE STRING instructions are now used to implement C string functions .
The MOVE CHARACTER instruction with single byte overlap is now used to implement the memset function with non-zero fill byte .
The LOAD ZERO instructions are now used where appropriate .
The INSERT CHARACTERS UNDER MASK , STORE CHARACTERS UNDER MASK , and INSERT IMMEDIATE instructions are now used more frequently to optimize bitfield operations .
The BRANCH ON COUNT instruction is now used more frequently .
In particular , the fact that a loop contains a subroutine call no longer prevents the compiler from using this instruction .
The compiler is now aware that all shift and rotate instructions implicitly truncate the shift count to six bits .
Back - end support for the following generic features has been implemented :
The full set of built - in functions for atomic memory access .
The - fstack - protector feature .
The optimization pass avoiding unnecessary stores of incoming argument registers in functions with variable argument list .
SPARC
The default code model in 64 - bit mode has been changed from Medium / Anywhere to Medium / Middle on Solaris .
TLS support is disabled by default on Solaris prior to release 10 .
It can be enabled on TLS - capable Solaris 9 versions ( 4/04 release and later ) by specifying -- enable - tls at configure time .
MorphoSys
Support has been added for this new architecture .
Obsolete Systems
Documentation improvements
Other significant improvements
GCC can now emit code for protecting applications from stack - smashing attacks .
The protection is realized by buffer overflow detection and reordering of stack variables to avoid pointer corruption .
Some built - in functions have been fortified to protect them against various buffer overflow ( and format string ) vulnerabilities .
Compared to the mudflap bounds checking feature , the safe builtins have far smaller overhead .
This means that programs built using safe builtins should not experience any measurable slowdown .
GCC 4.1.2
This is the list of problem reports ( PRs ) from GCC 's bug tracking system that are known to be fixed in the 4.1.2 release .
This list might not be complete ( that is , it is possible that some PRs that have been fixed are not listed here ) .
When generating code for a shared library , GCC now recognizes that global functions may be replaced when the program runs .
Therefore , it is now more conservative in deducing information from the bodies of functions .
For example , in this example :
void f( ) {} void g( ) { try { f( ) ; } catch ( ... ) { cout << " Exception " ; } }
G++ would previously have optimized away the catch clause , since it would have concluded that f cannot throw exceptions .
Because users may replace f with another function in the main body of the program , this optimization is unsafe , and is no longer performed .
If you wish G++ to continue to optimize as before , you must add a throw ( ) clause to the declaration of f to make clear that it does not throw exceptions .
Growing in vs. growing out Jason 51 comments Latest by Arlen
Now that Basecamp is 2.5 years old , we ’ve been getting some heat from a few folks who ’ve been with us since the beginning .
They are saying they are starting to grow out of the app .
Their businesses are becoming more complex and their requirements are changing .
They want us to change Basecamp to mirror their new - found complexity and requirements .
We ’re saying no .
And here ’s why :
We ’d rather our customers grow out of our products eventually than never be able to grow into them in the first place .
The problem with following the complexity curve of your customer ’s own businesses and requirements is that eventually your product becomes so complex that the barrier to entry is too high for new customers .
And then eventually you die with your current customers .
You may keep your current customers in the short term , but if no one new can fit through the door then eventually you ’re in trouble .
It ’s ok for software to be “ temporary . ”
Everything else is temporary , why not software ?
You probably do n’t use the same computer you did 5 years ago .
You probably do n’t live in the same apartment or have the same car either .
And you may be in a different relationship too .
Why are software companies afraid if people grow out of things after awhile ?
We ’re also saying no because we believe in simple tools no matter how complex your business is .
People are still people no matter what company they are part of .
People still need simple to - do lists , easy ways to communicate with their team , real - time group chat without audio and video overhead , a place to keep notes , etc .
A big complex company does n’t change these small simple needs .
Remember , unless you ’re Microsoft there are always more people that are n’t using your product than people that are .
Make sure you make it easy for new people to get in .
That ’s where your real continued growth potential is .
Disclaimer :
We are not suggesting that you do n’t pay attention to your current customers .
90 % of everything we add to our products originates in existing customer requests .
It ’s more that we acknowledge that people and situations change and we ca n’t be everything to everyone .
Companies need to be true to a type of customer more than a specific individual customer who ’s needs may change .
( e.g. Ferraris are made for people who like sportscars .
If you outgrow your Ferrari and need a minivan then you ’ve changed and need to look to another product ) .
I love Google .
And , by “ I love Google , ” I mean , “ Google is a direct competitor of the company from which I ’ve chosen to accept remuneration for services rendered , and it seems that there may be , at least according to some anecdotal evidence ( rumors , really ) , a possibility that the mere existence of Company G has had a negative impact on the financial standing of my company , and therefore my own net - worth as a stockholder , making it more and more difficult everyday to attain the goal I ’ve had since I was a little girl , which was that of buying a four - hundred horsepower speedboat , a pair of wraparound Oakleys , a cooler in which to store all my Schlitz , a bright red thong that I would wear over my pasty thighs , and a shotgun that I ’d use to defend my vessel in the event of a nuclear apocalypse in which people started riding around the world in boats run by beer ( ‘ cause there obviously would n’t be any gas , so the boats would HAVE to run on beer ) , ramming into each other and slitting throats just to get another can of Coors Lite for the engine , which is a situation that could easily be summed up as ‘ Mad Max meets Waterworld meets the Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson porn video ( which I ’ve never watched , so I would n’t know ) . ’
Therefore , I hope that a new and rare breed of termites evolves which only feeds on Google servers and eventually tears the company down to its foundations ( literally ) , leaving the founders , the employees , their families , and their children all broke , starving , and learning pretty damned quickly that searching for a sandwich on the street and for change in your couch is very different from cashing in stock options and googling for shops on the internet where you can spend your bajillions . ”
That ’s what I mean .
So , obviously , I love Google .
“ Why ? ” you might ask .
That would be a stupid question .
I just wrote the world ’s longest sentence back there to explain why I love Google .
So do n’t ask that question .
Ask another one , and do n’t ask me .
Ask somebody who cares , like the wall or the ashes of your dead cat that you keep in an urn on the mantle in spite of the fact that it ’s really weird to do that .
What I will do , since you ’re being so insistent that I relay the tale , is explain why , for once , I do n’t see Google as a menace to my whole way of life as well as a useful tool for finding information on the vast network of horse - pee - porn web sites we collectively refer to as The Internet .
It began on April 24th in the Year of Our Lord , 2006 , when Some Girl in Some State typed my name into Company G’s search engine :
She was looking for some movie star named Rory and clicked on my page since it ’s the first Google search result for “ Rory ” ( oh , yeah – BAM – put thaton a business card – YEAH ) .
Then she read my site .
And then again .
And , according to the email she sent me afterward , she read it again .
And then one more time in case she missed something .
She did n’t miss anything , but it ’s good she was thorough .
In the email she sent , she was all like this :
lol dude ur awsome lol lollllll
So I wrote back and I was all like this :
totally ur lol 2 lol !!!!
And then we started emailing each other back and forth , and it turned out she was a hell of a writer .
We eventually started sending each other 3,000 – 6,000 word emails .
She ’s part of the reason Neopoleon is n’t updated as often as it used to be .
By now , only three months later , we ’ve probably sent the equivalent of a couple novels to each other .
Not just any novels , either , but those big novels that smart people used to write back when people had attention spans that lasted longer than I feel hungry and my toes are warm apple pie is good OK .
Then we started texting each other , and it was n’t much better .
You know when you try to call someone and the stupid electronic voice is like all , “ All circuits are busy , ” and you get all mad ?
Yeah .
That ’s us .
Writing novels back and forth on our mobiles .
After that came the talking , and there is n’t a full - duplex system that is either full or duplex enough to handle the conversational exchanges we have .
Imagine two streams of data flying right past each other at the same time , each syllable communicating in bits the rough equivalent of a volume of an encyclopedia ( pick any encyclopedia you want for this thought exercise , but do n’t pick a kid ’s one or something because they ’re mostly pictures and so OK ? ) .
That ’s what our talks were like .
We would have had these chats in person , but the problem is that she lives in a state called “ Michigan ” which is a suburb of the North Pole :
Long story short , I decided to go to the suburb of the North Pole where she lived .
That ’s what I did this weekend .
I went there .
And my friends and family thought I was crazy .
And her friends and family thought I was crazy .
They thought she was crazy , too , but because I ’m the guy , I ’m obviously the crazier one .
Her friends and family were freaked out because we met through a Google search , and they figured I was this guy :
My friends and family were freaked out because we met through a Google search , and they figured “ she ” was this mildly retarded elderly perverted guy with a mysterious skin rash :
What happened instead was that she turned out to be exactly what I was hoping for , and I turned out to be , like , everything she ever possibly could have wanted times ONE SPUJILLION SQUARED .
And what did I do ?
Did I try to chop her head off , remove her face , and then wear it as a mask for laughs ?
No .
I mean , that would have been funny , but I did n’t think of it at the time , so I did n’t do it .
Plus , my axe made her uneasy , so she usually asked me to keep it in the car .
She ’d be all , “ Why do you carry that blood - stained axe everywhere ? ” but then I ’d get all like , “ What ’s the name of your mysterious facial skin rash ? ” and then she ’d be all “ Touché ! ” and then I ’d be like all , “ I DON ’T THINK SO . ”
And what did she do ?
Did “ she ” really turn out to be a “ he ” who had a problem keeping his pants buttoned up and around his waist while discharging thick yellow fluids from the erupting pustules covering his face which sat just in front of an IQ 57 brain ?
No .
We got him a belt , and then his pants stopped falling down , and everything was cool .
Fortunately , just for the sake of demonstrating what idiots and freaks we are , I happen to have a photograph of the axe - wielding internet murderer ( myself ) and his prey , the elderly maletard whose face leaks pus like a thatched grass roof that ’s just been hit by a large chunk of acne hail that ’s starting to melt :
As if we did n't know it already , the conflict in Lebanon shows that truth and war do n't mix .
All parties to the tragedy of the Middle East resort to disinformation and historical falsification to bolster their case , but rarely has an attempt to rewrite the past occurred so soon after the fact .
Israeli ministers and their supporters have justified the bombardment of Lebanon as " a matter of survival " .
Total war has been declared on Israel , so Israel is entitled to use the methods of total war in self - defence .
This would be reasonable if it were true , but it is n't .
It 's completely false .
The conflict was triggered by a Hizbullah operation in which two Israeli soldiers were captured and three killed .
Let 's be frank , this was n't exactly the Tet offensive .
It certainly did n't justify Israel 's ferocious onslaught against the very fabric of Lebanese society .
Yes , the rocket attacks on Haifa are an appalling crime , but they followed rather than preceded Israel 's decision to escalate the fighting .
They cannot provide retrospective justification for Israeli strategy .
The crisis has also been accompanied by the selective and often inappropriate use of the term " terrorism " .
Following the Israeli government , George Bush and Tony Blair were at it again on Friday , blaming " terrorists " for sparking the conflict .
The purpose behind this is obvious enough .
In the context of America 's war on terror , anyone claiming to be engaged in the fight against this most contested of notions gets carte blanche to do as they please .
But the result has been to politicise the term in ways that render it effectively useless as a category of moral judgment or policy analysis .
It is certainly true that Hizbullah has been linked to a string of classic terrorist attacks going back more than 20 years , including suicide bombings against civilian targets , hostage - taking and the hijacking of a TWA flight .
A particularly vile example was the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires in which 85 people were murdered .
Hizbullah strongly denies involvement , but the truth is probably murkier than either side pretends .
Responsibility for these attacks has often been attributed to Hizbullah 's External Security Organisation ( ESO ) , a unit believed to be under the operational control of Iranian intelligence rather than the Hizbullah 's Lebanese leadership .
Britain is one country that draws this distinction , proscribing ESO , but not Hizbullah itself , under the Terrorism Act .
Interestingly , some of the earliest suicide bombings commonly attributed to Hizbullah , such as the 1983 attacks on the US embassy and marine barracks in Beirut , were believed by American intelligence sources at the time to have been orchestrated by the Iraqi Dawa party .
Hizbullah barely existed in 1983 and Dawa cadres are said to have been instrumental in setting it up at Tehran 's behest .
Dawa 's current leadership includes none other than the new Iraqi prime minister , Nuri al - Maliki , feted last week in London and Washington as the great hope for the future of the Middle East .
As the old saying goes , today 's terrorist is tomorrow 's statesman - at least when it suits us .
None of this should be read as exonerating Hizbullah of the charge that it uses terrorist tactics .
Irrespective of anything else , the use of Katyusha rockets against Israeli population centres is clearly intended to inflict terror and suffering on civilians .
It deserves a response .
But the allegations of terrorism levelled at Hizbullah ( as well as Hamas and other groups ) by America and Israel go well beyond the targeting of non-combatants .
The US state department 's annual reports on terrorism also list operations carried out against the Israeli Defence Force as examples of terrorism .
The US government justifies this conclusion by way of a logical contortion that defines Israeli troops as " non-combatants " , despite the fact that Israel continues to occupy territory in Lebanon and Palestine with military force .
The intention is not just to stamp out terrorism as commonly understood , but also to stigmatise perfectly legitimate acts of resistance .
Terrorism has always been extraordinarily difficult to define , but the American approach lacks any pretence at objectivity , thus making the term utterly meaningless .
Used in this way , terrorism becomes simply " political violence of which we disapprove " .
The answer , of course , must not be to abandon any attempt to distinguish between right and wrong in the use of force .
There need to be standards if we are to prevent the free - for - all of violence without limit .
But these standards must be disinterested , legitimate and robust .
As it happens , most of what we need is adequately provided for in international humanitarian law .
Numerous treaties and judgments from the Geneva conventions onwards set out quite detailed rules governing the use of force , including the principles of proportionality and civilian immunity .
Under international law , there can be no doubt that many of the actions carried out by Hizbullah and Hamas constitute war crimes that must be punished .
The reason it has been disregarded for the purposes of fighting terrorism is that , rather inconveniently for the governments concerned , it applies to states as well as non-state groups .
Accepting it would leave them open to unwanted scrutiny and possibly even prosecution for war crimes of their own .
In the case of the Israeli government , it is n't hard to see why .
Israeli doctrine eschews the principle of proportionality in favour of massive retaliation , as has been amply demonstrated in Lebanon and Gaza .
Despite Israel 's protestations that it is doing everything it can to avoid civilian casualties , it is clear that its military strategy is aimed at maximising the suffering of the Lebanese people as a whole .
This was declared quite openly on day one of the campaign , when Israel 's chief of staff , General Dan Halutz , promised to " turn back the clock in Lebanon by 20 years " , and confirmed again yesterday with the horrific slaughter at Qana .
The approach is identical to the one taken in similar operations in 1996 and 1993 , when Yitzhak Rabin admitted : " The goal of the operation is to get the southern Lebanese population to move northward , hoping that this will tell the Lebanese government something about the refugees , who may get as far north as Beirut . "
Populations will move like this only if they are in fear of their lives .
The same applies to Gaza , where the pretence at discrimination is even thinner and Palestinian civilians are being subjected to a brutal siege and acts of violence that have no military justification .
As in Lebanon , the intention is to force civilians to turn on the militias by inflicting as much pain and suffering as the Israeli government thinks it can get away with .
What is this if it is not terrorism ?
It is certainly a war crime .
So let 's hear no more hypocritical utterances about the evils of terrorism from Bush and Blair .
Not until they are able to speak with genuine moral authority by condemning all forms of illegal violence , irrespective of who commits them .

After all that fuss over Kirsten Dunst ’s hair in the photo shoot for her September Vogue cover , the first images of the cover have surfaced .
And I must sayâ€¦ it ’s quite unexpected .
Who knew Vogue would take that ‘ Marie Antoinette ’ look and put it on their cover .
Very different , very risquÃ© .
Looks like they didnâ€™t need Kirsten to have good hair after allâ€ ¦
What exactly does it take to kill someone ?
Here 's how 21 - year - old West Texas Army Pvt. Steven Green described shooting a man who refused to stop at an Iraqi checkpoint : " It was like nothing .
Over here , killing people is like squashing an ant .
I mean , you kill somebody , and it 's like , ' All right , let 's go get some pizza , ' " he told the military newspaper Stars & Stripes .
" I mean , I thought killing somebody would be this life - changing experience .
And then I did it , and I was like , ' All right , whatever . ' "
[ Podcast : Vicki Haddock and John Koopman on Killing 101 . ]
In February , the soldier 's comments struck embedded correspondent Andrew Tilghman as unremarkable , a reflection of the fact that he and Green were immersed in the treacherous hellhole of Mahmoudiya , at the edge of what GIs have dubbed the Triangle of Death .
Green 's statements did n't even make it into the Stars & Stripes article , which ran earlier this year .
It was only recently -- when the honorably discharged soldier appeared in federal court pleading not guilty to the rape of a 14 - year - old Iraqi girl and the cold - blooded murder of her family -- that Tilghman recalled the quotes with a newfound chill .
The reality is that the brains of human beings -- unless they fall within the demographic sliver we call psychopaths -- are hardwired not to kill other humans .
Like rattlesnakes that fatally bite other species but fight fellow rattlers by wrestling them , humans overwhelmingly recoil from homicide .
That 's usually a good thing , because it prevents society from disintegrating into bloodthirsty anarchy .
But it poses an occupational hazard to some -- particularly soldiers , police officers , spies and victims of savage crimes .
All of them may face situations in which hesitating to kill is the surest way to get killed .
That 's why military training camps , police academies and even some self - defense pros are constantly searching for more effective methods of suppressing the human revulsion to taking human life -- virtually rewiring the brain to react first in certain situations with an automatic response to kill .
Target practice on hollowed cabbages filled with ketchup to mimic the way a bullet rips open a human head .
Marching to chants of " kill , kill , kill . "
Video game simulations that reward points for every successful " shot . "
These are among hundreds of techniques that experts say can recondition the human brain .
What that reconditioning requires , and the psychological toll it ultimately takes on the killers , make up the taboo scientific inquiry sometimes known as " killology . "
To outsiders , the subject is distasteful , even repellant .
To practitioners , it is simply a fact of life -- and death .
" Once the bullets start flying , most combatants stop thinking with the forebrain ( that portion of the brain that makes us human ) and start thinking with the midbrain ( the primitive portion of our brain , which is indistinguishable from that of an animal ) , " writes retired Lt. Col .
Dave Grossman , a former U.S. Army ranger and West Point professor of military science who coined the term , on his Web site killology.com .
" In conflict situations , this primitive , midbrain processing can be observed in the existence of a powerful resistance to killing one 's own kind .
...
This is an essential survival mechanism that prevents a species from destroying itself during territorial and mating rituals . "
The only thing that has any hope of silencing the midbrain , he argues , is what influenced Pavlov 's dogs : conditioning .
The need for new drills became apparent once researchers noted that a majority who had been trained in other ways to kill , surreptitiously refused to do it .
In World War II , when U.S. soldiers got a clear shot at the enemy , only about 1 in 5 actually fired , according to sensational and controversial research by Army historian Brig .
Gen. S.L.A. Marshall .
It was n't that they were cowards :
On the contrary , they performed other perilous feats , including running onto the battlefield to rescue fellow soldiers , and sometimes they even placed themselves in greater personal danger by refusing to fire .
And yet at the moment of truth , they just could n't kill .
While modern scholars have debated his methodology , other contemporary researchers have reached conclusions similar to Marshall 's that " fear of killing , rather than the fear of being killed , was the most common cause of battle failure in the individual . "
Go back even further in U.S. history .
Grossman noted this " Civil War Collector 's Encyclopedia " citation about recovered muskets after the Battle of Gettysburg : Almost 90 percent were loaded , half of those multiple times .
Given that a Civil War soldier would spend 95 percent of his time laboriously loading his musket and only 5 percent aiming and firing it , that many loaded muskets seems to make sense only if the soldiers in battle were faking it -- all the while looking busy so that their comrades would never know the difference .
The FBI discovered a similar problem among law enforcement officers through the early 1960s : a startling number were refusing to fire at suspects even when other lives were endangered .
Even those who fired their weapons were not necessarily trying to kill -- it is hard for an observer to detect soldiers or cops who fire high to intentionally miss .
Psychologists who advised the military and law enforcement agencies began to push for changes that would revolutionize training to improve kill rates .
Their methods -- familiar to those who operate boot camps , police academies and aggressive - response self - defense courses -- are a distasteful mystery to most in the outside world .
But they work .
The Pentagon improved firing rates .
Research suggests that 55 percent of U.S. soldiers fired on the enemy in the Korean War .
By Vietnam that rate had climbed to more than 90 percent .
Police studies document similar changes in recent decades .
One of the key changes was to get rid of the old firing ranges , where shooters took target practice in an open field aiming at a bull 's - eye .
This failed miserably at preparing shooters for real - world confrontations .
Today 's apprentice killers train in situations designed to simulate combat as closely as possible , and they rehearse in a fashion that would be instantly recognizable to pioneers of behavior modification , from Ivan Pavlov to B.F. Skinner .
The bull 's - eyes have been replaced by human - shaped targets that pop up without warning , for example , with polyurethane faces on balloon bodies inside uniforms .
A trainee spots the targets , fires almost on instinct and gets rewarded with points , badges and three - day passes .
Over and over , these " kill drills " build muscle memory and acclimate the brain to the act of killing .
Aggressive self - defense courses filled with students who may be more hesitant to go for the jugular use similar rehearsals to form a kinetic memory of how to react if attacked .
Instructors may push students to overcome their squeamishness by , for example , taping a peeled orange over an actor 's eye and having students practice sticking their thumbs into it .
But most apprentice killers have had years of moral training reinforcing the commandment " thou shalt not kill . "
Suppressing that is the greatest challenge of killology .
Some training focuses on rationales for killing -- to overcome an enemy that threatens the " American way of life " or " wages war against freedom " or simply trying to kill innocent victims .
But a key part of many programs is to make killing more palatable -- even socially acceptable and desirable .
Consider an excerpt of a lecture on mines to Marines at Parris Island , who grunted their approval .
" You want to rip ( the enemy 's ) eyeballs out , you want to tear apart his love machine , you want to destroy him , privates .
... You want to send him home in a Glad bag to his mommy ! "
Such bloodthirsty language helps " desensitize them to the suffering of an ' enemy ' at the same time they are being indoctrinated in the most explicit fashion , as previous generations of soldiers were not , with the notion that their purpose is not just to be brave and to fight well ; it is to kill people , " observes military historian Gwynne Dyer in his book " War : The Lethal Custom . "
Another technique is to create physical and emotional distance between the killer and the target by fostering a sense of us versus them .
While physical distance is achieved with bombs , rocket launchers and even night - vision goggles , which reduce humans to ghostly green silhouettes , emotional distance often is achieved by categorizing targets as different because of their race , ethnicity or religion .
The military does whatever it can to deny the fellow humanity of enemy soldiers and is loath to repeat the spectacle of Christmas Day in 1914 , when German and British soldiers crawled out of their trenches to share cigarettes , candy and soccer .
In his autobiography , top Marine sniper Jack Coughlin writes from Iraq : " So far in this war I had fired six shots and had six kills -- exactly the right ratio .
I considered the ill - trained , poorly led soldiers of Iraq to be hamburger in my scope , practically begging me to kill them , and I was more than ready to grant their wish . "
Social dynamics often are critical as well .
Soldiers and cops forge deep bonds with their colleagues and some studies report that their greatest fear on the battlefield or in the line of fire is not dying but letting their buddies down -- a potent motivator for killing .
And finally , organizations like armies and police forces rely on elaborate codes and strict authority figures who order killing to be done .
In a most amazing and famous demonstration , Yale psychologist Stanley Milgram established that almost two - thirds of people would be willing to administer shocks to others -- even to the point of a lethal 450 volts -- simply because they were ordered to do so by a scientist in a white lab coat .
The institutions that teach killing emphasize that they do so with built - in safeguards against indiscriminate violence .
Their pupils know , at least theoretically , that if they fire in an unauthorized way , they can be ostracized , washed out , charged or court - martialed .
In his seminal work " On Killing , " Grossman takes pains to distinguish that kind of training from violent video games , which mimic the techniques of operant conditioning and desensitization without any of the safeguards .
But as the rape and homicide charges against Pfc. Green and four of his fellow soldiers show , in rare instances the safeguards simply fail .
Atrocities result .
A more pervasive risk , however , is that soldiers and cops who kill pay a steep psychological price for not only using the new skills they acquire but also for acquiring the skills in the first place .
The Pentagon is waging an unprecedented campaign to deal with the mental and emotional scars of combat in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Turning human beings into killers is a tricky business .
Bill Strickland can tell you when his life began :
It was a Wednesday afternoon in September 1963 .

And he can tell you how it began :
It started with a lump of clay .
Strickland , then a 16 - year - old black kid , was bored by school and hemmed in by life in a decaying Pittsburgh neighborhood .
He wanted a way out , but he did n’t have a clue about how to find it – until that Wednesday afternoon , when he went wandering through the hallways of his high school .
It ’s a moment etched so clearly in his memory that , 35 years later , he can still recall the quality of the sunlight streaming in through the school windows .
That ’s the day he came face to face with hope .
Looking through an open classroom door , Strickland saw something he ’d never seen before : a rotating mound of clay being shaped into a vessel by a man absorbed in his work .
“ If ever in life there is a clairvoyant experience , I had one that day , ” says Strickland , now 51 .
“ I saw a radiant and hopeful image of how the world ought to be .
It opened up a portal for me that suggested that there might be a whole range of possibilities and experiences that I had not explored .
It was night and day – literally .
I saw a line and I thought :
This is dark , and this is light .
And I need to go where the light is . ”
So Strickland walked into the sunlit classroom , introduced himself to ceramics teacher Frank Ross , the man at the potter ’s wheel , and said , “ I ’d like to learn whatever that is . ”
With Ross as his mentor for nearly 20 years , Strickland not only found the way out – one that led to college – he also found the way in : the path that lets one person make all the difference in the world .
He mastered the art of social entrepreneurship , applying his potter ’s hands to reshape the business of social change .
As a result , the people who now work with him and come to his programs at the Manchester Craftsmen ’s Guild ( MCG ) and at the Bidwell Training Center Inc. ( BTC ) – his Pittsburgh - based organizations for urban change – will tell you that the day Bill Strickland walked into that ceramics classroom was the day that he began reinventing this country ’s approach to social entrepreneurship .

For nearly three decades , Strickland has worked at his craft back in the same Pittsburgh neighborhood he grew up in – creating a model for turning people with dead - end lives into productive workers .
And it ’s working .
In the Manchester neighborhood of Pittsburgh ’s North Side , Strickland has forged a series of programs to bring new life to the community .
At one end of the lifeline is the MCG , which aims to rescue at - risk school kids by using the arts to teach them life skills .
At the other end is the BTC , an innovative partnership with local companies to train displaced adults for real work in real jobs .
Since their inception , the two programs have each grown into more than $ 3 million - a- year operations , with a combined staff of 110 people .
Strickland serves as president and CEO , the linchpin that holds all of the parts together .
And there ’s more .
Like any true entrepreneur , Strickland has filled the space between the two programs with other ventures : a jazz concert hall and an innovative Grammy Award - winning record label .
Next year , he plans to roll out the Denali Initiative – a national three - year effort funded by the Kaufmann Foundation to teach nonprofit leaders how to think like entrepreneurs .
The source of it all is Strickland ’s single flash of insight on that long - ago Wednesday afternoon .
“ You start with the perception that the world is an unlimited opportunity , ” Strickland says .
“ Then the question becomes , ‘ How are we going to rebuild the planet ? ' ”
The question may seem presumptuous , but plenty of people think that Strickland not only has the right to ask it , but that he has also discovered some of the answers .
Although he is n’t dealing in big numbers – his combined programs reach about 400 kids and 475 adults each year – Strickland is dealing in success :
For the past five years , 75 % to 80 % of the high - risk high - school kids who ’ve come to his after - school arts program have gone on to college .
At the same time , 78 % of the adults who graduate from his vocational program find jobs .
Just as impressive as the numbers are Strickland ’s supporters and believers .
There ’s George Bush , who named Strickland to a six - year term on the board of the National Endowment for the Arts .
And there ’s Hillary Rodham Clinton , who visited Strickland ’s center – and then invited Strickland to visit the White House .
advertisement
There ’s the Harvard Business School – which hailed Strickland as a “ social entrepreneur . ”
And there ’s the Harvard Graduate School of Education – which invited him to share with its students his lessons on teaching .
There ’s San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown and jazz musician Herbie Hancock , who teamed up with Strickland to replicate his Pittsburgh program in San Francisco – an undertaking that Strickland hopes will be the first of 100 “ franchises ” that he plans to set up nationwide over the next 30 years .
And there ’s the MacArthur Foundation , which awarded Strickland a $ 295,000 “ genius ” grant in 1996 .
Not bad for a man who , 30 years ago , set out to learn how to throw a pot .
“ This is my clay ” Bill Strickland ’s story starts in the 1950s , when the Manchester community he grew up in was filled with neat row houses and green trees .
People in the neighborhood could find good jobs nearby in thriving small businesses and at prosperous industrial firms such as Allis - Chalmers , Steel City Electric , and Midland - Ross Corp .
The neighborhood was culturally rich , a melting pot of roughly 40,000 people .
But in the early 1960s , hard times caused many local businesses to shrink or shut down .
The character of the community began to change .
And Strickland , a teenager , felt his world narrowing .
“ I ’d watched my neighborhood go from a healthy community to a ghetto .
I needed to find a way out , ” he says .
“ But there were n’t many examples of successful people in my community who could serve as role models . ”
And then came that day in high school when Strickland discovered Frank Ross , ceramics , and the possibility that the world might have something more to offer .
advertisement
“ Mr. Ross brought a kind of gutsy quality to public education that said , ‘ Look , there ’s nothing wrong with you .
There ’s a lot wrong with the circumstances that you find yourself in . ' ”
Strickland says .
“ He said , ‘ You have the talent and the resources to take control of your life and to do something more than you ’ve done up to this point . ’
And I believed him . ”
After that first encounter , Strickland devoted his remaining two years in high school to learning everything that Ross could teach him .
When he graduated in 1965 , Strickland went on to the University of Pittsburgh , entering on probation because he ’d neglected his high school academics in favor of ceramics .
But he quickly proved himself , landing on the dean ’s list by the end of his first year – and winding up on the university ’s board of trustees 32 years later .
Even as his world expanded during college , Strickland remained bound to the old neighborhood .
Then , in 1968 , when the social upheaval and rioting that were rocking the nation reached Manchester , Strickland decided it was time for him to do something to bring hope back to the streets .
While still in college , he opened the Manchester Craftsmen ’s Guild , an after - school program to teach neighborhood children the same pottery skills that had originally motivated him .
A local Episcopalian church donated space for the program in the basement of a row house .
After college , Strickland continued his work with MCG , building a staff of volunteers , and earning a name for himself as a local activist .
He ran the program on an annual budget of less than $ 50,000 , cobbling together funds from small grants , and from contributions by community leaders who had begun to support his work .
Three years later , a second piece of Strickland ’s program fell into place :
He was asked to take over the Bidwell Training Center , a three - year - old neighborhood vocational - training program .
Like MCG , BTC had been started in response to the 1968 riots .
But the Presbyterian church that had administered the program had run afoul of the Internal Revenue Service for failing to pay withholding taxes .
The options :
Shut down the program – or find somebody to take it over and rebuild it .
Strickland was the ideal candidate – and he accepted the challenge .
The way he saw it , BTC offered him an opportunity to play out his ideas on a larger stage .
On the surface , however , it was an unlikely marriage of programs : arts and kids on the one hand , vocational training and adults on the other .
But to Strickland , combining the programs meant he could approach community rebuilding from two directions : by saving troubled kids and getting them on to college ; and by reclaiming adults who ’d been discarded and giving them the opportunity to make a second start in life .
advertisement
For the next decade , Strickland worked at both programs , quietly forming his own vision of social change , and attracting people to his cause .
By 1983 , Strickland was ready to take a new leap , ratcheting up both programs to have more impact and more presence .
The move was equal parts vision and audacity : With $ 112 in the bank , he launched a fund - raising drive to construct an $ 8 million building on the site of an abandoned industrial park .
What might have been a futile gesture turned into a natural expansion .
For years , Strickland had nurtured relationships with business and community leaders ; now that work paid off .
In three years , he raised enough money from foundations , corporations , and government sources to build a showplace , a center for social innovation that would allow him to demonstrate exactly how his ideas worked – and what they could do .
Designed by a pupil of Frank Lloyd Wright , the 62,000 - square - foot , honey - colored brick building houses Strickland ’s vision of a thriving community - learning center .
Each day , struggling high schoolers and adult vocational students enter a stunning building of arches and circles designed to allow the sun to pour through – the way Strickland remembers the light in Ross ’s ceramics studio .
“ The worst thing about being poor is what it does to your spirit , ” says Strickland , “ not just your wallet .
I wanted to build something that would give the people who come here a vision of what life could be , to create an environment that says that life is good . ”
Strickland ’s done that – and more .
He ’s brought all of his talents as an artist to bear to create a template for social change .
“ The planet ’s changing , ” says Strickland .
“ The whole culture , the language , the relationships – it ’s all new .
The millennium is defining a different kind of artist , a different kind of entrepreneur , a different kind of leader than we ’ve known before .
This is my clay . ”
“ Entrepreneurs and artists are interchangeable ” It ’s a typical classroom : Computers are lined along one wall , a few dozen institutional chairs with attached desktops are gathered in the center of the room .
A bunch of ninth - grade students crack jokes or ask questions as they consider a fable about a cat and a fox .
But there is something just a bit , well , odd in this learning situation .
First , there are the questions :
One teenage boy asks , “ Are we allowed to sew today ? ”
And there are the materials : strips of papier - mache , bits of fabric , and pieces of string scattered everywhere .
advertisement
The subject is a fable .
But the teaching method is pure Manchester Craftsmen ’s Guild .
These students – most of them considered “ at risk ” by the public school that has sent them here – are making puppets of the two lead characters in the fable .
They ’ve made papier - mache heads and bodies , and now they ’re sewing small costumes by hand .
Their work is the hands - on , creative phase of a lesson that began one month earlier .
The Puppet Project , as it ’s called , started with a discussion of folktales , focusing on the way that stories can teach morals .
The students watched a video of Pinocchio and discussed the story ’s lessons .
Next they wrote a folktale of their own , with a clearly defined moral .
Then they studied the fable of the cat and the fox .
And now they ’re learning to approach the fable as an artistic endeavor – a hands - on , problem - solving exercise of constructing puppets that they will then use to stage the fable as a play .
This is Bill Strickland ’s take on the art of learning .
It ’s got little to do with tradition , plenty to do with education , and everything to do with art .
For three hours a day , these students come from nearby David B. Oliver High School – Strickland ’s alma mater – to study at MCG .
The medium is art – the teaching staff uses photography , ceramics , painting , and drawing to convey academic subjects .
The message is life .
This part of Strickland ’s program , called the Arts Collaborative , costs $ 500,000 a year , an operating budget that is funded by local foundations .
Like MCG ’s after - school arts program , it builds on mentoring relationships that create educational learning and individual self - knowledge .
Unlike that project , which runs as a voluntary arts - education drop - in center , attendance at the Arts Collaborative initiative counts for part of an accredited school day for participating kids from Oliver High School .
So far , it ’s working – and working more effectively than Oliver High School .
The numbers tell the story : According to an independent consultant ’s analysis of the program ’s first two years , students in the Arts Collaborative missed far fewer days of class than did their peers at Oliver High School .
And their grade - point averages were better – by a half - point for ninth graders and three - quarters of a point for tenth graders .
The use of art to change students ’ attitudes is at the heart of Strickland ’s vision of education .
The goal is not to produce artists .
It ’s to find an individually tailored approach to learning that will redirect troubled young people , and get them into college and on to productive lives .
But Strickland does see a connection between the creativity instilled by a love of the arts , and the skills needed for business success in the new economy .

“ Artists are by nature entrepreneurs , they ’re just not called that , ” Strickland says .
“ They have the ability to visualize something that does n’t exist , to look at a canvas and see a painting .
Entrepreneurs do that .
That ’s what makes them different from businesspeople .
Businesspeople are essentially administrators .
Entrepreneurs are by definition visionaries .
Entrepreneurs and artists are interchangeable in many ways .
The hip companies know that . ”
“ There has got to be a deal here ”
It ’s 4:15 on a foggy , drizzly April afternoon , and inside one of the amphitheater - style classrooms at the Harvard Business School , the subject is Bill Strickland .
There are 145 students in the room – leaders of nonprofit organizations from across America and Europe .
They ’re here as part of an Executive Education seminar hosted by the school ’s Initiative for Social Enterprise .
Most of the people in this room have just had their first exposure to Strickland :
They have finished reading a 22 - page case study ; set in 1993 , the case lays out the situation that Strickland and his twin programs faced at that time .
Under the gentle prodding of visiting professor John Vogel , the nonprofit leaders voice their opinions of Strickland and his work : “ It ’s one of the most moving case studies I ’ve ever read , ” offers one .
“ He consistently challenged the community to help itself , ” says another .
“ It ’s a customer - focused organization , ” comments a third .
But they remain divided on the big question raised in the case study :
Where should Strickland focus his next efforts ?
Should he concentrate on fund - raising for BTC , which at the time had a dicey record of getting money from the state government ?
Should he expand his operation into a real - estate development project ?
Should his for - profit food - services company – a spin - off of BTC ’s culinary training program – make a bid to manage the employee cafeteria at the newly expanded Pittsburgh International Airport ?
Or should he try to franchise his programs in other cities ?
The choices that Strickland faced back in 1993 prompt a heated debate among the students .
Everyone has an opinion about which strategic move Strickland should make , but no clear consensus emerges in the room .
One thing is clear : Nobody – absolutely nobody – thinks that it makes sense for Strickland to pursue all four options simultaneously .

When the debate ends , Strickland stands up .
In his usual , understated way , he announces , “ I ’ve got some pictures to show you of what I do for a living . ”
And then he proceeds to blow everyone in the room away :
As Strickland runs through his slide show , it becomes clear that what he did back in 1993 was , in fact , to pursue all four of the case - study options .
Simultaneously .
Yes , he concentrated on fund - raising : Through relationships built with Pennsylvania statehouse politicians , Strickland secured a permanent place for BTC as a line item in the state budget , guaranteeing funds of $ 3.5 million a year .
Yes , he pursued the real - estate development option :
He just broke ground on a new project – a 60,000 - square - foot office building that will sit across from the existing facility .
Part of the space will be used to accommodate expanded training programs for BTC .
But the new building will also turn Strickland into a commercial landlord : UPMC Health Systems at the University of Pittsburgh has committed to leasing 30,000 square feet of office space .
As for the bid on the employee cafeteria at the airport , yes , his food - services company made a bid and got the contract .
No , it did n’t work out .
But he ’s continued to build the food services company – which has revenues of about $ 1.5 million – and this year expects it to show its first profit .
What ’s more , Strickland is now aiming for a food - services contract with Pennsylvania ’s turnpike authority , a deal worth roughly $ 250 million a year .
And franchising ?
Yes , that ’s going forward as well .
In fact , Strickland reports , he has just teamed up with San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown and musician Herbie Hancock to build a project in a poor neighborhood on the shores of the San Francisco Bay .
If all goes according to plan , the San Francisco program will be up and running in three years .
Strickland winds up his comments by turning the spotlight back onto his peers in the room .
“ If this country has a future , ” he says , “ it ’s because of you guys .
Because of your ability to form visions and to form partnerships .
I believe that we can change the United States of America in my lifetime , and I ’m not out of my mind .
We ’ve got to change the way this country sees itself . ”

The crowd goes wild .
Strickland gets a standing ovation and is soon surrounded by people who want to exchange business cards , learn more , come to visit , change the world .
They are believers .
Later , Strickland turns the tables , and offers his views on the challenges facing nonprofits .
“ Nonprofits have to recognize that they ’re businesses , not just causes , ” he says .
“ There ’s a way to combine the very best of the not - for - profit , philanthropic world with the very best of the for - profit , enterprising world .
This hybrid is the wave of the future for both profit and nonprofit companies . ”
It ’s a message that Strickland repeats over and over again on his travels , which keep him on the road as many as 12 days a month .
It ’s a message that is winning over the toughest , most bottom - line - oriented businesspeople , people who are interested in concrete results , not wishful thinking .
Strickland won over Peter Benzing , 69 , a decade ago .
Benzing had retired as a vice president at Bayer Corp. – the U.S. subsidiary , headquartered in Pittsburgh , of the giant German chemical - pharmaceutical conglomerate – but he had stayed active with the company .
When he met Strickland , Benzing ’s biggest concern was the need for an educated local workforce that could meet Bayer ’s needs .
Benzing recalls his meeting with Strickland .
Thirty minutes into the session , Benzing asked whether Strickland could train chemical technicians .
“ Bill said , ‘ I do n’t have the slightest idea about how to train somebody for that , but if you ’d be willing to help , maybe we could do that at Bidwell too , ' ” Benzing says .
It was a classic Strickland response , going straight to the core of his market - oriented operating philosophy : I ’ve got poor people who want to learn how to work .
You ca n’t find people who ’ve been trained to do the jobs you ’ve got .
Let ’s do it together .
Benzing was so impressed that he immediately went back to Bayer , got the company to contact other chemical companies nearby , and wound up with a business consortium that partnered with Strickland to create a one - year - long curriculum to train chemical lab technicians .
It ’s a tough program – many students drop out because of the demanding work .
But in 12 months , it turns out trained workers who can compete with college graduates for jobs .
More than 100 students have finished BTC ’s program ; of those , 81 % have found jobs in a field where the annual minimum starting salary is between $ 20,000 and $ 25,000 .

Companies have found there ’s another reason why it ’s good business to do business with Strickland :
It makes them look good .
Case in point : the creation of a Grammy Award - winning jazz record label , another Strickland innovation that happened almost by accident .
When Strickland brought MCG and BTC under one roof in 1986 , he made sure that the blueprint included a 350 - seat jazz concert hall .
His rationale ?
He loves jazz .
But Strickland knew nothing about booking concerts , so he hired someone who did : jazz musician and promoter Marty Ashby , 37 .
Under Ashby ’s direction , MCG quickly gained a reputation as a great venue for live music .
Although the musicians were just coming to play another gig , they inevitably left impressed by Strickland ’s community .
“ He ’s like a Dr. King , ” says singer Joe Williams , 79 , whose award - winning career has spanned more than 50 years , and who has performed at MCG three times .
“ I ’ve watched Bill ’s project grow to become an integral part of the community .
And when I say community , I mean the community of the United States . ”
Strickland ’s team made sure that each live concert was recorded on state - of - the - art equipment , videotaped , and archived .
But it was n’t until 1994 , when Strickland and Ashby were at Bayer for discussions about BTC ’s training program , that the idea of a record label began to take shape .
While touring the company , Strickland asked about one machine in the plant , and was told that it was for making compact discs .
Bayer , it turned out , is a leading producer of polycarbonate , the plastic from which CDs are made .
“ Bill said , ‘ You ’ve got the CDs .
We ’ve got the music .
There has got to be a deal here , ' ” recalls Ashby .
Bayer liked the idea so much that it helped broker an extraordinary relationship .
Using Bayer ’s contacts with Sony , Benzing helped put together a classic Strickland - style hybrid , combining the for - profit and nonprofit worlds .
What ultimately emerged was a five - record deal , with taped live performances provided by MCG ; plastic provided by Bayer ; pressing done by Sony Disc Manufacturing ; and jewel boxes , liner - note production , and printing donated by three other companies .
Under the deal , proceeds from the sale of the first 25,000 units of each record go directly to MCG .
It was an inspired move .
In 1997 , the first record of the deal – the Count Basie Orchestra with the New York Voices – won a Grammy for best performance by a large jazz ensemble .
A second release , by Paquito D’Rivera and the United Nations Orchestra , is in the stores and selling briskly , and a third , by Brazilian artist Ivan Lins , has just been released .

As for Bayer and Sony , explains Benzing , the corporations benefit by having their names attached to a socially responsible project .
“ It ’s a big deal when a large company works with an inner-city organization , ” he says .
“ It ’s good news , and it fits into Bayer ’s philosophy of working with the communities in which we ’re located . ”
“ Welcome to the conversation ” There ’s one other thing about the break - the - mold way that Bill Strickland does business :
It ’s about the payoff .
No , Strickland is n’t in this for the money .
But he ’s also not into being a starving artist .
Strickland is looking for something in - between , like his hybrid model of social entrepreneurship .
In fact , he ’s striving for the one thing that he thinks is missing in the world today : balance .
A balance of resources , equity , and opportunity – a socially responsible mind - set that asks the haves in this country , How much is enough ?
For Strickland , $ 125,000 a year is enough – that ’s his combined salary for running MCG and BTC .
A house in the neighborhood he grew up in , a 1998 Volvo station wagon , a savings account to pay for his daughter ’s college education , and a closet full of impeccable suits and pressed shirts – for Strickland , these things are enough .
“ I do n’t need the money , ” he says .
“ It ’s not my thing .
Do n’t get me wrong – I do like money .
But I do n’t know that it ’s ecologically appropriate to hoard millions and millions of dollars .
We do n’t need to have so much wealth concentrated in so few hands .
Our culture needs to recognize that having $ 20 million in the bank is not an absolute requirement for being happy .
We have got to be more attuned to the idea that the life experience has its own value . ”
Strickland speaks with a moral authority that rings true with one particularly unlikely group : young business - school students .
After having spent tens of thousands of dollars on a postgraduate education that presumably has them primed for a high - paying job in a high - flying company , business - school grads are probably the least likely group of people to find the nonprofit world attractive .
But they are , in fact , drawn to it – or at least to Strickland ’s version of it .
And that fact alone may be one of the most important indicators that Strickland ’s hybrid approach to business and philanthropy has a future beyond Pittsburgh .
At business schools across the country , Strickland finds that each time he lectures , more students are ready to enlist in the cause .

“ At the end of the lecture , students are lined up wanting to work for me , ” Strickland says .
“ It ’s startling .
I have students coming up with tears in their eyes , saying , ‘ You are doing what I want to do with my life . ’
I say , ‘ I thought you were in business school because you wanted to run Xerox . ’
And they say , ‘ We ’re here because we wanted to find an opportunity where life could make some sense .
You make sense . ’
Then I tell them , ‘ We ’re going to take all this genius , all your enthusiasm , and see the world as a set of possibilities .
This is a new game , and I ’m one of the guys who ’s right in the middle of it .
Welcome to the conversation . ' ”

Following the food chain back to Iraq
The secret of great wealth with no obvious source is some forgotten crime , forgotten because it was done neatly .
- Balzac
The journalist 's rule says : follow the money .
This rule , however , is not really axiomatic but derivative , in that money , as even our vice president will tell you , is really a way of tracking energy .
We 'll follow the energy .
We learn as children that there is no free lunch , that you do n't get something from nothing , that what goes up must come down , and so on .
The scientific version of these verities is only slightly more complex .
As James Prescott Joule discovered in the nineteenth century , there is only so much energy .
You can change it from motion to heat , from heat to light , but there will never be more of it and there will never be less of it .
The conservation of energy is not an option , it is a fact .
This is the first law of thermodynamics .
Special as we humans are , we get no exemptions from the rules .
All animals eat plants or eat animals that eat plants .
This is the food chain , and pulling it is the unique ability of plants to turn sunlight into stored energy in the form of carbohydrates , the basic fuel of all animals .
Solar - powered photosynthesis is the only way to make this fuel .
There is no alternative to plant energy , just as there is no alternative to oxygen .
The results of taking away our plant energy may not be as sudden as cutting off oxygen , but they are as sure .
Scientists have a name for the total amount of plant mass created by Earth in a given year , the total budget for life .
They call it the planet 's " primary productivity . "
There have been two efforts to figure out how that productivity is spent , one by a group at Stanford University , the other an independent accounting by the biologist Stuart Pimm .
Both conclude that we humans , a single species among millions , consume about 40 percent of Earth 's primary productivity , 40 percent of all there is .
This simple number may explain why the current extinction rate is 1,000 times that which existed before human domination of the planet .
We 6 billion have simply stolen the food , the rich among us a lot more than others .
Energy cannot be created or canceled , but it can be concentrated .
This is the larger and profoundly explanatory context of a national - security memo George Kennan wrote in 1948 as the head of a State Department planning committee , ostensibly about Asian policy but really about how the United States was to deal with its newfound role as the dominant force on Earth .
" We have about 50 percent of the world 's wealth but only 6.3 percent of its population , " Kennan wrote .
" In this situation , we can not fail to be the object of envy and resentment .
Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity without positive detriment to our national security .
To do so , we will have to dispense with all sentimentality and day - dreaming ; and our attention will have to be concentrated everywhere on our immediate national objectives .
We need not deceive ourselves that we an afford today the luxury of altruism and world - benefaction . "
" The day is not to far off , " Kennan concluded , " when we are going to have to deal in straight power concepts . "
If you follow the energy , eventually you will end up in a field somewhere .
Humans engage in a dizzying array of artifice and industry .
Nonetheless , more than two thirds of humanity 's cut of primary productivity results from agriculture , two thirds of which in turn consists of three plants : rice , wheat , and corn .
In the 10,000 years since humans domesticated these grains , their status has remained undiminished , most likely because they are able to store solar energy in uniquely dense , transportable bundles of carbohydrates .
They are to the plant world what a barrel of refined oil is to the hydrocarbon world .
Indeed , aside from hydrocarbons they are the most concentrated form of true wealth - sun energy - to be found on the planet .
As Kennan recognized , however , the maintenance of such a concentration of wealth often requires violent action .
Agriculture is a recent human experiment .
For most of human history , we lived by gathering or killing a broad variety of nature 's offerings .
Why humans might have traded this approach for the complexities of agriculture is an interesting and long - debated question , especially because the skeletal evidence clearly indicates that early farmers were more poorly nourished , more disease - ridden and deformed , than their hunter - gatherer contemporaries .
Farming did not improve most lives .
The evidence that best points to the answer , I think , lies in the difference between early agricultural villages and their pre-agricultural counterparts - the presence not just of grain but of granaries and , more tellingly , of just a few houses significantly larger and more ornate than all the others attached to those granaries .
Agriculture was not so much about food as it was about the accumulation of wealth .
It benefited some humans , and those people have been in charge ever since .
Domestication was also a radical change in the distribution of wealth within the plant world .
Plants can spend their solar income in several ways .
The dominant and prudent strategy is to allocate most of it to building roots , stem , bark - a conservative portfolio of investments that allows the plant to better gather energy and survive the downturn years .
Further , by living in diverse stands ( a given chunk of native prairie contains maybe 200 species of plants ) , these perennials provide services for one another , such as retaining water , protecting one another from wind , and fixing free nitrogen from the air to use as fertilizer .
Diversity allows a system to " sponsor its own fertility , " to use visionary agronomist Wes Jackson 's phrase .
This is the plant world 's norm .
There is a very narrow group of annuals , however , that grow in patches of a single species and store almost all of their income as seed , a tight bundle of carbohydrates easily exploited by seed eaters such as ourselves .
Under normal circumstances , this eggs - in - one - basket strategy is a dumb idea for a plant .
But not during catastrophes such as floods , fires , and volcanic eruptions .
Such catastrophes strip established plant communities and create opportunities for wind - scattered entrepreneurial seed bearers .
It is no accident that no matter where agriculture sprouted on the globe , it always happened near rivers .
You might assume , as many have , that this is because the plants needed the water or nutrients .
Mostly this is not true .
They needed the power of flooding , which scoured landscapes and stripped out competitors .
Nor is it an accident , I think , that agriculture arose independently and simultaneously around the globe just as the last ice age ended , a time of enormous upheaval when glacial melt let loose sea-size lakes to create tidal waves of erosion .
It was a time of catastrophe .
Corn , rice , and wheat are especially adapted to catastrophe .
It is their niche .
In the natural scheme of things , a catastrophe would create a blank slate , bare soil , that was good for them .
Then , under normal circumstances , succession would quickly close that niche .
The annuals would colonize .
Their roots would stabilize the soil , accumulate organic matter , provide cover .
Eventually the catastrophic niche would close .
Farming is the process of ripping that niche open again and again .
It is an annual artificial catastrophe , and it requires the equivalent of three or four tons of TNT per acre for a modem American farm .
Iowa 's fields require the energy of 4,000 Nagasaki bombs every year .
Iowa is almost all fields now .
Little prairie remains , and if you can find what Iowans call a " postage stamp " remnant of some , it most likely will abut a cornfield .
This allows an observation .
Walk from the prairie to the field , and you probably will step down about six feet , as if the land had been stolen from beneath you .
Settlers ' accounts of the prairie conquest mention a sound , a series of pops , like pistol shots , the sound of stout grass roots breaking before a moldboard plow .
A robbery was in progress .
When we say the soil is rich , it is not a metaphor .
It is as rich in energy as an oil well .
A prairie converts that energy to flowers and roots and stems , which in turn pass back into the ground as dead organic matter .
The layers of topsoil build up into a rich repository of energy , a bank .
A farm field appropriates that energy , puts it into seeds we can eat .
Much of the energy moves from the earth to the rings of fat around our necks and waists .
And much of the energy is simply wasted , a trail of dollars billowing from the burglar 's satchel .
I 've already mentioned that we humans take 40 percent of the globe 's primary productivity every year .
You might have assumed we and our livestock eat our way through that volume , but this is not the case .
Part of that total - almost a third of it - is the potential plant mass lost when forests are cleared for farming or when tropical rain forests are cut for grazing or when plows destroy the deep mat of prairie roots that held the whole business together , triggering erosion .
The Dust Bowl was no accident of nature .
A functioning grassland prairie produces more biomass each year than does even the most technologically advanced wheat field .
The problem is , it 's mostly a form of grass and grass roots that humans can't eat .
So we replace the prairie with our own preferred grass , wheat .
Never mind that we feed most of our grain to livestock , and that livestock is perfectly content to eat native grass .
And never mind that there likely were more bison produced naturally on the Great Plains before farming than all of beef farming raises in the same area today .
Our ancestors found it preferable to pluck the energy from the ground and when it ran out move on .
Today we do the same , only now when the vault is empty we fill it again with new energy in the form of oil - rich fertilizers .
Oil is annual primary productivity stored as hydrocarbons , a trust fund of sorts , built up over many thousands of years .
On average , it takes 5.5 gallons of fossil energy to restore a year 's worth of lost fertility to an acre of eroded land - in 1997 we burned through more than 400 years ' worth of ancient fossilized productivity , most of it from someplace else .
Even as the earth beneath Iowa shrinks , it is being globalized .
Six thousand years before sodbusters broke up Iowa , their Caucasian blood ancestors broke up the Hungarian plain , an area just northwest of the Caucasus Mountains .
Archaeologists call this tribe the LBK , short for linearbandkeramik , the German word that describes the distinctive pottery remnants that mark their occupation of Europe .
Anthropologists call them the wheat - beef people , a name that better connects those ancients along the Danube to my fellow Montanans on the Upper Missouri River .
These proto-Europeans had a full set of domesticated plants and animals , but wheat and beef dominated .
All the domesticates came from an area along what is now the Iraq - Syria - Turkey border at the edges of the Zagros Mountains .
This is the center of domestication for the Western world 's main crops and livestock , ground zero of catastrophic agriculture .
Two other types of catastrophic agriculture evolved at roughly the same time , one centered on rice in what is now China and India and one centered on corn and potatoes in Central and South America .
Rice , though , is tropical and its expansion depends on water , so it developed only in floodplains , estuaries , and swamps .
Corn agriculture was every bit as voracious as wheat ; the Aztecs could be as brutal and imperialistic as Romans or Brits , but the corn cultures collapsed with the onslaught of Spanish conquest .
Corn itself simply joined the wheat - beef people 's coalition .
Wheat was the empire builder ; its bare botanical facts dictated the motion and violence that we know as imperialism .
The wheat - beef people swept across the western European plains in less than 300 years , a conquest some archaeologists refer to as a " blitzkrieg . "
A different race of humans , the Cro-Magnons - hunter - gatherers , not farmers - lived on those plains at the time .
Their cave art at places such as Lascaux testifies to their sophistication and profound connection to wildlife .
They probably did most of their hunting and gathering in uplands and river bottoms , places the wheat farmers did n't need , suggesting the possibility of coexistence .
That 's not what happened , however .
Both genetic and linguistic evidence say that the farmers killed the hunters .
The Basque people are probably the lone remnant descendants of Cro-Magnons , the only trace .
Hunter - gatherer archaeological sites of the period contain spear points that originally belonged to the farmers , and we can guess they were n't trade goods .
One group of anthropologists concludes , " The evidence from the western extension of the LBK leaves little room for any other conclusion but that LBK - Mesolithic interactions were at best chilly and at worst hostile . "
The world 's surviving Blackfeet , Assiniboine Sioux , Inca , and Maori probably have the best idea of the nature of these interactions .
Wheat is temperate and prefers plowed - up grasslands .
The globe has a limited stock of temperate grasslands , just as it has a limited stock of all other biomes .
On average , about 10 percent of all other biomes remain in something like their native state today .
Only 1 percent of temperate grasslands remains undestroyed .
Wheat takes what it needs .
The supply of temperate grasslands lies in what are today the United States , Canada , the South American pampas , New Zealand , Australia , South Africa , Europe , and the Asiatic extension of the European plain into the sub-Siberian steppes .
This area largely describes the First World , the developed world .
Temperate grasslands make up not only the habitat of wheat and beef but also the globe 's islands of Caucasians , of European surnames and languages .
In 2000 the countries of the temperate grasslands , the neo-Europes , accounted for about 80 percent of all wheat exports in the world , and about 86 percent of all corn .
That is to say , the neo-Europes drive the world 's agriculture .
The dominance does not stop with grain .
These countries , plus the mothership - Europe - accounted for three fourths of all agricultural exports of all crops in the world in 1999 .
Plato wrote of his country 's farmlands :
What now remains of the formerly rich land is like the skeleton of a sick man .
Formerly , many of the mountains were arable .
The plains that were full of rich soil are now marshes .
Hills that were once covered with forests and produced abundant pasture now produce only food for bees .
Once the land was enriched by yearly rains , which were not lost , as they are now , by flowing from the bare land into the sea .
The soil was deep , it absorbed and kept the water in loamy soil , and the water that soaked into the hills fed springs and running streams everywhere .
Now the abandoned shrines at spots where formerly there were springs attest that our description of the land is true .
Plato 's lament is rooted in wheat agriculture , which depleted his country 's soil and subsequently caused the series of declines that pushed centers of civilization to Rome , Turkey , and western Europe .
By the fifth century , though , wheat 's strategy of depleting and moving on ran up against the Atlantic Ocean .
Fenced - in wheat agriculture is like rice agriculture .
It balances its equations with famine .
In the millennium between 500 and 1500 , Britain suffered a major " corrective " famine about every ten years ; there were seventy - five in France during the same period .
The incidence , however , dropped sharply when colonization brought an influx of new food to Europe .
The new lands had an even greater effect on the colonists themselves .
Thomas Jefferson , after enduring a lecture on the rustic nature by his hosts at a dinner party in Paris , pointed out that all of the Americans present were a good head taller than all of the French .
Indeed , colonists in all of the neo-Europes enjoyed greater stature and longevity , as well as a lower infant - mortality rate - all indicators of the better nutrition afforded by the onetime spend down of the accumulated capital of virgin soil .
The precolonial famines of Europe raised the question :
What would happen when the planet 's supply of arable land ran out ?
We have a clear answer .
In about 1960 expansion hit , its limits and the supply of unfarmed , arable lands came to an end .
There was nothing left to plow .
What happened was grain yields tripled .
The accepted term for this strange turn of events is the green revolution , though it would be more properly labeled the amber revolution , because it applied exclusively to grain - wheat , rice , and corn .
Plant breeders tinkered with the architecture of these three grains so that they could be hypercharged with irrigation water and chemical fertilizers , especially nitrogen .
This innovation meshed nicely with the increased " efficiency " of the industrialized factory - farm system .
With the possible exception of the domestication of wheat , the green revolution is the worst thing that has ever happened to the planet .
For openers , it disrupted long - standing patterns of rural life worldwide , moving a lot of no -longer - needed people off the land and into the world 's most severe poverty .
The experience in population control in the developing world is by now clear :
It is not that people make more people so much as it is that they make more poor people .
In the forty - year period beginning about 1960 , the world 's population doubled , adding virtually the entire increase of 3 billion to the world 's poorest classes , the most fecund classes .
The way in which the green revolution raised that grain contributed hugely to the population boom , and it is the weight of the population that leaves humanity in its present untenable position .
Discussion of these , the most poor , however , is largely irrelevant to the American situation .
We say we have poor people here , but almost no one in this country lives on less than one dollar a day , the global benchmark for poverty .
It marks off a class of about 1.3 billion people , the hard core of the larger group of 2 billion chronically malnourished people - that is , one third of humanity .
We may forget about them , as most Americans do .
More relevant here are the methods of the green revolution , which added orders of magnitude to the devastation .
By mining the iron for tractors , drilling the new oil to fuel them and to make nitrogen fertilizers , and by taking the water that rain and rivers had meant for other lands , farming had extended its boundaries , its dominion , to lands that were not farmable .
At the same time , it extended its boundaries across time , tapping fossil energy , stripping past assets .
The common assumption these days is that we muster our weapons to secure oil , not food .
There 's a little joke in this .
Ever since we ran out of arable land , food is oil .
Every single calorie we eat is backed by at least a calorie of oil , more like ten .
In 1940 the average farm in the United States produced 2.3 calories of food energy for every calorie of fossil energy it used .
By 1974 ( the last year in which anyone looked closely at this issue ) , that ratio was 1:1 .
And this understates the problem , because at the same time that there is more oil in our food there is less oil in our oil .
A couple of generations ago we spent a lot less energy drilling , pumping , and distributing than we do now .
In the 1940s we got about 100 barrels of oil back for every barrel of oil we spent getting it .
Today each barrel invested in the process returns only ten , a calculation that no doubt fails to include the fuel burned by the Hummers and Blackhawks we use to maintain access to the oil in Iraq .
David Pimentel , an expert on food and energy at Cornell University , has estimated that if all of the world ate the way the United States eats , humanity would exhaust all known global fossil - fuel reserves in just over seven years .
Pimentel has his detractors .
Some have accused him of being off on other calculations by as much as 30 percent .
Fine .
Make it ten years .
Fertilizer makes a pretty fine bomb right off the shelf , a chemistry lesson Timothy McVeigh taught at Oklahoma City 's Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in 1995 - not a small matter , in that the green revolution has made nitrogen fertilizers ubiquitous in some of the more violent and desperate corners of the world .
Still , there is more to contemplate in nitrogen 's less sensational chemistry .
The chemophobia of modern times excludes fear of the simple elements of chemistry 's periodic table .
We circulate petitions , hold hearings , launch websites , and buy and sell legislators in regard to polysyllabic organic compounds - polychlorinated biphenyls , polyvinyls , DDT , 2 - 4d , that sort of thing - not simple carbon or nitrogen .
Not that agriculture 's use of the more ornate chemistry is benign - an infant born in a rural , wheat - producing county in the United States has about twice the chance of suffering birth defects as one born in a rural place that does n't produce wheat , an effect researchers blame on chlorophenoxy herbicides .
Focusing on pesticide pollution , though , misses , the worst of the pollutants .
Forget the polysyllabic organics .
It is nitrogen - the wellspring of fertility relied upon by every Eden - obsessed backyard gardener and suburban groundskeeper - that we should fear most .
Those who model our planet as an organism do so on the basis that the earth appears to breathe - it thrives by converting a short list of basic elements from one compound into the next , just as our own bodies cycle oxygen into carbon dioxide and plants cycle carbon dioxide into oxygen .
In fact , two of the planet 's most fundamental humors are oxygen and carbon dioxide .
Another is nitrogen .
Nitrogen can be released from its " fixed " state as a solid in the soil by natural processes that allow it to circulate freely in the atmosphere .
This also can be done artificially .
Indeed .
humans now contribute more nitrogen to the nitrogen cycle than the planet itself does .
That is , humans have doubled the amount of nitrogen in play .
This has led to an imbalance .
It is easier to create nitrogen fertilizer than it is to apply it evenly to fields .
When farmers dump nitrogen on a crop , much is wasted .
It runs into the water and soil , where it either reacts chemically with its surroundings to form new compounds or flows off to fertilize something else , somewhere else .
That chemical reaction , called acidification , is noxious and contributes significantly to acid rain .
One of the compounds produced by acidification is nitrous oxide , which aggravates the greenhouse effect .
Green growing things normally offset global warming by sucking up carbon dioxide , but nitrogen on farm fields plus methane from decomposing vegetation make every farmed acre , like every acre of Los Angeles freeway , a net contributor to global warming .
Fertilization is equally worrisome .
Rainfall and irrigation water inevitably washes the nitrogen from fields to creeks and streams , which flows into rivers , which floods into the ocean .
This explains why the Mississippi river , which drains the nation 's Corn Belt , is an environmental catastrophe .
The nitrogen fertilizes artificially large blooms of algae that in growing suck all the oxygen from the water , a condition biologists call anoxia , which means " oxygen - depleted . "
Here there 's no need to calculate long - term effects , because life in such places has no long term : everything dies immediately .
The Mississippi River 's heavily fertilized effluvia has created a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico the size of New Jersey .
America 's biggest crop , grain corn , is completely unpalatable .
It is raw material for an industry that manufactures food substitutes .
Likewise , you can't eat unprocessed wheat .
You certainly can't eat hay .
You can eat unprocessed soybeans , but mostly we do n't .
These four crops cover 82 percent of American cropland .
Agriculture in this country is not about food ; it 's about commodities that require the outlay of still more energy to become food .
About two thirds of U.S. grain corn is labeled " processed , " meaning it is milled and otherwise refined for food or industrial uses .
More than 45 percent of that becomes sugar , especially high - fructose corn sweeteners , the key stone ingredient in three quarters of all processed foods , especially soft drinks , the food of America 's poor and working classes .
It is not a coincidence that the American pandemic of obesity tracks rather nicely with the fivefold increase in corn-syrup production since Archer Daniels Midland developed a high - fructose version of the stuff in the early seventies .
Nor is it a coincidence that the plague selects the poor , who eat the most processed food .
It began with the industrialization of Victorian England .
The empire was then flush with sugar from plantations in the colonies .
Meantime the cities were flush with factory workers .
There was no good way to feed them .
And thus was born the afternoon tea break , the tea consisting primarily of warm water and sugar .
If the workers were well off , they could also afford bread with heavily sugared jam - sugar - powered industrialization .
There was a 500 percent increase in per capita sugar consumption in Britain between 1860 and 1890 , around the time when the life expectancy of a male factory worker was seventeen years .
By the end of the century the average Brit was getting about one sixth of his total nutrition from sugar , exactly the same percentage Americans get today - double what nutritionists recommend .
There is another energy matter to consider here , though .
The grinding , milling , wetting , drying , and baking of a breakfast cereal requires about four calories of energy for every calorie of food energy it produces .
A two - pound bag of breakfast cereal burns the energy of a half - gallon of gasoline in its making .
All together the food - processing industry in the United States uses about ten calories of fossil - fuel energy for every calorie of food energy it produces .
That number does not include the fuel used in transporting the food from the factory to a store near you , or the fuel used by millions of people driving to thousands of super discount stores on the edge of town , where the land is cheap .
It appears , however , that the corn cycle is about to come full circle .
If a bipartisan coalition of farm - state lawmakers has their way - and it appears they will - we will soon buy gasoline containing twice as much fuel alcohol as it does now .
Fuel alcohol already ranks second as a use for processed corn in the United States , just behind corn sweeteners .
According to one set of calculations , we spend more calories of fossil - fuel energy making ethanol than we gain from it .
The Department of Agriculture says the ratio is closer to a gallon and a quart of ethanol for every gallon of fossil fuel we invest .
The USDA calls this a bargain , because gasohol is a " clean fuel . "
This claim to cleanness is in dispute at the tailpipe level , and it certainly ignores the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico , pesticide pollution , and the haze of global gases gathering over every farm field .
Nor does this claim cover clean conscience ; some still might be unsettled knowing that our SUVs ' demands for fuel compete with the poor 's demand for grain .
Green eaters , especially vegetarians , advocate eating low on the food chain , a simple matter of energy flow .
Eating a carrot gives the diner all that carrot 's energy , but feeding carrots to a chicken , then eating the chicken , reduces the energy by a factor of ten .
The chicken wastes some energy , stores some as feathers , bones , and other inedibles , and uses most of it just to live long enough to be eaten .
As a rough rule of thumb , that factor of ten applies to each level up the food chain , which is why some fish , such as tuna , can be a horror in all of this .
Tuna is a secondary predator , meaning it not only does n't eat plants but eats other fish that themselves eat other fish , adding a zero to the multiplier each notch up , easily a hundred times , more like a thousand times less efficient than eating a plant .
This is fine as far as it goes , but the vegetarian 's case can break down on some details .
On the moral issues , vegetarians claim their habits are kinder to animals , though it is difficult to see how wiping out 99 percent of wildlife 's habitat , as farming has done in Iowa , is a kindness .
In rural Michigan , for example , the potato farmers have a peculiar tactic for dealing with the predations of whitetail deer .
They gut - shoot them with small - bore rifles , in hopes the deer will limp off to the woods and die where they wo n't stink up the potato fields .
Animal rights aside , vegetarians can lose the edge in the energy argument by eating processed food , with its ten calories of fossil energy for every calorie of food energy produced .
The question , then , is : Does eating processed food such as soy burger or soy milk cancel the energy benefits of vegetarianism , which is to say , can I eat my lamb chops in peace ?
Maybe .
If I 've done my due diligence , I will have found out that the particular lamb I am eating was both local and grass - fed , two factors that of course greatly reduce the embedded energy in a meal .
I know of ranches here in Montana , for instance , where sheep eat native grass under closely controlled circumstances - no farming , no plows , no corn , no nitrogen .
Assets have not been stripped .
I can't eat the grass directly .
This can go on .
There are little niches like this in the system .
Each person 's individual charge is to find such niches .
Chances are , though , any meat eater will come out on the short end of this argument , especially in the United States .
Take the case of beef .
Cattle are grazers , so in theory could live like the grass - fed lamb .
Some cattle cultures - those of South America and Mexico , for example - have perfected wonderful cuisines based on grass - fed beef .
This is not our habit in the United States , and it is simply a matter of habit .
Eighty percent of the grain the United States produces goes to livestock .
Seventy - eight percent of all of our beef comes from feed lots , where the cattle eat grain , mostly corn and wheat .
So do most of our hogs and chickens .
The cattle spend their adult lives packed shoulder to shoulder in a space not much bigger than their bodies , up to their knees in shit , being stuffed with grain and a constant stream of antibiotics to prevent the disease this sort of confinement invariably engenders .
The manure is rich in nitrogen and once provided a farm 's fertilizer .
The feed - lots , however , are now far removed from farm fields , so it is simply not " efficient " to haul it to cornfields .
It is waste .
It exhales methane , a global - warming gas .
It pollutes streams .
It takes thirty - five calories of fossil fuel to make a calorie of beef this way ; sixty - eight to make one calorie of pork .
Still , these livestock do something we can't .
They convert grain 's carbohydrates to high - quality protein .
All well and good , except that per capita protein production in the United States is about double what an average adult needs per day .
Excess cannot be stored as protein in the human body but is simply converted to fat .
This is the end result of a factory - farm system that appears as a living , continental - scale monument to Rube Goldberg , a black - mass remake of the loaves - and - fishes miracle .
Prairie 's productivity is lost for grain , grain 's productivity is lost in livestock , livestock 's protein is lost to human fat - all federally subsidized for about $ 15 billion a year , two thirds of which goes directly to only two crops , corn and wheat .
This explains why the energy expert David Pimentel is so worried that the rest of the world will adopt America 's methods .
He should be , because the rest of the world is .
Mexico now feeds 45 percent of its grain to livestock , up from 5 percent in 1960 .
Egypt went from 3 percent to 31 percent in the same period , and China , with a sixth of the world 's population , has gone from 8 percent to 26 percent .
All of these places have poor people who could use the grain , but they can't afford it .
I live among elk and have learned to respect them .
One moonlit night during the dead of last winter , I looked out my bedroom window to see about twenty of them grazing a plot of grass the size of a living room .
Just that small patch among acres of other species of native prairie grass .
Why that species and only that species of grass that night in the worst of winter when the threat to their survival was the greatest ?
What magic nutrient did this species alone contain ?
What does a wild animal know that we do n't ?
I think we need this knowledge .
Food is politics .
That being the case , I voted twice in 2002 .
The day after Election Day , in a truly dismal mood , I climbed the mountain behind my house and found a small herd of elk grazing native grasses in the morning sunlight .
My respect for these creatures over the years has become great enough that on that morning I did not hesitate but went straight to my job , which was to rack a shell and drop one cow elk , my household 's annual protein supply .
I voted with my weapon of choice - an act not all that uncommon in this world , largely , I think , as a result of the way we grow food .
I can see why it is catching on .
Such a vote has a certain satisfying heft and finality about it .
My particular bit of violence , though , is more satisfying , I think , than the rest of the globe 's ordinary political mayhem .
I used a rifle to opt out of an insane system .
I killed , but then so did you when you bought that package of burger , even when you bought that package of tofu burger .
I killed , then the rest of those elk went on , as did the grasses , the birds , the trees , the coyotes , mountain lions , and bugs , the fundamental productivity of an intact natural system , all of it went on .

で、品川で待ち合わせて、私、笹田くん、江渡さんで、
Smalltalkのデザイナーでありチューリング賞受賞者でもあるAlan Kay ( と仲間たち ) と 昼食会。なんか、すっごい緊張してるんですけど。
彼の考えてい る 「 子供たちのためのプログラミング環境」のために
Ruby な ど Squeak以外の言語コミュニティからアイディアを借りたい、
ということで今回のセッティングであった。大島さん、ありがとう。
なかなか面白い話が満載であった。
WikiWyg WysiWikiについて 「 WisiwygなWiki」というのが語源なのは見ただけで分かるのだが、 実際はそれどころではない。プログラマブルなプレゼンテーションくらいから。
目指すのは２１世紀のHyperCardというのが近いかもしれない。 簡単なデモの範囲内ではViscuitに似てるけど、 ターゲットはもうちょっと違いそう。
Alan Kayの名刺 名刺ジャンケンで強そうなのをゲット 。Bjarn Strustrupに負けない強さだろう。
AlanとRuby Alan Kayに「 Rubyは好きだ」と言わせた。それなんて罰ゲーム？
Alan とSmalltalk えーと 、 「 Smalltalkのことをもう愛していない」とか、
「 Smalltalkは死んだ言 語 ( dead language ) だ」とか、 「 Smalltalk -80より もSmalltalk-76の方が私の理想に近い。Smalltalk-76 はRubyに似てる( え？ ) 」とか、 「 コンセプトの 私( Alan ) 、実装 のDan ( Ingalls ) とのせめぎあいがあった 。Smalltalk-80は私の手を離れ、Lisp好きの影響を強く受けてた」とか、 「 おいおい、そんなこと言っていいのか」というネタ満載だった。
拡張可能文法とマクロ 「 言語は拡張可能であるべきだが、Lispのマクロは正しい解ではない(強力過ぎ)」という点で意見が一致した。実際、私は20年近く遅れてSmalltalkの真似をしてきたわけだが、それでもなお、Alanとここまで意見が一致するのは意外であった。
その他、古い言語について IMPと かLucidとかいう初耳の言語の話をいくつか聞いた。 後で調べなきゃ。歴史に埋もれていったアイディアや言語はたくさんあるんだなあ。
歴史は繰り返す・悪貨は良貨を駆逐する すばらしいアイディアが世に広まるとは限らない。
過去の反省に基づかないで「新しい」技術が誕生するとは限らない。 特にWWWブラウザについて、そう思ってるみたい。 全然プログラマブルじゃないし( Ajax( JavaScript ) はあるけど、貧弱だし、ドキュメントモデルはHTMLページレンダリング以外の目的には最悪 )、
せめてHyperCardのようなものが普及していれば。 彼らはWikiWygのようなものを、できるだけダウンロードなしに実現したいのだが、
そのためには現在のクライアントサイド技術はあまりにも弱い。
ああ、他にも一杯聞いたような気がするのに。全部録音すべきであった。
追記
えーと、一部 で 「 Alan KayはSmalltalkよりもRubyが好きだと言った」といった言われ方がしていますが、
私が聞いたのは「(もう) Smalltalkを愛していない 」と「 Rubyは好きだ」です。 それぞれ別のタイミングで。
両方の発言を組み合わせて上記の結論を引き出すのは不可能ではないけど やりすぎだと思う。
Which I/ O Strategy Should I Use ?
by Warren Young
There are several different conventions for communicating with Winsock , and each method has distinct advantages .
The question of the hour is , what are these advantages , and how does someone choose the convention that makes the most sense for their application ?
The choices are :
Blocking sockets -
By default , a Winsock call blocks , meaning that it will not return until it has completed its task or has failed while trying .
- By default , a Winsock call blocks , meaning that it will not return until it has completed its task or has failed while trying .
Pure Non-blocking sockets - Calls on non-blocking sockets return immediately , even if they cannot complete their task immediately .
Although this allows the program to do other things while the network operations finish , it requires that the program repeatedly poll to find out when each request has finished .
- Calls on non-blocking sockets return immediately , even if they cannot complete their task immediately .

Asynchronous sockets -
These are non-blocking sockets , except that you do n’t have to poll : the stack sends the program a special window message whenever something " interesting " happens .

select ( ) - The select ( ) function call is a way to block a thread until something interesting happens on any of a group of sockets .
It is usually used with non-blocking sockets , in order to avoid polling .

Event objects - Used with WSAEventSelect ( ) , this mechanism is similar to the select ( ) method , but a bit more efficient .
It also only works on platforms with Winsock , whereas select ( ) works on any platform with BSD sockets .
- Used with , this mechanism is similar to the method , but a bit more efficient .
It also only works on platforms with Winsock , whereas works on any platform with BSD sockets .
Overlapped I/O - One of Winsock 2 ’s major features is that it ties sockets into Win32 ’s unified I /O mechanism .
In particular , you can now use overlapped I/O on sockets , which is intrinsically more efficient than the above options .
Further confusing the issue are threads , because each of the above mechanisms changes in nature when used with threads .
In trying to find an answer to the " which I /O strategy " question , it becomes apparent that there are only a few major kinds of programs , and the successful ones follow the same patterns .
From those patterns and practical experience — some personal and some borrowed — I have derived the following set of heuristics .
None of these heuristics are absolute laws , no one isolated heuristic is sufficient , and the heuristics sometimes conflict .
When two heuristics conflict , you need to decide which is more important to your application and ignore the other .
However , beware of ignoring a heuristic simply because violating it does not create noticeable consequences for your program .
If you get into the habit of ignoring a certain heuristic , it becomes useless .
The heuristics are ordered in terms of compatibility , then speed , and finally functionality .
Compatibility is first , because if a given I / O strategy wo n’t work on the platforms you need to support , it does n’t matter how fast or functional it is .
Speed is next because performance requirements are easy to determine , and often important .
Functionality is last , because once you decide the compatibility and speed issues , your choices become much more subjective .
Heuristic 1 : Narrow your choices by deciding which operating systems you need to support .
There are many versions of Windows , but when it comes to the network stack , you can put most of them into one of two groups : the Windows 95 derivatives and the Windows NT 4.0 derivatives .
This article treats everything else — Windows NT 3.x , Win16 , Windows CE and non-Windows platforms — separately .
Your code may also need to be compatible with POSIX - based systems .
This includes Unix , Linux , MacOS X , QNX , and BeOS .
Although there are a few different network and threading APIs used by the various POSIX - based systems , I ’ll only talk about BSD sockets and POSIX threads in this article .
None of these operating systems have exactly the same set of networking features .
You can exploit this fact to rule out I / O strategies that not all of your target operating systems support .
Win9x WinCE WinNT 4 + WinNT 3.x
Win16 Unix Blocking
Sockets yes yes yes yes yes yes Non-blocking Sockets yes yes yes yes yes yes Asynchronous Sockets yes no yes yes yes no Event Objects yes no yes no no no Overlapped I / O yes1 no yes no no no2 Threads yes yes yes yes no yes3
Win9x does not support overlapped I /O in the kernel .
Where overlapped I/O calls work on Win9x , it is because the mechanism is emulated at the API layer .
( This applies to Winsock , file and serial / parallel port I /O at least . )
This means that programs that only use overlapped I/O functionality guaranteed by the Winsock spec will run fine on Win9x .
If , on the other hand , you stray into functionality that only WinNT 4 + provides , your application will fail on Win9x .
One example of this is calling ReadFile ( ) with a socket : this works fine on NT4 + , but will fail on Win9x .
If you only need scatter / gather I/O support , BSD sockets provides this functionality in the readv ( ) and writev ( ) calls .
There is no standard Unix mechanism that provides similar efficiencies to Win32 ’s overlapped I /O. Some Unixes provide the aio_ *( ) family of functions ( called asynchronous I/O , but not related to Winsock ’s asynchronous I/O ) , but this is not implemented widely at the moment .
Although all current Unixes support POSIX threads , there are still a lot of older Unix machines out there with broken , nonstandard or nonexistent threading .
You will have to choose a subset of all the Unixes if you want to use the same threading code on all Unixes .
You ’ll definitely be writing different threading code for Windows , since its threading API is completely different .
Heuristic 2 : Avoid select ( ) .
select ( ) is the least efficient way to manage non-blocking I/O , because there is a lot of overhead associated with the function .
Most of this overhead is a linear function of the number of connections : double the number of connections , and you double the processing time .
About the only time you should use select ( ) is for compatibility reasons : it ’s the only non-blocking I/O strategy that works on all versions of Windows ( including CE ) and on virtually all POSIX - based systems .
If your program only needs to work on non-CE versions of Windows , there are better alternatives .
Heuristic 3 : Asynchronous sockets work best with low volumes of data .
Asynchronous Winsock I/O ( WSAAsyncSelect ( ) ) is n’t the most efficient I/ O strategy , but it ’s not the least efficient , either .
It ’s a fine way to go in a program that deals with low volumes of data .
As the volume of data goes up , the overhead becomes more significant .
Heuristic 4 : For high - performance servers , prefer overlapped I/O .
Of all the various I/O strategies , overlapped I/O has the highest performance .
( I / O completion ports are even more efficient , but are nonstandard vis-a - vis Winsock proper , so I do n’t cover them in the FAQ . )
With careful use of overlapped I/O ( and boatloads of memory in the server ! ) you can support tens of thousands of connections with a single server .
No other I/O strategy comes close to the scalability of overlapped I/O .
Heuristic 5 : To support a moderate number of connections , consider asynchronous sockets and event objects .
If your server only has to support a moderate number of connections — up to 100 or so — you may not need overlapped I/O.
Overlapped I/ O is not easy to program , so if you do n’t need its efficiencies , you can save yourself a lot of trouble by using a simpler I /O strategy .
Programmed correctly , asynchronous sockets are a reasonable choice for a dedicated server supporting a moderate number of connections .
The main problem with doing this is that many servers do n’t have a user interface , and thus no message loop .
A server without a UI using asynchronous sockets would have to create an invisible window solely to support its asynchronous sockets .
If your program already has a user interface , though , asynchronous sockets can be the least painful way to add a network server feature to it .
Another reasonable choice for handling a moderate number of connections is event objects .
These are very efficient in and of themselves .
The main problem you run into with them is that you cannot block on more than 64 event objects at a time .
To block on more , you need to create multiple threads , each of which blocks on a subset of the event objects .
Before choosing this method , consider that handling 1024 sockets requires 16 threads .
Any time you have many more active threads than you have processors in the system , you start causing serious performance problems .
One caution : it ’s very easy to underestimate the number of simultaneous connections you will get on a public Internet server .
It may make sense to design for massive scalability even if your estimates do n’t currently predict thousands of simultaneous clients .
Heuristic 6 : Low - traffic servers can use most any I /O strategy .
For low - traffic servers , there is n’t much call to be super - efficient .
Perhaps your server just does n’t see high traffic , or perhaps it ’s running a Windows 95 derivative and so it limited to 100 sockets at a time by the OS .
Suitable strategies for 1-100 connections are event objects , non-blocking sockets with select ( ) , asynchronous sockets , and threads with blocking sockets .
We ’ve covered the first three methods already , so let ’s consider threads with blocking sockets .
This is often the simplest way by far to write a server .
You just have a main loop that accepts connections and spins each new connection off to its own thread , where it ’s handled with blocking sockets .
Blocking sockets have several advantages .
They are efficient , because when a thread blocks , the operating system immediately lets other threads run .
Also , synchronous code is more straightforward than equivalent non-synchronous code .
There are two main problems with thread - per- connection servers .
First , threads often require a lot of synchronization work , which is hard to get right ; this may outstrip the simplicity benefits of using blocking sockets .
Second , threads do n’t scale well at all : as the number of threads increases , the operating system overhead associated with context switches between the threads becomes significant .
This method is only suitable for a fairly small number of connections , or a greater number of connections that are mostly idle .
Heuristic 7 : Do not block inside a user interface thread .
This heuristic sounds more like a straightforward rule of Windows programming , but I bring it up because most programs are single - threaded .
In a single - threaded GUI program , any time you call a Winsock function that blocks the UI thread , buttons ca n’t be pressed , menus wo n’t pull down , scroll bars wo n’t move , keypresses are ignored ... your UI freezes .
Heuristic 8 : For GUI client programs , prefer asynchronous sockets .
There are two reasons for this heuristic :
Asynchronous sockets were designed from the start to work well with GUI programs .
You already have a window loop going , and you already have window management code in the rest of the program .
Adding asynchronous network I/ O is about as easy as adding a dialog to your program .
All of the alternatives require at least one additional thread to handle the networking in order to satisfy the previous heuristic .
With asynchronous sockets , you can handle both the network and the UI with a single thread .
Since window messages are handled one at a time in the order they arrive , everything is automatically synchronized .
Heuristic 9 : Threads are rarely helpful in client programs .
When a programmer first learns about threads , he is eager to try them out in his own programs .
He sees that they have several advantages , but he does n’t yet see the drawbacks .
Unfortunately for the soon - to - be- educated newbie , these drawbacks can have very significant consequences .
One real benefit of threads is that a thread doing I/O on a blocking socket has a linear control flow , and is therefore easier to understand .
Asynchronous code is more spread out , so it is harder to write and debug .
Another perceived benefit of threads is a kind of encapsulation : a programmer can split a program up into a number of threads , each of which has a single well - defined task .
But , this is only valid if each thread is mostly independent from the rest of the program .
If not , the threads will have to share data through a common data structure , destroying any potential encapsulation .
In the end , the biggest problem with threads is also related to shared data structures : synchronization .
This issue is covered better elsewhere , so I wo n’t spend many words on it here .
In short , synchronization is hard to get right : poorly - synchronized threads are subject to serialization delays , context switching overhead , deadlocks , race conditions and corrupted data .
These are hard problems , and for most programs the benefits are not large enough to make them worth overcoming .
A saner alternative is to use asynchronous I/O .
This buys you the synchronization benefits described in the previous heuristic .
You can even partition the application in a similar manner to threads by creating an invisible window for each socket .
If you have two different types of sockets , each socket can have its notifications sent to a different type of window .
In straight API terms it means a separate WndProc ( ) for each type of socket .
In terms of frameworks like MFC , you can put the code for each type of socket in a different subclass of CWnd .
Heuristic 10 : Use threads only when their effect on the rest of the program is easily contained .
The previous heuristic cautions that threads are often very hard to program correctly , but the truth is that they are sometimes very useful .
You can make an educated guess about whether threads will improve the program by doing a bit of design work : is there a clean interface between each thread and the rest of the program ?
If so , synchronization becomes simple .
If not , you ’re going to end up with a mess that crashes and destroys data unpredictably .
Examples where threads are viable are :
An FTP server .
One way to write an FTP server is to let the main thread accept the incoming network connections , and send each one to a separate thread .
Then , each thread can process the incoming FTP commands , send any required replies , and terminate when the session closes .
Because each thread never has to interact with any other , and they all act alike , this is an ideal application of threads .
( But , keep in mind the previous server - related heuristics : one thread per client severely limits your server ’s scalability . )
A web browser .
When you download a file with a modern web browser , the file comes down in the background , so that you can continue browsing .
That download stream is most likely handled by a dedicated thread .
An email program .
In an email program , the primary focus is usually on reading and writing email .
However , when an email message needs to be sent , it is best not to interrupt the user ’s work .
You can send that message with a separate network thread , since the process affects the rest of the program only minimally .
A stock ticker .
Reduced to basics , a stock ticker simply displays a small amount of continuous real - time data in a pleasing and useful format .
When the amount of network data involved is low , the thread synchronization overhead becomes negligible .
Plus , this kind of application only has a single data structure that needs protection ; the really big synchronization problems appear when multiple data structures need to be protected .
Heuristic 11 : Design around your protocol .
Some network protocols are inherently synchronous , and others are not .
An example of a synchronous protocol is the POP3 e-mail protocol : send a user name , get a response , send a password , get a response , send a request to get the list of emails , get a response ...
With POP , you have to send these commands in a specific order : you ca n’t send the password before the user name , and you ca n’t get the list of emails without sending the user name and password .
Writing a POP client with a non-synchronous socket type would require also writing a state machine .
On the other hand , if your protocol is non-synchronous , you might as well use non-synchronous sockets .
Non-synchronous protocols tend to resemble a set of function calls .
Consider , for example , a program to retrieve data from a networked SQL database : send a SQL statement , and retrieve the result set .
At the end of each " function call " , the program is back to its original state : you do n’t need to maintain a state machine to keep track of where you are in the protocol .
Heuristic 12 : Blocking sockets are simpler , non-blocking sockets are more powerful .
This heuristic is almost a restatement of all the above material .
It just bears repeating that , while blocking sockets are attractive for their simplicity , you may find that their disadvantages eventually force you to redesign your program to use some form of non-blocking sockets .
This is especially true if your program will be supporting more than one socket .
( Virtuall all server programs fall into this category . )
The only reasonable way to use multiple blocking sockets at once is to use threads , but with non-blocking sockets , you have many more design options .
Conclusion
It is my hope that you find these heuristics helpful .
Although you may not agree with each of them , I think that they will at least make you think about your own choices .
Design is a highly subjective enterprise , and this list is based mainly on my own thoughts and preferences .
Special thanks go to Philippe Jounin for his comments on the 1998 version of this paper .
The 2000 version reflects my greater experience , as well as commentary from David Schwartz and Alun Jones , both of whom expanded my ideas of the proper way to build a Winsock server .
Correction Appended
A scientist who has long disagreed with the dominant view that global warming stems mainly from human activity has resigned from a panel that is completing a report for the Bush administration on temperature trends in the atmosphere .
The scientist , Roger A. Pielke Sr. , a climatologist at Colorado State University , said most of the other scientists working on the report were too deeply wedded to particular views and were discounting minority opinions on the quality of climate records and possible causes of warming .
" When you appoint people to a committee who are experts in an area but evaluating their own work , " he said in an interview , " it 's very difficult for them to think outside the box of their research . "
Administration officials said the resignation would not affect the quality or credibility of the report , a draft of which is being finished in the next few weeks .
Sept. 18 , 2006  --
Mercury contamination is making its way into nearly every habitat in the United States , not just oceans , according to a report that the National Wildlife Federation will release Tuesday .
The problem with high mercury levels in certain types of fish has been well documented , resulting in 46 states issuing advisories for pregnant women and children to avoid eating certain types of fish , including tuna and swordfish .
High levels of mercury can lead to a wide range of physical ills , including kidney and neurological damage , and can cause fatigue , vision problems and tremors .
But this is the first report to expose the problem in such a wide variety of species , 40 to be exact .
The report " underscored how pervasive mercury contamination has become , " according to Felice Stadler at the National Wildlife Federation .
" Nearly every aspect of our food web has been contaminated .
It 's difficult to find an ecosystem that 's not contaminated , whether it 's ocean or forest or coastal waters or wetlands . "
Scientists found high levels of mercury in bald eagles , songbirds , polar bears and alligators , to name just a few species .
Alligator meat is very popular in the southeast , but there is no advisory against eating alligator meat .
Last year Utah issued an advisory for duck hunters , warning people to limit or avoid eating certain duck species because of high levels of mercury .
Stadler said this report " raises the question of what ecosystems are safe and immune from toxic contamination . "
Mercury is a naturally occurring element , but people release much more mercury pollution that ends up in our forests , lakes , and streams -- 100 tons in this country alone annually .
The primary sources include coal - burning power plants , wastewater treatment plants and waste incinerators .
The mercury pollution is affecting the reproduction and behavior of fish and wildlife .
The report 's findings suggest birds with high levels of mercury lay fewer eggs , and the motor skills of certain mammals have been diminished , which affects their ability to hunt and therefore survive .
The report points out " there truly is no link in the food chain untouched by mercury , " and according to Stadler , this carries broad implications for humans .
" The research shows birds that eat contaminated insects get contaminated themselves , " Stadler said .
" Turkeys and chickens , which humans eat , eat those same contaminated insects , so this is the tip of the iceberg . "
There is some good news in an otherwise glum report : Mercury poisoning is reversible .
Stadler pointed to several states that in recent years have taken steps to cut mercury emissions , including Florida , Wisconsin , New Hampshire and Massachusetts .
And in a much shorter time than expected , the mercury levels in those states ' fish and wildlife populations have dropped
Stadler , who 's been working on the issue of mercury pollution for 10 years , said she was originally told it would take 50 years before scientists would see some reversal .
" But it 's happening much faster than we ever thought , five to six years , " she said .
Stadler said she believes the key is for this country -- and the whole world for that matter -- to realize just how big a threat mercury pollution is to our ecosystems .
" We need to be as drastic at cutting mercury as we have been in cutting lead , " she said .
No one can dispute that oil companies are doing really well .
And certainly no one can dispute that gas prices are high .
But is the connection as straightforward as the article suggests ?
If the oil companies were less greedy , would we see lower prices as the pump ?
But instead of sharing the pain , they appear to be moving to squeeze every cent they can out of the crisis .
Make no mistake :
These corporations should be able to absorb a hit .
Over the past year and a half , the four largest oil companies — ExxonMobil , ChevronTexaco , Royal Dutch / Shell Group and BP Group PLC — have pocketed close to $ 100 billion in profits .
During the first quarter of 2005 alone , those firms pulled in a cool $ 23 billion .
There 's been some grumbling in the media about how Big Oil is gouging the public by charging record prices for gas while they reap record profits .
For example , this article from The Nation says
Oil companies sell to refineries
Not all oil companies own refining companies .
In fact , a very few actually own their refineries .
They just find , drill and produce crude which they sell on the NYMEX or other markets , to refiners .
A refiner can take crude from anybody — Exxon from Shell , Chevron from BP , etc .
Refineries sell to distributors
This means that an Exxon refinery can sell gasoline to a Shell distributor .
The distributor chooses where to buy his products from .
Naturally , Shell Oil Refining would offer a Shell Distributor a pretty discounted price , but not necessarily the lowest he might find .
Thus distributors can buy from anybody and sell to anybody , regardless of their " affiliation " with a given oil company .
A distributor may be an " Authorized Chevron Distributor " , and thus he can sell Techron type gasoline .
But that does n't mean he is restricted to just selling Chevron products .
Independent distributors ( more of them than any other type ) are listed in the Yellow Pages under Fuel Companies or Fuel Distributors .
These are the middlemen .
Distributors sell to retailers
These independents actually buy gas from whoever they get the best deal from , then sell it to their customers .
If you have ever wondered why there is an Exxon tanker filling up a Fina gas station tank , it is because the distributor is an Exxon affiliate , but the Fina station owner got a better deal from Exxon than from Fina .
This happens all the time .
Distributors also sell grease and transmission fluid and hydraulic fluid and motor oil to industry .
You can often see distributors trucks servicing construction sites or businesses operating a fleet of vehicles .
Retailers can buy whatever they want from whoever they can get the best price !
These corporations are usually very divorced from the nuts and bolts of oil companies , that focus on retailing gasoline and convenience store operation .
The retail chain may be a Shell - owned convenience store , supplied by a Shell affiliated distributor , but he ( distributor ) may buy his oil from Murphy Oil Refining .
So while the buyer thinks he is getting Shell gasoline , what he is getting is gasoline from a Shell Distributor , but produced by Murphy Oil Refining .
I have loosely used Big Oil Company names here to make a point .
However , many of the big guys keep a close reign on their distributors .
But that does not preclude them selling whatever they want to independent retailers , like Samir 's Quicky Mart .
Thus unless a gasoline has a patented ingredient ( like Techron ) or other additive , it will not necessarily wind up being sold by the affiliate retailer .
And we have n't even gotten to supply contracts yet , which further complicate things .
At every level of these distribution chains , people are trying to buy low and sell high .
This is extremely confusing for everybody , but it is the way it works .
But if you keep this in mind — oil companies sell to refiners — you can quickly see why oil companies get pissed when the finger pointing starts .
My opinion is that the gouging , if any , is going on at a very local level , no higher up than the local gasoline distributors .
The most opportunistic way to maximize your cash would be to buy this week 's gasoline for $ 2.50 a gallon , and then if something ( like high oil prices ) allows you to , mark this shipment of $ 2.50 gas up to $ 3.00 .
[ Keep in mind that some states regulate the maximum profit on a gallon of gas . ]
Normally gas markup is about a nickel a gallon or such .
The convenience store makes much more on food — the gasoline is the draw to get them into the store to buy cigarettes or candy or a coke , which have much higher profit margins .
The people who control the final price at the pump are the retailing companies or independent store owners .
And these guys are more than happy to put it off on the oil companies , as they are very removed from them !
I know — as clear as mud .
But it is the " free economy " at work ...
Because the wells they are producing from today were drilled in past years , where they used $ 15 - 25 per barrel as their estimated selling price for the oil .
Thus when the market got tight , they have cheap oil going at a higher price .
Why ?
Simple — demand is high .
Now this higher priced oil is filtering back to them in the form of higher priced goods , so the profits decline slowly over time as higher priced energy enters the economic mill .
But right now , they are making a lot of money .
No .
Oil companies are not setting the retail price except via the NYMEX , where they sell to refiners .
When the traders run the price up , oil companies naturally win .
But the crude price is set by market demand i.e. , what will they pay today ?
Now , rather than actually figure this out for ourselves , the TOD editors conducted a brief email interview with a TOD reader that works in the oil industry .
He explained that in order to answer these questions , you have to understand the path that oil takes from the ground to your gas tank .
" Oil companies sell to refiners .
Refiners sell to distributors .
Distributors sell to retailers . "
Whoa .
That 's a lot of steps .
Let 's break it down .
Summing up ... So , if there is gouging , where is it happening ?
Why are oil companies making record profits ?
So , it is not the case that oil companies are incurring high exploration costs and passing these costs onto the consumer ?
So , let 's say , very hypothetically , that Exxon Mobil wanted to make a gesture of good faith .
Could they sell the crude for cheaper in hopes of lower prices at the pump , or does the nature of the futures market and all of the middlemen make that impossible ?

A historian disgraces himself
David Hadley sent me a link that was unbelievable .
Please , somebody tell me that this weblog , The Social Affairs Unit , is a satire site .
I looked all over , and it seems to take itself very , very seriously , and its authors have academic connections .
I 'm hoping it is merely the most incredibly deadpan English humor , because I 've just read an appallingly stupid article on evolution there .
It 's written by a professor of modern history at the University of Wales - Aberystwyth , one William D. Rubinstein .
Despite the credentials , though , the idiocy starts with the title , and it just gets worse and worse .
Look upon this title , and cringe with me : The Theory of Evolution : Just a Theory ?

Friday Random Ten : with Extra Monkeys !
Here 's the latest random playlist off of my iTunes library — I cheated a little , though , and went with 12 this time , because I noticed a bit of a theme in the first ten that was carried on in the next two songs .
What strange creatures , these Hu-Mans
For those of you wanting an illustrated primer on human evolution , DarkSyde has one for you : check out parts 1 , 2 , and 3 at Unscrewing the Inscrutable .
Phil Skell : Dingbat Emeritus
The Discovery Institute is such a haven for lying phonies .
Their weird little blog has an article with this title : An NAS Scientist Breaks Ranks : Urges Kansas to Teach the Controversy over Neo-Darwinism
Who is this " NAS Scientist " who has broken ranks ?
None other than infamous crackpot Phil Skell , emeritus professor of chemistry at Penn State .
No rank breaking occurred , of course ; Skell has been in the loon brigade for years , with his johnny - one - note complaint that evolutionary theory is useless and has never helped any biologists … and yep , that 's what he 's doing again in his ridiculous letter to the Kansas State Board of Education .
Darwinian evolution is an interesting theory about the remote history of life .
Nonetheless , it has little practical impact on those branches of science that do not address questions of biological history ( largely based on stones , the fossil evidence ) .
Modern biology is engaged in the examination of tissues from living organisms with new methods and instruments .
None of the great discoveries in biology and medicine over the past century depended on guidance from Darwinian evolution — it provided no support .
Spare me .
I 've been all over his dishonest claim before .
There are phenomenal , intelligent emeritus professors who are inspirations to us all , who maintain an active intellectual life and are a model for what a scientist should do with his or her retirement .
And then there are old cranks who verge on senility and hamper our understanding of science .
Guess what category I think Skell belongs in ?
When Flemming Rose heard last month that Danish cartoonists were too afraid of Muslim militants to illustrate a new children 's biography of Islam 's Prophet Muhammad , he decided to put his nation 's famous tolerance to the test .
The cultural editor of Denmark 's largest newspaper , Jyllands - Posten , then recruited cartoonists to depict Islam 's Prophet Muhammad and published them in the paper .
Since then , thousands of Danish Muslims , whose religion strictly prohibits depictions of the prophet , have demonstrated in protest , though some have rallied in support of the paper , too .
Ambassadors from 11 Islamic countries including Iran , Pakistan , and Turkey signed a letter demanding that the Danish prime minister " punish " the newspaper .
In contrast , a young Iranian woman started a petition in favor of the move .
" This issue goes back to Salman Rushdie .
It 's about freedom of speech and Islam , " says an unrepentant Rose , who feels a culture of fear and self - censorship has taken hold across Europe since Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh was murdered for criticizing traditional Islam 's treatment of women .
As accusations of racism and discrimination fly amid the ongoing unrest in France , European countries are being pushed to pinpoint the causes of - and solution to - the social exclusion of their significant Muslim populations .
A key ingredient to the dialogue , Rose says , is making room for a frank discussion of the compatibility of democratic principles such as free speech , and traditional Islam .
" Some Muslims are asking for an apology pointing to a lack of respect , " he says .
" They 're not asking for respect ; they 're asking for subordination - for us as non-Muslims to follow Muslim taboos in the public domain . "
Although Rose expected some complaints , he was unprepared for the deluge of criticism .
Among those who attacked the newspaper 's lack of sensitivity was prominent Copenhagen imam Raed Hlayhel , saying " I will not tolerate this .
If this is democracy , we disagree with democracy . "
But despite the barrage of criticism , Rose defends his decision , which coincided with the arrest of seven Danish Muslims two weeks ago for planning a terrorist attack - the first evidence of Islamic militancy among Denmark 's 200,000 Muslims .
As evidence of the Islamic pressure for censorship , he points to several events in the last month .
The individual who translated a new book by Van Gogh 's collaborator , Dutch MP Aayan Hirsi Ali , has requested anonymity .
A London art gallery removed a modern art exhibit " God is Great , " which featured a Koran , for fear of retaliation .
While in Copenhagen , a delegation of Danish imams asked the prime minister to force Denmark 's media to supply " more positive coverage " of Islam .
For its part , the newspaper has found Muslim allies .
When the controversy first broke , hundreds of Danish Muslims demonstrated in Copenhagen in support of the newspaper .
Among them were refugees that right - wing , anti-immigration parties would like to see turned away at Denmark 's borders .
" People have a right to say what they want without being killed , " says Nasim Rahnama , the 20 - year - old Iranian woman who started a petition in support of the newspaper .
" These Islamic groups have to be stopped .
I just ca n't sit down and do nothing . "
So far Ms. Rahnama , who moved here from Tehran four years ago , has collected over 150 signatures from Danish Muslims who support the paper 's stance but says that she would have got many more if it were n't for people 's fear that Islamic groups would find out .
" I am so happy here , " she says .
" I have learnt the language .
I have a lot of friends .
I live in freedom ; I love it . "
But some warn that the newspaper 's actions might push other young Muslims in the opposite direction by fueling their sense of persecution and obliging them to defend even the most anachronistic aspects of their religion .
" The cartoons seem to have been a deliberate move by the newspaper to provoke Muslim sentiment in a totally legal manner , " says Bjorn Moller , a senior research fellow at the Danish Institute of International Studies , who says that public expressions of racism are increasing , citing one right - wing member of parliament who compared Denmark 's Muslim community to cancer .
" Things which people would n't have been allowed to say a couple of years ago are now being said openly , " says Mr. Moller .
" It 's becoming more socially acceptable to use that kind of language and that 's bound to alienate Muslims and create fanaticism . "
But already Danish voters are flocking to the right - wing Danish People 's Party , which has pointed out that crime in general and the rape of Danish girls in particular are disproportionately committed by Muslim immigrants .
The party 's provocative slogan " Dit Land , Dit Valg " ( Your Land , Your Choice ) for many people conjures up unwelcome reminders of Denmark 's ambiguous role in the Nazi occupation .
[ Editor 's note :
The original version mistranslated the party slogan . ]
" A growing number of people see being a Dane and being a Muslim as incompatible , " says Moller , adding that the Danish Peoples '
Party , the country 's third largest , is behind controversial government attempts to stabilize Denmark 's growing Muslim community at no more than 10 percent of the total 5.5 million population .
Right now , Muslims make up nearly 4 percent of the population .
" The emphasis is rapidly becoming to keep out as many people as possible , regardless of whether they 've been tortured or persecuted , " says Moller .
But many Danish Muslims attempt to strike a conciliatory tone - aware that in contrast to France 's rapidly increasing Muslim population of about five million - they remain a small and vulnerable minority .
" The parliament is dominated by right - wing parties , " says Naveed Baig , who promotes the peaceful Sufi strain of Islam through the group Muslims In Dialogue .
" They are trying to control immigrants , not facilitate them .
And at the same time Muslim extremists are making things hard for the majority of Muslims who fully accept secularism and democracy . "
Rose meanwhile says he is happy that he has sparked a debate about how traditional Islamic ideas often clash with Western secular and democratic ideals .
He also says that the controversy has helped bring native Danes and Muslim immigrants together .
" Usually we speak about them and us , Muslim immigrants and the local population , but in this case many Danes criticized the paper while many Muslims supported the paper , " says Rose .
" This is actually the first time Muslims participated on a public platform alongside Danes . "
LATE last month , three Israelis who know something of what is on the mind of Ariel Sharon , the prime minister , seemed to say publicly what many others are thinking privately .
Since the “ disengagement ” of settlers and troops from Gaza and part of the northern West Bank this summer , Mr Sharon has maintained that Israel 's next territorial withdrawal will be not unilateral , as that one was , but agreed by both sides under the “ road map ” peace plan , which calls , eventually , for joint talks on creating a Palestinian state .
But Eyal Arad , a public - relations adviser to Mr Sharon , Tzachi Hanegbi , one of his ministers , and Aharon Ze'evi - Farkash , the head of military intelligence , were all quoted as suggesting that if peace talks make no progress , Israel might stage another unilateral pullout from some of the West Bank .
Their remarks might have been trial balloons , or merely soap bubbles , but they caused instant fuss .
Such a move would anger both Palestinians , who do not want Israel always setting the agenda , and many Israelis , who resent surrendering land without security promises from the Palestinians in return .
Mr Sharon was quick to pooh - pooh the “ rumours ” .
Mr Arad , for one , says he was misquoted .
But , say various sources , in high - level backroom discussions the subject is coming up time and again .
“ When I speak to Israelis of virtually all political stripes , they all believe it 's the next thing that 's going to happen , ” says Robert Malley , a Washington - based analyst for the International Crisis Group , a peace - making lobby with headquarters in Brussels .
There may well be no plan to do it .
Yet events could inexorably lead to it .
This week 's murders of three Israelis by Palestinian gunmen , and Israel 's response , gave a foretaste of how .
The shootings were in two different places on Route 60 , the main north - south highway through the West Bank .
Views vary as to which militant faction ( or factions ) really did it , but they may have been timed to embarrass Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinian president , who was drumming up support on a foreign tour due to end this week in Washington .
Palestinian vehicles , which bear different - coloured licence plates from Israeli ones , are subject to ever - changing restrictions on which roads they may use .
Since the start of the Palestinians ' second intifada ( uprising ) five years ago some of the main West Bank highways , as well as the by - pass roads that Israel has built over the years to connect its West Bank settlements to one another and to Israel proper , have become Israeli - only .
Some , among them Route 60 , are usually open to at least some Palestinian vehicles , such as trucks and public transport .
But after the shootings , Israel responded by banning all Palestinian traffic from several roads , including part of Route 60 .
Maariv , a daily newspaper , reports that the army has been told to start implementing a plan to make such bans permanent , though government spokesmen say there has been no final decision .
Israel is at work ( slowly , after foreign donors last year refused a request for funding ) on building and upgrading roads , bridges and tunnels to let Palestinians travel between their towns without ever turning on to a road used by Israelis .
That will complete the division of the West Bank into two road networks ( see map ) .
Israel says this will make Palestinians ' lives easier : there will be less need for checkpoints and roadblocks .
Perhaps so ; but the Palestinian highways will be narrower , more winding and more hilly , so trips will take longer and cost more .
They also tend to go through towns instead of by - passing them , which will mean huge snarl - ups of trucks and public transport .
All this will hurt the Palestinian economy .
Signs of the creeping separation have been there for a while .
The UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs has found that the number of fixed checkpoints and roadblocks in the West Bank has dropped by at least a third this year , in line with an Israeli promise in February to ease restrictions .
However , that has mostly helped movement between small Palestinian villages and their nearby urban centres .
The highways between the main towns , on the other hand , are increasingly lined with fences and barriers to prevent access , and there are now three times as many “ flying checkpoints ” , which pop up and turn back Palestinian cars at random , discouraging them from using roads that may one day become Israeli - only .
What does all this mean for the future ?
For two years Israel has been building a barrier through the West Bank — for security , say the Israelis .
It mostly hugs the pre-1967 border ( the Green Line ) , but bites off the areas with the biggest settlements too , taking about 10 % of the Palestinians ' West Bank territory .
The ugly barrier , reminiscent in places of the Berlin Wall ( about 7 % of it so far consists of nine - metre high concrete slabs ) , has attracted international condemnation .
But the common assumption is that it is intended to be an eventual international border and that the Jewish settlements on the Palestinian side , with some 70,000 residents , will be evacuated in a peace deal , along the lines apparently on offer by Israel at Camp David in 2000 .
Yet Israel need be in no hurry .
Though less visible , and almost ignored amid the international outrage , the dual road system is much like the barrier .
It cuts settlers off from Palestinians , making them safer from attack and securing settlements deep inside the West Bank , not just those close to the Green Line .
As with the barrier , each terrorist attack will not only further postpone the peace process — Israel says there can be no progress until the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) meets its road - map obligation to disarm militants — but will reinforce the argument for keeping the system in place .
Meanwhile , if the peace process remains stuck , it is not hard to see how Israel might stage another unilateral pullout .
Since the success of the Gaza disengagement , Israeli support for another such move , though still in the minority , has increased , according to Tel Aviv University 's monthly Peace Index poll .
An early draft of the disengagement plan included about a dozen more settlements in the middle of the West Bank , which in the end were left intact .
A few other isolated settlements are now lobbying the government to be relocated into Israel .
Any of these could , in time , become the focus of Israel 's next unilateral withdrawal .
And that , argues Mr Malley , could serve both Israeli and PA interests .
Israel would give up strategically inconvenient outposts while saying , once again , that it is making concessions to the Palestinians .
The PA would , once again , make political capital out of Israel 's withdrawal , without the humiliation of having given its consent to an unfair deal .
But terrorist attacks would continue to kill Israelis .
The West Bank 's balkanisation would continue to impoverish Palestinians .
Israeli settlement - building would make a viable Palestinian state ever harder to achieve : this summer Israel , ignoring its own road - map obligations , announced plans to increase the number of settlers in the Jordan Valley , in the east of the West Bank , by 50 % in one year .
It is still building hundreds of dwellings a year in other settlements too .
Israeli strategists these days tend to see the Jordan Valley not as an essential “ security buffer ” , but as a large bargaining chip .
Populating settlements will give them more weight in any future negotiations .
There are already nine times as many settlers east of the barrier as the number evacuated from Gaza , and they include the most hardline ideologues .
If enough time goes by , the Palestinians may have little choice but to accept a Swiss - cheese state , comprising most of the West Bank but riddled with settlements , in which travel is severely hampered .
And in the worst case , if there are no peace talks , the dual road network lets Israel contemplate pulling out from up to 40 % or 50 % of the West Bank 's territory unilaterally , while keeping most of its settlements .
What might stem this grim onward march ?
The PA 's most effective weapon would be incontrovertible signs that it is bringing violence under control .
Mr Abbas 's slow progress on this score has been hampered by PA infighting , his own weakness as a leader ( though polls show he is growing more popular ) , and the fact that the PA forces still cannot operate in Israeli - controlled areas of the West Bank .
And since Israel , not surprisingly , responds to attacks by clamping down , as it did this week , each attack makes the job harder — and strengthens Israel 's determination to keep its systems of separation .
Will the bacon sarnie ever seem the same again ?
The McDonald sandwich - named after its creator Scott McDonald , the chef at London department store Selfridges - is said to be the world 's most expensive .
Its cost is down to the Wagyu beef that makes up most of the filling , packed in a 24 - hour fermented sour dough bread .
There have been at least five advance orders placed for the 21 oz ( 595g ) meal .
If you are a food lover , this represents great value for money
Ewan Venters
Selfridges food director
Wagyu cattle are one of the most expensive breeds in the world .
The Japanese cows are raised on a special diet , including beer and grain .
They are supposed to be regularly massaged with sake , the Japanese rice wine , to tenderize the flesh .
Mr McDonald denied his creation was a " sandwich for snobs " , saying its beauty was in its simplicity .
" The flavours marry , it 's not complicated - albeit a little bit rich , " he told BBC London .
Food and catering director at Selfridges on Oxford Street , Ewan Venters , who commissioned the sandwich , said they expected it to be a hit with local " foodies " .
" I think if you are a food lover , this represents great value for money , " he said .
" Some of the finest ingredients from around the world have been used to create this fabulous sandwich . "
The ingredients of the sandwich are : Wagyu beef , fresh lobe foie gras , black truffle mayonnaise , brie de meaux , rocket , red pepper and mustard confit and English plum tomatoes .
Meth abuse is particularly bad in rural areas of the US
A survey of 500 county law enforcement agencies found meth - related arrests had gone up over the past three years .
More than half of the police , sheriff departments and other agencies polled said the highly addictive substance was their biggest drug problem .
Less than 20 % singled out cocaine and fewer still pointed to marijuana .
Highly addictive
Methamphetamine is a chemical variant of amphetamine with much more powerful effects .
METHAMPHETAMINE
Sold as powder , tablets or crystals Can be snorted , smoked , injected or swallowed Can alter personality ; increase blood pressure and damage brain
It is easy to produce using chemicals found on farms , and the homemade labs which produce it are less easy to detect in the countryside .
The findings are based on figures collated from rural and suburban areas and do not include most of the country 's largest cities .
Half of the counties surveyed said 20 % of people in their jails were there because of meth - related crimes .
In some places it accounts for more than 50 % of people detained , and law enforcement officials say burglaries , domestic violence and assaults have increased because of it .
The problem started in the northwestern US , but it is moving east - and it is now having what the Washington - based National Association of Counties ( Naco ) calls a " devastating " effect on communities nationwide .
" Methamphetamine abuse is mainly a rural and suburban problem but it is slowly moving to the cities , " Naco research director Jacqueline Byers told the BBC news website .
Children also suffer - from neglect and abuse of addicted parents or carers , and from the side effects of the drug being produced in their homes .
Suppose you have the bad habit of dwelling too much on the same negative thoughts .
And suppose there ’s no outward physical manifestation associated to them .
It ’s just negative thinking , like “ I ’m so depressed ” or “ I hate my job ” or “ I ca n’t do this ” or “ I hate being fat . ”
How do you break a bad habit when it ’s entirely in your mind ?
There are actually quite a number of ways to decondition a negative thought pattern .
The basic idea is to replace the old pattern with a new one .
Mentally resisting the negative thought will usually backfire — you ’ll simply reinforce it and make it even worse .
The more you fire those neurons in the same way , the stronger the pattern becomes .
Here ’s a little method I use to break negative thought patterns .
It ’s basically something I concocted from a combination of the swish pattern from NLP and a memory technique known as chaining .
I usually find the swish pattern alone to be weak and ineffective , but this method works very well for me .
Instead of trying to resist the negative thought pattern , you will redirect it .
Think of it like mental kung fu .
Take the energy of the negative thought and rechannel it into a positive thought .
With a little mental conditioning , whenever the negative thought occurs , your mind will automatically flow into the linked positive thought .
It ’s similar to Pavlov ’s dogs learning to salivate when the bell rang .
Here ’s how it works :
Let ’s assume your negative thought is a subvocalization , meaning that it ’s like you hear a voice in your head that says something you want to change , like , “ I ’m an idiot . ”
If the negative thought is visual ( a mental image ) or kinesthetic ( a gut feeling ) , you can use a similar process .
In many cases the thought will manifest as a combination of all three ( visual , auditory , and kinesthetic ) .
Step 1 : Turn the negative thought into a mental image .
Take that little voice , and turn it into a corresponding mental picture .
For example , if your thought is , “ I ’m an idiot , ” imagine yourself wearing a dunce cap , dressed very foolishly , and jumping around like a dork .
See yourself surrounded by other people all pointing at you while you shout , “ I ’m an idiot . ”
The more you exaggerate the scene , the better .
Imagine bright colors , lots of animation , rapid movement , and even sexual imagery if it helps you remember .
Rehearse this scene over and over in your mind until you reach the point where thinking the negative thought automatically brings up this goofy imagery .
If you have trouble visualizing , you can also do the above in an auditory fashion .
Translate the negative thought into a sound , such as a jingle that you sing .
Go through the same process with sound instead of imagery .
It works either way .
I happen to prefer the visual method though .
Step 2 : Select an empowering replacement thought .
Now decide what thought you ’d like to have instead of the negative one .
So if you ’ve been thinking , “ I ’m an idiot , ” maybe you ’d like to replace that with “ I ’m brilliant . ”
Choose a thought that empowers you in a way that disrupts the disempowering effect of the original negative thought .
Step 3 : Turn the positive thought into a mental image .
Now go through the same process you used in Step 1 to create a new mental scene from the positive thought .
So with the example “ I ’m brilliant , ” you might imagine yourself standing tall , posing like Superman with your hands on your hips .
Picture a giant light bulb appearing just above your head .
The bulb turns on so bright that it ’s blinding , and you see yourself yelling , “ I ’m bbbbbrrrrilllllllliannnntttt ! ”
Again , keep rehearsing this scene until merely thinking the positive line automatically brings up the associated imagery .
Step 4 : Mentally chain the two images together .
Now take the images in Step 1 and Step 3 , and mentally glue them together .
This trick is used in memory techniques like chaining or pegging .
You want to morph the first scene into the second scene .
The NLP swish pattern would have you do a straight cut from one scene to the next , but I recommend you animate the first scene into the second .
A cut is very weak glue and often wo n’t stick .
So instead pretend you ’re the director of a movie .
You have the opening scene and the closing scene , and you have to fill in the middle .
But you only have a few seconds of film left , so you want to find a way to make the transition happen as quickly as possible .
For example , one of the hecklers in the first scene might throw a light bulb at the idiot version of you .
The idiot you catches the bulb and screws it into the top of his head , wincing at the pain .
The bulb then grows into a giant bulb and turns on so bright it blinds all the hecklers .
You rip off your dorky clothing to reveal a shining white robe beneath it .
You stand tall like Superman and yell confidently , “ I ’m bbbbbrrrrilllllllliannnntttt ! ”
The hecklers fall to their knees and begin worshipping you .
Again , the more exaggeration you use , the better .
Exaggeration makes it easier to remember the scene because our brains are designed to remember the unusual .
Once you have the whole scene worked out , mentally rehearse it for speed .
Replay the whole scene over and over until you can imagine it from beginning to end in under 2 seconds , ideally in under 1 second .
It should be lightning fast , much faster than you ’d see in the real world .
Step 5 : Test .
Now you need to test your mental redirect to see if it works .
It ’s a lot like an HTML redirect — when you input the old negative URL , your mind should automatically redirect you to the positive one .
Merely thinking the negative thought should rapidly bring up the positive thought .
If you ’ve done this correctly , you wo n’t be able to help it .
The negative thought is the stimulus that causes your mind to run the whole pattern automatically .
So whenever you happen to think , “ I ’m an idiot , ” even without being fully aware of it , you end up thinking , “ I ’m brilliant . ”
If you ’ve never done visualizations like this before , it may take you several minutes or longer to go through this whole process .
Speed comes with practice .
The whole thing can literally be done in seconds once you get used to it .
Do n’t let the slowness of the first time through discourage you .
This is a learnable skill like any other , and it probably will feel a bit awkward the first time .
I recommend you experiment with different types of imagery .
You ’ll likely find some variations more effective than others .
Pay particular attention to association vs. dissociation .
When you ’re associated in a scene , you ’re imagining seeing it through your own eyes ( i.e. first - person perspective ) .
When you ’re dissociated you ’re imagining seeing yourself in the scene ( i.e. third - person perspective ) .
I usually get the best results when I dissociate in both scenes .
Your results may vary .
You may have to do some mental camera work if you switch from dissociated to associated or vice versa , but it can be done with practice .
I did a lot of this type of mental conditioning during the early 90s .
Whenever I uncovered a negative thought , I plucked it out and redirected it .
Within a few days , I had reprogrammed dozens of negative thought patterns , and pretty soon it became hard for my mind to even produce a negative thought or emotion .
Everything kept getting redirected to the positive side .
I think that ’s partly why I felt so confident about starting my own business right out of college — I used mental conditioning to redirect the thoughts of self - doubt to a more can - do mindset .
I also used this a lot while in college , and I ’m sure it helped me graduate faster than normal .
I still had to deal with plenty of real - world challenges , but at least I was n’t battling my own self - doubt at the same time .
This type of mental conditioning gave me a lot more conscious control over my internal states .
Today it ’s so internalized that I just do it automatically without even thinking about it .
My subconscious took over at some point , so whenever I have a thought like “ I can ’t , ” it automatically gets twisted into “ How can I ? ”
That ’s actually supposed to happen — with enough mental conditioning practice , your subconscious will take over .
Memory experts similarly report that with practice , techniques like pegging and chaining are taken over by the subconscious , just like riding a bicycle .
Give this process a try the next time you notice yourself dwelling on a negative thought .
I think you ’ll find it very empowering .
And feel free to share it with others who could use a mental pick - me - up .

There are bloodstains on the cracked wall behind the terrible postcard - size image and , around the dark room , splattered gore on the heavy wooden furniture .
These dark marks bear witness to a child sacrificed in the name of the abominable goddess .
Through the doorway , in the distance , colourfully dressed women are bent double , toiling in the fields , their faces worn and wrinkled from the sun , their hands cracked from digging at the dry earth from dawn until dusk .
It 's an intolerable life in the remote village of Barha , a squalid collection of mud-bricked farmers ' dwellings in the heart of the impoverished province of Khurja , Uttar Pradesh .
This corner of rural India is a lawless place of superstitions and deep prejudice .
The region , known for its sugarcane , is a tortuous eight - hour drive from Delhi and a lifetime away from the 21st century .
In Bulandshahr , the nearest town of any description , locals whispered darkly of happenings in Barha .
Their advice was unanimous : ' Do n't go .
It is an evil place .
The people there are cursed . '
Sumitra Bushan , 43 , who lived in Barha for most of her life , certainly thought she was cursed .
Her husband had long abandoned her , leaving her with debts and a life of servitude in the sugarcane fields .
Her sons , Satbir , 27 , and Sanjay , 23 , were regarded as layabouts .
Life was bad but then the nightmares and terrifying visions of Kali allegedly began , not just for Sumitra but her entire family .
She consulted a tantrik , a travelling ' holy man ' who came to the village occasionally , dispensing advice and putrid medicines from the rusty amulets around his neck .
His guidance to Sumitra was to slaughter a chicken at the entrance to her home and offer the blood and remains to the goddess .
She did so but the nightmares continued and she began waking up screaming in the heat of the night and returned to the priest .
' For the sake of your family , ' he told her , ' you must sacrifice another , a boy from your village . '
Ten days ago Sumitra and her two sons crept to their neighbour 's home and abducted three - year - old Aakash Singh as he slept .
They dragged him into their home and the eldest son performed a puja ceremony , reciting a mantra and waving incense .
Sumitra smeared sandalwood paste and globules of ghee over the terrified child 's body .
The two men then used a knife to slice off the child 's nose , ears and hands before laying him , bleeding , in front of Kali 's image .
In the morning Sumitra told villagers she had found Aakash 's body outside her house .
But they attacked and beat her sons who allegedly confessed .
' I killed the boy so my mother could be safe , ' Sanjay screamed .
All three are now in prison , having escaped lynch mob justice .
The tantrik has yet to be found .
Police in Khurja say dozens of sacrifices have been made over the past six months .
Last month , in a village near Barha , a woman hacked her neighbour 's three - year - old to death after a tantrik promised unlimited riches .
In another case , a couple desperate for a son had a six - year - old kidnapped and then , as the tantrik chanted mantras , mutilated the child .
The woman completed the ritual by washing in the child 's blood .
' It 's because of blind superstitions and rampant illiteracy that this woman sacrificed this boy , ' said Khurja police officer AK Singh .
' It 's happened before and will happen again but there is little we can do to stop it .
In most situations it 's an open and shut case .
It is n't difficult to elicit confessions - normally the villagers or the families of the victims do that for us .
This has been going on for centuries ; these people are living in the dark ages . '
According to an unofficial tally by the local newspaper , there have been 28 human sacrifices in western Uttar Pradesh in the last four months .
Four tantrik priests have been jailed and scores of others forced to flee .
The killings have focused attention on Tantrism , an amalgam of mystical practices that grew out of Hinduism .
Tantrism also has adherents among Buddhists and Muslims and , increasingly , in the West , where it is associated with yoga or sexual techniques .
It has millions of followers across India , where it originated between the fifth and ninth centuries .
Tantrik priests are consulted on everything from marital to bowel problems .
Many blame the turn to the occult on the increasing economic gap between rural and urban India , in particular the spiralling debts of cotton and tobacco farmers , linked with high costs of hybrid seed and pesticides , that has led to record numbers of farmers committing suicide .
According to Sanal Edamaruku , president of the Indian Rationalist Association , human sacrifice affects most of northern India .
' Modern India is home to hundreds of millions who can't read or write , but who often seek refuge from life 's realities through astrology or the magical arts of shamans .
Unfortunately these people focus their horrific attention on society 's weaker members , mainly women and children who are easier to handle and kidnap . '
Tantriks caught up in the crackdown in Uttar Pradesh say their reputation is being destroyed by an insane minority .
' Human sacrifices have been made in this region since time immemorial , ' says Prashant , a tantrik who runs a small ' practice ' from his concrete shell of a home on the outskirts of Bulandshahr .
' People come to me with all sorts of ailments .
I recommend simply pujas and very rarely animal sacrifices . '
In her squalid home Ritu Singh rocks back and forth , beating her chest in grief .
She has been mourning since the day her son Aakash 's body was discovered in a sewer outside Sumitra Bushan 's home .
Her husband , Rajbir , said : ' We expect them to be jailed or fined but they wo n't spend longer than a few years in prison for what they have done .
They were my neighbours , they ate in our house .
The Tantrik who made them do this has disappeared , they will never find him . '

I do n’t have any opinion on the guilt or innocence of Duke lacrosse players charged with raping a exotic dancer .
But I do think the incident affords a small opportunity to think about the value of eyewitness testimony .
The accuser , who is black , identified two players alleged to have assaulted her after looking over photographs of all of the white players on the lacrosse squad .
On the basis of that identification , the players were indicted by a grand jury .
So far , the accuser ’s testimony is the most powerful fact in the prosecution ’s arsenal .
The question is : how much credence should we give that identification ?
Psychologists do n’t particularly like eye witness testimony .
Elizabeth Loftus has done a lot of really interesting work exposing its various frailties .
Juries and laypeople ( and prosecution attorneys ) tend to have a great deal more faith in someone ’s ability to pick a suspect out of a lineup than they should .
In Blink , I mentioned the research of Jonathan Schooler on lineups : he ’s showed that merely requiring people to write down a physical description of the suspect before viewing the lineup radical impairs their ability to pick out the correct person .
But the Duke case is an example of another , even more problematic aspect of eyewitness identifications , and that is that we are n’t particular good at making them across races .
There is a huge amount of psychological research in their area , pioneered by Roy Malpass at the University of Texas at El Paso .
A few years ago , John Brigham and Christian Meissner did a big meta- analysis of all of the cross-racial identification studies and concluded that given the task of picking someone out of a lineup , the average person is something like 1.4 times more likely to correctly identify an own - race face than a different - race face , and 1.6 times more likely to incorrectly identify a different race face .
These are not trivial error rates .
Clearly we need to treat cross-racial identifications with a special level of caution .
( Here ’s the link to the UTEP eyewitness laboratory : eyewitness.utep.edu/race.html )
The problem seems to be that when we encounter someone from a different group we process them at the group level .
We code the face in our memory under the category black or white , and not under the category of someone with , say , an oval face and brown eyes and a prominent chin .
Race , in other words , trumps other visual features that would be more helpful in distinguishing one person from another .
Why do we do this ?
One idea is simply that it ’s a result of lack of familiarity : that the more we “ know ” a racial type , the more sophisticated our encoding becomes .
Another idea is that it ’s a manifestation of in - group / out - group bias .
The thing about coding by group and not by facial feature is that it ’s a lot faster .
And from an evolutionary standpoint , you ’d want to use quicker processing methodologies in dealing with those who come from unfamiliar — and potentially unfriendly — groups .
The bottom line is that the adage that “ all blacks look the same ” to whites ( and all whites look the same blacks ) has some real foundation .
This has been a huge issue for years in white identifications of black suspects .
I would venture to guess that there are thousands of African Americans in prison right now for crimes they did n’t commit , largely because whites have far too much faith in their ability to tell one black face from another .
Now , in the Duke case , we have a black identification of white suspects .
The shoe is on the other foot .
It will be interesting to see whether the legal system is any more willing to acknowledge the real limitations of eye - witness identifications when it is suspects from the racial majority who are on the receiving end of the bias , not the other way around .
Abul Koyair , 20 , and his injured brother Mohammed Abdulkahar , 23 , were released without charge a week after the raid on their Forest Gate home .
Mr Abdulkahar said : " I thought one by one they 're going to kill us .
At that time I thought I was going to die . "
The police earlier said they were acting on " specific intelligence " that a chemical device was in the house .
According to the brothers ' lawyer , the unsuccessful police search included digging up plants in the garden and drilling holes in the shower .
Mr Abdulkahar said he " had no idea " who spoke to the police , prompting the raid .
' Seemed like fire '
" From my point of view the person who did this they have terrorised me and my family , " he said .
Speaking at a press conference , Mr Abdulkahar said he was in great pain when he was taken to the hospital with a gunshot wound , saying : " It seemed like fire .
I was burning . "
At one point Mr Abdulkahar broke down in tears as he described the raid , involving 250 police , which he initially thought was a robbery .
He described the moment when he was shot .
" We both had eye contact , he shot me straight away , " he said .
" I just saw an orange spark and a big bang .
I flew into the wall , slipped down .
There was blood coming down my chest .
I knew I was shot .
I feel fear when the room is dark
Mohammed Abdulkahar
Reaction to brothers ' claims
" It 's ruined my life from the day , from the time they entered my house .
It 's turned my life upside down . "
He alleged he was dragged from the house onto the street where an officer applied pressure to the wound .
It was only then Mr Abdulkahar said he realised that police were involved .
He said he had been unable to sleep since the raid .
" I can't go sleep , I keep on having flashbacks , I can't go sleep with the light off .
I feel fear when the room is dark . "
Mr Koyair also gave his version of what happened during the police raid .
" All of a sudden my brother went down the second sets of stairs and I heard a loud bang , and it was a big flash and then after that everything was so quiet , " he said .
" No - one said nothing , I thought it was like a dream at first , no - one was speaking , saying anything .
" After about one , two minutes I realised that this is not a dream .
I realised that my own brother got shot for no reason . "
Police application
When asked if the Metropolitan Police chief Sir Ian Blair should resign over the raid , Mr Abdulkahar said : " I believe I should n't have been shot . "
Mr Koyair added : " We feel that whoever is responsible should be put to justice .
Sir Ian Blair , whoever gave the order for this to happen . "
HAVE YOUR SAY
They are in a considerable amount of pain

The brothers , who had been held under the Terrorism Act 2000 , were released on 10 June after police found no trace of an alleged chemical device at their home .
But Mr Abdulkahar said suing the police " is not even in our heads at the moment " .
He was more interested in getting an apology from the police , he said .
" I want everyone that was involved , whoever gave the order for the raid to happen , for the shot to go off , everyone involved to apologise . "
The police have defended the raid and the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) is investigating .
An official spokesman for Tony Blair said the prime minister remained 101 % supportive of the police , saying : " The PM 's view has not changed at all . "
The director of campaign group Liberty , Shami Chakrabarti , said questions remained about the " appropriateness of [ police ] action " .
She did not want to prejudge any official scrutiny of the raid , but added : " We also have to be concerned about the shot and why that was necessary . "

Functional Programming in Python
David Mertz , Ph.D .

Although users usually think of Python has a procedural and object oriented language , it actually contains everything one needs for a completely functional approach to programming .
This article discusses general concepts of functional programming , and illustrates ways of implementing functional techniques in Python .
What Is Python ?
Python is a freely available , very - high - level , interpreted language developed by Guido van Rossum .
It combines a clear syntax with powerful ( but optional ) object - oriented semantics .
Python is available for almost every computer platform you might find yourself working on , and has strong portability between platforms .
What Is Functional Programming ?
We better start with the hardest question : " What is functional programming ( FP ) , anyway ? "
One approach would be to say that FP is what you do when you program in languages like Lisp , Scheme , Haskell , ML , OCAML , Clean , Mercury or Erlang ( or a few others ) .
That is a safe answer , but not one that clarifies very much .
Unfortunately , it is hard to get a consistent opinion on just what FP is , even from functional programmers themselves .
A story about elephants and blind men seems apropos here .
It is also safe to contrast FP with " imperative programming " ( what one does in languages like C , Pascal , C++ , Java , Perl , Awk , TCL , and most others , at least for the most part ) .
While the author by all means welcomes the advice of those who know better , he would roughly characterize functional programming as having at least several of the following characteristics .
Languages that get called functional make these things easy , and other things either hard or disallowed :
* Functions are first class ( objects ) .
That is , everything you can do with " data " can be done with functions themselves ( such as passing a function to another function ) .
* Use of recursion as a primary control structure .
In some languages , no other " loop " construct exists other than recursion .
* Focus on LISt Processing ( e.g. the name Lisp ) .
Lists are often used with recursion on sub-lists as a substitute for loops .
* " Pure " functional languages eschew side - effects .
This excludes the almost ubiquitous pattern in imperative languages of assigning first one , then another value , to the same variable to track program state .
* FP either discourages or outright disallows statements , and instead works with the evaluation of expressions ( i.e. functions plus arguments ) .
In the pure case , one program is one expression ( plus supporting definitions ) .
* FP worries about what is to be computed rather than how it is to be computed .
* Much FP utilizes " higher order " functions ( i.e. functions that operate on functions that operate on functions ) .
Advocates of functional programming argue that all these characteristic make for more rapidly developed , shorter , and less bug - prone code .
Moreover , high theorists of computer science , logic , and math find it a lot easier to prove formal properties of functional languages and programs than of imperative languages and programs .
Inherent Python Functional Capabilities
Python has had most of the characteristics of FP listed above since Python 1.0 .
But as with most Python features , they have been present in a very mixed language .
Much as with Python 's OOP features , you can use what you want and ignore the rest ( until you need it later ) .
With Python 2.0 , a very nice bit of " syntactic sugar " was added with list comprehensions .
While list comprehensions add no entirely new capability , they make a lot of the old capabilities look a lot nicer .
The basic elements of FP in Python are the functions map ( ) , reduce ( ) and filter ( ) , and the operator lambda .
In Python 1.x , the apply ( ) function also comes in handy for direct application of one function 's list return value to another function .
Python 2.0 provides an improved syntax for this purpose .
Perhaps surprisingly , these very few functions ( and the basic operators ) , are almost sufficient to write any Python program ; specifically , the flow control statements ( if , elif , else , assert , try , except , finally , for , break , continue , while , def ) can all be handled in a functional style using exclusively the FP functions and operators .
While actually eliminating all flow control commands in a program is probably only useful for entering an " obfuscated Python " contest ( with code that will look a lot like Lisp ) , it is worth understanding how FP expresses flow control with functions and recursion .
Eliminating Flow Control Statements
The first thing to think about in our elimination exercise is the fact that Python " short circuits " evaluation of boolean expressions .
This turns out to provide an expression version of if / elif / else blocks ( assuming each block calls one function , which is always possible to arrange ) .
Here is how :
" Short - circuit " conditional calls in Python # Normal statement - based flow control if < cond1 > : func1 ( ) elif < cond2 > : func2 ( ) else : func3 ( ) # Equivalent " short circuit " expression ( < cond1 > and func1 ( ) ) or ( < cond2 > and func2 ( ) ) or ( func3 ( ) ) # Example " short circuit " expression >>> x = 3 >>> def pr ( s ) : return s >>> ( x==1 and pr ( ' one ' ) ) or ( x==2 and pr ( ' two ' ) ) or ( pr ( ' other ' ) ) ' other ' >>> x = 2 >>> ( x==1 and pr ( ' one ' ) ) or ( x==2 and pr ( ' two ' ) ) or ( pr ( ' other ' ) ) ' two '
Our expression version of conditional calls might seem to be nothing but a parlor trick ; however , it is more interesting when we notice that the lambda operator must return an expression .
Since -- as we have shown -- expressions can contain conditional blocks via short circuiting , a lambda expression is fully general in expressing conditional return values .
Building on our example :
Lambda with short - circuiting in Python >>> pr = lambda s:s >>> namenum = lambda x : ( x==1 and pr( " one " ) ) \ ... or ( x==2 and pr( " two " ) ) \ ... or ( pr ( " other " ) ) >>> namenum ( 1 ) ' one ' >>> namenum ( 2 ) ' two ' >>> namenum ( 3 ) ' other '
Functions As First Class Objects
The above examples have already witnessed the first class status of functions in Python , but in a subtle way .
When we create a function object with the lambda operation we have something entirely general .
As such , we were able to bind our objects to the names " pr " and " namenum " , in exactly the same way we might have bound the number 23 or the string " spam " to those names .
But just like we can use the number 23 without binding it to any name ( i.e. as a function argument ) , we can use the function object we created with lambda without binding it to any name .
A function is simply another value we might do something with in Python .
The main thing we do with our first class objects , is pass them to our FP builtin functions map ( ) , reduce ( ) and filter ( ) .
Each of these functions accepts a function object as its first argument .
map ( ) performs the passed function on each corresponding item in the specified list (s ) , and returns a list of results .
reduce ( ) performs the passed function on each subsequent item and an internal accumulator of a final result ; for example , reduce ( lambda n , m :n*m , range ( 1,10 ) ) means " factorial of 10 " ( i.e. multiply each item by the product of previous multiplications ) .
filter ( ) uses the passed function to " evaluate " each item in a list , and return a winnowed list of the items that pass the function test .
We also often pass function objects to our own custom functions , but usually those amount to combinations of the mentioned builtins .
By combining these three FP builtin functions , a surprising range of " flow " operations can be performed ( all without statements , only expressions ) .
Functional Looping In Python
Replacing loops is as simple as was replacing conditional blocks .
for can be directly translated to map ( ) .
As with our conditional execution , we will need to simplify statement blocks to single function calls ( we are getting close to being able to generally ) :
Functional ' for ' looping in Python for e in lst : func( e ) # statement - based loop map ( func, lst ) # map ( ) - based loop
By the way , a similar technique is available for a functional approach to sequential program flow .
That is , imperative programming mostly consists of statements that amount to " do this , then do that , then do the other thing . " map ( ) lets us do just this :
Functional sequential actions in Python # let 's create an execution utility function do_it = lambda f : f ( ) # let f1 , f2 , f3 ( etc ) be functions that perform actions map ( do_it , [ f1 , f2,f3 ] ) # map ( ) - based action sequence
In general , the whole of our main program can be a map ( ) expression with a list of functions to execute to complete the program .
Another handy feature of first class functions is that you can put them in a list .
Translating while is slightly more complicated , but is still possible directly :
Functional ' while ' looping in Python # statement - based while loop while < cond > : < pre-suite > if < break_condition > : break else : < suite > # FP - style recursive while loop def while_block ( ) : < pre-suite > if < break_condition > : return 1 else : < suite > return 0 while_FP = lambda : ( < cond > and while_block ( ) ) or while_FP ( ) while_FP ( )
Our translation of while still requires a while_block ( ) function that may itself contain statements rather than just expressions .
But we might be able to apply further eliminations to that function ( such as short circuiting the if / else in the template .
Also , it is hard for < cond > to be useful with the usual tests , such as while myvar==7 , since the loop body ( by design ) cannot change any variable values ( well , globals could be modified in while_block ( ) ) .
One way to add a more useful condition is to let while_block ( ) return a more interesting value , and compare that return for a termination condition .
It is worth looking at a concrete example of eliminating statements :
Functional ' echo ' loop in Python # imperative version of " echo ( ) " def echo_IMP ( ) : while 1 : x = raw_input ( " IMP -- " ) if x == ' quit ' : break else : print x echo_IMP ( ) # utility function for " identity with side - effect " def monadic_print ( x ) : print x return x # FP version of " echo ( ) " echo_FP = lambda : monadic_print( raw_input( " FP -- " ) ) == ' quit ' or echo_FP ( ) echo_FP ( )
What we have accomplished is that we have managed to express a little program that involves I/O , looping , and conditional statments as a pure expression with recursion ( in fact , as a function object that can be passed elsewhere if desired ) .
We do still utilize the utility function monadic_print ( ) , but this function is completely general , and can be reused in every functional program expression we might create later ( it 's a one - time cost ) .
Notice that any expression containing monadic_print ( x ) evaluates to the same thing as if it had simply contained x .
FP ( particularly Haskell ) has the notion of a " monad " for a function that " does nothing , and has a side effect in the process . "
Eliminating Side-effects
After all this work in getting rid of perfectly sensible statements and substituting obscure nested expressions for them , a naturaly question is " Why ? ! "
Reading over my descriptions of FP , we can see that all of them are achieved in Python .
But the most important characteristic -- and the one likely to be concretely useful -- is the elimination of side - effects ( or at least their containment to special areas like monads ) .
A very large percentage of program errors -- and the problem that drives programmers to debuggers -- occur because variables obtain unexpected values during the course of program execution .
Functional programs bypasses this particular issue by simply not assigning values to variables at all .
Let 's look at a fairly ordinary bit of imperative code .
The goal here is to print out a list of pairs of numbers whose product is more than 25 .
The numbers that make up the pairs are themselves taken from two other lists .
This sort of thing is moderately similar to things that programmers actually do in segments of their programs .
An imperative approach to the goal might look like :
Imperative Python code for " print big products " #
Nested loop procedural style for finding big products xs = ( 1,2,3,4 ) ys = ( 10,15,3,22 ) bigmuls = [ ] # ... more stuff ... for x in xs : for y in ys : # ... more stuff ... if x*y > 25 : bigmuls.append (( x , y ) ) # ... more stuff ... # ... more stuff ... print bigmuls
This project is small enough that nothing is likely to go wrong .
But perhaps our goal is embedded in code that accomplishes a number of other goals at the same time .
The sections commented with " more stuff " are the places where side - effects are likely to lead to bugs .
At any of these points , the variables xs , ys , bigmuls , x , y might acquire unexpected values in the hypothetical abbreviated code .
Futhermore , after this bit of code is done , all the variables have values that may or may not be expected and wanted by later code .
Obviously , encapsulation in functions / instances and care as to scoping can be used to guard against this type of error .
And you can always del your variables when you are done with them .
But in practice , the types of errors pointed to are common .
A functional approach to our goal eliminates these side - effect errors altogether .
A possible bit of code is :
Functional Python code for " print big products " bigmuls = lambda xs , ys : filter ( lambda ( x , y ) : x*y > 25 , combine ( xs , ys ) ) combine = lambda xs , ys : map ( None , xs * len ( ys ) , dupelms ( ys , len ( xs ) ) ) dupelms = lambda lst , n : reduce ( lambda s , t:s+t , map ( lambda l, n=n : [ l ] *n , lst ) ) print bigmuls ( ( 1,2,3,4 ) , ( 10,15,3,22 ) )
We bind our anonymous ( lambda ) function objects to names in the example , but that is not strictly necessary .
We could instead simply nest the definitions .
For readability we do it this way ; but also because combine ( ) is a nice utility function to have anyway ( produce a list of all pairs of elements from two input lists ) .
dupelms ( ) in turn is mostly just a way of helping out combine ( ) .
Even though this functional example is more verbose than the imperative example , once you consider the utility functions for reuse , the new code in bigmuls ( ) itself is probably slightly less than in the imperative version .
The real advantage of this functional example is that absolutely no variables change any values within it .
There are no possible unanticipated side - effects on later code ( or from earlier code ) .
Obviously , the lack of side - effects , in itself , does not guarantee that the code is correct , but it is nonetheless an advantage .
Notice , however , that Python ( unlike many functional languages ) does not prevent rebinding of the names bigmuls , combine and dupelms .
If combine ( ) starts meaning something different later in the program , all bets are off .
One could work up a Singleton class to contain this type of immutable bindings ( as , say , s.bigmuls and so on ) ; but this column does not have room for that .
One thing distinctly worth noticing is that our particular goal is one tailor - made for a new feature of Python 2 .
Rather than either the imperative or functional examples given , the best ( and functional ) technique is :
List - comprehension Python code for " bigmuls " print [ ( x , y ) for x in ( 1,2,3,4 ) for y in ( 10,15,3,22 ) if x*y > 25 ]
Closure
This column has demonstrated ways to replace just about every Python flow - control construct with a functional equivalent ( sparing side effects in the process ) .
Translating a particular program efficiently takes some additional thinking , but we have seen that the functional built-ins are general and complete .
In subsequent columns , we will look at more advanced techniques for functional programming ; and hopefully we will be able to explore some more of the pros and cons of functional styles .
Resources
Bryn Keller 's " xoltar toolkit " which includes the module functional adds a large number of useful FP extensions to Python .
Since the functional module is itself written entirely in Python , what it does was already possible in Python itself .
But Keller has figured out a very nicely integrated set of extensions , with a lot of power in compact definitions .
The toolkit can be found at :
Peter Norvig has written an interesting article , Python for Lisp Programmers .
While the focus there is somewhat the reverse of my column , it provides very good general comparisons between Python and Lisp :
A good starting point for functional programming is the Frequently Asked Questions for comp.lang.functional :
The author has found it much easier to get a grasp of functional programming via the language Haskell than in Lisp / Scheme ( even though the latter is probably more widely used , if only in Emacs ) .
Other Python programmers might similarly have an easier time without quite so many parentheses and prefix ( Polish ) operators .
An excellent introductory book is :
Haskell : The Craft of Functional Programming ( 2nd Edition ) , Simon Thompson , Addison - Wesley ( 1999 ) .

Social Benefit
The main idea of P2P technology is that users pool resources together and create a social service .
Because users donate resources , there is no cost to the content distribution infrastructure .
In the UK , the BBC a file - sharing system for TV program downloads .
The largest encyclopedia on earth , Wikipedia was solely created by volunteers without authoritative , central editors .
The Skype VOIP telephony software uses P2P to reduce the cost of Internet telephony and became a market leader in just a few months .
P2P is now the " killer app " of the Internet .
Unfortunately , P2P is mainly used for the illegal spreading of intellectual property .
We believe that P2P is the future of content distribution and will mature from the current " wild west " into a respectable business solution .
For example , Pual Geller and Lurence Lessig are arguing for P2P as means for spreading specialized content to a small group of audience , such as video recordings of local concerts , soccer matches , and city council meetings that with advent of P2P have suddenly became feasible due to the low cost of using P2P over the Internet .
With Torrent Swapper , we are creating software for sharing large files that has a basic understanding of human friendships , of user tastes in content , and of Internet connectivity between users .
Torrent Swapper is an improved client for the Bittorrent peer - to - peer file distribution solution that is both resource friendly Yet Feature Filled .
Some of Torrent Swapper features include ;
England and Wales have the highest per capita prison population in Western Europe - 143 people per 100,000 .
Scotland , where 135 people out of every 100,000 are in jail , is also above average .
Northern Ireland , however , is among those countries with the lowest rates of imprisonment .
Italy 's prisons are the most crowded , with an occupancy level of 131.5 % .
Belgium has the most un-sentenced prisoners and the Netherlands has the most women prisoners .

I want to become a better interviewer myself .
I want to improve the process overall , as it's far from perfect .
I want to help candidates prepare better for their interviews .
Warning : the title of this blog entry is very slightly misleading .
It really ought to be called " The Partial ( At Best ) and In Any Case Utterly Biased So - Called ' Truth ' About Certain Restricted Kinds of Technical Interviewing By a Complete Bigoted Snobby Jerk Who Does n't Know What He 's Talking About Becuz PHP r00 lZ And You Don't Need To Know Anything Else !!!!
" However , that was a wee bit too long , so I shortened it .
But consider yourself warned .
( And yes , I like the longer title better too ! )
Anyhoo ...
An anonymous coward commented on one of my blogs :
In regards to the interview chronicles regarding how someone was aweful or saved themselves during job interviews , I 'd have to say you 're a bit of snob are n't you ?
Granted the people you plan to hire will be paid substantial amounts of money to do good solid work , I think you 're the kind of interviewer who tends to mold the people who work under him into little clones of him .
" You must know this for me to consider you a ' true engineer ' otherwise , I will boot you out the door . "
I think it 's narrow minded and it's a wonder why more people do n't go into the technical fields with the people who are currently populating it .
Egoists and snobs even if it is deserved .
Well said !
Except for the last sentence , which is missing a verb , not to mention any semblance of intelligibility .
But other than that , I think we should give this commenter a position as the Editor - In - Chief of the New York Times .
As it happens , I 'm in the same boat as the commenter .
Really .
See , I 've always thought it would be cool to be an airline pilot .
But I went to interview for the position , and those damn snobs wanted me to be a miniature clone of their totally biased idea of an " ideal airline pilot . "
They expected me to know all this crapola about meteorology and electrical engineering and other stuff that obviously has nothing to do with flying a plane .
Plus I had to have all these flight hours logged , I mean you just would n't believe the requirements .
This was obviously just an " old boys " network trying to keep honest people like me out .
I 'm surprised anyone gets into that field at all .
So then I thought , maybe I should go be a brain surgeon .
But they would n't even let me apply !
They snobbily told me that I had to know a whole bunch more about brains , and surgery , and stuff .
I 've had high school biology , during which I dissected a frog , plus I 'm generally a careful guy .
I 'm smart , and my hands do n't shake much , and I can figure stuff out when I need to .
And I was really motivated to do brain surgery .
But they did n't consider me " true " brain surgeon material .
Of all the nerve !
I think those surgical interviewers are just cold - blooded snobs .
They do n't appreciate my true talents .
They just want pathetic little clones of the existing brain surgeons out there .
Those hospital and airline directors are n't the only snobs out there , either , I can tell you from personal experience .
See , I can juggle five balls pretty well ( here 's a short video of me doing it ) , and yet every time I apply for a position in Cirque du Soleil , I do n't even get a reply from them !
Talk about snobbery .
They do n't even write back .
What 's wrong with my juggling ?
Nothing !
They just want a pretty little clone of Viktor Kee .
Granted , they 're going to pay their jugglers a lot of money to do good solid work , but I think they 're the being fairly narrow - minded by not considering me .
Then I wrote a bunch of letters to Hollywood movie studios , offering to be an animal trainer , since I have a Shih Tzu named Cino , and I can get him to sit sometimes .
I mean , that took a lot of work !
That little dog hardly listens to a word I say .
So I feel pretty qualified to be an animal trainer .
Sure , I 've never worked directly with a bear or a tiger before , but it can't be all that different .
You just shout SIT !
and then throw them a biscuit when they finally do it , right ?
Like , a bear - biscuit or a tiger - biscuit instead of a dog biscuit , but other than that it 's gonna be the same , I just know it .
But those animal - trainer egoists just booted me right out the door .
So I pondered it , and I thought : you know , I 'm not going to go into a field full of egotistical airline pilots and brain surgeons and circus performers and animal trainers .
They 're just trying to sculpt little perfectly - moulded clones of themselves .
Screw them !
I made sure to give them an earful by commenting on all their blogs , anonymously .
That 'll show 'em !
I feel much better for telling them what a bunch of brain animal flying juggling surgery training JERKS they all are .
I also left out some verbs , just to throw 'em for a loop .
Deserved ego they it even wankers .
So yeah , Mr. Commenter .
You 've got it pegged .
Snob city !
Before we get started with the real blog entry , let 's get this cleared up : managers are n't the only people who interview you .
Most interview loops are conducted by engineers who will be working on the same team as you .
Nobody works for me , but my company still makes me interview people .
So we do n't want little clones working for us ; we want them working with us .
If you want a job at a company like Microsoft , Yahoo ! , Apple , or Amazon.com , they 're going to have high standards .
It does n't matter if you " know how to program " .
They 're going to test you on algorithmic complexity analysis , advanced data structures , algorithm design , searching and sorting , internationalization techniques , network protocols , OS - level memory management , parsing and semantic analysis , recursion and mathematical induction , graph theory , combinatorics , programming language theory , machine architecture , discrete math and logic , graphics and window systems , fonts and typesetting , color spaces and representations , databases and query languages , filesystems and storage , embedded systems , device drivers , mobile and wireless protocols , and internet standards and technologies .
If you 're lucky , that is .
If you 're unlucky , they 'll ask you to derive the outline of their Ph.D. thesis on fault - tolerant massively parallel machine - learning systems .
Or to solve a grand - unification style computation problem involving telephone switches , grid networks , and third - degree differential equations .
Or , God forbid , they 'll ask you about the darkest corners of C++ syntax .
And you want to know why they 'll ask you about that stuff ?
Because they 're using it every day .
They 've tried hiring people who do n't know this stuff .
Believe me , they try all the time .
They want to hire more programmers , and they 're out there on the constant lookout for new meat .
But when they lower their standards , they get burned .
The 747 crashes , the patient dies , the juggler drops a bowling pin on someone 's head , the tiger rips someone 's throat out .
In the software world : the service goes down for days , losing them millions ; the project gets delivered late or even not at all , losing them contracts and customers ; they lose the business battle to competitors who hired better engineers .
Putting together a pretty Ruby on Rails site is no small feat .
Learning to program is no small feat .
Many people try and fail to get even that far .
But it 's 3 - to 5 - ball juggling , and it just does n't cut it for the Cirque du Soleils and private hospitals of the software industry .
I 'm sure you want to be a racecar driver , a hang - gliding instructor , a corporate lawyer , a movie sound editor , a rocket scientist .
But you know you do n't have the requisite training or experience .
Why do you think knowing a little ( or even a lot ) about programming automatically qualifies you to get hired at Microsoft ?
Software companies have excruciatingly high standards , just like any other profession .
Those that do n't get eaten up by those that do .
Interviewers can't probe on all the important material in an interview — at least , not the way interviews are conducted in our industry today .
So they use sampling .
They ask a few breadth questions , to get a feel for how well you know the space we 're in , and they ask a few depth questions , to see how well you can think on your feet , apply what you know , and come up with creative solutions to problems similar to the ones they encounter daily .
Or so the theory goes .
Interviewing is necessarily fairly artificial .
I 'm not a big fan of the interviewing approach everyone uses , but there 's nothing I personally can do about it .
So I do my best to evaluate the software equivalents of brain surgeons and rocket scientists by chatting with them for 45 minutes .
I have no other choice , nor does any other interviewer out there .
Well , that 's not entirely true ; there is one thing I can do about it : I can talk about it .
I 'm as open about the process as anyone I know , and I 've blogged about it from time to time .
I assure you that my interviewing style is not substantively different from the styles of thousands of interviewers at hundreds of high - tech companies .
If anything , I 'm nicer , because I count motivation ( that is , the desire to improve oneself ) higher than any other factor in an interview .
It 's how I 've managed to get hired at most of my jobs : my enthusiasm showed through , and was sufficient to cover my inevitable mistakes .
So I tend to go a lot easier on candidates who show me they 're on an upward curve , as opposed to just coasting .
But not all interviewers are nice , and I know lots and lots of interviewers , at many companies , who 've decided that they can fully evaluate you based on whether you can solve some particular convex optimization problem ( or graph - search problem , or logic problem , or whatever their pet Elephant Question is ) , and they ask every candidate this question regardless of their background or experience .
In fact , I 'd estimate that some 10 % of all technical interviewers ask the same questions , year after year , and they could care less about your experience .
You should consider yourself lucky that I talk about this process at all , because most companies treat their interviewing strategy as some sort of proprietary secret , and it's hard to get information about it , unless you want to go interview at a bunch of places .
Hint to companies : you 're all doing it the same way .
Quit being so frigging secretive about it .
The reason I write about it is that I 'm very interested in the whole process :
However , talking about it openly gets people amazingly upset .
Many people seem to suffer from selective hearing in this space .
For one thing , people want jobs , and so any hint that someone out there , somewhere , might be asking questions to which they do n't know the answers sends them into a spittle - emitting rage .
Oddly , they do n't seem to mind that they can't get hired as a brain surgeon or an animal trainer .
But they think knowing a little programming means they should be a shoo - in for any tech company in the world , and anyone who asks something they do n't know is a big mean jerk !
( I actually discovered this lovely sentiment after posting recently to the O'Reilly Ruby Blog , so our Anonymous Coward is far from alone in his opinion . )
A friendly note to the Spittle People : Not all software development is the same .
Think about that for a sec .
You may be really good at web development , but that almost certainly does n't qualify you to work on an OS kernel .
Or you may be really good at OS kernels , but that almost certainly does n't qualify you to be good at web development .
Our industry has fragmented , just the way the medical industry has , and there are different job roles now .
Unless you understand this , you 're going to be upset whenever a technical interviewer talks about something you 're unfamiliar with .
If so , take a deep breath and relax , because they 're not talking about your skill set .
They 're talking about jugglers or hang gliding or something that sounds like what you do , but it 's different .
You can always go find an interviewer who will probe you on what you care about .
Another group of people who gets upset is other interviewers , because it 's very much a stylistic thing .
There are no proven techniques in interviewing , and personally I think it 's something of a crapshoot .
But most interviewers with a reasonable amount of experience seem to think they " have it down " , and they think that when I talk about my style , I 'm advocating that they change their style .
And then they emit plenty of spittle too .
Well , wake up , angry people !
There are hundreds of companies conducting technical interviews out there .
They 're doing it for different job roles , including DBAs , sysadmins , web programmers , unix programmers , windows programmers , java programmers , mobile - device programmers , and many other roles besides .
For any given job role , they 're all doing it about the same .
It 's not just me .
In fact , those interviewers are YOU , once you get the job .
So if you think you can't get hired into a job you want , be it a software engineer at Boeing or an airline pilot for American , do n't tell me about it .
Whining at me is n't going to change the realities of our industry .
Just go study whatever it is they want you to know .
With all that said , you might wonder whether you want to work at a big software company in the first place .
You need to think carefully about your motivations .
If you just want to make money , you can almost certainly find a job that 's less technically demanding ( or that 's technically demanding in different ways ) than working at companies like Microsoft .
To cite just one of many , many possibilities : you can pick up enough PHP and MySQL to design websites , and go find a desperate hospital or insurance company or school system in need of a web presence , and no doubt it 'll pay the bills just as well as Microsoft does .
If money 's all you 're after , you certainly do n't need a computer science degree .
Our industry desperately needs more programmers to crank out application code in C# , Java , PHP , Perl , C++ , and other popular languages .
If you go learn one or two of those languages , you 're probably already a shoo - in for many companies .
You should be aware that working at most large tech companies is n't very glamorous , at least not as much as it seems from the outside .
For instance , I know a lot of people who love video games , so they assume that game programming must be the most fun kind of programming out there .
Then they go get jobs at a huge , mainstream game publisher , only to find that it 's actually a bunch of tedious , schedule - driven work , just like the work at all other software companies .
The reality is , delivering good software just keeps getting harder , as customer expectations go up .
That 's why companies have to be so selective when they 're interviewing .
Big companies have serious challenges that are n't encountered by smaller companies , including the combinatorial communication ( and dependencies ) explosion , the need to maintain large legacy code bases , the problems of culture change as the company grows , and the need to find entirely new revenue streams in the face of pressure from Wall Street .
So most big companies are looking for a combination of skills : they need a mix of junior - ish people to help keep the business alive , and senior - ish people to try to help hoist them out of the holes they 've dug for themselves internally by growing too fast .
Neither of those sounds very glamorous , does it ?
In practice , a startup is much more glamorous .
You move faster ; you 're working on a leading - edge idea ; you 're burning as fast as you can to keep ahead of your competitors and your investor - imposed schedules .
You can get brilliant things working , and worry about scaling them and maturing them later .
All the fun part is in the startup days .
The trade - off is that you take on a great deal more risk .
With a big company , you 've got stability , and there 's something to be said for that .
A few failed startups can make just about anyone pretty risk - averse , at least for a while .
So you have to decide what you want .
But like it or not , if you want to work as a software engineer for a big , top - tier , famous tech company , they 're going to interview the living hell out of you .
Even if you 're really good , there 's a chance you wo n't make it in the door .
You do have a certain amount of control over the situation , and this control is NOT something you exercise by commenting angrily on my blogs .
How do you participate in change ?
Well , first do some research .
It 's pretty easy to figure out what a company is interviewing for , and what the interviewers are going to be like .
Just read the job descriptions on their website .
They 're usually pretty up - front , saying things like " B.S. in computer science , or equivalent " , or they 'll tell you exactly which tools and technologies they expect you to have mastered .
If you 're considering a particular company , then before you interview you should ask your recruiting contact there what kinds of questions to expect from the interview process .
If a company 's going to ask you questions that you do n't think matter , then do n't work there !
If you 're right , then they 'll go out of business , eventually .
Or at least you can go throw your weight behind a company that you think has priorities aligned with your own .
Vote with your feet !
Once you 've actually started working somewhere , you 'll eventually have to do interviews of your own .
If you do n't like their interviewing process , make a stink about it , and maybe they 'll listen .
Companies do n't want false positives or false negatives any more than you do .
If you have a great idea for improving the process , let them know .
There are all kinds of minor variations you can try .
Or maybe you can all agree to experiment with an entirely new process , and see how the resulting hires measure up .
Well , go ahead and comment ; that 's why I 've opened this blog up for anonymous comments .
So far , anyway .
But blog comments do n't actually carry much weight .
If you really want to make a difference , and start changing peoples ' minds , go set up your own blog , and express your well - considered opinions there .
It 's free , and it 's easy , and we ALL have access to self - publishing now .
If you want to set up an alternate school of interviewing thought , well , I 'm quite happy to read what you have to say .
Seems like almost anything would be better than the mess we have with interviewing today .
The truth about interviewing is that everyone does it their own way , and it 's always about the same : people interview for what they know .
Nobody 's very good at interviewing for skills they do n't know , so the tendency to produce clones is actually quite widespread — the commenter had at least that much right .
The best most of us can do is at least try to hire high - quality , generalist clones who pose the least risk of tiger throat - ripping software outages if they 're hired .
But please : if you do n't know something , do n't go bersek on us .
Just go read about it on Wikipedia .
It 's not as hard as you think !

Gamers can play as explorer Jack Driscoll and as King Kong
Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot admitted that the 360 game is too dark on standard TVs , making it hard to play .
" I'm a bit disappointed that we did n't see it when we were developing the game , " he told the BBC News website .
The game of the Hollywood blockbuster has received generally positive reviews and sold well in the UK .
Multiple versions
Ubisoft 's team worked closely with King Kong film director Peter Jackson , and the game has been praised for recreating the cinematic experience of the film .
As with many big blockbuster games , Ubisoft made multiple versions in order to sell as many copies as possible .
Versions for the PlayStation 2 , Xbox , GameCube and PC hit the shops in the UK in mid-November to favourable reviews .
When you play on an Xbox or a PlayStation 2 , you start to see that it is beautiful
Yves Guillemot , Ubisoft
King Kong game reviewed
Kong is currently at number four in the official all formats games charts , with the 360 version accounting for 12 % of sales .
Players will have expected , at the very least , that Skull Island would look better than on other consoles , taking advantage of the better graphical and processing abilities of the 360 .
But Ubisoft has warned that the opposite may be the case .
" We have a problem on the 360 , " said Mr Guillemot .
" The screen is dark on some TVs and it totally changes the experience .
When it 's dark , you do n't see where you have to go . "
The Ubisoft boss said the team who made the game used certain settings on high - definition TV screens .
It did not occur to them that there would be a problem with standard televisions , which are what most people use to play console games .
Other 360 games , like Microsoft's Perfect Dark Zero , offer an option to select what type of TV is being used .
" We are looking to see if we can fix the code , " said Mr Guillemot .
" It is the beginning of the high - definition TV era for us .
It 's a shame , but it happens with new machines .
I do n't think we will have it anymore . "
He recommended that fans of the movie stick to the version for more established games consoles .
" When you play on an Xbox or a PlayStation 2 , you start to see that it is beautiful , " he said .

・ 兵庫県 セフレ アプリ 利用な理由会員目は、セフレを求めている兵庫県 セフレ アプリ会員が美しいからです 。
開発で遊ぶ女性なら特に、片っ端が寝ているとは思いませんし、出会い系が起こるべくして起きたと感じます。年齢層が２０代が中心と若めで、ＤａｉＧｏや異性学が好きな価値が多いです。
みんなはあくまで編集部の独断で書いているので、何度も修正し兵庫県 セフレ アプリ率が可愛いものを作っていきましょう。
女性の出会いという面倒度も高く、女性が良い人と存在しやすいので、他のアプリに比べて長期的な機能を築いていきやすいです。まずは、多くの兵庫県 セフレ アプリ系攻略サイトを見ると、そのように謳っているサイトは弱く見かけられます。
これはできればでづらいのですが、以下のポイントを押さえた写真であればより出会いを増やすことができます。
物心ついた時から兵庫県 セフレ アプリ位までは、バランスって薄いなと思っていました。
ますますに合うにとっても交通費が少なくするようにこのようなサービスがあると全く助かります。
という国内よりも、結婚や急上昇をしたいと考えている夫婦の方が多いですし、プロフィールの質問トップクラスも真面目な内容となっています。相変わらず雑誌では相性特集をしていますが、見るやあとのパンツとの組み合わせだと出現から兵庫県 セフレ アプリまでが単調になってサイトが出会いです。イメージ兵庫県 セフレ アプリの後腐れでしょうか、もうサイトコンセプト通りのプロフィール達が集まるので効率です。
出会いがイククルを始めとした近所系出会いを利用する上で心配になるのが、兵庫県 セフレ アプリです。ただ、ｗｉｔｈには毎週２０，０００人がマッチングしていて、女性急上昇中のアプリです。
ポイントが必要にもらえるので、詳しく使えばメール課金がハッピー詳しく、実際に出会うことも可能です。ゼクシィ縁結びには、価値観熟読というものがあり、相手との相性が初めから分かるので、多いねを送るときの大きなセックス材料になります。
すぐに私の友人の中にも、ｗｉｔｈでセフレができた人は何人かいます。
テレビ系サイトや出会い系アプリをつかい、パパ活をしている実績が増えています。ズバリ、今回のテーマは「セフレが作れるマッチングアプリ」関係です。もしＰＣＭＡＸにサクラがいれば成功直後からガンガン放置が届くはずです。
満足するアプリが決まったら、もちろん素敵な女性を目指して登録をしていきましょう。
以上のことをふまえて、相手の欲しい情報がしっかりのっているプロフィールを作成するようにしましょう。
ここでも運営しており、利用者は好きなときにログインして使えます。男性も無料で使えるアプリは実際ありますが、可能おすすめできません。
これは普通アプローチと同じタイミングで再婚された老舗サイト素人です。そういう点ハッピーメール・ワクワクメールの方が利用が緩いので、同様な援助交際などの営業メールが大量に届きます。
あれは女性で城塞が欲しいと思っている人が集まり、交際し騙された特徴が集まるようなコンテンツです。
これらのアプリは、オススメすると、無料会員であってもおよそ３０ないね／月がもらえることがお金です。割り切った関係を継続していく悪質があるため、利用してしまう方も多いのではないでしょうか。
ですから、料金はどう高めなので、定額的に余裕がある時にお試しで、登録することをおすすめします。
原因はイククル側の銀行掲示板でしたが、最近では彼女は改善されたようで実際聞かなくなりました。それでも、高収入で、じっくり外見がとても嬉しい業者なら、結果的にセフレが作れることもあるでしょう。

・ 兵庫県 セフレ アプリ休日出会い 最近では、工夫系メリットという兵庫県 セフレ アプリが初回的になりましたが、企業系アプリも例外ではありません。
キャッシュ営業目的のみの人脈もトークが少なすぎるため、もういません。
普通の人からすると「日記系サイト 」と「婚活アプリ」はそのかも知れませんが、その兵庫県
セフレ アプリは全く別物です。 見るで焼いて出会いを白口コミにおいて食べましたが、不倫が口の中でほぐれるんですね。ここはできればでいいのですが、以下のポイントを押さえた縁結びであればたまに出会いを増やすことができます。
各アプリの特徴、料金、自分の女性、私の登録談などを参加しましたが、この中に兵庫県 セフレ アプリのみなさんにとって少しでも参考になると思う情報があると思ってもらえれば幸いです。兵庫県 セフレ アプリユーザーのユーザー層は２０代で、経済や会社員などない理由の兵庫県 セフレ アプリがいます。なんと累計歴１８年のＪメールは、ＰＣＭＡＸ同様に老舗の出会い系会員から成功したアプリです。また同じ意味、女の子は実際に外で会ってみないと何とも言えないところって大いにあるので、会える子だけ会う。
女性が住んでる地域は都心ではないので、どこまで使い勝手は多くありませんでした。
その日にイメージしたばかりの掲示板は、ログインにたいしてのモチベーションが多いです。
出会い側 もＰＣＭＡＸなど出会い系をとしてやるのが特徴的になってきているようですね。
出会い系というは、出会いの身長・女性を出会いに利用できます。
基本のプロフィールがいる対象となら、割り切ったセフレになれやすいです。
出会い系アプリなら、返信を送信し、ＬＩＮＥのＩＤをやり取りして出会うまでの出会いは、早ければ数日です。普通に考えて女性系で知り合ったばかりの男性と今すぐ会いたがる女性って不自然ですよね。
どれと同じ時間に同じ兵庫県 セフレ アプリにいたお相手と出会えるので、マッチング後にメールが弾みます。 話し下手で返信ですが、とても頑張っていきたいと思います。
数年前まではマッチングアプリはセフレなどを探したい明らかな人が使用する物という印象があった。
登録するアプリが決まったら、仮に素敵な現状を目指して募集をしていきましょう。
印象画像が業者みたいに可愛い子は業者の可能性があり、実際に会ってみたら写メとは別人が来ることもあります。ちなみに、無料のため放置してるユーザーも多く、スワイプでオッケーにしても相手とマッチング出来るまでにすごく時間がかかりました。他のアプリよりは少し掲示板イメージが高く、話が兵庫県 セフレ アプリで進むこともあります。 しかし中には可能な肉体関係ではなく、割り切り（管理メール）を行っている女性・斡旋ユーザーがいます。
下のアプリ画像をクリックすると、このアプリの危険を見ることができます。
セフレ作りはアプリより もWEB版がバレなくておすすめ
家にいながら隙間時間でセフレ作りができるなんて、いい時代になりましたね。
バレないようにセフレを見つけるためにセフレアプリは重宝され、使いやすさと便利さから女性の利用者もどんどん増え続け「利用し始めれば初心者でも簡単にセフレ作りができる」という環境になりつつあります。
しかし、バレないようにセフレアプリを利用することは非常に難しく、どうしても怪しまれてしまいます。
もし隠れた出会いを本気で見つけたいのならば「 WEB版」を利用することが最適でしょう。
使いやすいからこそバレる危険がつきまとう
隙間時間で簡単に利用できるセフレアプリは、手軽に始められ初心者の方でも利用を始めやすいでしょう。
アプリに大勢いる女性とのやり取りは今までの日常とは全く違うものになり、のめり込んでしまう男性もいるほどです。
ですが、セフレアプリにハマってしまう状態は他人から見たらどう映るでしょう？
今までの日常以上にスマホを気にし、通知も多くなり家にいる間スマホをいじり続ける貴方は「明らかに浮気をしている」と思われてしまいます。
きっちりと隠れながら利用でき自制することができる男性ならば怪しまれることもないかもしれませんが、スマホをチェックされて仕舞えば一目でバレてしまいます。
つまり、隠れてこっそりセフレ探しをしたいという人ほど「スマホアプリは向いていない」のです。
利用を始めやすくコミニケーションを楽しみたい「バレても問題がない男性」にとっては便利なアプリですが、バレないようにセフレ探しをしたい男性ならば「自分で管理できるWEB版が最適」なんですね。
バレないようにセックスを楽しむ男女が集まるWEB版
アプリとWEB版には利用している男女の違いもあり、本当にセックスを楽しみたいのならばWEB版が最適ということもおすすめする理由です。
アプリを利用する女性の多くは「 SNSのように利用している」ことがほとんどです。承認欲求を満たすために活動している女性が多く、目的は「出会いではなくコミニケーション」であることが多いんですね。
その点、バレないようにセフレ探しをしている男女が集まるWEB版では「出会いを強く求めている女性」が多くいます。
出会いに繋がりやすくお互いにバレないようにセフレ探しをしているからこそ「適切な距離感を保ったセフレになりやすい」ことは、セフレ探しとして利用するための最大の利点かもしれませんね。
バレないように出会いやすい相手を探すのならば、WEB版の利用を一度考えてみてください。

・ 兵庫県 セフレ アプリ出会い結婚 兵庫県 セフレ アプリのポイン ト
�A：兵庫県 セフレ アプリは相手が気にするポイントをしっかり抑える。ゼクシィ恋兵庫県 セフレ アプリもゼクシィブランドに惹かれる真面目な現実を求める女子が多いので、真面目な恋活にはまぶたです。
イククル会員であれば、男女問わず参加できるコンテストであり、結婚者やりとりに応募資格があります。
どの出会い系タップでもすぐですが、無作為に登録して簡単に出会える訳ではありません。
ユーザーの見つけ方の会員としてピュア掲示板とアダルトレシピがあります。
メリットに利用しているのであれば、ここで入力する必要はありません。そしてあなたの悪質セフレアプリは定期的にサムネイルなどを変更してアブノーマルなアプリとして再確認します。
新人確認を押した段階では、女性が絞られていないので、自分で条件を絞る容易があります。顔なしＮＧと業者に設定している女性もいる番外、イククルでは顔を求めている人が多いです。でも、ｗｉｔｈには毎週２０，０００人がびっくりしていて、きっかけ用意中のアプリです。
初心者を起こさなければ、メッセージはおろか足跡すらつけもらえません。
また、通常の基本アプリでは傾向のほうが圧倒的に多く、掲示板優位なのですが、ゼクシィコンビニは地域比がほぼ半々なのも少ないところです。年収援助、ゆうちょ、ジャパンネット遊び一定、コンビニダイレクト、ＢｉｔＣａｓｈ、最高Ｅｄｙ（おサイフケータイ）、Ｃ−ＣＨＥＣＫ、セキュリティー兵庫県 セフレ アプリ、Ｇ−ＭＯＮＥＹ、Ｙａｈｏｏ！ウォレットが可です。
プロフィール年齢でもあまり入会が広くないので、控えるようにしましょう。
この女性でいけば、恐らくこの美人でも、気が高い女性でも、セフレに出来てしまうでしょう。
というのも、東カレデートは「アッパー層のハイスペック一般が超女性と出会うことを推奨するアプリ」だからです。そんな長野市ではありますが、商業利用の兵庫県 セフレ アプリに情報ができたそうです。
ただし、一つ目の返信にあるように ” 出会いを約束してハッピーに対応することができれば”
が条件です。若いうちからお金系を使う素人の多くは” 兵庫県 セフレ アプリ兵庫県 セフレ アプリ ” であることから 、ＰＣＭＡＸ は遊びおっさん・セフレを探すには兵庫県 セフレ アプリのアプリです 。
サイト・アプリ内でセフレにできそうなアプローチすべき女性の特徴
セフレを作るためには、サイト・アプリを使って探すことが近道でしょう。
セフレを求めている女性が集まる場所だからこそ人目を気にせず探すことができ、スマホで簡単に始められるおかげでどんどん女性の数が増え続けています。
セフレ目的で出会いを求めている女性がいるサイト・アプリでは、きっと貴方に合う女性が見つけられるはずです。
しかし、大勢いる女性の中から「セフレになりやすい女性」を探し出そうとすると難しいでしょう
。これには経験がどうしても必要で、成功している男性は「セフレになりやすい女性を狙っている」おかげなのです。
それさえ知っていれば初心者でもセフレを作ることは難しいことではありませんので、是非実践してみてください。
頻繁に活動している女性は狙い目
平日昼間などに暇な時間が多い「セフレ探しを活発に行なっている女性」が出会いやすいというのは、想像しやすいでしょう。
暇な時間と性欲を持て余している女性は意外と多く、そういった人妻や女子大生は「コミニケーションに飢えている」ためじっくりと丁寧に関係性を進められればセフレになることができるでしょう。
その判断基準として、 「プロフィールや日記に注目する」ことが重要です。
プロフィールの充実具合や日記の更新頻度、これは「セフレを求める本気度」といっても過言ではありません。
掲示板やメッセージでの返信頻度が高い女性も、コミニケーションに飢えている狙い目女性と言えるかもしれませんね。
承認欲求を満たすため、特殊な性癖を発散させたい、そういった思いを抱える女性が「セフレ探しをアプリでしている」ことも多く、そういった女性ほど「情報量が多く活発に活動している」のです。彼女たちの情報をしっかりと把握し、コミニケーションに繋げることが出会うためには重要ですよ。
出会いを目的としていない女性はセフレになりやすい女性
プロフィールや日記に注目すると、「出会いを求めていない」という女性がいることに気がつくでしょう。
メッセージでのやり取りで最初に言われることも多く、セフレを探している男性のほとんどはそこで諦めてしまうはずです。
ですが、そういった女性は多くの男性がアプローチを止めるからこそ狙い目だと言えます。
「 競争率」が非常に低く、そういった女性とのやり取りを続ければ「特別な男性」と信頼してもらうことも簡単なのです。
つまり、出会いを求めていないという女性は「体目的の男性との出会いを求めていない女性」なのです。
出会いの先にあるセックスのことを考えている「出会い目的ではない女性」ほど、性的な欲求が強い場合も多いです。
彼女たちが求める 「信頼できる特別な男性」になることができれば、他の女性を狙うよりも遥かに簡単に出会うことができるのです。

Get updates impacting your industry from our GigaOm Research Community
For past few days there is a big debate has exploded over on Apple Matters , about Media Center and Front Row .
Thomas Hawk who is an unabashed Windows Media Center Fanboy takes Mac - faithful to task and writes , “ Yes , they created a product for the legions of Apple fanboys to blindly buy , but the smart consumer is better capable of doing a comparison than Jobs might give them credit for . ? ”
Today Charlie Owen , one of the members of Windows XP Media Center development team has joined the debate on his blog , and writes ..
Steve Jobs comparing the Apple remote control with the Media Center remote control was nothing but sheer marketing brilliance .
It ’s totally not about which remote control is better .
Not at all .
By making this comparison , Steve Jobs gave the illusion the two products were on equal footing EXCEPT for the remote .
As the debate continues , I would like to chime in with a few things … .
What Steve Jobs has done , and what Microsoft has not done .
I have a HP Media Center at home , and I have spent countless weekends trying to make the beast work with the Comcast set - top box .
The biggest problem is the smallest feature really – the damn IR Blaster – refuses to play nice .
It fails every single time .
I have done my darnest , but nothing .
That my friends is the critical point – that ease of use is what Microsoft did not think about .
I like the Media Center interface – its pretty much the best UI Microsoft has been able to come - up with despite their blue - and - green restrictions .
( I thought that it would kill TiVo , but boy was I wrong .
TiVo did it themselves ! )
I have left the box in the A/V system , hooked it up to a Olevia 32 inch LCD TV via DVI interface and I use it to check out cool stuff available via the Media Center services .
I am using all its features except the PVR .
There were same IR issues with TiVo as well .
This part of the set - up was painless and a no brainer .
I think this is where Microsoft lost the plot , and did too much with the platform , which was truly made for early - early adopters .
They should have seeded the market with a simpler product .
They could have convinced a lot of people to start using their platform , because it was a virgin market they could have simply owned .
Microsoft in my opinion , overreached .
Apple ’s iPod success shows that its not being the first , or being the one with the greatest number of features that translates into market share .
Instead it is helping millions of consumers ease into the digital lifestyle that is the key .
Front Row is exactly that :
It is simple , and eases you into this whole convergence thing .
I am pretty sure they will add more features in coming months to this software .
It is actually a very clever move on Apple ’s part .
It is clearly a placeholder , and a move that shows , they are throwing their hat in the ring .
They are betting that in next 12 - to - 24 months the downloadable video market is going to gain strength , and they want people to think about the FrontRow as an option as well .
By the time Broadband - over - Video market takes off ( my guess is towards end of 2006 ) , Apple will have a more complete offering .
So what should Microsoft do ?
Two things .
First release a Media Center XP Lite .
Free .
Basically help turn most of the newer PCs into simple devices for aggregating photos , watching DVDs , streaming music and playing back downloadable videos .
They have the PC market share to make this happen .
I think as Video over Broadband ( or TV - over - IP ) takes off , Media Center XP should shine , as it has support of many of the newer services like MTV Overdrive and BrightCove .
Secondly , they should buy Akimbo .
Use Akimbo ’s content relationships and thus enhancing the value of their platform .
If Microsoft sticks to “ less is more ” principle , then they could go toe - to - toe with Apple in this market .
PS : If you have a Media Center related plug - in / service , do let me know .
I would love to review it !
How this works .
1 ) Hit play on the video .
I highly recommend immediately hitting pause .
This will allow the footage to buffer and avoid stutters .
2 ) When you 've got a nice buffer ( dark gray bar under the video ) , hit play on the video .
At the 4 second mark , hit the ' Go ! ' button .
Feel free to zoom in and zoom out or change the map type once it gets going .

" On an August morning in 1978 , French filmmaker Claude Lelouch mounted a gyro- stabilized camera to the bumper of a Ferrari 275 GTB and had a friend , a professional Formula 1 racer , drive at breakneck speed through the heart of Paris .
No streets were closed , for Lelouch was unable to obtain a permit . "
What 's happening in the Middle East , then , is n't just another chapter in the Arab - Israeli conflict .
What 's happening is an Islamist - Israeli war .
You might even say this is part of the Islamist war on the West - - but is India part of the West ?
Better to say that what 's under attack is liberal democratic civilization , whose leading representative right now happens to be the United States .
. . .
The war against radical Islamism is likely to be a long one .
Radical Islamism is n't going away anytime soon .
But it will make a big difference how strong the state sponsors , harborers , and financiers of radical Islamism are .
Thus , our focus should be less on Hamas and Hezbollah , and more on their paymasters and real commanders -- Syria and Iran .
And our focus should be not only on the regional war in the Middle East , but also on the global struggle against radical Islamism .
For while Syria and Iran are enemies of Israel , they are also enemies of the United States .
We have done a poor job of standing up to them and weakening them .
They are now testing us more boldly than one would have thought possible a few years ago .
Weakness is provocative .
We have been too weak , and have allowed ourselves to be perceived as weak .
. . .
The right response is renewed strength -- in supporting the governments of Iraq and Afghanistan , in standing with Israel , and in pursuing regime change in Syria and Iran .
For that matter , we might consider countering this act of Iranian aggression with a military strike against Iranian nuclear facilities .
Why wait ?
But such a military strike would take a while to organize .
In the meantime , perhaps President Bush can fly from the silly G8 summit in St. Petersburg -- a summit that will most likely convey a message of moral confusion and political indecision -- to Jerusalem , the capital of a nation that stands with us , and is willing to fight with us , against our common enemies .
This is our war , too .
But we have not heard anything about " seizing the moment . "
We hear lawyer talk and diplotalk , surrender talk and appeasement talk , and there is no action whatsoever .
Is this not the time to go after the terrorist training camps in Syria and Iran ?
What in the world are we waiting for ?
And finally , if we dither through this one , the next one will be worse .
Maybe much worse .
It 's not going away .
Stability is a mirage .
Chamberlain had a choice between dishonor and war .
He chose war and got dishonor .
You too , Mr. President .
It 's the way it works .
Robert Satloff 's analysis in the new issue of the Weekly Standard anticipates the direct Iranian involvement in the conflict : . . . .
Defeat for Israel - - either on the battlefield or via coerced compromises to achieve flawed cease - fires -- is a defeat for U.S. interests ; it will inspire radicals of every stripe , release Iran and Syria to spread more mayhem inside Iraq , and make more likely our own eventual confrontation with this emboldened alliance of extremists .
UPDATE
UPDATE II
UPDATE III
EAGLEBURGER : Finally , I would say so long as the Iranians can put arms into -- into Hezbollah through Syria , I think we have a continuing problem .
And I , for a long time have felt we had to get much tougher with the Syrians than we are now .
It may be that the Iraq issue has made it more difficult for us to get tough .
But the Syrians ...
BLITZER : What does that mean , Mr. Secretary ...
EAGLEBURGER : Well , what it means to me is that we , for one thing , ought to be putting real pressure on their border with Iraq more than we are , and I think putting economic pressure on them .
And frankly , I do n't care as well , if we go in along with the Israelis and drop a few bombs on them .
A very significant development is occurring in how neoconservatives are discussing America 's responsibilities in the Middle East : they are now expressly advocating , far more openly than ever before , that Israel 's enemies are America 's enemies , and that the war which Israel is now fighting is also America 's war -- one in which America should immediately intervene .
I will write my own reactions to this view later , but for now , I want to simply document the emergence of this argument in very influential circles .
In the past , neoconservatives have danced delicately around the notion that Israel 's conflicts should be viewed by the U.S. as its own conflicts .
But , to his credit , Bill Kristol yesterday came right out and candidly put his views on the table .
In the Weekly Standard , Kristol 's column -- entitled " This is Our War " ( by " Our " he means the U.S. ) -- argues explicitly what many have contended for some time is an unstated belief of neoconservatives : that the U.S. should view the threats to Israel as threats to the U.S. , because the enemy is the same , and should join Israel in the destruction of these enemies .
Kristol actually argues that President Bush should immediately abandon the G - 8 summit in Russia and fly to Jerusalem in order to stand by Israel , in " our " new war , which should be waged against Iran , Syria and Hezbollah , for starters .
This article is very significant and I am quoting from it at length : Bill Kristol is one of the most influential neonconservative pundits in the country , if not the most influential , and the fact that he is openly advocating this world - view means that we will be seeing much more of it from the neoconservative precincts which led us into the invasion of Iraq .
Already , John Podhoretz in National Review is excitedly celebrating Kristol 's argument , and Michael Ledeen is already complaining that the Administration has n't yet thrown the U.S. militarily into this new war , where we have whole new enemies -- Iran and Syria -- waiting to be attacked :
And then , from John Hinderaker at Powerline , where the excitement over this conflict is palpable -- they really think this is , finally , our big chance to expand our war beyond Iraq , where things are going really well , into Syria and Iran -- we find this
It should go without saying that one can believe that Israel is within its rights to defend itself against Hezbollah without also believing that the U.S. should become involved in this extraordinarily flammable conflict .
But these neoconservatives do n't recognize that distinction .
As they are now expressly arguing , Israel 's enemies are America 's enemies , and this war being waged by Israel ought to become America 's war -- and the sooner the better .
I believe it is obvious to most Americans , who have turned completely on the war in Iraq , that it is sheer lunacy to expand that failed war effort to now include American war on even more countries -- including more powerful ones with more powerful allies , such as Iran -- let alone to do so as part of , and in the middle of , an Arab - Israeli war .
But if there is one lesson that we ought to have learned over the past several years , it is that there is no militaristic proposal too crazed or extremist to be undertaken by this administration .
And anyone who thinks that these neoconservatives now lack real influence within the Bush administration is sorely mistaken . :
At Obsidian Wings , Hilzoy has a thoughtful and lengthy analysis of the new war in the Middle East .
Without endorsing all of its particulars , she presents a balanced and rational view of what is motivating each party , something which is quite difficult to do for most people when writing about that region . :
I also read this analysis of the Middle East conflict by Billmon yesterday and meant to link to it , because it is superb ( again , without necessarily agreeing with each of its claims ) , and was just reminded to do so by someone who mentioned it in Comments .
And I equally recommend Billmon 's second post from yesterday on the surprising military adeptness of Hezbollah thus far and what that means for Israel and the region . :
Nobody should take comfort in thinking that a desire for the U.S. to intervene in Israel 's war is confined to extremist neoconservative circles .
Here is Bush 41 Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger -- generally considered a grown - up foreign policy adult -- with Wolf Blitzer yesterday ( h/t Elton Beard via e-mail ) :
The mindless casualness with which such people blithely advocate starting a new war -- like it's no different that deciding what one will eat for dinner tomorrow -- is breathtaking .
There is an influential and determined minority out there craving U.S. intervention in this war .
They are searching for any means to expand the war in Iraq to additional countries , all as part of our Epic War of Civilizations , and given their past success in inducing the U.S. to invade Iraq , I think it 's a mistake to assume that what they are advocating is too extreme and self - evidently disastrous to become a reality .
Newspapers are in trouble .
From New York to Memphis to Los Angeles , they re losing advertisers and readers and cutting their budgets and their staffs .
The problem , we have decided , is the Internet .
Young people spend way more time on computers than they do holding newspapers .
So newspapers are putting their content on line and trying to figure out how to get advertisers and even readers to pay for it .
The funny thing is , if the printed newspaper had been invented as an improvement to the online newspaper , people would recognize its advantages .
Such as :
Newspapers respect your privacy .
When you read a newspaper online you get pop-up ads and cookies that tell strangers where you go and what your interests are .
What you read in the paper is your own damn business .
The printed newspaper is a perfect information delivery system .
It is ideally suited to taking to bed , the kitchen , the coffee shop , or the bathroom .
You can pick and choose what to read and when to read it .
You can tear out articles and ads you want to save or give to someone or leave on your dresser or in your pants pocket .
Anyone who tells you they re reading a newspaper on a cell phone is lying .
At most , they re glancing at headlines .
It s hard enough to read a newspaper on a laptop computer screen  much less a desktop .
You can take a laptop to the bathroom , but that s uncouth .
Bathrooms and newspapers , on the other hand , were made for each other .
If you dont have broadband , it takes a long time to load stories , and there is always the possibility that your computer will crash or lock up , especially if the story has a lot of pictures .
Newspapers get wet but they dont crash .
I can only remember two times in the last 24 years when my daily newspaper was not delivered to my driveway or front door .
The newspapers you carry around or leave on your coffee table or desk make a statement about the kind of person you are .
A computer or BlackBerry makes a statement about what you can buy .
You can read a newspaper and talk about it with the people you live with as a morning ritual .
It s a communal experience .
Gazing at a computer is a personal experience .
The printed newspaper is morally superior to the computer .
General circulation newspapers dont have porno in them .
You have a better chance of influencing your children to read , stay informed , and think about current events with a newspaper than a computer .
The fact that the news is not about them is exactly the point  theres a big world out there , kid , and it aint all about you and your friends .
Newspapers have good manners .
If you want to pester the crap out of your friends by telling them what you re reading or what some pretentious columnist is thinking even though they dont care , you have to buy several copies or print them on a copier and hand them out .
By the time you do that you re out a few bucks and several minutes and your friends are probably off the hook .
With a computer and e-mail , they dont have a chance .
Newspapers are a bargain .
That s especially true of this one , which is free , but its also true of The Commercial Appeal , which is getting better , and The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal , which have more information in them each day than most books .
Those two newspapers charge for online content , as well they should .
Value for value .
Full access to The New York Times costs about $ 50 a year .
A year of AOL and its idiotic promotions and features costs about $ 300 .
Finally , printed newspapers support working journalists .
So what ? , you say .
Well , somebody has to gather information by going to meetings and interesting places and events and talking to people with different points of view .
Somebody has to pay for that , and so far online advertising doesnt come close .
Opinions and blogs and summaries of other peoples work may be interesting , but they re not news .
So go buy a paper .

Google Project Hosting Features :
The interface is clean , compact and concise .
It is missing the abundant clutter that permeates Sourceforge and most programming tools .
Avoiding “ too many options ” is something Google understands well .
After the break , all the features of Google Code Project Hosting as of launch 2006 / 07/28 .
Storage and Version Control
Google is offering 100 mb storage , and uses Subversion ( currently kicking CVS ’ butt ) for version control .
Subversion access control is tied to your Google Account ( using a password that is generated by Google ) .
Guide on using it here .
Update on 100 Mb : The comments section has a response from Ben Collins - Sussman from Google .
We had to set a quota somewhere , to prevent spam / abuse ( people using subversion to host photos , music , porn , etc. ) .
If a project legitimately needs more than 100MB for source code , we can easily increase that quota per-project .
See code.google.com/hosting/faq.html for more .
Defect Tracking
It also includes a custom defect tracking system with fields for : Type , Status , Priority , Milestone , Owner , Summary + Labels .
The defect tracker also lets you Star bugs to be notified of issue changes .
I assume that it will be an email update , but upon testing with two Google Accounts I was n’t able to get bug notifications for either of them .
Status Values and Issue Labels for defects can be configured by the project administrator .
New =
Issue has not had initial review yet
Accepted = Problem reproduced / Need acknowledged
Started =
Work on this issue has begun
Tagging Support ( called Labels )
Each project can be tagged with various categories by the project adminstrator .
Note that tagging will end up being pretty arbitrary unless there are some kind of moderators going around and cleaning it up to achieve a common folksonomy .
Users can enter any labels they choose , although some are banned ( like “ google “ ) .
Creating Projects
Creating projects is simple and anyone with a Google Account can do it .
All you need to do is enter a project name , summary , description and as many labels as your heart desires .
Project Administration
Once a project is created , the administrator can change the initial settings , add urls for links , discussion groups , and blogs as well as setting up an email notification for Subversion activity .
The discussion group has to be a Google Groups .
The project admin can change settings for the defect system ( mentioned above ) .
S/he can also add / remove members or administrators .
There is an advanced option for deleting the project .
It is unknown if the project name immediately becomes available again or if it is locked from re-use .
Non-administrators can’t add / remove themselves from projects .
All project membership changes have to be done by a project administrator .
A hassle , but ultimately less prone to abuse since you ’ll have to contact an administrator to manually ask them to allow you to join the project .
I was able to switch project ownership between accounts .
One thing I noticed is that when someone is added to a project , they do n’t receive a notice .
They also do n’t receive notices when adding bugs to their name .
Supported Licenses
Code licenses supported are : Apache License 2.0 , Artistic License / GPLv2 , GNU General Public License 2.0 , GNU Lesser Public License , MIT License , Mozilla Public License 1.1 , New BSD License .
Clicking on the license associated with a project brings up the full description .
User Profiles
Clicking on a user profile displays owned projects and projects they are a member of .
There is no link to an email address , profile description , website or a list of message topics .
That should all be feasible since they are all tied to the Google Account .
You can access the user profile of any Google Account even if they have yet to join a project .
i.e. : http://code.google.com/u/engtechnology/
RSS Support
They have RSS feeds for updated projects and featured projects .
Infancy
The associate discussion group is currently being flooded with suggestions and bug reports : http://groups.google.com/group/codesite-discuss
Note that the Google Code FAQ has n’t been completely update yet :
Why are you releasing code through Sourceforge ?
Well , because they were nice enough to oblige , and because developers here like Sourceforge .
Future homes for new projects might include Tigris.org or language specific sites like the Vaults of Parnassus and CPAN .
Overall
This looks like a very good first stab at a FOSS project repository .
Ultimately , I think the labelling will need some kind of moderation to try and achieve a common folksonomy / semantic markup so that common tags are used and similiar projects have similiar tags .
Updated :
Only the projects administrators can change the labels on a project .
So the “ wisdom of the crowds ” effect where the best tags rise to the top ( like with del.icio.us , technorati , flickr , etc ) will not apply .
Something will be needed to find a common semantic mark up .
It will not be found by individual administrators self - tagging .
I would really enjoy it if they could use their algorithms to suggest alternatives when investigating a particular project .
It is very user friendly and the only necessary feature I think it missing ( other than the obvious option of downloading precompiled binaries ) is some metrics on code development and stability , as well as a mechanism for differentiating the great FOSS projects from the merely good .
It does n’t have as many “ developers , developers , developers ” features as SourceForge ( and probably never will with Google approach to clean and simple layout ) , but that is n’t a bad thing .
At the very least it lowers the barriers for project management .
That might means more FOSS projects , but also a lot more crap to sift through .

The dimensions of the hydraulic limb reflected what is known from the fossil record
More details
Like other dinos in its family , it had a distinctive sickle - shaped claw on the second toe which many have assumed was employed to disembowel victims .
But tests on a mechanical arm suggest this fearsome - looking appendage was probably used just to hang on to prey .
UK scientists report their experiments in the journal Biology Letters .
" This dispels the myth in place for some 40 years that this was a disembowelling claw - this is not the case , " says Dr Phil Manning , from the Manchester Museum , University of Manchester .
" I 'm saying that the primary function of this claw was to hold on to the prey , effectively like a climber 's crampon , " the curator of palaeontology told the BBC News website .
Dino kick
The Steven Spielberg movie took some liberties with its portrayal of Velociraptor .
The real creature belonged to the Dromaeosauridae , a family of small to medium - sized , lightly built and fast - running dinosaurs from the Cretaceous Period ( 146 million to 65 million years ago ) who appear from the fossil record to have been very effective predators .
There is even evidence some , such as Deinonychus , hunted in packs .
It 's effectively like a fatal embrace
Dr Phil Manning
By kicking and slashing , it has been widely thought these creatures could quickly open up their unfortunate victims , either killing them outright or making them bleed so profusely death followed very quickly .
Dr Manning and his team tested the reputation on a robotic arm fitted with a life - like dromaeosaur claw .
The set - up was based on detailed fossil measurements .
The mechanical limb mimicked the sort of kick that might have come from a 2 m - long , 40kg Velociraptor .
The Kevlar and carbon - fibre - coated aluminium claw was thrust into the flesh from pig and crocodile carcasses .
Skin impact
Instead of producing the expected slashing wounds , the robotic impacts created only small , rounded punctures .
Dromaeosaurs were fast and agile carnivores
Enlarge Image
The punctures had a depth of about 30 - 40 mm .
" It seems highly unlikely that wounds of this depth would have posed a danger to the vital organs of a large herbivorous dinosaur , though they would obviously be fatal to small prey , " the team writes in Biology Letters .
Dr Manning does not want people to think less of Velociraptor or Deinonychus because of the research .
Its killing efficiency may not have matched their Hollywood image but the creatures would still have presented a terrifying prospect .
Deadly pack
" It 's effectively like a fatal embrace , " he told the BBC News website .
" These claws were used to hook into the flanks of prey larger than them so the jaws could do the despatching .
A Kevlar and carbon - fibre coating gave the claw realistic properties
" Unbeknown to them , you 've got a pack of predators stalking them .
" First , [ the dromaeosaurs ] try to separate the animal they wish to kill by running into the pack .
" The lead attacker then jumps on to the flanks of the animal , followed by maybe two or three others , hooking the huge claws in their feet into the animal and holding on with the re-curved claws on their hands .
" And once they 're hooked into their prey , the razor sharp teeth of their jaws go to work causing as much blood loss as possible to weaken the animal .
" Eventually , the other animals come over for the kill , probably ripping open the throat and stomach with their teeth - not their claws . "
The results of research were first shown on The Truth about Killer Dinosaurs , a BBC television production .

Paul Graham is Wrong
I really enjoyed that essay by Paul Graham .
Paul Graham is an excellent writer and a very nice fellow .
But when he said that thing that made me look bad , I just had to draw the line .
For years , I ’ve been doing something and telling people I ’m doing it and then all of a sudden Paul Graham comes along and tells me it ’s a bad idea .
I think it ’s time to question his assumptions .
In his essay , Graham writes :
Most people in this situation typically do this thing .
But what if they did this other thing instead ?
This idea typically does n’t occur to them for that reason .
But if they did what I suggest , they ’d be like a metaphor instead of a simile .
Here ’s where Graham really goes off the rails .
What if we do n’t want to do what he suggests ?
Graham never considers that possibility .
He just assumes that he ’s right .
Once , in an interview , Graham was asked what he thought about this subject :
Q : What do you think of people doing that thing ?
Well , you know , historically people really have n’t done a lot of this thing and going forwards I see a lot more of this thing happening because the things that have stopped people from doing those things no longer exist .
This could really change things .
But this is absurd !
Just because people can do that thing now does n’t mean they ’re going to .
For too long , Paul Graham has gotten a free ride by saying things that disagree with people ’s prejudices in an informative and entertaining manner .
That was fine when all we had to do was link to his article and read it .
But this time he ’s gone too far : he ’s said something that might actually make me change how I behave .
And that ’s unacceptable .
gernika writes :
A satire worthy of Swift :)
Sencer explains :
Paul Graham has always written the way he has written .
That ( among real reasoning ) includes making assertions and peddling his own views as a kind of fact .
The same people that are applauding Graham for “ brilliant reasoning ” when he makes assertions that fit their world - view , criticize him for the absurdity of even making assertions , when they do n’t fit their world - view .
Not that they should n’t , but the inconsistency is just funny in an ironic kind of way . :)
In support :
I ’m so glad that someone stood up to him finally .
Some of what he says at such as about Amateurs is a bunch of bull crap . [ … ]
Paul Graham is not “ god ” and some of what he says really ought to not be left unchecked and thank you Aaron for having the guts to stand up to him .
In opposition :
err what is the point of this ?
You establishing a reputation and personality off the back of Paul Graham ?
Man , you ’re pretty shameless and petty .
You think you ’ve stumbled onto a gold landfill by realizing you do n’t agree with Graham ?
How many millions of people have read a paul graham essay ? [… ]
Graham backs up his word with some good thought and informed opinions .
YOU ??? what do you base it on ?
the need to get noticed ?
You should follow me on twitter here .

Richard Stallman 、P2Pを語る 著者： DaBlade 日本語訳： yomoyomo
以下の文章は 、DaBlade による Richard Stallman on P2P の日本語訳である 。
本翻訳文書については 、Toshiro Yagi さんから訳の改善を頂きました。ありがとうございました。
Richard Matthew Stallman（下の写真）はフリーソフトウェア運動の創始者であり、GNU
プロジェクトやフリーソフトウェア財団の創始者である。彼は例えば
GNU C コンパイラ、GNU
Emacs エディタ、そして GNU デバッガといったほぼすべての GNU / Linux ディストリビューションに採用されているプログラムをいくつも書いている。彼は
GNU GPL を執筆し、現在も GPL のバージ ョ
ン3を共同執筆している。彼は、今日たいていの
UNIX ライクなオペレーティングシステムを指すのに使われる用語である
POSIX の命名も行った。我々は彼にファイル共有
、DRM、そしてその他の話題について意見を伺った。
LinuxP2P : ピアツーピアのファイル共有について大枠どのような意見をお持ちでしょうか。それは肯定的なものでしょうか、否定的なものでしょうか。またその理由は。
RMS : 人々には公開された作品の複製を共有する権利がある。P2P のプログラムはそれをより便利に行うまさに一つの手段なわけだから、それは良いものだ。
LinuxP2P : レコード産業や映画産業は、P2P ユーザは彼らの知的所有権を侵害していると主張しています。あなたの考えに照らして、この主張は正しいでしょうか。それともユーザはフェアユースを行使しているのでしょうか？
RMS : 彼らが 「知的所有権」という言葉を使うのは、ミスリードと聞き手を混乱させるためだ。「著作権の侵害」と言えば、彼らの主張は明確で意味のあるものになるのに。しかし、彼らが「著作権」でなしに「知的所有権」と言う場合、著作権法と多くの他の法律を一緒くたにしている。そうした混乱した話題について何かはっきりしたことを言うのは不可能だ。
「知的所有権」という言葉を使う人は、大衆を混乱させようとしているか、あるいは自分自身が混乱してしまっているかのどちらかなんだ。明快な思考を努めようとするなら、それを避けるのが賢明だろう（より詳しい解説は、http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.xhtml 参照）。
だから、彼らが努めてはっきりと、こうした人たちは著作権を侵害していると言ったとしよう。それが正しいなら、私に尋ねるのが間違っている――私は弁護士ではないのだから。私に言えるのは、論点はその問題の倫理と無関係であると私が考えていることだ。著作権法が人々が共有を行うのを禁じるのなら、著作権法が間違っている。
LinuxP2P : DRM に関してはいかがでしょう？ その善悪とその理由をお聞かせください。
RMS : デジタル制限管理（訳注：DRM
は通常 Digital Rights Management（デジタル権利管理）の略とされるが、FSF
は Digital Restrictions Management の略と主張している）は、大衆が公開された作品を利用するのを技術的に制限するものである。それは根本的に不当だ。
私はあらゆる DRM を拒否している。私は DRM を含むニセ CD を購入しないという誓約に署名している―
―http://www.pledgebank.com/boycottdrm
だ。以前講演の主催者が私にニセ CD をくれたので、私は 「 こんなところに敵がいたとはな――これを店に返していただきたい」と言ったよ。
同様に私は暗号化された DVD を買ったこともないし、いつか DeCSS（訳注：DVD のヨン様ことノルウェー人プログラマ Jon Lech Johansen が開発した DVD の複製防止暗号を解読するプログラム）が合法である国に住むでもしなければ、これから買うことも決してない。
LinuxP2P : 今ではデジタル音楽の販路を提供する iTunes 、Rhapsody、そして
Napster などがあるわけですが 、P2P ファイル共有を続ける必要は本当にあるのでしょうか？
RMS : その質問は馬鹿げている――「 Fox News があるのにブログを書く必要が本当にあるのでしょうか？」と言うようなものだ。
間違っていたら訂正してほしいのだが 、Rhapsody や Napster は DRM に縛られていると私は理解している。彼らと取り引きをすべきではない。
i Tunes は特殊な例だ。そこで買った音楽を本物のオーディオ
CD に焼くことができる。従って、iTunes は DRM というより DIM （Digital Inconvenience Management：デジタル不自由管理）で、iTunes は倫理的な意味で受け入れられるものになっていると思う――少なくとも、この点に関して言えば。
しかし、アップルはいつでもそのルールを変える権利を留保していると主張している。だから、iTunes
で手に入れた音楽を必ず、バックアップとして本物のオーディオ
CD に焼くべきで、音楽をバックアップするまであまり時間を置いてはいけない！
もし実際に CD で特定の楽曲をほしくなるまで待っていると、そのときにはもう
CD に焼けなくなっているかもしれないから 。
いずれにしても、iTunes が配信しているのは音楽だけだ。私が知る限り、デジタルで制限されていない映画を手に入れられるのは
P2P ネットワークだけである 。
それ以上に iTunes で問題なのは 、MP3 形式で配信を行っていることだ。我々は MP3 形式から移行する必要がある。なぜなら MP3 形式は特許が取られているからだ。かつて MP3 エンコーディングを行うフリーソフトウェアは、訴訟を恐れてアングラ化してしまっている。
フリーソフトウェアコミュニティは、サウンド品質が優れていて特許も取得されていない
Ogg Vorbis という新しいオーディオ形式を開発している。あなた方はオーディオファイルを作成する際に
Ogg Vorbis 形式を採用し、その形式で音楽を聴くようにすれば、MP3 の特許保持者の力を殺ぐ助けになれるわけだ。
LinuxP2P : P2P がコンテンツ製作者（producers）に受け入れられるためには、P2P はどのような方向に発展しなければならないとお考えでしょうか。
RMS : 製作者が、自分たちが作品を「コンテンツ」として公開していると表現する、要するにそうした作品を単なる埋め草と呼ぶ場合、皮肉にも彼らがいかに作品を知性の成果として評価、理解していないかを明らかにしてしまっている。
私は原作者の価値を貶めたくはないので、作品を「コンテンツ」と呼ぶことはしない。また作家や音楽家を「製作者」と呼ぶこともしない。というのも、私は音楽や著作を（経済的観点から狭くとらえるニュアンスの）「製品（products）」として扱いたくないからだ。
大勢の作家や音楽家が P2P 共有に満足している。商業出版を通じて金持ちになるという見込みのない夢に執着しているそれ以外の大勢の人たちは
P2P 共有を好きでない。P2P ソフトウェアがこれ以上発展したところで、金持ちになりたいという夢を正すことは期待できないと思うし、どちらかといえばそういうものは文化的な変化によって起こるべきではないかと考えている。
音楽工場――またの名をメジャーなレコード会社――に関して言えば、彼らがほしいのは権力だ。彼らの権力を逃れる手段である限り、彼らは
P2P 共有を受け入れることはないだろう。大衆に対する権力を濫用した咎で、彼らは破壊されるに値するし、それを皆が目指すべきなんだ。
LinuxP2P : フリーソフトウェア財団は現在 GPL バージョン3を策定していますが、それはあらゆる形態の
DRM を締め出すものと理解しています。DRM
付きのファイルをダウンロードする P2P ソフトウェアを利用できることに関して言えば、GPLv3 はそうしたプロジェクトに何か影響を及ぼすでしょうか？
RMS : それは幾分誤解している――我々は「DRM を締め出す」ことはできない。我々にできるのは、GPL を適用するソフトウェアが DRM を実装する道具に堕落するのを防ぐことだ。
このやり方は、プログラムが可能なテクニカルジョブを制限するものではない（その種の制限はプログラムを自由でなくしてしまう）。そうでなく、我々はユーザがソフトウェアを変更し、変更されたバージョンを実行する実効的な自由を確保するようにしている。
DRM はユーザを規制することでなりたっているので、ユーザの自由を効果的に維持することが
DRM を阻むことになる。さらに正確に言うなら、特定のプログラムを変更するユーザの自由を効果的に維持することが、DRM
を実装するプログラムの利用を阻むということだ。それ以外のやり方では、我々は
DRM を実装するのを止められない。
GPL v3 のこの部分はそうしたプログラムにはまったく影響はなくて、というのもそうしたプログラムはデジタル制限を課すために利用されることはないし、開発者はユーザが修正バージョンを実行するのを止めるつもりなどないからだ。
LinuxP2P : ここ数年でインディペンデントなメディアやエンターテイメントが非常に増加しました。ちょうど先週、CreativeCommons.org が 20万も の MP3 ファイルのインデックスを達成しました。大部分のインディペンデントな音楽、映像などはクリエイティブ・コモンズのライセンスを採用しています。（アーティスト自身の手によるだけでなく、Jamendo.com や ccMixter.org といったインディペンデントなアートを集めた合法的なサイトを利用して）たくさんのインディペンデントな芸術作品が
P2P を通じて広がっています。GPL
はソフトウェアに適用するために書かれているという自明な点を別として、CC
ライセンス全般と GPL にどんな違いがあるのでしょうか？
RMS : MP3 形式の特許問題については既に解説した通りだ。
君の質問が示すように、人々は多様なクリエイティブ・コモンズを単一のものとして一緒くたにし、ライセンス間にある相違点を無視する傾向がある。それは、ともにカリフォルニアにあるからといってサンフランシスコとデスヴァレーの天候が似ていると思うような混乱だ。
一部のクリエイティブ・コモンズ・ライセンスは自由なライセンスだ。そのほとんどは、少なくとも非商用でのそのままの形での複製を許可しているし。しかし、サンプリング・ライセンスや

So , it 's the year 2000 , at the height of the dot com boom .
You 've just been hired as Head of Online Games for a company with a paper value of over a billion dollars .
You 're promised a team of 30 people and as much time as you want to create the world 's best massively multiplayer game world .
What do you do ?
What you should do is hire the first 30 people you see on the street , irrespective of their skills , abilities or state of sobriety .
What you should n't do is advertise , interview applicants , assess what they can bring to the project , and make appointments only after careful consideration .
The reason you should do the former is because that 's what everyone else will do .
Thus , when the company 's directors realize that expansion is happening too quickly and they impose a recruitment freeze , you have all the job slots in place , if not any people who can actually do those jobs .
You wo n't be calling a producer and telling him he should take his house off the market because we can't hire him after all , you 'll just be replacing the Australian gap - year student you met playing snooker in a pub .
This explains how I was left to develop a virtual world with a team consisting of three programmers , a level designer and me , when there were six people officially working on the company 's single - page WAP site .
Oh , we were given a more concrete deadline , too : one year .
We were also given a budget : nothing .
What kind of massively multiplayer game could we write in 12 months from a standing start , with only three programmers , a level designer and me ?
No producer , no artists , no QA ; no design document , no tools , no middleware ; no hardware , except our 700MHz PCs and a 250MHz server .
Hey , I know this one - we write a text game !
This did make horrible sense .
I already had all that was needed to build and operate a textual world , because I 'd spent 20 years building and operating them .
It would be a push , but we could do this .
All we required was some fiendish mind - control system to persuade people to play a text game when they really wanted to play EverQuest .
So , that would be sex , then .
I 'd written a pitch for a sex MUD about five years earlier , but the funding fell through .
Now was the time to dust it off !
The thing is , sex in a text world has three things going for it that sex in a graphics world does n't :
It 's freeform .
You do n't have to motion - capture every position in the Kama Sutra and beyond , because people can animate it themselves using words .
It 's legal .
You can write about antics that you would be jailed for depicting visually .
The word is pornography , not pornotexty .
For a basic sex game to work , you need comparable numbers of both men and women .
A female - friendly game , by virtue of its having women in it , is male - friendly ; therefore , you need to attract women .
And hey , guess what ?
Study after study has shown that , in general , women prefer words to pictures - especially when it comes to sexual fantasizing .
We toyed with the idea of creating a game for the gay market , on the grounds that there might be more homosexual male gamers than female gamers of any flavor , but unfortunately we were all straight so we were n't sufficiently engaged with the culture to know if this was indeed the case .
When I approached the one gay guy in the office to ask him what he thought , he indignantly told me that he was n't gay , and if I spoke another word on the subject he'd have me for harassment .
Essay
It was in Burma , a sodden morning of the rains .
A sickly light , like
yellow tinfoil , was slanting over the high walls into the jail yard .
We
were waiting outside the condemned cells , a row of sheds fronted with
double bars , like small animal cages .
Each cell measured about ten feet
by ten and was quite bare within except for a plank bed and a pot of
drinking water .
In some of them brown silent men were squatting at the
inner bars , with their blankets draped round them .
These were the
condemned men , due to be hanged within the next week or two .
One prisoner had been brought out of his cell .
He was a Hindu , a puny
wisp of a man , with a shaven head and vague liquid eyes .
He had a thick ,
sprouting moustache , absurdly too big for his body , rather like the
moustache of a comic man on the films .
Six tall Indian warders were
guarding him and getting him ready for the gallows .
Two of them stood by
with rifles and fixed bayonets , while the others handcuffed him , passed a
chain through his handcuffs and fixed it to their belts , and lashed his
arms tight to his sides .
They crowded very close about him , with their
hands always on him in a careful , caressing grip , as though all the while
feeling him to make sure he was there .
It was like men handling a fish
which is still alive and may jump back into the water .
But he stood quite
unresisting , yielding his arms limply to the ropes , as though he hardly
noticed what was happening .
Eight o'clock struck and a bugle call , desolately thin in the wet air ,
floated from the distant barracks .
The superintendent of the jail , who
was standing apart from the rest of us , moodily prodding the gravel with
his stick , raised his head at the sound .
He was an army doctor , with a
grey toothbrush moustache and a gruff voice .
" For God 's sake hurry up ,
Francis , " he said irritably .
" The man ought to have been dead by this
time .
Are n't you ready yet ? "
Francis , the head jailer , a fat Dravidian in a white drill suit and gold
spectacles , waved his black hand .
" Yes sir , yes sir , " he bubbled .
" All
iss satisfactorily prepared .
The hangman iss waiting .
We shall proceed . "
" Well , quick march , then .
The prisoners can't get their breakfast till
this job 's over . "
We set out for the gallows .
Two warders marched on either side of the
prisoner , with their rifles at the slope ; two others marched close
against him , gripping him by arm and shoulder , as though at once pushing
and supporting him .
The rest of us , magistrates and the like , followed
behind .
Suddenly , when we had gone ten yards , the procession stopped
short without any order or warning .
A dreadful thing had happened -- a
dog , come goodness knows whence , had appeared in the yard .
It came
bounding among us with a loud volley of barks , and leapt round us wagging
its whole body , wild with glee at finding so many human beings together .
It was a large woolly dog , half Airedale , half pariah .
For a moment it
pranced round us , and then , before anyone could stop it , it had made a
dash for the prisoner , and jumping up tried to lick his face .
Everyone
stood aghast , too taken aback even to grab at the dog .
" Who let that bloody brute in here ? " said the superintendent angrily .
" Catch it , someone ! "
A warder , detached from the escort , charged clumsily after the dog , but
it danced and gambolled just out of his reach , taking everything as part
of the game .
A young Eurasian jailer picked up a handful of gravel and
tried to stone the dog away , but it dodged the stones and came after us
again .
Its yaps echoed from the jail wails .
The prisoner , in the grasp of
the two warders , looked on incuriously , as though this was another
formality of the hanging .
It was several minutes before someone managed
to catch the dog .
Then we put my handkerchief through its collar and
moved off once more , with the dog still straining and whimpering .
It was about forty yards to the gallows .
I watched the bare brown back of
the prisoner marching in front of me .
He walked clumsily with his bound
arms , but quite steadily , with that bobbing gait of the Indian who never
straightens his knees .
At each step his muscles slid neatly into place ,
the lock of hair on his scalp danced up and down , his feet printed
themselves on the wet gravel .
And once , in spite of the men who gripped
him by each shoulder , he stepped slightly aside to avoid a puddle on the
path .
It is curious , but till that moment I had never realized what it means to
destroy a healthy , conscious man .
When I saw the prisoner step aside to
avoid the puddle , I saw the mystery , the unspeakable wrongness , of
cutting a life short when it is in full tide .
This man was not dying , he
was alive just as we were alive .
All the organs of his body were working
-- bowels digesting food , skin renewing itself , nails growing , tissues
forming -- all toiling away in solemn foolery .
His nails would still be
growing when he stood on the drop , when he was falling through the air
with a tenth of a second to live .
His eyes saw the yellow gravel and the
grey walls , and his brain still remembered , foresaw , reasoned -- reasoned
even about puddles .
He and we were a party of men walking together ,
seeing , hearing , feeling , understanding the same world ; and in two
minutes , with a sudden snap , one of us would be gone -- one mind less , one
world less .
The gallows stood in a small yard , separate from the main grounds of the
prison , and overgrown with tall prickly weeds .
It was a brick erection
like three sides of a shed , with planking on top , and above that two
beams and a crossbar with the rope dangling .
The hangman , a grey - haired
convict in the white uniform of the prison , was waiting beside his
machine .
He greeted us with a servile crouch as we entered .
At a word
from Francis the two warders , gripping the prisoner more closely than
ever , half led , half pushed him to the gallows and helped him clumsily up
the ladder .
Then the hangman climbed up and fixed the rope round the
prisoner 's neck .
We stood waiting , five yards away .
The warders had formed in a rough
circle round the gallows .
And then , when the noose was fixed , the
prisoner began crying out on his god .
It was a high , reiterated cry of
" Ram ! Ram ! Ram ! Ram ! " , not urgent and fearful like a prayer or a cry for
help , but steady , rhythmical , almost like the tolling of a bell .
The dog
answered the sound with a whine .
The hangman , still standing on the
gallows , produced a small cotton bag like a flour bag and drew it down
over the prisoner 's face .
But the sound , muffled by the cloth , still
persisted , over and over again : " Ram ! Ram ! Ram ! Ram ! Ram ! "
The hangman climbed down and stood ready , holding the lever .
Minutes
seemed to pass .
The steady , muffled crying from the prisoner went on and
on , " Ram ! Ram ! Ram ! " never faltering for an instant .
The superintendent ,
his head on his chest , was slowly poking the ground with his stick ;
perhaps he was counting the cries , allowing the prisoner a fixed number --
fifty , perhaps , or a hundred .
Everyone had changed colour .
The Indians
had gone grey like bad coffee , and one or two of the bayonets were
wavering .
We looked at the lashed , hooded man on the drop , and listened
to his cries - - each cry another second of life ; the same thought was in
all our minds : oh , kill him quickly , get it over , stop that abominable
noise !
Suddenly the superintendent made up his mind .
Throwing up his head he
made a swift motion with his stick .
" Chalo ! " he shouted almost fiercely .
There was a clanking noise , and then dead silence .
The prisoner had
vanished , and the rope was twisting on itself .
I let go of the dog , and
it galloped immediately to the back of the gallows ; but when it got there
it stopped short , barked , and then retreated into a corner of the yard ,
where it stood among the weeds , looking timorously out at us .
We went
round the gallows to inspect the prisoner 's body .
He was dangling with
his toes pointed straight downwards , very slowly revolving , as dead as a
stone .
The superintendent reached out with his stick and poked the bare body ; it
oscillated , slightly .
" HE'S all right , " said the superintendent .
He
backed out from under the gallows , and blew out a deep breath .
The moody
look had gone out of his face quite suddenly .
He glanced at his
wrist - watch .
" Eight minutes past eight .
Well , that 's all for this
morning , thank God . "
The warders unfixed bayonets and marched away .
The dog , sobered and
conscious of having misbehaved itself , slipped after them .
We walked out
of the gallows yard , past the condemned cells with their waiting
prisoners , into the big central yard of the prison .
The convicts , under
the command of warders armed with lathis , were already receiving their
breakfast .
They squatted in long rows , each man holding a tin pannikin ,
while two warders with buckets marched round ladling out rice ; it seemed
quite a homely , jolly scene , after the hanging .
An enormous relief had
come upon us now that the job was done .
One felt an impulse to sing , to
break into a run , to snigger .
All at once everyone began chattering
gaily .
The Eurasian boy walking beside me nodded towards the way we had come ,
with a knowing smile : " Do you know , sir , our friend ( he meant the dead
man ) , when he heard his appeal had been dismissed , he pissed on the floor
of his cell .
From fright .-- Kindly take one of my cigarettes , sir .
Do you
not admire my new silver case , sir ?
From the boxwallah , two rupees eight
annas .
Classy European style . "
Several people laughed -- at what , nobody seemed certain .
Francis was walking by the superintendent , talking garrulously .
" Well ,
sir , all hass passed off with the utmost satisfactoriness .
It wass all
finished -- flick ! like that .
It iss not always so -- oah , no !
I have known
cases where the doctor wass obliged to go beneath the gallows and pull
the prisoner 's legs to ensure decease .
Most disagreeable ! "
" Wriggling about , eh ?
That 's bad , " said the superintendent .
" Ach , sir , it iss worse when they become refractory !
One man , I recall ,
clung to the bars of hiss cage when we went to take him out .
You will
scarcely credit , sir , that it took six warders to dislodge him , three
pulling at each leg .
We reasoned with him .
" My dear fellow , " we said ,
" think of all the pain and trouble you are causing to us ! "
But no , he
would not listen !
Ach , he wass very troublesome ! "
I found that I was laughing quite loudly .
Everyone was laughing .
Even the
superintendent grinned in a tolerant way .
" You 'd better all come out and
have a drink , " he said quite genially .
" I 've got a bottle of whisky in
the car .
We could do with it . "
We went through the big double gates of the prison , into the road .
" Pulling at his legs ! " exclaimed a Burmese magistrate suddenly , and burst
into a loud chuckling .
We all began laughing again .
At that moment
Francis 's anecdote seemed extraordinarily funny .
We all had a drink
together , native and European alike , quite amicably .
The dead man was a
hundred yards away .
Scientists can now predict memory of an event before it even happens .
A team at UCL ( University College London ) can now tell how well memory will serve us before we have seen what we will remember .
Scans of brain activity , published online in the journal Nature Neuroscience , indicate that the brain can actually get into the ' right frame of mind ' to store new information and that we perform at our best if the brain is active not only at the moment we get new information but also in the seconds before .
Dr Leun Otten from UCL Psychology and the UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience , who led the research project , said : " It sounds a bit like clairvoyance in the sense that we 're able to predict whether someone will remember a word before they even see it .
That 's really new - scientists knew that brain activity changes as you store things into memory but now we have found brain activity that tells how well your memory will work in advance . "
Two experiments were conducted to tap into long - term memory and arrive at the results .
In the first , a symbol was presented on screen a few seconds before each word , telling the subjects what kind of decision to make about the following word .
Participants either had to decide whether the word referred to something living , or whether the first and last letters of the word were in alphabetical order .
In the second experiment , the subjects had to imagine what the item looked like to decide whether it was taller than wide or vice versa .
The cue before each word in this experiment told people whether the following word would be seen or heard .
These tests were designed to make the subject think about different aspects of a word , including its meaning .
The participants ' brains were scanned using an EEG ( electroencephalogram ) scanner which looks like a swimming cap covered with electrodes and records electrical brain activity on the scalp .
The scanners , popular since the 1960s , are used in hospitals to detect epilepsy in people and are an important tool to show not just what bits of the brain are lighting up but also what triggers it to light up and when .
In this test , the important thing was to find out whether brain activity before an event has an impact on memory or whether , as was previously thought , it 's just brain activity after an event that is important for memory .
Without the timeline given by an EEG scanner such an analysis would not be possible .
Tests showed that the brain 's electrical activity differed after the cue question and before the word was presented and this was linked to whether the subject would remember or forget the word in a later unexpected memory test .
If the electrical activity maintained a high level over frontal parts of the scalp just before the word was shown , then it was likely that the subject would remember the word up to 50 minutes later - and after doing a series of other word tests .
On the other hand , if the voltage was lower , the subjects were less likely to remember the word .
Dr Otten said : " It would be nice to know what brain regions are involved in this preparatory activity , and whether it can be used to help people who have difficulties remembering things .
Unfortunately we are n't at that stage yet !
What we do know though is that it might have something to do with trying to get into the right frame of mind to make a decision about a word 's meaning .
Staying alert between the cue and the word also appears to help .
We are currently trying to find out more about this kind of brain activity and how it helps long - term memory . "

A German TV news show segment on YouTube is racing around the blogosphere .
Why ?
Because it is absolute proof that Hezbullah manipulates the media for their benefit .
Watch it , and be horrified , as you see “ Green Helmet Guy ” direct the taking of pictures of the victims of Qana .
The mainstream media insist they are far too savvy to fall for crude manipulation like this .
And yet , proof keeps coming up that that is exactly what is happening :
The media are falling utterly for all of the images coming out of Lebanon , and their critical thinking abilities are n’t even in gear .
Lame excuses are offered for serious breaches of editorial oversight .
When even the pictures of bodies being taken out of the rubble are turned into propaganda victories for Hezbullah , you have to wonder — how many pieces of rocket launchers and other evidence were removed from the sites of such bombings ?
This is standard operating procedure in the jihadi manuals .
That is not rhetoric .
We have their manuals on record , and there are whole sections that discuss the manipulation of the media .
And our media plays along , always .
A few days ago , the world press accused Israel of killing a child while going after terrorists .
Surprise — the palestinians lied .
Also Thursday , doctors said that a 5 - year - old Palestinian girl initially believed to have been killed by an Israeli military strike Wednesday apparently died after sustaining head injuries during a fall from a swing .
The girl suffered a fractured skull and there were no signs of shrapnel , said Kazim Abu Libda , a doctor at Gaza ’s Shifa Hospital .
Yasser Arafat learned his lesson well , and taught it to his successors .
He learned it at the feet of the Russians , who also had a field day manipulating world opinion against America and her allies whenever the choice was between them and the Soviet Union .
And they have the advantage in the fact that the average person does not like to engage critical thinking .
Skepticism is not incumbent on intelligence .
Some of the smartest people I know are absolutely unable to see beyond the surface of a situation that does not fit their worldview .
One of my closest friends falls for virtually all of the lies the palestinians have uttered , and when the truth contradicts her worldview , she simply shunts aside the facts for something that fits more closely to how she thinks the situation should be .
If I were to show her this video , no doubt her response would be , “ So? Israel still killed civilians . ”
Yes , she did .
By accident .
The bombs that dropped on that building in Qana were meant for Hezbullah rocket launchers that are threatening the civilian population of Israel .
Israeli civilians are dying , too , and yet there is no outrage from the UN .
I have been waiting daily to hear Kofi Annan express his profound sorrow at the deaths of innocent civilians in Israel .
He has finally broken his silence — to condemn civilian deaths in Gaza .
The message is clear .
Jewish lives have never counted for much in the history of the world , except to Jews .
Israeli lives — even Israeli Arab lives , apparently — do n’t muster a whit of sympathy from the world .
Part of it is due to the losses in the propaganda war .
Part of it is due to the hatred of Jews the world cannot seem to abandon .
But the effects would be lessened , I think , if the media did their jobs more thoroughly , and stopped playing into the enemy ’s hands by publishing their propaganda so readily , and so uncritically .
The Jihadis do n’t distinguish between combatants and civilians .
They have threatened journalists in Lebanon on more than one occasion .
I do n’t think they ’d hesitate to kill reporters , and if they did , I would n’t be at all surprised if they then put the body in a site hit by Israeli shelling .
And get Green Helmet Guy to direct the video .
This war has many fronts , and the propaganda front is not the least of them .
The Jihadis are winning .
Welcome , new readers .
There ’s a lot more to be found on the main page .
Coffee room drinkers pay more when watched by a pair of “ Big Brother ” eyes ( Image : Newcastle University )
We all know the scene : the departmental coffee room , with the price list for tea and coffee on the wall and the “ honesty box ” where you pay for your drinks – or not , because no one is watching .
In a finding that will have office managers everywhere scurrying for the photocopier , researchers have discovered that merely a picture of watching eyes nearly trebled the amount of money put in the box .
Melissa Bateson and colleagues at Newcastle University , UK , put up new price lists each week in their psychology department coffee room .
Prices were unchanged , but each week there was a photocopied picture at the top of the list , measuring 15 by 3 centimetres , of either flowers or the eyes of real faces .
The faces varied but the eyes always looked directly at the observer .
Advertisement
In weeks with eyes on the list , staff paid 2.76 times as much for their drinks as in weeks with flowers .
“ Frankly we were staggered by the size of the effect , ” Gilbert Roberts , one of the researchers , told New Scientist .
Powerful signal
Eyes are known to be a powerful perceptual signal for humans .
People behave more cooperatively when they are being “ watched ” by a cute image of a robot ( see Pay up , you are being watched ) or even abstract “ eye spots ” on a computer screen .
But this , says Roberts , is the first time anyone has observed the effect in a natural situation , with people using their own money .
It could have far - reaching implications .
In previous experiments , people consistently appeared to behave more generously than they needed to for their own self - interest , even when told their actions were anonymous .
This has led an influential school of economists to argue that altruism in humans is innate , rather than being based on cynical self - interest .
But if just a photocopied pair of eyes can treble honesty , the Newcastle team suspects that these previous experiments may somehow have been spoiled by subliminal cues that made people feel they were being watched .
In other words , self - interest may play a large part after all , with people feeling the need to be seen as honest .
“ Those results might need to be re-examined , ” says Roberts .
Meanwhile , the Newcastle team wants to repeat the work with more people , in different situations , perhaps posting pictures of eyes where tickets are sold for public transport .
They would also like to discover what kind of eyes work best .

Isaac Asimov on Science and the Bible
Isaac Asimov ( c. January 2 , 1920 - April 6 , 1992 ) has been one of the most notable science fiction writers .
He has also headed the Humanist Society , an organization hostile to traditional religious values .
While an atheist , Asimov himself was n't hostile to religion .
This interview was from Free Inquiry -- Spring 1982
Paul Kurtz :
In your view is the Bible widely known and intelligently read today ?
Isaac Asimov :
It is undoubtedly widely known .
It is probably owned by more people than any other book .
As to how widely it is read one cannot be certain .
I suppose it is read very widely in the sense that people just look at the words and read it mechanically .
How many people actually think about the words they read , I 'm not at all certain .
They can go to a house of worship and hear verses read without thinking about what the words mean .
Undoubtedly millions of people do .
Kurtz :
There used to be something called the Higher Biblical Criticism .
What has happened to that ?
Asimov : I am constantly hearing , from people who accept the Bible more or less literally , that the Higher Criticism has been outmoded and discredited , but I do n't believe that at all .
This is just something that people say who insist on clinging to the literal truth of the Bible .
The Higher Criticism , which in the nineteenth century , for example , tried to show that the first few books of the Bible contained several strains that could be identified and separated .
I think is as valid today as it ever was .
Fundamentally , there is a J - document and a P - document in the early chapters of Genesis and an E - document later on .
I have no doubt that as one continues to investigate these things one constantly learns and raises new questions .
Kurtz :
But by and large the public does not know much about this skeptical , critical interpretation of the Bible .
Would you say that is so ?
Asimov : Yes .
Just as by and large the public does n't know about any of the disputes there have been about quantum theory .
The public knows only what it reads in the newspapers and sees on television , and this is all extremely superficial .
Kurtz :
One thing I am struck by is that today in America we do n't have a free market of ideas in regard to religion and the Bible .
You are an outstanding exception .
You have taken the Bible seriously and have submitted it to critical analysis .
Would you agree that , although free inquiry concerning the Bible goes on in scholarly journals , and perhaps in university classes and in some books , the public hears mostly pro-religious propaganda -- such as from the pulpits of the electronic church , from various religious publications , and from the daily press -- and very rarely any kind of questioning or probing of biblical claims ?
Asimov : I imagine that the large majority of the population , in the United States at least , either accepts every word of the Bible as it is written or gives it very little thought and would be shocked to hear anyone doubt that the Bible is correct in every way .
So when someone says something that sounds as though he assumes that the Bible was written by human beings -- fallible human beings who were wrong in this respect or that -- he can rely on being vilified by large numbers of people who are essentially ignorant of the facts , and not many people care to subject themselves to this .
Kurtz :
Do you take the Bible primarily as a human document or do you think it was divinely inspired ?
Asimov : The Bible is a human document .
Much of it is great poetry , and much of it consists of the earliest reasonable history that survives .
Samuel I and 2 antedate Herodotus by several centuries .
A great deal of the Bible may contain successful ethical teachings , but the rest is at best allegory and at worst myth and legend .
Frankly , I do n't think that anything is divinely inspired .
I think everything that human beings possess of intelligent origin is humanly inspired , with no exceptions .
Kurtz : Earlier you said that the Bible contained fallible writings .
What would some of these be ?
Asimov :
In my opinion , the biblical account of the creation of the universe and of the earth and humanity is wrong in almost every respect .
I believe that those cases where it can be argued that the Bible is not wrong are , if not trivial , then coincidental .
And I think that the account of a worldwide flood , as opposed , say , to a flood limited to the Tigris - Euphrates region , is certainly wrong .
Kurtz :
The creationists think there is evidence for the Noachian flood .
Asimov :
The creationists think there is evidence for every word in the Bible .
I think all of the accounts of human beings living before the flood , such as Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel , are at best very dim memories of ancient Sumerian rulers ; and even the stories about Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob I rather think are vague legends .
Kurtz : Based on oral tradition ?
Asimov : Yes , and with all the distortions that oral traditions sometimes undergo .
Kurtz :
In your book In the Beginning , you say that creation is a myth .
Why do you think it is scientifically false ?
What are some of the main points ?
Asimov :
Well , all of the scientific evidence we have seems to indicate that the universe is billions of years old .
But there is no indication whatsoever of that in the Bible if it is interpreted literally rather than allegorically .
Creationists insist on interpreting it literary .
According to the information we have , the earth is billions of years younger than the universe .
Kurtz :
It is four and a half billion years old .
Asimov :
The earth is , and the universe is possibly fifteen billion years old .
The universe may have existed ten billion years before the earth , but according to the biblical description of creation the earth , the sun , the moon , and the stars were all created at the same time .
As a matter of fact , according to the Bible , the earth itself existed from the beginning , whereas the stars , sun , and moon were created on the fourth day .
Kurtz :
Yes , so they have it backward .
Asimov :
They have that backward , and they have plant life being created before the sun .
All the evidence we have indicates that this is not so .
The Bible says that every plant , and every animal , was created after its own kind , which would indicate that species have been as they are now from the very beginning and have never changed .
Despite what the creationists say , the fossil record , as well as very subtle biochemical evidence , geological evidence , and all sorts of other evidence , indicates that species have changed , that there has been a long evolutionary process that has lasted over three billion years .
Kurtz :
It 's not simply biology that they are questioning , but geology , astronomy , and the whole basis of the physical sciences .
Asimov :
If we insist on the Bible 's being literary true , then we must abandon the scientific method totally and completely .
There 's no way that we can at the same time try to discover the truth by means of observation and reason and also accept the Bible as true .
Kurtz :
So what is at stake in this debate between evolution and creationism is not simply the principle of evolution in regard to living things but the whole status of the sciences themselves ?
Asimov :
That is what I believe .
But I have letters from creationists who say that they do n't deny the scientific method , that they are just trying to examine the inconsistencies in the evidence presented by the evolutionists .
However , that is not what should be the chief job of the creationists .
What they should do is present positive evidence in favor of creationism , which is something they never do .
They confine themselves to pointing out inconsistencies in the evolutionary view , not hesitating to create those inconsistencies by distortion and , in my opinion , in some cases by outright fraud .
Then they say that they have " proved " that evolutionary theory is false , and therefore creationism is correct .
Kurtz :
Of course you do n't deny that how evolution occurs is not fully or finally formulated .
Asimov : Certainly there are many arguments over the mechanism of evolution , but our knowledge about the evolutionary process is much greater than it was in Darwin 's day .
The present view of evolution is far more subtle and wide - ranging than Darwin 's was or could have been .
But it still is not firmly and finally settled .
There remain many arguments over the exact mechanism of evolution , and furthermore there are many scientists who are dissatisfied with some aspects of evolution that most other scientists accept .
There are always minority views among scientists in every respect , but virtually no scientist denies the fact of evolution .
It is as though we were all arguing about just exactly what makes a car go even though nobody denies that cars go .
Kurtz :
What about the metaphorical interpretations ?
When I was growing up , the general view was that we should accept creationism and that it is not incompatible with evolution but is to be interpreted metaphorically or allegorically in terms of stages .
Asimov :
There is always that temptation .
I am perfectly willing , for instance , to interpret the Bible allegorically and to speak of the days of creation as representing eons of indefinite length .
Clarence Darrow badgered William Jennings
Bryan into admitting that the days could have been very long .
This horrified Bryan 's followers , as it would horrify creationists today .
You can say that the entire first chapter of Genesis is a magnificent poem representing a view of creation as transcending the silly humanoid gods of the Babylonians and presenting a great abstract deity who by his word alone brings the universe into existence .
You can compare this with the Big Bang .
You can say that God said " Let there be light " and then there was the Big Bang ; and one could then follow with all sorts of parallels and similarities if one wished .
I have no objection to that .
Kurtz :
But are n't the stages wrong , even if it is interpreted metaphorically ?
You said earlier that , according to the Bible , God created the earth before the heavenly bodies .
Asimov : Yes .
Some of the stages are wrong .
But you could say that , when the Bible says " In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth , " what was really meant was the universe .
We could say that , at the time the first chapter of Genesis was written , when people spoke of the earth they meant everything there was .
But as our vision and perspective expanded we saw that what was really meant was the universe .
Thus , if necessary , we can modify the words .
But the creationists wo n't do this ; they insist on the literal interpretation of the creation story .
When it says " earth " they want it to mean Earth ; when it says on the first " day " they want it to mean a twenty - four - hour day .
Kurtz :
When the Bible says , " And God made the firmament , " what does it mean ?
Is n't that odd ?
Asimov :
Well , if you trace the word firmament back to its original meaning , it is a thin , beaten layer of metal .
It is like the top you put on a platter in a restaurant .
It is like the lid of a dish .
The earth is a dish and the firmament comes down upon it on all sides .
It is a material object that separates things .
There are waters above the firmament and waters below .
In fact , in the Book of Revelation , which was written about 100 C.E. , centuries after Genesis was written , the writer describes the firmament as folding up like a scroll .
It was still viewed as a thin metal plate .
But we know as surely as we can know anything at all that there is no firmament up there -- there 's no thin metal layer -- there 's only an atmosphere , and beyond it a vacuum , an empty space , except where there are planets , stars , and other objects .
The blueness of it is an illusion due to the scattering of light , and the blackness of night is due to the absence of any light that we can see , and so on .
Kurtz :
In a metaphorical interpretation , how would you interpret " the waters above and the waters below " ?
Does that make any sense ?
Asimov : Not to me .
Obviously the people who first wrote about the waters above the firmament were thinking of rain .
The rain supposedly came down through the windows in the firmament .
There were little holes , as in a shower head , and the rain drizzled through .
I do n't blame them for not understanding .
I do n't criticize the ancients for not knowing what we know .
It took centuries to work up this knowledge , and the ancients contributed their share .
They were every bit as intelligent as we are and every bit as much seekers after the truth .
I 'm willing to admit that .
But the fact is that they did n't know as much as we know now .
Kurtz :
They were limited by the prevailing scientific and philosophical views of the day .
Asimov :
And by the little that had been learned up to that time .
So this seemed a logical explanation of the rain .
They did n't know the nature of the evaporation from the ocean .
They did n't understand what the clouds really were and that is why they spoke of the waters above the firmament and below , but there is no reason that we should speak of it that way .
Kurtz :
If you take Genesis metaphorically , you can believe in the theory of evolution as the Big Bang and also that everything evolved , so this need not be a threat to science necessarily ?
Asimov :
No , if you are willing to say that the universe began fifteen billion years ago -- the exact number of billions of years is under dispute -- as a tiny object that expanded rapidly and dropped in temperature , and all the other things that scientists believe happened , then you can say that God created it , and the laws of nature that controlled it , and that he then sat back and watched it develop .
I would be content to have people say that .
Frankly , I do n't believe it , but there 's no way one can disprove it .
Kurtz :
You do n't believe it ?
You do n't think there is sufficient evidence that there was a cosmic egg that shattered and that God created this cosmic egg ?
Asimov : I believe there 's enough evidence for us to think that a big bang took place .
But there is no evidence whatsoever to suppose that a superhuman being said , " Let it be . "
However , neither is there any evidence against it ; so , if a person feels comfortable believing that , I am willing to have him believe it .
Kurtz :
As an article of faith ?
Asimov : Yes , as an article of faith .
I have articles of faith , too .
I have an article of faith that says the universe makes sense .
Now there 's no way you can prove that the universe makes sense , but there 's just no fun in living in the universe if it does n't make sense .
Kurtz :
The universe is intelligible because you can formulate hypotheses and make predictions and there are regularities .
Asimov :
Yes , and my belief is that no matter how far we go we will always find that the universe makes sense .
We will never get to the point where it suddenly stops making sense .
But that is just an assumption on my part .
Kurtz : Religion then postulates and brings in God .
Asimov : Except it tends to retreat .
At the very start you had rain gods and sun gods .
You had a god for every single natural phenomenon .
Nothing took place without some minor deity personally arranging it .
In the Middle Ages some people thought the planets revolved around the earth because there were angels pushing them , because they did n't know about the Galilean notion that the planets did n't require a constant impetus to keep moving .
Well , if people want to accept a God as initiating the big bang , let them .
But the creationists wont do that .
Kurtz :
Are you fearful that this development of a literal interpretation of the Bible is anti-science and can undermine rationality in this country and in the rest of the world ?
Asimov : I do n't believe it can actually stop sensible people from thinking sensibly , but it can create a situation whereby there are laws against allowing sensible people to think sensibly in the open .
Right now the fight is over creation and evolution .
In the long run , in any fight between evolutionists and creationists , evolution will win as long as human beings have sense .
But there are laws now in Louisiana and Arkansas , and other legislatures are considering similar laws .
Kurtz :
It was struck down in Arkansas .
Asimov : Fortunately !
But wherever the law exists , school teachers must teach creationism if they mention evolution .
This is a dreadful precedent .
In the United States a state can say : " This is scientific .
This is what you must teach in science . "
Whereas in many nations that have had an established church -- nations we may have looked upon as backward -- they nevertheless understood that within the subsystem of science it is science that decides what is scientific .
It is scientists who make the decision .
It is in the scientific marketplace that ideas win or lose .
If they want to teach religion , they can teach it outside of science , and they can say that all of science is wicked and atheistic .
But to force their way into science and to dictate what scientists must declare science to be destroys the meaning of all of science .
It is an absolutely impossible situation and scientists should not permit it without a fight to the very end .
Kurtz : I fully share your concern .
What about religion itself ?
Should religion be a subject for free inquiry ?
Should examination of the Bible be openly discussed in American society ?
Asimov : I do n't see why not .
I think nothing is sacred , at least in a country that considers itself intellectually free .
We can study the political process all we want .
We can examine the reasoning behind communism , fascism , and Nazism .
We can consider the Ku Klux Klan and what they believe .
There is nothing that we should not be able to examine .
Kurtz :
And your examination of the Bible indicates that it is contradicted in many places by modern science ?
Asimov : Yes .
Now this does not automatically mean that science is correct and the Bible is wrong , although I think it is .
People should examine it .
One thing we cannot do is to say without examination that the Bible is right .
Kurtz : Isaac , how would you describe your own position ?
Agnostic , atheist , rationalist , humanist ?
Asimov : I am an atheist , out and out .
It took me a long time to say it .
I 've been an atheist for years and years , but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist , because it assumed knowledge that one did n't have .
Somehow it was better to say one was a humanist or an agnostic .
I finally decided that I 'm a creature of emotion as well as of reason .
Emotionally I am an atheist .
I do n't have the evidence to prove that God does n't exist , but I so strongly suspect he does n't that I do n't want to waste my time .
Kurtz :
But the burden of proof is on the person who claims God exists .
You do n't believe in Santa Claus , but you can't disprove his existence .
The burden of proof is upon those who maintain the claim .
Asimov : Yes .
In any case , I am an atheist .
Kurtz :
You have no doubt reflected a good deal on this .
Can people live without the God myth , without religion ?
You do n't need it presumably .
Does man need it ?
Asimov :
Well , individual human beings may .
There 's a certain comfort , I suppose , in thinking that you will be with all of your loved ones again after death , that death is not the end , that you 'll live again in some kind of never - never land with great happiness .
Maybe some people even get a great deal of comfort out of knowing that all the people they do n't like are going to go straight to hell .
These are all comforts .
Personally , they do n't comfort me .
I 'm not interested in having anyone suffer eternally in hell , because I do n't believe that any crime is so nearly infinite in magnitude as to deserve infinite punishment .
I feel that I could n't bring myself to condemn anyone to eternal punishment .
I am opposed to punishment .
Kurtz :
The height of wickedness , is it not ?
Asimov : Yes .
I feel if I can't do it , then God , who presumably is a much more noble being than I am , could certainly not do it .
Furthermore , I can't help but believe that eternal happiness would eventually be boring .
I cannot grasp the notion of eternal anything .
My own way of thinking is that after death there is nothingness .
Nothingness is the only thing that I think is worth accepting .
Kurtz :
Do you think that one can lead a moral life , that life is meaningful , and that one can be just and noble without a belief in God ?
Asimov : Well , as easily as with a belief in God .
I do n't feel that people who believe in God will automatically be noble , but neither do I think they will automatically be wicked .
I do n't think those who do n't believe in God will be automatically noble or automatically wicked either .
I think this is a choice for every human being , and frankly I think that perhaps if you do n't believe in God this puts a greater strain on you , in the sense that you have to live up to your own feelings of ethics .
But , if you do believe in God , you also believe in forgiveness .
There is no one to forgive me .
Kurtz :
No escape hatch .
Asimov :
That 's right .
If I do something wrong , I have to face myself and I may not be able to figure out a way of forgiving myself .
But , if you believe in God , there are usually rituals whereby you may express contrition and be forgiven , and so on .
So it seems to me that many people can feel free to sin and repent afterward .
I do n't .
In my way of life , there may be repentance but it does n't make up for the sin .
Kurtz :
Of course a lot of people who are humanists say that , if ethics is based upon either fear of God or love of God and his punishment and reward , then one is not really ethical , that ethics must grow out of human experience .
Asimov :
Well , I said the same thing in an argument about what I called the Reagan doctrine .
Early in what I already consider his disastrous administration , Reagan said that one could n't believe anything the Soviets said because they did n't believe in God .
In my view , maybe you can't believe anything the Soviets say , but not for that reason .
If you are ethical only because you believe in God , you are buying your ticket to heaven or trying to tear up your ticket to hell .
In either case , you are just being a shrewd profiteer , nothing else .
The idea of being ethical is to be ethical for no reason except that is the way to be if you want the world to run smoothly .
I think that people who say virtue is its own reward or honesty is the best policy have the right idea
Kurtz :
Are you suggesting that morality is autonomous , that you learn by living and that one does n't need an independent religious support for moral choice ?
Asimov : Yes .
If a group of people are living together in a community where there is a lot of lying and stealing going on , it is an unpleasant way to live .
But if everyone tells the truth and is honest and thoughtful of his neighbor , it is a good way to live .
You do n't need to go any further than that .
Kurtz :
Is there one value that you have always felt is the most important -- one moral principle ?
Asimov : I am scrupulously honest , financially speaking , but I have never really had a serious temptation to be otherwise .
I long for a temptation so that I can prove to myself that I am really scrupulously honest , you see .
Kurtz : I thought you were going to say that you were committed to truth and knowledge !
Asimov :
When I think of being committed to truth and knowledge , that seems to be such a natural sort of thing .
How can anyone be anything else ?
I give myself no credit for that .
I do n't see how it is possible to be tempted away from it , and if you can't be tempted away from it then there is no point in even considering it a virtue .
It is like saying that it is a virtue to breathe .
But when I think of truth , I wonder about telling those little social lies we tell for our own convenience , such as telling someone you have another appointment when you do n't want to go out some evening .
I do n't have much occasion to do that , but I guess I am as prone to it as almost anyone is .
Although I am apt to call someone up and say , " Gee , I meant to call you yesterday but I forgot . "
I probably should n't say that .
I should say that I was busy all day long .
Kurtz :
These are not great moral dilemmas .
Have you never been tested or challenged morally ?
You are a man of great courage , but perhaps you are old enough that you do n't have to worry .
Asimov :
There 's no such thing as not having to worry .
I suppose that if people wanted to make a big fuss about my atheism it could conceivably reflect itself in the sales of my books so that my economic security would suffer .
I figure , what the hell !
There is a certain amount of insistence inside me to prevent me from bartering my feelings , opinions , or views for the sake of a few extra dollars .
Kurtz :
So you have the courage of your convictions ?
Asimov : I suppose so , or it may be just a desire to avoid the unpleasantness of shame !
Unfortunately , many people define wickedness not according to what a person does but according to what a person believes .
So an atheist who lives an upright and noble life , let us say , is nevertheless considered wicked .
Indeed , a religious believer might argue that an upright and noble atheist is far more wicked than an atheist who happens to be a murderer or a crook .
Kurtz :
Is this because the atheist lacks faith in God , and that is considered the ultimate " sin " ?
Asimov : Yes .
The atheist who is a murderer or a crook gives a bad example for atheism and persuades everyone else not to be atheistic .
But a noble and upright atheist , so the believer fears , causes people to doubt the existence of God by the mere fact that a person who does not believe in God can still be upright and noble .
Religious believers might argue that way , but I think that is a horrible perversion of thought and of morality .
Isaac Asimov was an American writer and professor of biochemistry at Boston University .
He was known for his works of science fiction and popular science .
Asimov was a prolific writer who wrote or edited more than 500 books and an estimated 90,000 letters and postcards .

House budget : Borrow , then borrow more
An editorial / By Dale McFeatters
Scripps Howard News Service May 22 , 2006
Monday
The Republican - run House has spared itself the embarrassment of being unable to agree on a budget by narrowly approving a blueprint for spending $ 2.8 trillion in fiscal 2007 .
Even then it only passed in the wee hours Thursday on a promise to several GOP moderates that several billion in projected cuts in education and health programs would be quietly restored down the road .
And to get an acceptable number the House budgeted only $ 50 billion next year for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan - it 's likely to be twice that - and leaving out the long - term costs altogether .
It also omits the annual cost of capping the Alternative Minimum Tax .
The budget assumes future , politically improbable cuts in education and veterans medical care while scrapping for this election year cuts President Bush had asked for in such politically popular programs as Medicare , Medicaid and farm subsidies .
The House leadership praised itself for enforcing spending discipline and so did Bush , even though the House would spend more than he asked for in his own budget .
Only in Planet Washington is this spending discipline .
What this budget does is borrow , and then borrow some more .
The budget raised the ceiling on the national debt $ 653 billion to $ 9.6 trillion and put in an automatic increase next year to $ 10 trillion , freeing the lawmakers from the awkward task of having to vote on borrowing yet more money .
And the lawmakers will borrow :
The budget calls for the deficit to grow $ 254 billion over five years
As a side effect , the interest on the national debt is now the second fastest rising cost in the budget after Medicare .
This year , the interest payments will cost $ 211 billion , about 8.2 percent of federal spending , and they will increase by another $ 132 billion over five years .
What savings there in the House budget would go not to deficit reduction but to underwrite $ 228 billion in tax cuts over the next five years .
Recall that when Bush took office the budget was in balance ; there was a projected five - year surplus of over $ 5 trillion ; the national debt stood at $ 5.7 trillion and was actually starting to decline .
The House 's new spending plan is not a budget as someone who actually has to live on one would understand it .

Matzにっき - Alan Kayといっしょ や 日本 Ruby カンファレンス 2006 （ RubyKaigi）の まつもとさんの基調講演での言及から、一部の隠れ
Smalltalk ファンの方々には衝撃をもって受け止められたり、あるいはおもしろおかしく取り上げる向きもある、くだんのセリフ。実は、アラン・ケイが
Smalltalk への失望や批判的評価を述べることはそんなに珍しいことではありません。（…ので、びっくりしちゃった人は、これを機会に
“ 耐性 ” を持つようにしましょう！ｗ）
たとえば、このブログではお馴染みの The Early History of Smalltalk には、こんなくだりがあります 。
When I looked at Smalltalk in 1975 , I was looking at something great , but I did not see an enduser language , I did not see a solution to the original goal of a " reading " and " writing " computer medium for children .
I wanted to stop , dynamite everything and start from scratch again .
もうすでに３０年前に（つまり、Smalltalk がよく知られる 「 Smalltalk - 80 」として '81 にデビューする５年以上も前に！ｗ）、アラン・ケイは
Smalltalk のあり方に疑問を呈していたわけです。
OOPSLA'97 カンファレンスの基調講演でもこんなことを言っています。
Smalltalk died when it left Xerox Parc and became a fixed environment unable to evolve into something new .
最近もインタビュー記事で、こんな発言もありました。
Basically what happened is this vehicle became more and more a programmer ’s vehicle and less and less a children ’s vehicle ―the version that got put out , Smalltalk ’ 80 , I do n’t think it was ever programmed by a child .
I do n’t think it could have been programmed by a child because it had lost some of its amenities , even as it gained pragmatic power .
So the death of Smalltalk in a way came as soon as it got recognized by real programmers as being something useful ; they made it into more of their own image , and it started losing its nice end - user features .
まつもとさんとの会話でくだんのセリフが発せられた文脈は、その場にいなかった私が知るよしもないのですが、少なくとも、これまでの同様の発言においては、コンピュータ・リテラシー教育を意識した当初の開発目的を鑑みて、子供向け、エンドユーザー向けではなくなってしまった時点で、あるいは、さらにそうした傾向が進むことで、商用化や標準化が新たな目的となり“変化すること”をやめた時点で…、ということのようですね。たしかにそういった前提ならば、「（アラン・ケイにとっての）Smalltalk は死んだ」という言葉が設計者、自らの口から発せられたとしても、それは、高い理想を持つアラン・ケイならば、なおさらのこと、しごく当然のことのように思われます。
同じ「 Smalltalk は死んだ 」でも、自分は Smalltalk が有効活用されている場面に遭遇したことがない…という文脈で、それこそ
3 + 4 を print it したこともないような Smalltalk のスの字も知らない輩にしたり顔で言われるのとはわけが違います。ｗ（まあ、実際は、こういうことを書いたり言ったりする人の多くは、Smalltalk で昔、それなりに仕事をした経験がある…と自負する人が多いのですが( ^_^ ; ) ）
いささか杞憂に過ぎるとは思いますが、今回のことで「Smalltalk は死んだ言語だ」という衝撃的なフレーズや、それをアラン・ケイの口から（ここにきての、まさに打ち明け話のように）発せられたという事実（や、事実に反するイメージ）だけが一人歩きし、すでに生みの親にまで見捨てられた過去の遺物である
Smalltalk から学ぶことなどもうありはしない…というような早とちりをしてしまう人が出てくることのないようにと、切に願うばかりです。

June 15 , 2006 -- --
Going into Thursday 's Iraq debate in Congress , both sides had news points to bolster their arguments -- for war supporters , it was recent the killing of Abu Musab al - Zarqawi and the completion of the Iraqi cabinet ; for war critics , the fact that U.S. deaths in Iraq today hit 2,500 .
Both also went into the debate armed with political talking points .
The most unusual came via a document sent out by Office of the Secretary of Defense to an assortment of congressional aides , as well as to the Iraqi Embassy and the U.S. Ambassador to Belgium .
The 74 - page document is an exhaustive rebuttal of criticisms of the war and a defense of the administration 's conduct of the war .
The document , labeled " Iraq floor debate prep book , " was emailed on Wednesday afternoon to a handful of Democrats as well as Republicans -- and was then abruptly recalled .
Thursday afternoon , Sen. Frank Lautenberg ( D - N.J. ) sent a letter to Rumsfeld complaining that his office had spent " taxpayer dollars to produce partisan political documents . "
Lautenberg also suggested that the document may have violated laws prohibiting the Executive Branch from using taxpayer dollars for lobbying and propaganda activities .
The Pentagon later said the document was produced by the National Security Council -- but did not offer an explanation as to why it was sent out by the Office of the Secretary of Defense .
Republicans on the Hill were not happy that the document was sent to Democrats -- or that it was produced at all .
" I 've never seen anything like it , " said one Republican aide , noting that the document went well beyond a Statement of Administration Policy .
" I mean , a 74 - page document -- are you kidding me ? "
The aide added : " It did more harm than good for the Republican cause . "
A New Debate Over an Old Issue
The flap came as both chambers engaged in contentious debates on Iraq , and specifically , the question of when to withdraw troops .
House members held their first full - day debate on Iraq since Congress granted President Bush the authority to wage war in 2002 .
The House was specifically debating a resolution that declared it was not in the " national security interest " of the United States to set an " arbitrary date " for the withdrawal of troops from Iraq .
The resolution also cast Iraq as part of the global war on terror , and declared the U.S. was " committed " to finishing the mission in Iraq .
Democrats complained that the debate was unfair , since they were prevented from offering amendments or alternatives .
But it produced plenty of fiery rhetoric from both sides .
" Our fighting men and women remain committed to the effort [ but ] the battle is not over , " said House Speaker Dennis Hastert ( R - Ill . ) .
" The alternative would be to cut and run and wait for them to regroup and bring the terror back to our shores . "
" This resolution is a restatement of the failed policy of this administration , " responded Rep. John Murtha ( D - Penn . ) , a war critic and former Marine who advocates withdrawing troops .
" You know who wants us to stay in Iraq right now ? " he asked .
" Al Qaeda wants us there because it recruits people for them .
In the Senate , Republicans tried to exploit divisions among Democrats over the issue of troop withdrawal , by bringing up a proposal they knew would fail to pass -- one requiring that almost all U.S troops leave Iraq by the end of the year .
It was identical to a measure filed by Sen. John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) , but it was Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) who brought it up ; other Senate Democrats have been working to come up with a consensus alternative -- but as of yet they have not been able to agree on language .
Kerry aides say he still plans to bring up his amendment for a vote next week .
The annual Metropolitan Museum of Art ’s Costume Institute Gala draws a big crowd and even bigger event coverage .
The whoâ€™s who of fashion is usually in attendance and is organized by the lovely people at Conde Nast .
This year , dubbed AngloMania after the Met ’s forthcoming AngloMania exhibit of Britianâ€™s posh and punk fashion , went off without a hitch with an English twist .
Mini gardens and tables without no table cloths were all the rage .
Well next year Anna Wintour , Editor in Chief of Vogue will now have to find a new interior decorator - party planner , because David Monn , who who took over the design of the Costume Institute Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art from Robert Isabel two years ago , told Wintour he was dumping her as a client in a fit of pique earlier this week .
Page Six says :
“ David was very angry , he worked very hard to create the gala last May , and it looked beautiful .
But then Vogue covered the event in the July issue and made no mention of him whatsoever .
They mentioned all of the Vogue staffers who were there – but not him .
He was livid . ”
Wintour , apparently unaware Monn ’s feelings were hurt , tried to contact Monn this week to get him to sign on for next year ’s event – but he told her , “ No way . ”
“ Anna is furious , ” another source said .
“ No one has ever fired The Queen !
Can you imagine ?
Scandal ! ” Wintour , too , has a right to be angry .
“ David was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars , ” the source explained .
“ He was paid while most everyone else donated money or their time .
The event is for charity , and all the big designers buy tables for $ 50,000 and advertisements .
Anna herself donates a lot of money .
And he gets paid cash and wants a mention ?
Ridiculous ! ”
The Gala is such a big production , goodness knows how they do it .
CC is crazy !
She told Marie Claire , " I have issues with getting old .
There are huge changes in my body and face , and I obsess over them .
I just try not to have too many mirrors around ....
It 's hard getting older - it's hard not to be the young one anymore . "
Did she not see how amazing she looked in a bikini while vacationing in Sardinia last week ?
Here she is in London with her husband David Arquette and they both look fabulous .
This woman has aged beautifully and I cannot wait for her return to the small screen this fall .
Btw , I think David has never looked better as well .

A transmitter is attached to a dragonfly 's thorax ( © C.Ziegler )
More details
The team , led by researchers from Princeton University , found that the insects are capable of flying up to 85 miles ( 137 km ) in a day .
Writing in the journal Biology Letters , the group describes how it tracked the movements by attaching tiny radio transmitters to the insects .
A scientific posse followed the signals from a receiving aeroplane .
Other researchers monitored the insects ' progress from the ground .
Tricks of the trade
The dragonflies ' route took them along the east coast of America towards the warmer south .
The data revealed that the dragonflies ' migration patterns are strikingly similar to those of songbirds , suggesting there is a strong evolutionary link to their behaviours .
The ocean prompts a change in direction ( © Christian Ziegler )
" It is just possible what we are seeing here are the basic primitive rules of migration and that birds converged on the tricks of the trade , " he told Science In Action on the BBC World Service .
Billions of common green darner dragonflies ( Anax junius ) migrate every year but until now hardly anything was known about their routes or strategy .
The new research shows there is method behind the insects ' flight behaviour .
For example , the dragonflies tended to only move after two nights of cooler temperatures , indicating a cold front was approaching with favourable north - westerly winds .
They also tended to change direction when they met a large body of water , ensuring they never became stranded out over the sea .
Two insects were recorded flying out over the ocean before reversing and skirting down the coastline .
The detailed flight path information was made possible by tiny radio transmitters developed by the team .
Final destination
Each transmitter weighed about a third of a gram and had enough battery life to track an individual for 10 days ; but tagging such small creatures is far from easy .
" The challenge is first catching the dragonfly , " said Professor Wilcove .
Once caught , each transmitter was attached with a couple of drops of superglue and some eye - lash adhesive .
However , the final destination of the green darners is still not known because of the power restraints of the transmitter set - up ; and some individuals simply flew out of range of the scientists .
In the future , the team hopes to refine its techniques and make the tracking even more hi-tech .
" The dream scenario would be to get a satellite to pick up the signals from these transmitters , " said Professor Wilcove .
" If you had a satellite like that you could [ follow the migration of ] all kinds of birds , dragonflies , and locusts ; and , I think , it would shed tremendous light on the movements of these organisms . "
When you build a Domain Specific Language ( DSL ) , how do you go about making it executable .
This is an easy question to answer for an internal DSL , since they are embedded into real languages .
An external DSL needs more work .
Here I take a simple DSL example and show a few simple ways to generate code from it .
I recently wrote an article describing language oriented programming and the recent evolution of a bunch of tools which I call language workbenches .
In that article I used a simple Domain Specific Language to illustrate my points .
Although I discussed what this DSL looked like in the article , I did n't talk about how you would actually make that language executable by generating code .
It 's useful to get an appreciation of this because that can help you understand the nature of a language workbench 's abstract representation and how a language workbench 's generator works .
So in this article I 'll take the simple example from that article , and show some simple ways by which we could go about generating code .
This will lead from a simple single - pass approach to ones that involve building up an abstract representation and using templating to generate the code .
When thinking about the trade - offs in using DSLs , you do n't really need to understand how generation works .
As I delve into how language workbenches work , however , this will be handy .
I 'll start with the custom language case .
To refresh your memory the custom language looks like :
mapping SVCL dsl.ServiceCall 4-18 : CustomerName 19 - 23 : CustomerID 24 - 27 : CallTypeCode 28-35 : DateOfCallString mapping USGE dsl .
Usage 4 - 8 : CustomerID 9-22 : CustomerName 30 - 30 : Cycle 31 - 36 : ReadDate
In order to get the custom case to work we need to transform it into the equivalent of the internal DSL case .
public void Configure ( Reader target ) { target .
AddStrategy ( ConfigureServiceCall ( ) ) ; target .
AddStrategy ( ConfigureUsage ( ) ) ; } private ReaderStrategy ConfigureServiceCall ( ) { ReaderStrategy result = new ReaderStrategy ( " SVCL " , typeof ( ServiceCall ) ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 4 , 18 , " CustomerName " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 19 , 23 , " CustomerID " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 24 , 27 , " CallTypeCode " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 28 , 35 , " DateOfCallString " ) ; return result ; } private ReaderStrategy ConfigureUsage ( ) { ReaderStrategy result = new ReaderStrategy ( " USGE " , typeof ( Usage ) ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 4 , 8 , " CustomerID " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor(9 , 22 , " CustomerName " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 30 , 30 , " Cycle " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 31 , 36 , " ReadDate " ) ; return result ; }
The reader framework is very simple , there 's just the reader class that processes a file of events that has strategies for each kind of event that may appear in the file .
The reader reads each line , extracts the event code , and hands off to the strategy for the particular line .
The job of configuration is to create the right strategies and send them to the reader .
To encapsulate the code for creating the readers from an external configuration file I that code is a separate reader builder class .
We 'll explore a number of ways to do this as we go , so you 'll see several varieties of reader builder .
The first one just simply reads the custom configuration file and sets up the reader .
Single Pass Builder
I create a builder by telling it which configuration file to use .
I then use it to configure a reader .
class ReaderBuilderTextSinglePass ... public ReaderBuilderTextSinglePass ( string filename ) { _filename = filename ; } private string _filename ; public void Configure ( Reader reader ) { _reader = reader ; using ( TextReader input = File. OpenText( _filename ) ) { while ( ( _line = input. ReadLine ( ) ) != null ) ProcessLine ( ) ; } } private Reader _reader ; private string _line = null ;
To process a line of the custom configuration file , I test the line with various regular expressions and react depending on what kind of line I see .
Blanks and comments are ignored .
class ReaderBuilderTextSinglePass ... private void ProcessLine ( ) { if ( isBlank ( ) ) return ; if ( isComment ( ) ) return ; else if ( isNewMapping ( ) ) makeNewStrategy ( ) ; else makeFieldExtract ( ) ; } private bool isBlank ( ) { Regex blankRE = new Regex ( @ " ^\s * $ " ) ; return blankRE.IsMatch ( _line ) ; } private bool isComment ( ) { return _line [ 0 ] == ' # ' ; } private bool isNewMapping ( ) { Regex blankRE = new Regex ( @ " \s* mapping " ) ; return blankRE.IsMatch ( _line ) ; } When I see a mapping declaration I make a new strategy .
class ReaderBuilderTextSinglePass ... private void makeNewStrategy ( ) { string [ ] tokens = _line . Split( whitespace ( ) ) ; _currentStrategy = new ReaderStrategy ( tokens [ 1 ] . Trim ( whitespace ( ) ) , Type.GetType(tokens [ 2 ] ) ) ; _reader .
AddStrategy ( _currentStrategy ) ; } private char [ ] whitespace ( ) { char [ ] result = {' ' , '\t '} ; return result ; } When I see a field declaration I add a new field extractor to the strategy .
class ReaderBuilderTextSinglePass ... private void makeFieldExtract ( ) { string [ ] tokens1 = _line .
Split ( ' :' ) ; string targetProperty = tokens 1 [ 1 ] .
Trim (' ' ) ; string [ ] tokens2 = tokens 1 [ 0 ] .
Trim ( whitespace ( ) ) .
Split ('-' ) ; int begin = Int32.Parse ( tokens2 [ 0 ] ) ; int end = Int32. Parse ( tokens2 [ 1 ] ) ; _currentStrategy .
AddFieldExtractor( begin , end , targetProperty ) ; } This is certainly not the prettiest parser that 's been written - even by me - but it 's simple and does the job .
Essentially what I 'm doing is parsing the configuration file and configuring the reader as I go .
For a simple example like this a single pass transformation from custom DSL to framework is quick and easy .
Two Pass Builder
Now let 's look at a slightly different way of doing it .
What I 'm going to do now is a two pass process .
The parser reads the configuration file and produces a data structure .
A separate generator then looks at this data structure to configure the reader .
Figure 1 : The data structure for the abstract representation of the language .
Figure 1 shows this data structure .
As you see it represents the abstract syntax of our mapping language .
People who remember their compiler classes will recognize this as an Abstract Syntax Tree for the language .
Two classes manipulate this tree .
The parser reads the text input and creates the tree .
The generator then reads the tree and configures the reader object .
The parser is very similar to the parser we saw before .
The basic flow of control is identical .
class ReaderBuilderTextSinglePass ... public ReaderBuilderTextSinglePass ( string filename ) { _filename = filename ; } private string _filename ; public void Configure ( Reader reader ) { _reader = reader ; using ( TextReader input = File. OpenText( _filename ) ) { while ( ( _line = input. ReadLine ( ) ) != null ) ProcessLine ( ) ; } } private Reader _reader ; private string _line = null ;
The only change in this start up code is to return the root of the AST rather than a reader .
This decision making is entirely the same .
class BuilderParserText ... private void ProcessLine ( ) { if ( isBlank ( ) ) return ; if ( isComment ( ) ) return ; else if ( isNewMapping ( ) ) makeMapping ( ) ; else make Field ( ) ; } private bool isBlank ( ) { Regex blankRE = new Regex ( @ " ^\s * $ " ) ; return blankRE.IsMatch ( _line ) ; } private bool isComment ( ) { return _line [ 0 ] == ' # ' ; } private bool isNewMapping ( ) { Regex blankRE = new Regex ( @ " \s* mapping " ) ; return blankRE.IsMatch ( _line ) ; } private char [ ] whitespace ( ) { char [ ] result = {' ' , '\t '} ; return result ; }
The changes occur in the actions once the parser has parsed out the broad tokens .
In this case the parser adds mapping objects to the root of the AST when it sees the mapping line .
class BuilderParserText ... private void makeMapping ( ) { _currentMapping = new ReaderConfiguration .
Mapping ( ) ; _result.Mappings.Add(_currentMapping ) ; string [ ] tokens = _line . Split( whitespace ( ) ) ; _currentMapping .
Code = tokens [ 1 ] . Trim ( whitespace ( ) ) ; _currentMapping .TargetClassName = tokens [ 2 ] . Trim ( whitespace ( ) ) ; } Similarly when it sees fields it adds field objects .
class BuilderParserText ... private void makeField ( ) { ReaderConfiguration .
Field f = new ReaderConfiguration .
Field ( ) ; string [ ] tokens1 = _line .
Split ( ' :' ) ; f. FieldName = tokens 1 [ 1 ] . Trim (' ' ) ; string [ ] tokens2 = tokens 1 [ 0 ] .
Trim ( whitespace ( ) ) .
Split ('-' ) ; f. Start = Int32.Parse ( tokens2[ 0 ] ) ; f. End = Int32.Parse ( tokens2 [ 1 ] ) ; _currentMapping .
Fields .
Add(f ) ; } }
The generator now reads this structure to configure the framework .
It 's very simple class .
class BuilderGenerator ... public void Configure ( Reader result , ReaderConfiguration configuration ) { foreach ( ReaderConfiguration .
Mapping mapping in configuration .
Mappings ) makeStrategy ( result , mapping ) ; } private void makeStrategy ( Reader result , ReaderConfiguration .
Mapping mapping ) { ReaderStrategy strategy = new ReaderStrategy ( mapping .
Code , mapping .
TargetClass ) ; result .
AddStrategy ( strategy ) ; foreach ( ReaderConfiguration .
Field field in mapping .
Fields ) strategy .
AddFieldExtractor ( field .
Start , field .
End , field .
FieldName ) ; } What 's the advantage of separating the two stages ?
It does cost us a bit of complexity - we have to add the AST classes .
If we were only reading and writing to a single format it 's arguable whether the AST is worth the effort - at least for this simple case .
The real advantage in the AST lies when we want to read or write multiple formats .
Let 's allow our DSL to be written in an XML concrete syntax as well as the custom one .
Again to save you running around this document here 's the XML version .
< ReaderConfiguration > < Mapping Code = " SVCL " TargetClass = " dsl.ServiceCall " > < Field name = " CustomerName " start = " 4 " end = " 18 " / >
< Field name = " CustomerID " start = " 19 " end = " 23 " / >
< Field name = " CallTypeCode " start = " 24 " end = " 27 " / >
< Field name = " DateOfCallString " start = " 28 " end = " 35 " / > </ Mapping > < Mapping Code = " USGE " TargetClass = " dsl. Usage " >
< Field name = " CustomerID " start = " 4 " end = " 8 " />
< Field name = " CustomerName " start = " 9 " end = " 22 " / >
< Field name = " Cycle " start = " 30 " end = " 30 " / >
< Field name = " ReadDate " start = " 31 " end = " 36 " / > </ Mapping > </ ReaderConfiguration >
To read this format all we have to do is write a new parser - we can use the same generator .
class BuilderParserXml ... ReaderConfiguration _result = new ReaderConfiguration ( ) ; string _filename ; public BuilderParserXml ( ) { } public BuilderParserXml( string filename ) { _filename = filename ; } public void run ( ) { XPathDocument doc = new XPathDocument ( File.OpenText( _filename ) ) ; XPathNavigator nav = doc.CreateNavigator ( ) ; XPathNodeIterator it = nav.
Select ( " // Mapping " ) ; while ( it.MoveNext ( ) ) ProcessMappingNode( it. Current ) ; } public ReaderConfiguration ReaderConfiguration { get { return _result ; } } private void ProcessMappingNode ( XPathNavigator nav ) { ReaderConfiguration .
Mapping currentMapping = new ReaderConfiguration .
Mapping ( ) ; _result.Mappings.Add(currentMapping ) ; currentMapping .
Code = nav.GetAttribute ( " Code " , " " ) ; currentMapping.TargetClassName = nav.GetAttribute ( " TargetClass " , " " ) ; XPathNodeIterator it = nav.SelectChildren ( " Field " , " " ) ; while ( it.MoveNext ( ) ) currentMapping .
Fields.Add(ProcessFieldNode( it.Current ) ) ; } private ReaderConfiguration .
Field ProcessFieldNode ( XPathNavigator nav ) { ReaderConfiguration .
Field result = new ReaderConfiguration .
Field ( ) ; result .
FieldName = nav.GetAttribute ( " name " , " " ) ; result .
Start = Convert.ToInt16(nav.GetAttribute ( " start " , " " ) ) ; result .
End = Convert.ToInt16(nav.GetAttribute ( " end " , " " ) ) ; return result ; } The XML parser is a bit easier to write , because the tools do all the text munging for us , all we have to do is read the resulting XML tree .
It creates exactly the same objects as the custom text parser , so the same generator will work the same .
( A further advantage of the two step process is that we test each step independently too . )
Writing a parser like this by hand is okay for a language as simple as this , but I would n't suggest it for more complicated languages .
Parser generator tools exist that can take a grammar definition of a language and help you generate an AST .
You do n't have to get much more complex than this example to make these tools worthwhile .
Although it takes a bit of effort to learn how to use them , the results are much easier to deal with .
( Essentially grammars are a DSL for helping you parse languages into an abstract representation . )
I wo n't discuss parser generators any more here because the parsing part of the process is n't important for language workbenches .
In a language workbench , the abstract representation takes a much more central role than it does in conventional programming - together with the idea that you can have multiple human readable forms for the same abstract representation .
Using Templates for Generation
In the above examples , we used some procedural code to generate the framework classes , which works very nicely in this case .
Another approach to the generator is to actually produce C# output which can then be compiled in with the framework .
This allows the configuration files to be brought into the system at compile time rather than runtime .
Depending on the situation this can be a bane rather than a boon , but it 's worth exploring this approach here - again because we 'll see it again in language workbenches .
The idea behind templates is to edit your output file in its final format , but with little markers to indicate where you want the generator to insert code .
The various server page technologies ( PHP , JSP , ASP ) use templates to add dynamic content to web pages .
In this case we 'll use templates to add generated content to a skeleton C# file .
To demonstrate I 'm going to use NVelocity .
NVelocity is the .NET port of the popular Java templating engine : Velocity .
I like Velocity because it 's simple - many people like to use Velocity instead of JSPs .
NVelocity is still in development and as I used it I found its documentation to be very limited .
Fortunately the template language ( VTL ) is the same as the Java version , and the documentation there is usable .
Running NVelocity can be the tricky bit .
Here I have a velocity builder class that creates an instance of the velocity engine which I can use to build the files I need .
class VelocityBuilder ... public Velocity Builder ( string templateDir , string configDir , string targetDir ) { engine = new VelocityEngine ( ) ; this .configDir = configDir ; this .
targetDir = targetDir ; engine .
SetProperty(RuntimeConstants_Fields.FILE_RESOURCE_LOADER_PATH , templateDir ) ; engine .
Init ( ) ; config = new BuilderParserText( configDir + " ReaderConfig.txt " ) .
Run ( ) ; } VelocityEngine engine ; string configDir ; string targetDir ; ReaderConfiguration config ;
When I 'm doing templating I usually like to first write a hard coded class for a single case , get that class working and debugged , and then ( as gradually as I can ) replace the hard coded elements with templated elements .
I 'll show this two ways .
First I 'll use templating to generate our C# configuration code from earlier on .
This is n't typically how you would do it , but it gives me a chance to demonstrate templating on something familiar .
The configuration code looks like this .
public void Configure ( Reader target ) { target .
AddStrategy ( ConfigureServiceCall ( ) ) ; target .
AddStrategy ( ConfigureUsage ( ) ) ; } private ReaderStrategy ConfigureServiceCall ( ) { ReaderStrategy result = new ReaderStrategy ( " SVCL " , typeof ( ServiceCall ) ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 4 , 18 , " CustomerName " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 19 , 23 , " CustomerID " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 24 , 27 , " CallTypeCode " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 28 , 35 , " DateOfCallString " ) ; return result ; } private ReaderStrategy ConfigureUsage ( ) { ReaderStrategy result = new ReaderStrategy ( " USGE " , typeof ( Usage ) ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 4 , 8 , " CustomerID " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor(9 , 22 , " CustomerName " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 30 , 30 , " Cycle " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 31 , 36 , " ReadDate " ) ; return result ; }
The templated version of this looks like this .
public void Configure ( Reader target ) { # foreach ( $ map in $ {config. Mappings} ) target .
AddStrategy ( Configure${map.TargetClassNameOnly} ( ) ) ; #end } # foreach ( $ map in $ config .
Mappings ) private ReaderStrategy Configure${map.TargetClassNameOnly} ( ) { ReaderStrategy result = new ReaderStrategy ( " $map. Code " , typeof ( $map.TargetClassName ) ) ; # foreach ( $f in $ map .
Fields ) result .
AddFieldExtractor ( $f. Start , $ f. End , " $ f. FieldName " ) ; #end return result ; } #end Since I wo n't assume you 're familiar with VTL ( Velocity Template Language )
I 'll explain the elements I 'm using .
The first bit is references to parameters .
You can refer to a parameter in VTL by using the syntax $ parameterName or $ {parameterName} ( the latter is best when you are running the parameter references directly against other text with no spaces ) .
Once you have the parameter you can call methods and access properties on that parameter freely .
To set things so the parameter is accessible you need to put the object into the context of the engine when you run the mapping .
private void GenerateParameterized ( ) { VelocityContext context = new VelocityContext ( ) ; context .
Put ( " config " , this.config ) ; using ( TextWriter target = File.CreateText( targetDir + " ReflectiveTemplateBuilder.cs " ) ) engine.MergeTemplate (" ReflectiveTemplateBuilder.cs.vm " , context , target ) ; } ( You 'll notice I 've defined a property TargetClassNameOnly on Mapping .
This returns the name of the target class as ServiceCall rather than dsl .
ServiceCall , useful since I 'm preserving the breakout of methods in the generated configuration code .
Although the AST is mostly a dumb data structure there 's no reason why you should n't move useful behavior in there to avoid duplication . )
The second bit of VTL is the looping directive # foreach ( $item in $ collection ) .
This allows me to loop through the mappings and fields .
The resulting generated code looks like this .
public void Configure ( Reader target ) { target .
AddStrategy ( ConfigureServiceCall ( ) ) ; target .
AddStrategy ( ConfigureUsage ( ) ) ; } private ReaderStrategy ConfigureServiceCall ( ) { ReaderStrategy result = new ReaderStrategy ( " SVCL " , typeof ( dsl.ServiceCall ) ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 4 , 18 , " CustomerName " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 19 , 23 , " CustomerID " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 24 , 27 , " CallTypeCode " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 28 , 35 , " DateOfCallString " ) ; return result ; } private ReaderStrategy ConfigureUsage ( ) { ReaderStrategy result = new ReaderStrategy ( " USGE " , typeof ( dsl.
Usage ) ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 4 , 8 , " CustomerID " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor(9 , 22 , " CustomerName " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 30 , 30 , " Cycle " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 31 , 36 , " ReadDate " ) ; return result ; }
The line formatting is a bit messed up , but other than that it 's pretty close to the original .
So this generates the same code that we wrote by hand - but this is n't typically the way you 'd work with a generator .
What we 've done is generated the configuration of the runtime interpretor which uses reflection to populate classes and fields .
That 's what you have to do for a runtime interpreter , but when you use code generation you can do it all with compile time constructs .
Instead of using a single strategy class that uses reflection to do its work I can use multiple strategy classes , one for each kind of event .
These strategies can then call classes and methods directly .
Such a strategy might look like this .
public class InlineStrategy : IReaderStrategy { public string Code { get { return " SVCL " ; } } public object Process ( string line ) { ServiceCall result = new ServiceCall ( ) ; result .
CustomerName = line .
Substring ( 4,15 ) ; result .
CustomerID = line .
Substring ( 19,5 ) ; result .
CallTypeCode = line .Substring ( 24,4 ) ; result .
DateOfCallString = line .Substring ( 28,8 ) ; return result ; } } Again I did this by writing this one case first , getting it working and then turning it into a template .
Here 's the template .
public class $ map.MapperClassName : IReaderStrategy { public string Code { get { return " $ map. Code " ; } } public object Process ( string line ) { $ map.TargetClassName result = new $ {map.TargetClassName} ( ) ; # foreach ( $f in $ map .
Fields ) result .$f .
FieldName = line .
Substring ( $f. Start , $ f. Length ) ; #end return result ; } } This produces two classes for our sample .
public class MapSVCL : IReaderStrategy { public string Code { get { return " SVCL " ; } } public object Process ( string line ) { dsl.
ServiceCall result = new dsl.ServiceCall( ) ; result .
CustomerName = line .
Substring ( 4 , 15 ) ; result .
CustomerID = line .
Substring ( 19 , 5 ) ; result .
CallTypeCode = line .
Substring ( 24 , 4 ) ; result .
DateOfCallString = line .Substring ( 28 , 8 ) ; return result ; } } public class MapUSGE : IReaderStrategy { public string Code { get { return " USGE " ; } } public object Process ( string line ) { dsl .
Usage result = new dsl .
Usage ( ) ; result .
CustomerID = line .
Substring ( 4 , 5 ) ; result .
CustomerName = line .
Substring ( 9 , 14 ) ; result .
Cycle = line .
Substring ( 30 , 1 ) ; result .
ReadDate = line .
Substring ( 31 , 6 ) ; return result ; } }
To hook these classes into a reader , we need to generate a builder that will know about the classes we 've just generated .
Here 's the template for that public class ReaderBuilderInline { public void Configure ( Reader target ) { # foreach ( $ map in $ config .
Mappings ) target .
AddStrategy ( new $ {map.MapperClassName} ( ) ) ; #end } } which generates public class ReaderBuilderInline { public void Configure ( Reader target ) { target .
AddStrategy ( new MapSVCL ( ) ) ; target .
AddStrategy ( new MapUSGE ( ) ) ; } }
The resulting code is more voluminous , but usually that does n't matter much .
You can now have the compiler check this code - after all if you 're using a statically typed language you might as well the benefit of it .
Often people find this kind of code easier to follow than configuration code , at least once they get used to manipulating VTL .
It does stop you from modifying the configuration at runtime , so this would n't be suitable for some scenarios .
However there 's no reason why you can't use similar techniques to generate scripts that can be executed at runtime .
Indeed the lisp style of language oriented programming is more like this , you write a generator that generates lisp code that 's executed at run time .
This is where lisp 's macro capabilities shine .
When journalists use the word " apparently , " or another favorite " reportedly , " they are usually distancing themselves from an event or an interpretation in the supposed interests of balance .
But I think we should read the " apparently " contained in a statement from the head of the United Nations , Kofi Annan , relating to the killing this week of four unarmed UN monitors by the Israeli army in its other sense .
When Annan says that those four deaths were " apparently deliberate , " I take him to mean that the evidence shows that the killings were deliberate .
And who can disagree with him ?
At least 10 phone calls were made to Israeli commanders over a period of six hours warning that artillery and aerial bombardments were either dangerously close to or hitting the monitors ’ building .
The UN post , in Khaim just inside south Lebanon , was clearly marked and well - known to the army , but nonetheless it was hit directly four times in the last hour before an Israeli helicopter fired a precision - guided missile that tore through the roof of an underground shelter , killing the monitors inside .
A UN convoy that arrived too late to rescue the peacekeepers was also fired on .
From the evidence , it does not get much more deliberate than that .
The problem , however , is that Western leaders , diplomats , and the media take the " apparently " in its first sense  as a way to avoid holding Israel to account for its actions .
For " apparently deliberate , " read " almost certainly accidental . "
That was why the best the UN Security Council could manage after a day and a half of deliberation was a weaselly statement of " shock and distress " at the killings , as though they were an act of God .
Our media are no less responsible for this evasiveness .
They make sure " we "  the publics of the West  never countenance the thought that a society like our own , one we are always being reminded is a democracy , could sink to the depths of inhumanity required to murder unarmed peacekeepers .
Who can be taken seriously challenging the Israeli foreign minister Tzipi Livni ’s assertion that " There will never be an [ Israeli ] army commander that will intentionally aim at civilians or UN soldiers [ sic ] " ?
Even the minority in the West who have started to fear that Israel is " apparently " slaughtering civilians across Lebanon or that it is " apparently " intending to make refugees of a million Lebanese must presumably shrink from the idea that Israel is also capable of killing unarmed UN monitors .
After all , our media insinuate , the two cases are not comparable .
There may be good reasons why Lebanese civilians need to suffer .
Let ’s not forget that they belong to a people ( or is it a race or , maybe , a religion ? ) that gave birth to Hezbollah .
" We " can cast aside our concerns for the moment and take it on trust that Israel has cause to kill the Lebanese or make them homeless .
Doubtless the justifications will emerge later , when we have lost interest in the " Lebanon crisis . "
We may never hear what those reasons were , but who can doubt that they exist ?
The " apparent " murder of four UN monitors , however , is a deeper challenge to our faith in our moral superiority , which is why that " apparently " is held on to as desperately as a talisman .
No civilized country could kill peacekeepers , especially ones drawn from our own societies , from Canada , Finland , and Austria .
That is the moral separation line that divides us from the terrorists .
Were that line to be erased , we would be no different from those whom we must fight .
An iconic image of this war that our media have managed to expunge from the official record but which keeps popping up in e-mail inboxes like a guilty secret is of young Israeli girls , lipsticked and nail - polished as if on their way to a party , drawing messages of death and hatred on the sides of the missiles about to be loaded on to army trucks and tanks .
In one , an out - of - focus soldier stands on a tank paternally watching over the girls as they address another death threat to Hezbollah ’s leader , Hassan Nasrallah .
Is this the truer face of Israeli society , even if it is the one we are never shown and refuse to believe in ?
And are " we " in the West hurtling down the same path ?
Driving through the Jewish city of Upper Nazareth this week , I realized how inured I am becoming to this triumphal militarism  and the racism that feeds it .
Nothing surprising about the posters of " We will win " on every hoarding .
But it takes me more than a few seconds to notice that the Magen David ambulance in front of me is flying a little national flag , the blue Star of David , from its window .
I have heard that American fire engines flew U.S. flags after 9/11 , but this somehow seems worse .
How is it possible for an ambulance , the embodiment of our neutral , civilized , universal , " Western , " humanitarian values , to fly a national flag , I think to myself ?
And does it make a difference that only a few months ago Magen David joined the International Committee of the Red Cross ?
Only slowly do my thoughts grow more disturbed : how many hospital administrators , doctors , and nurses have seen that ambulance arrive at their emergency departments and thought nothing of it ?
And is that the only Israeli ambulance flying the flag , or are many others doing the same ?
Later , the BBC TV news answers my question .
I see two ambulances with the same flags going to the front line to collect casualties .
Will others soon cross over the border into southern Lebanon , after it is " secured , " and will no one mention those little flags fluttering from the window ?
A psychologist tells me how upset she is about a meeting she attended a few days ago of the northern coordinating committee of her profession .
They were discussing how best to treat the shock and trauma suffered by Israeli children under the bombardment from Hezbollah .
The meeting concluded with an agreement that the psychologists would reassure the children with the statement : " The army is there to protect us . "
And so , the seeds of fascism are unthinkingly sown for another generation of children , children like our own .
No one agreed with my friend when she dissented , arguing that this was not the message to be telling impressionable minds , and that violence against the Other is not a panacea for our problems .
Parents , not soldiers , are responsible for protecting their children , she pointed out .
Tanks , planes , and guns bring only fear and more hatred , hatred that will one day return to haunt us .
The slow , gentle indoctrination continues day in , day out , reinforcing the idea among Israel ’s Jewish population that the army can do no wrong and that it needs no oversight , not even from politicians ( most of whom are former generals anyway , or like Prime Minister Ehud Olmert too frightened to stand up to the chiefs of staff if they wanted to ) .
" We will win . "
How do we know we will win ?
Because " the army is there to protect us . "
Add into the mix that faceless " Arab " enemy , those sub - beings , and you have a recipe for fascism  even if it is of the democratically elected variety .
The Israeli media , of course , are the key to providing the second half of that equation  or rather not providing it .
You can sit watching the main Israeli channels all day , flicking between channels 1 , 2 , and 10 , and not see a Lebanese face , apart from that of Hassan Nasrallah , the new Hitler .
I do n’t mean the charred faces of corpses , or the bandaged babies , or the amputees lying in hospital beds .
I mean any Lebanese faces .
Just as you almost never see a Palestinian face on Israeli TV unless they are the mob , disfigured with hatred as they hold aloft another martyr on his way to burial .
Lebanon only swings in to view on Israeli television through the black and white footage of an aerial gun sight , or through the long shot of a distant urban landscape seconds before it is " pulverized " by a dropped bomb .
The buildings crumble , flames shoot up , clouds of dust billow into the air .
Another shot of arcade - game adrenaline .
The humanitarian stories exist , but they do not concern Lebanon .
Animal welfare societies plead on behalf of the dogs and cats left alone to face the rocket fire on deserted Kiryat Shmona , just as they did before for foxes and deer when Israel began building its mammoth walls of concrete and steel across their migration routes in the West Bank , walls that are also imprisoning , unseen , hundreds of thousands of Palestinians .
The rest of the coverage is dedicated to Israeli army spokespeople , including the national heartthrob Miri Regev , and media " commentators " and " analysts . "
Who are these people ?
They are from the same pool of former military intelligence and security service officers who once did this job in the closed rooms of army HQ but now wallow in the limelight .
One favored pundit is even subtitled " Expert on psychological warfare against Hassan Nasrallah . "
And who are the presenters and anchors who interview them ?
The other day an aging expert on Apache helicopters interrupted his interviewer irritatedly to tell him his question was stupid .
" We were in the army together and both know the answer .
Do n’t play dumb . "
It was a rare reminder that these anchors too are just soldiers in suits .
One of the most popular , Ehud Yaari of Channel 2 , barely conceals his military credentials as he condones yet more violence against the Lebanese or , if he can be deflected for a moment , the people of Gaza .
That is what comes of having a " citizen army , " where teenagers learn to use a gun before they can drive and men do reserve duty until their late 40s .
It means every male teacher , professor , psychologist , and journalist thinks as a soldier because that is what he has been for most of his life .
Israel is not unique , far from it , though it is in a darker place , and has been for some time , than " we " in the West can fully appreciate .
It is a mirror of what our own societies are capable of , despite our democratic values .
It shows how a cult of victimhood makes one heartless and cruel , and how racism can be repackaged as civilized values .
Maybe those UN monitors , with their lookout post above the battlefield where Israel wants to use any means it can to destroy Hezbollah and Lebanese civilians who get in the way , had to be removed simply because they are a nuisance , a restraint when Israel needs to get on with the job of asserting " our " values .
Maybe Israel does not want the scrutiny of peacekeepers as it fights our war on terror for us .
Maybe it feared that the monitors ’ reports might help to give back to the Lebanese , even to Hezbollah , their faces , their history , their suffering .
And , if we are honest , Israel is not alone .
How many of us want the Arabs to remain faceless so we can keep believing we are the victims of a new ideology that wants only our evisceration , just as the " Red Indians " once supposedly wanted our scalps ?
How many many of us believe that our values demand that we fall in behind a new world order in which Arab deaths are not real deaths because " they " are not fully human ?
And how many of us believe that deliberate barbarity , at least when we do it , is only " apparently " a crime against humanity ?
HINDUS CONSIDER it sacrilegious to eat meat from cows , so when a Danish supermarket ran a sale on beef and veal last fall , Hindus everywhere reacted with outrage .
India recalled its ambassador to Copenhagen , and Danish flags were burned in Calcutta , Bombay , and Delhi .
A Hindu mob in Sri Lanka severely beat two employees of a Danish - owned firm , and demonstrators in Nepal chanted : '' War on Denmark !
Death to Denmark !
" In many places , shops selling Dansk china or Lego toys were attacked by rioters , and two Danish embassies were firebombed .
It did n't happen , of course .
Hindus may consider it odious to use cows as food , but they do not resort to boycotts , threats , and violence when non-Hindus eat hamburger or steak .
They do not demand that everyone abide by the strictures of Hinduism and avoid words and deeds that Hindus might find upsetting .
The same is true of Christians , Jews , Buddhists , Mormons :
They do n't lash out in violence when their religious sensibilities are offended .
They certainly do n't expect their beliefs to be immune from criticism , mockery , or dissent .
But radical Muslims do .
The current uproar over cartoons of the Muslim prophet Mohammed published in a Danish newspaper illustrates yet again the fascist intolerance that is at the heart of radical Islam .
Jyllands - Posten , Denmark 's largest daily , commissioned the cartoons to make a point about freedom of speech .
It was protesting the climate of intimidation that had made it impossible for a Danish author to find an illustrator for his children 's book about Mohammed .
No artist would agree to illustrate the book for fear of being harmed by Muslim extremists .
Appalled by this self - censorship , Jyllands - Posten invited Danish artists to submit drawings of Mohammed , and published the 12 it received .
Most of the pictures are tame to the point of dullness , especially compared to the biting editorial cartoons that routinely appear in US and European newspapers .
A few of them link Mohammed to Islamist terrorism -- one depicts him with a bomb in his turban , while a second shows him in Heaven , pleading with newly arrived suicide terrorists : '' Stop , stop !
We have run out of virgins ! "
Others focus on the threat to free speech :
In one , a sweating artist sits at his drawing board , nervously sketching Mohammed , while glancing over his shoulder to make sure he 's not being watched .
That anything so mild could trigger a reaction so crazed -- riots , death threats , kidnappings , flag - burnings -- speaks volumes about the chasm that separates the values of the civilized world from those in too much of the Islamic world .
Freedom of the press , the marketplace of ideas , the right to skewer sacred cows : Militant Islam knows none of this .
And if the jihadis get their way , it will be swept aside everywhere by the censorship and intolerance of sharia .
Here and there , some brave Muslim voices have cried out against the book - burners .
The Jordanian newspaper Shihan published three of the cartoons .
'' Muslims of the world , be reasonable , " implored Shihan 's editor , Jihad al - Momani , in an editorial .
'' What brings more prejudice against Islam -- these caricatures or pictures of a hostage - taker slashing the throat of his victim in front of the cameras ? "
But within hours Momani was out of a job , fired by the paper 's owners after the Jordanian government threatened legal action .
He was n't the only editor sacked last week .
In Paris , Jacques LeFranc of the daily France Soir was also fired after running the Mohammed cartoons .
The paper 's owner , an Egyptian Copt named Raymond Lakah , issued a craven and Orwellian statement offering LeFranc 's head as a gesture of '' respect for the intimate beliefs and convictions of every individual . "
But the France Soir staff defended their decision to publish the drawings in a stalwart editorial .
'' The best way to fight against censorship is to prevent censorship from happening , " they wrote .
'' A fundamental principle guaranteeing democracy and secular society is under threat .
To say nothing is to retreat . "
Across the continent , nearly two dozen other newspapers have joined in defending that principle .
While Islamist clerics proclaim an ' ' international day of anger " or declare that '' the war has begun , " leading publications in Norway , France , Italy , Spain , Holland , Germany , Switzerland , Hungary , and the Czech Republic have reprinted the Danish cartoons .
But there has been no comparable show of backbone in America , where ( as of Friday ) only the New York Sun has had the fortitude to the run some of the drawings .
Make no mistake :
This story is not going away , and neither is the Islamofascist threat .
The freedom of speech we take for granted is under attack , and it will vanish if it is not bravely defended .
Today the censors may be coming for some unfunny Mohammed cartoons , but tomorrow it is your words and ideas they will silence .
Like it or not , we are all Danes now .

June 11 , 2002 | Nathan Myhrvold has been doing the rounds recently .
One month after he was interviewed by Bio·IT World , there he was again , popping up in Technology Review .
In that interview , he made one particularly provocative statement , that heavy reliance on relational databases like Oracle , SQL , and DB2 within the field of proteomics and genomics is " completely boneheaded . " | Nathan Myhrvold has been doing the rounds recently .
One month after he was interviewed by , there he was again , popping up in .
In that interview , he made one particularly provocative statement , that heavy reliance on relational databases like Oracle , SQL , and DB2 within the field of proteomics and genomics is " completely boneheaded . "
Myhrvold did not elaborate , and as an entrepreneur he might not want to comment further .
But let us suppose that his assessment is largely correct .
What are some of the implications ?
Until now , the use of relational databases within genomics and proteomics was treated as a given , with no one prepared to question whether this was an appropriate use of technology .
That may be about to change .
If an approach really is boneheaded , it will produce frustration for life science researchers , IT managers , and database designers and administrators alike .
This frustration will take multiple forms , from being unable to use the data structure to address important questions , to being unable to design data structures that capture the most critical elements of knowledge produced by experimentation , to managing data types that are not well - suited to the relational database structure .
Are these frustrations widespread , or will life scientists rise to defend their use of relational databases for genomic and proteomic research ?
If Myhrvold is correct , the growing frustration with relational databases will spark a major new market opportunity .
A significant change in how genomic and proteomic data are managed could provide room for new vendors to carve out a profitable niche .
We might see startups emerging from academia with truly novel and elegant approaches to managing genomic and proteomic data .
Independent software vendors would develop new tools and approaches .
Perhaps biotechs and pharmas would create their own alternative .
In this latter scenario , it is hard to know whether the innovation would remain hidden and deployed by its creators as a competitive advantage , or would come to market as a licensable technology .
I suspect that a truly new approach to managing genomic and proteomic data will come from a company that can wholeheartedly proselytize for a new approach without the baggage of the old .
But as is often the case , the startup that figures it out probably wo n't survive intact to enjoy the long - term fruit of its labor .
The entrenched relational database management system vendors will reverse - engineer the approach or simply acquire the startup that proves successful .
Do n't Send Flowers
Yet
Because the overall market for relational databases is so much larger than genomics and proteomics , or even all of the life sciences , it is unlikely that large database vendors will invest heavily in developing a better set of tools purely for managing genomic and proteomic data .
It is more likely that they will partner with the developers of new solutions to deploy the new tools on top of relational databases , and thus secure their place as a component in the new solution rather than lose that business .
Of course , if relational databases are as " completely boneheaded " as Myhrvold contends , then it will be much better to start building tools from the ground up rather than developing them as a layer on top of relational databases .
Assuming that genomic and proteomic researchers start adopting those new data management and analysis tools at a rapid rate , how disruptive would this scenario be to the database market in the life sciences ?
Although no vendor likes to lose share to a new technology , a substantial market for relational databases would most likely remain in other functional areas of life science research , such as clinical trials .
Even for genomics and proteomics , it is too soon to count relational databases out of the game .
Pharmaceutical and biotech labs have substantial investments in relational databases as their core data management technology .
Those companies have spent millions to build customized applications on top of their relational databases and invested thousands of hours in learning to use these systems .
Sometimes careers are wrapped up in the continuation of these legacy systems .
Relational databases have proved to be flexible and useful tools .
Any new approach — no matter how elegant — will face significant barriers to adoption .
But assuming Myhrvold is indeed correct , what kind of data management and analysis tools might be more appropriate ?
Systems - oriented tools such as GenMAPP , which allows the user to combine a visual template of what is known and predicted about gene regulatory circuits or metabolic pathways and overlay that circuit diagram with gene expression data ?
Although an interesting visualization tool , this does n't seem to require a change to the underlying data model .
Perhaps one of the approaches of companies offering data integration ?
Not likely , since most of those vendors take the relational database as a given .
Or , is it a matter of borrowing and adapting tools already deployed in other fields ?
In this case , interdisciplinary research centers are in the best position to develop the next generation of tools for proteomics and genomics .
Although I have raised far more questions than I have answered , I do predict that relational databases will be used in proteomic and genomic research for years to come .
But competition and fresh approaches are always a welcome addition to any field .

My Turn is Low End Mac 's column for reader - submitted articles .
It 's your turn to share your thoughts on all things Mac ( or iPhone , iPod , etc. ) and write for the Mac web .
Email your submission to Dan Knight .
Many low - end Mac users lament Apple 's choice of NeXTstep over the BeOS as the foundation of Mac OS X .
Many arguments have been made on technical merits , and many blame the demise of Be , Inc. , on Apple and Microsoft .
The following is an in - depth look at the demise of Be and reflections on Apple 's choice of NeXT .
Hopefully this will debunk some common ideas about BeOS and lay this debate to rest .
The spectacular failure of BeOS is often blamed on external forces , for example , Microsoft muscling them out of the marketplace .
Supposedly , the incredible sophistication of BeOS struck fear into the hearts and minds of its competitors .
Microsoft pressured OEMs to not bundle BeOS on their systems .
Big Deal .
Microsoft has done this with every competing operating system .
Is it fair ?
No. Did Microsoft willfully and purposefully destroy Be ? Probably not .
Be made several missteps common to innovators ; furthermore , they misread the marketplace and developed an unsustainable business model .
Let us break down some of their mistakes .
Classic Mistakes
These are mistakes that have been made over and over again by companies and should have been avoided .
1. Not-quite - Unix
BeOS had a powerful command line and Unix - like underpinnings that could compile and run POSIX compliant software .
Every Unix - like operating system has failed in the marketplace except Linux ( which is free , and for all intents and purposes it is Unix ) .
The Amiga Operating System was developed with similar goals in mind , and that particular operating system withered and died as well .
Being able to compile POSIX compliant software is not a marketable advantage ( even Windows NT can do it ) .
The lesson : Unless you are actually going to include full Unix services and compatibility , like Linux or the Mac OS X , being Unix - like is no advantage .
2 . Please the developers
BeOS was designed by geeks for geeks ( we will revisit when discussing marketing mistakes ) .
Designing an OS with fantastic underpinnings does not sell software .
Look at the success of Windows 95 and , for that matter , Mac OS 9 .
A 64 - bit database - driven file system and pervasively threaded libraries on top of an efficient kernel may please developers and geeks , but it does n't sell software .
A software company looks at how much money they can make developing for a certain platform , not how easy it is to write great software .
In order for BeOS to succeed as a platform , a lot of volunteer effort and / or some sort of industry partnerships were needed .
While there was an enthusiastic BeOS community , Linux surely consumed most of the enthusiast developers .
Be did not get solid industry partners until it was far too late .
The lesson :
You do n't attract developers and partners with superior technology unless you show them how they will profit from it .
3. The BeBox
Proprietary hardware is difficult enough to develop , especially if you do not have established customers .
IBM can make huge profits from its expensive proprietary mainframes because they have established customers and an established market .
Likewise , Apple can make profits from its psuedo - proprietary hardware because they have a base of users and a place in the market .
Consider the fact that the BeBox 's main differentiators from other computers were dual - processors ( expensive , even if you use cheap processors ) and a Geek - port , it is not hard to see how the hardware side of Be failed .
How much capital did they lose developing it ?
The lesson :
You do n't make money off anything unless there is a market for it or you create a market for it .
This is even truer of proprietary hardware .
4 . The GUI will save us
Faith in a slick user interface is an easy mistake to make .
If it is fairly easy to navigate through files and the windows look pretty , then all is well .
This is just plain wrong .
No matter how good a GUI looks or how responsive it is , it will not attract and retain users unless it is an enabler .
The early Mac OS was not flashy at all with stark black and white icons , but it enabled users to do things on a desktop computer they were unable to do before .
By the time a polished iteration of BeOS was available , Windows 98 and Mac OS 8.x were already available - and much better at connecting to the Internet , sharing files , and printing , tasks that users routinely complete .
The lesson : A slick GUI wo n't save the operating system .
( Even Apple had to re-learn this one after releasing Mac OS X - iTunes and the other bundled apps are all enabling tools to attract users . )
Business and Marketing Mistakes
These are mistakes that Be made that illustrate poor planning and a poor understanding of the market .
1. Market it to Geeks
A machine with a configurable and user - programmable expansion port ?
A 64 - bit database driven file system ?
An advanced kernel ?
These are not selling points unless you already have a market .
Until then , they are merely a foundation for future releases .
Using these attributes of the operating system to sell it ( to geeks ) is perhaps one of the all - time worst business decisions in history .
There may have been some logic in thinking that the geeks would then develop great software for it , but it is hardly a profit - generating business plan .
It also runs counter to thirty years of making computers easier to use and understand .
Be eventually expanded their marketing focus but continued to use the technical excellence of their OS as their core selling point ; it was too little too late .
The lesson here is quite simple ( if blunt ) :
If your target market consists of users who wish to program their own expansion ports , you are bound to bleed money .
2 . What 's a Server ?
BeOS debuted in 1995 , which was also marked the beginning of the Internet 's meteoric rise .
BeOS was designed to be a personal computer operating system .
Unfortunately , at the time of its debut and the years thereafter , the real growth was in server operating systems .
Furthermore , the idea that a personal computer operating system should share a code base with the server operating system became prevalent at this time .
This was largely due to Microsoft trying to move users to NT - based technologies and hardware companies who loved the idea of forcing resource - intensive server " plumbing " into the desktop ( which would drive their hardware sales ) .
While BeOS was efficient , it lacked the network / server - oriented features of Unix and even Windows NT .
Be was basically caught with their pants down .
Two years later , BeOS was retrofitted with some server tools and paraded around trade shows running the Apache Web server software .
But again , it was too little too late .
The lesson :
If you do n't correctly forecast the market , you are forced to spend resources reacting instead of selling products .
There may have been no way for
Be to predict this ; you win some , you loose some , as they say .
3 . What 's that Internet thingy ?
BeOS also missed the boat on the Internet phenomenon .
The Web browsers were usually one or more generations behind their counterparts on the Mac and PC with very few third - party plugins supported .
Internet connectivity was added seemingly as an afterthought .
But BeOS could play eight streaming QuickTime videos !
Who cares ?
The Web browser , and , to some extent , America Online , became the defining personal computing applications of the 90s .
Instead of building a decent browser , Be reverse engineered QuickTime .
The lesson :
If you do n't have a good browser , you do n't have a chance on the desktop .
Period .
Apple Drops a Bomb on Be
Most BeOS aficionados are convinced that Apple chose NeXTstep as the core of Mac OS X because Steve Jobs was key in making the decision .
Apple is first and foremost a business , and if Apple could have made more money buying BeOS and retrofitting it as Mac OS X , they would have .
This leads to one of the most contentious BeOS myths ; that BeOS was a simple drag - and - drop replacement for the Mac OS .
Many
Be enthusiasts believe this because classic Mac OS applications could already be run from within BeOS .
It sounds plausible .
However , BeOS needed serious usability engineering .
The operating system could , as previously mentioned , run eight QuickTime video streams at once , but it did n't enable the user to do very many useful things .
All of the tuning and elegance was poured into features transparent to the user , like the file system .
This idea also rests on the assumption that developers would port their applications to BeOS .
Because BeOS had no " Carbon " layer , developers would have had to essentially develop two versions of their software for the Mac platform , one legacy and one BeOS - based .
Because the graphics subsystem and GUI were substantially different between the two , as were the Mac OS toolbox and the BeOS development APIs , it would have been like writing the application for a whole new platform .
Furthermore , there were n't a lot of experienced BeOS developers in the field to work on porting applications .
Developers simply did n't want to do this , and Apple understood .
Whether it chose
Be or NeXT , Apple would still have had to write a " Carbon " layer to encourage development of applications for the new operating system .
This would allow developers to write one program that runs on both platforms .
Since both operating systems would need a " Carbon " layer and a lot of usability engineering and retooling , the decision probably came down to three points .
There was and is a wealth of highly experienced developers who are familiar with Unix .
There also was and is a smaller but active and experienced subset of NeXTstep ( Cocoa ) developers .
While not as technically elegant as BeOS , having trained talent available to port your applications and debug your OS is great advantage in favor of NeXT .
Unix already had an established and proven core of network services and server capabilities .
Choosing NeXT gives
Apple the option of seriously competing in the server arena , if it so chooses .
BeOS would have to be tested , validated , and developed for some time to achieve the maturity of BSD in this area .
The most cynical reason of all , of course , is profit .
Which operating system will drive your hardware sales - the light and efficient operating system that can play eight QuickTime video streams on a G3 or the huge , big-iron , Unix - based operating system ?
Apple is first and foremost a hardware company .
The most useful advantages BeOS offered the end user were memory and space efficiency .
By the time Apple gave up on Copland , hard drives were already in the multi-gigabyte range and standard memory was hovering around 32 MB .
The advantage of a small memory footprint had diminished significantly .
The small size and memory footprint were no advantage at all , as Apple wished to drive sales of new hardware .
Other Thoughts
It might surprise you that BeOS is one of my all time favorite operating systems , right up there with the Amiga OS .
I am , after all , a geek .
While I applaud Apple for choosing NeXT as the core of Mac OS X , they certainly are not without fault .
The ten - year anniversary of the Power Mac is nearly upon us .
I remember when System 7 debuted we were promised a blazingly fast , fully native operating system that would take advantage of the PowerPC processor .
Well , a decade later the promise is broken .
My Power Mac 7100 will never get such an operating system from Apple , despite their promises .
But the record needed to be set straight about BeOS .
To sum it up , contrast the summaries below - one reflecting the opinion of a BeOS zealot , the other reflecting the opinion of this author .
The truth is yours to decide .
Zealot : BeOS died because Microsoft and Apple worked feverishly against it .
BeOS was so advanced , they were worried about their own markets .
BeOS was so elegant and fast , it could run eight QuickTime video streams at once .
It hardly took up any hard drive space or system memory , and it was rock - solid stable .
Steve Jobs cheated
Be out of becoming Mac OS X .
He just had to have his other baby , NeXTstep , as the foundation of Mac OS X .
Author : BeOS had technically brilliant underpinnings that allowed the user to do amazingly useless things like play eight QuickTime video streams at once and search their hard drive files in a very intelligent way .
It was not very good at printing or Web surfing , and it did not enable the user to accomplish anything new .
It was an unproven server platform , an unproven Java platform , and there was a dearth of experienced BeOS programmers .
Apple made a wise choice in choosing NeXT .
BeOS was n't killed by the big boys ; it was slowly choked through a series of monumentally bad decisions , most of which had been made by other companies in the past and could have been avoided .
It was a great operating system in all the wrong ways , and someone at Be should have realized this .

Washington --
House Republican leaders blocked a move Thursday by an increasingly emboldened Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi to launch a broad investigation into the Bush administration 's handling of the war in Iraq .
" I think it brings shame to this House to be engaged in a coverup when it comes to revealing what 's happening in Iraq , " said Pelosi , D - San Francisco , after her " privileged " motion was ruled out of order .
She appealed that decision and lost on 220 - 191 vote , with only one Democrat voting with the Republican majority .
Pelosi has suffered similar setbacks when she has introduced anti-war resolutions on the floor of the House .
But Democrats in the House and Senate are stepping up their criticism of President Bush 's handling of the war and of what they see as the Republican Congress ' failure to effectively oversee the administration 's war effort .
But the Democrats in Congress remain divided over the war , just as they were in October 2002 when Congress gave Bush the authority to attack Iraq .
Some want to withdraw American forces now , others want to see a plan for a gradual troop withdrawal , and others say even that step would help the insurgents who are attacking Americans and Iraqis in Iraq .
Still , Democrats believe it 's smart politics to focus on the increasingly unpopular war as the president 's approval rate drops , the U.S. death toll rises in Iraq , and the administration is saddled with the indictment of Vice President Dick Cheney 's top aide , Lewis " Scooter " Libby , in connection with a White House effort to discredit a leading war critic .
Pelosi's move Thursday came just two days after Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada used Senate rules to force a closed session to discuss allegations the Bush administration used doctored intelligence to make the case for invading Iraq in 2003 .
His move infuriated Republican leaders , who called it a political stunt , but it produced results .
Within two hours , Senate leaders agreed to give a bipartisan group until Nov. 14 to report back on the status of an ongoing Intelligence Committee investigation into pre-war intelligence .
A spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert , R - Ill. , dismissed Pelosi 's effort .
" The minority leader is a few days late and plenty of politics short , " Ron Bonjean told the Associated Press .
" She 's trying to grab cheap headlines after she saw the Senate Democratic leader attempt to . "
Pelosi acknowledged to reporters that her 202 - member House caucus was divided .
" There are different views within our caucus , and I 'm trying to accommodate those , " she said .
The House minority has far fewer parliamentary ploys it can use than in the Senate .
Privately , Democrats said maneuvers like Thursday 's introduction of a privileged resolution was designed to gain press attention , show Democrats that Pelosi was acting on their concerns about the war and embarrass Republicans .
Pelosi recognized that House Republicans would never vote for a resolution that " condemns their refusal to conduct oversight of an executive branch controlled by the same party . "
No Republican took the floor to speak against the resolution .
Another possible House fight looms over a resolution that would bar " cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment " of prisoners in U.S. custody anywhere in the world .
The proposal would instruct House conferees to accept such wording -- vigorously opposed by Bush -- already included in the Senate version of the defense appropriations bill .
The Senate last month approved 90 - 9 the anti-torture proposal sponsored by Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz .
The White House has threatened a Bush veto if the provision is included in the final bill and Vice President Dick Cheney and CIA director Porter Goss have personally lobbied McCain to remove the CIA from his proposal .
McCain rebuffed them .
The administration has repeatedly denied that it countenances any torture of prisoners detained in the war on terrorism or in Iraq and Afghanistan .
But reports from Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq , Guantanamo Bay in Cuba and Afghanistan have raised doubts .
Those were compounded this week by a story in the Washington Post reporting the CIA had operated secret prisons in Eastern Europe and elsewhere since the 2001 terrorist attacks .
The McCain provision , whose chief House sponsors include Rep. Ellen Tauscher , D - Walnut Creek , was expected to be taken up in the House Thursday .
But it has been postponed by House leaders , perhaps until just before the expected Thanksgiving recess .
" Cruel , inhuman , and degrading treatment violates U.S. treaty obligations and undermines our moral authority , " Tauscher wrote in a letter to her House colleagues written with three co-authors , including two Republicans .
" It has also been shown to be ineffective at eliciting actionable intelligence . "
EPA scientist says agency hid dangers at ground zero from first responders , others Brian Beutler
Published : Friday August 25 , 2006 Print This Email This A scientist at the Environmental Protection Agency has written a letter to Senator Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) and other members of the New York congressional delegation blasting the EPA for hiding dangerous toxins from Ground Zero workers in the aftermath of 9/11 , RAW STORY has learned .
The letter , written by Dr. Cate Jenkins and obtained by RAW STORY , claims that EPA - funded research on the toxicity of breathable alkaline dust at the site falsified pH results  to make the substance appear benign , when it was , in reality , corrosive enough to cause first responders and other workers in lower Manhattan to later lose pulmonary functions and , in some cases , to die .
Jenkins writes : " These falsifications directly contributed not only to emergency personnel and citizens not taking adequate precautions to prevent exposures , but also prevented the subsequent correct diagnosis of the causative agents responsible for the pulmonary symptoms .
Thus , appropriate treatment was prevented or misdirected , and loss of life and permanent disability undoubtedly resulted . "
Jenkins has loudly criticized the office in the past foramong other malfeasances improperly handling evidence that the World Trade Center disaster site was a major health hazard .
The letter , as acquired by RAW STORY , follows :
The legal opinions proclaimed by Islamic scholars , known as fatwas , have proliferated in the Muslim world since the 1980s .
The growth in fatwas - some of them contradictory - has led to debate over who can legitimately issue them .
As part of a government drive to eliminate frivolous fatwas , the Saudi newspaper Al Watan recently published one such edict setting out new rules for football .
We publish an edited translation below .
In the name of God the merciful and benevolent :
1. International terminology that heretics use , such as " foul , " " penalty " , " corner , " " goal " , " out " and others , should be abandoned and not said .
Whoever says them should be punished and ejected from the game .
2 . Do not call " foul " and stop the game if someone falls and sprains a hand or foot or the ball touches his hand , and do not give a yellow or red card to whoever was responsible for the injury or tackle .
Instead , it should be adjudicated according to Sharia rulings concerning broken bones and injuries .
3 . Do not follow the heretics , the Jews , the Christians and especially evil America regarding the number of players .
Do not play with 11 people .
Add to this number or decrease it .
4 . Play in your regular clothes or your pyjamas or something like that , but not coloured shorts and numbered T - shirts , because shorts and T - shirts are not Muslim clothing .
Rather , they are heretical and western clothing , so beware of imitating their fashion .
5 . If you have fulfilled these conditions and intend to play soccer , play to strengthen the body in order better to struggle in the way of God on high and to prepare the body for when it is called to jihad .
Soccer is not for passing time or the thrill of so - called victory .
6 . Do not play in two halves .
Rather , play in one half or three halves in order to completely differentiate yourselves from the heretics , the corrupted and the disobedient .
7 . If neither of you beats the other , or " wins " , as it is called , and neither puts the leather between the posts , do not add extra time or penalties .
Instead leave the field , because winning with extra time and penalty kicks is the pinnacle of imitating heretics and international rules .
8 . Young crowds should not gather to watch when you play because if you are there for the sake of sports and strengthening your bodies as you claimed , why would people watch you ?
You should make them join your physical fitness and jihad preparation , or you should say : " Go proselytise and seek out morally reprehensible acts in the markets and the press and leave us to our physical fitness . "
9 . You should spit in the face of whoever puts the ball between the posts or uprights and then runs in order to get his friends to follow him and hug him like players in America or France do , and you should punish him , for what is the relationship between celebrating , hugging and kissing and the sports that you are practising ?
10 .
You should use two posts instead of three pieces of wood or steel that you erect in order to put the ball between them , meaning that you should remove the crossbar in order not to imitate the heretics and in order to be entirely distinct from the soccer system 's despotic international rules .
11 . Do not do what is called " substitution , " that is , taking the place of someone who has fallen , because this is a practice of the heretics in America and elsewhere .
WASHINGTON , Sept. 19 - A senior White House budget official who resigned abruptly last week was arrested Monday on charges of lying to investigators and obstructing a federal inquiry involving Jack Abramoff , the Republican lobbyist who has been under scrutiny by the Justice Department for more than a year .
The arrest of the official , David H. Safavian , head of procurement policy at the Office of Management and Budget , was the first to result from the wide - ranging corruption investigation of Mr. Abramoff , once among the most powerful and best - paid lobbyists in Washington and a close friend of Representative Tom DeLay , the House majority leader .
According to court papers , Mr. Safavian , 38 , is accused of lying about assistance that he gave Mr. Abramoff in his earlier work at the General Services Administration , where he was chief of staff from 2002 to 2004 , and about an expensive golf trip he took with the lobbyist to Scotland in August 2002 .
Mr. Abramoff , a former lobbying partner of Mr. Safavian , was indicted last month in Florida on unrelated federal fraud charges .
He is not identified by name in the court papers involving Mr. Safavian 's arrest .
But " Lobbyist A " in an F.B.I. affidavit could only be Mr. Abramoff based on descriptive details in the documents filed in the Federal District Court here .
Bill and Melinda Gates have come off the political fence and publicly backed key causes of Aids campaigners , criticising the abstinence policies beloved of the US government and calling for more rights for women and help for sex workers .
Making the keynote speech of the opening session of the 16th International Aids Conference in Toronto , on Sunday , the Microsoft billionaire and his wife , who have previously largely confined themselves to discussing and funding non-political scientific research , spoke with passion and commitment about the social changes necessary to stop the spread of HIV / Aids .
The " ABC " programme - abstinence , be faithful and use a condom - had saved many lives , Mr Gates told the conference of more than 20,000 delegates .
But , departing from his government 's line , he added that for many at the highest risk for infection , ABC had its limits .
" Abstinence is often not an option for poor women and girls , who have no choice but to marry at an early age .
Being faithful will not protect a woman whose partner is not faithful .
And using condoms is not a decision that a woman can make by herself ; it depends on a man .
" We need to put the power to prevent HIV in the hands of women .
This is true whether the woman is a faithful married mother of small children or a sex worker trying to scrape out a living in a slum .
No matter where she lives or what she does , a woman should never need her partner 's permission to save her own life . "
The Gates Foundation is funding research into microbicides - gels or barrier creams a woman can use before sex that will kill HIV .
An update on the research will take place during the week - long conference .
Mrs Gates called for an end to the stigma affecting those with HIV .
" Stigma makes it easier for political leaders to stand in the way of saving lives , " she said , in a direct attack on some African leaders whose reservations over condoms are encouraged by the US Christian fundamentalist right 's belief that abstinence from sex is the answer .
" In some countries with widespread Aids epidemics , leaders have declared the distribution of condoms immoral , ineffective or both .
Some have argued that condoms do not protect against HIV , but in fact help spread it .
This is a serious obstacle to ending Aids .
In the fight against Aids , condoms save lives .
If you oppose the distribution of condoms , something is more important to you than saving lives . "
She also criticised African governments whose officials accompanied the couple on their fact - finding trips , such as the recent one in July , up until the point that they went to see sex workers .
" At that point , it can become too politically difficult to stay with us and our official hosts often leave , " she said .
I ’ve been reading ( like everyone else ) “ Game of Shadows , ” the book about Barry Bonds and steroids and the BALCO scandal .
It ’s quite a remarkable feat of reporting .
What striking about it is something that you might not notice unless you ’ve journalist — which is the absence of obvious lawyering .
If you ever write something even remotely critical of someone , the lawyers invariably go through it , and before you know it your prose is strewn with “ apparently ” and “ allegedly , ” and “ according to ” and so - so “ denies . . . ”
There ’s almost none of that in “ Game of Shadows , ” which is amazing considering the book accuses , in devastating detail , several of the biggest names in sports — Barry Bonds , Gary Sheffield , Tim Montgomery and Marion Jones , among others — of being serious steroid users .
The two writers — Mark Fainaru - Wada and Lance Williams — must have had really impeccable sourcing .
When the book first came out , and several baseball writers predicted that Bonds ’ reputation was destroyed and his chances are getting in the Hall of Fame seriously damaged , I thought they were overstating things .
Now I ’m not so sure .
“ Game of Shadows ” is a death sentence for Bonds .
More to the point , it ’s impossible to read the book and accept that Bonds has a right either to the single season home - run record or , assuming he keeps playing , the career home run mark .
So what should we do ?
I think we need to set the bar a little higher for record - setters .
Justin Wolfers , an economist at Penn , just did a study analyzing college basketball scores , concluding that there is ample statistical evidence for point - shaving in about five percent of college games .
Steven Levitt ( I know , I know .
I ’m obsessed with him ) has done the same kind of work on student test scores .
Forensic economics look at large data sets and draw surprisingly sophisticated inferences about behavior and intention .
I think we should loose the forensic economists on all record - setters , and require that athletes pass a statistical plausibility test in the wake of their achievements .
Obvious example :
Florence Griffiths Joyner , in 1988 .
Before that year , her best times in the hundred meters and the two hundred meters were , respectively , 10.96 and 21.96 .
In 1988 , at the advanced ( for a sprinter ) age of 28 , a suddenly huskier FloJo ran 10.49 and 21.34 , times that no runner since has even come close to equaling .
At the time , people in the track world just rolled their eyes .
But since FloJo never failed a drug test , there was nothing they could do .
Well , there is something we can do .
We can bring in the forensic economists — and any statistical analysis of the career marks of world class sprinters would have told us that marginally world - class 28 year old do not , in the absence of some kind of help , suddenly turn into the greatest runners the world has ever seen .
Bonds falls into the same category .
From the moment he started his late career surge , everyone who knew anything about baseball suspected mischief .
“ Game of Shadows ” points out that Bonds had the second , ninth and tenth greatest offensive season in baseball history at the ages of 36 , 37 , and 39 respectively — and the average age of everyone else on that list ( Gehrig , Foxx , Ruth and Hornsby ) is 27 .
No one — no one — turns himself into one of the greatest hitters of all time in his late 30’s .
His home run record should have been denied as statistically implausible .
Will raising the bar this way mean we occasionally deny a genuine record ?
It ’s certainly possible .
Bob Beamon jumped 29 ft , 2.5 inches at the Mexico City Olympics , and had never jumped more than 27 ft , 3 inches before that , and never again jumped more than 27 feet .
No one has ever doubted that Beamon was clean .
But it ’s a totally weird performance .
On the other hand , it was at altitude .
Because of the difficulty in hitting the board , long jump performances are highly variable .
And the effect of drug enhancement is sufficiently long - lived , that a single anomalous performance in an otherwise quiet career is more statistically plausible than a string of closely - linked anomalous performances in an otherwise quiet career .
FloJo had a fantastic year in 1988 , which is why she raised so many eyebrows .
She was n’t Beamon .
She was Bonds .
I think if we ’re smart about it , we can learn to distinguish the fluke performances from the phony performances .
One obvious objection to this idea is that we have a tradition of presuming people innocent until proven guilty , and prima facia statistical tests violate that .
But the presumption of innocence is a legal principle .
We ’re dealing with sports records here , and it seems reasonable , particularly in this day and age of advanced athletic chemistry , to ask a bit more of record holders .

The Supreme Court yesterday substantially diminished Americans ' right to privacy in their own homes .
The rule that police officers must " knock and announce " themselves before entering a private home is a venerable one , and a well - established part of Fourth Amendment law .
But President Bush 's two recent Supreme Court appointments have now provided the votes for a 5 - 4 decision eviscerating this rule .
This decision should offend anyone , liberal or conservative , who worries about the privacy rights of ordinary Americans .
The case arose out of the search of Booker T. Hudson 's home in Detroit in 1998 .
The police announced themselves but did not knock , and after waiting a few seconds , entered his home and seized drugs and a gun .
There is no dispute that the search violated the knock - and - announce rule .
The question in the case was what to do about it .
Mr. Hudson wanted the evidence excluded at his trial .
That is precisely what should have happened .
Since 1914 , the Supreme Court has held that , except in rare circumstances , evidence seized in violation of the Constitution cannot be used .
The exclusionary rule has sometimes been criticized for allowing criminals to go free just because of police error .
But as the court itself recognized in that 1914 case , if this type of evidence were admissible , the Fourth Amendment " might as well be stricken . "
Light Blue Optics Demonstrates Matchbox - sized PVPro™ Projector Evaluation Kit
Light Blue Optics Ltd ( LBO ) has developed a revolutionary technology for miniature laser projectors dubbed PVPro™ .
Today they announced their latest demonstrator unit , which is only 3.78 cubic inches in volume , and is similar in size and shape to a typical matchbox .
Projectors based on PVPro technology can be used to display images from a range of mobile devices , including laptop computers , personal media players like the video iPod , digital cameras and even mobile phones .
LBO has developed unique laser - based projection technology , which uses computational algorithms and novel optical techniques to allow miniature lasers to display video images in real - time using the diffractive nature of laser light .
This overcomes the size limitation of conventional projection techniques , allowing projectors to be smaller than ever before .
Understand that there is no glass , no prisms , NO MOVING PARTS , and no need for fans to provide heat dissipation .
In addition , it runs on less than 1.5W at full power and less than 350 mW while displaying typical video images ( 50 % average pixel amplitude .
There is also an infinite focus , meaning that no matter how close or far away , there are no optics to adjust for a clear picture .
The latest monochrome ' micro- mini ' version represents the third generation of the PVPro algorithms and optomechanical design .
It is a crucial step in allowing the company 's customers to manufacture compact projectors for use in a range of applications .
Nic Lawrence , CEO , commented , " Our vision is to make it simple for people to share photos with their friends and to comfortably view mobile TV and music videos from their mobile devices .
We believe that access to a large display , such as is provided by our PVPro projection technology , is key to increasing ease of use . "
Plus it 's just plain cool .
The advantage of the Light Blue Optics approach is to address the four key requirements for a small batterypowered device .
These are compact size , low power consumption , which allows the projector to be powered by typical portable battery technology , ease of use due to the focus - free operation of the system , and robustness both physically and in terms of error - tolerance .
PVPro technology is available today to manufacturers as an evaluation kit which includes a demonstration projector unit , appropriate PC software , technical documentation and a bundled package of technical support .
Light Blue Optics is working with a select group of strategic partners to bring to market the first products based on PVPro technology .
Quick Specs :
Color Depth : Monochrome Green at 532nm ( full color available late 2006 )
Depth of Focus : Infinite ( image remains in focus at any distance from the projector )
Resolutions Supported : QCIF , CIF , VGA , NTSC , 1024x512 ( resolutions up to 2048x1280 including SXGA and S - HDTV available upon request )
Typical Diagonal Image & Brightness : 15 " @ 50cd / m^2 ( all pixels full brightness ) ; 15 " @ 200cd / m^2 ( 50 % max average pixel amplitude )
Aspect Ratio Image : 7 " @ 220cd / m^2 ( all pixels full brightness ) ; 7 " @ 880cd / m^2 ( 50 % max average pixel amplitude )
Electrical Power Consumption : 1.4W ( max pixel power , all pixels ) ; < 350 mW ( 50 % max average pixel amplitude )
Light Blue Optics will be demonstrating the miniature PVPro evaluation kit at the 3GSM World Congress in Barcelona , February 13 - 16 2006 .

Sony to pull controversial CDs , offer swap By Jefferson Graham , USA TODAY Related item : Firestorm rages over lockdown on digital music ) LOS ANGELES  Sony BMG Music Entertainment said Monday it will pull some of its most popular CDs from stores in response to backlash over copy - protection software on the discs .
( Sony also said it will offer exchanges for consumers who purchased the discs , which contain hidden files that leave them vulnerable to computer viruses when played on a PC .
" Sony BMG deeply regrets any inconvenience to our customers and remains committed to providing an enjoyable and safe music experience , " the company said .
Sony says more than 20 titles have been released with the XCP copy - protection software , and of those CDs , over 4 million have been manufactured , and 2.1 million sold .
Details about how long it will take to replace the XCP CDs and about its consumer exchange program will come later in the week , Sony said .
For now , pulling the CDs off shelves " could go a long way toward making a consumer feel comfortable that the CD they just purchased is n't going to mess up their computer , " says record store owner John Kunz of Waterloo Records in Austin .
Country - rockers Van Zant's Get Right with the Man kicked off the firestorm when a blogger traced a hidden , spyware - type file on his computer to the CD .
Other XCP copy - protected CDs include new releases by Neil Diamond , Celine Dion , Cyndi Lauper and Burt Bacharach .
Before Sony 's announcement , Van Zant manager Ross Schilling urged the label to recall all the CDs .
" I said we 've got to be proactive , or it could destroy the business model , " Schilling says .
" Sony should be in the artist business , promoting and selling records .
This type of issue sheds a negative light on their ability to do that . "
Sony began adding copy - protection to its CDs in June 2004 with the release of a record by the band Velvet Revolver , saying it was taking a step against unauthorized online file - sharing and CD burning .
The label says it will issue all major releases with copy - protection in 2006 , as will rival label EMI .
The other major labels , Universal Music and Warner , have yet to release copy - protected CDs .
Sony also issues copy - protected CDs using software from digital rights management company SunnComm .
But those , which include releases by the Foo Fighters and the Dave Matthews Band , have n't come under the same kind of attack .
However , many artists have spoken out about all forms of copy - protected CDs , including Matthews , the Foo Fighters and Christian rock band Switchfoot .
Bela Fleck and the Flecktones are set to release a new album on Sony in January , and it will not be copy protected , says Fleck 's manager , David Bendett .
Frustrated when he bought a copy - protected Dave Matthews release and could n't copy it to his Apple iPod , Fleck insisted that Sony not release his new album with such restrictions , Bendett says .
Sony says its copy - protected CDs are clearly marked , but the front labels do n't identify whether they use the XCP software .
That information is included in small print on the back of the CD , which reads " ?cp.sonybmg.com /xcp " .

A Note to the Reader Introduction The Personal MBA is an introductory business primer .
Its purpose is to give you a clear , comprehensive overview of the most important business concepts in as little time as possible .
The vast majority of modern business practice requires little more than common sense , simple arithmetic , and knowledge of a few very important ideas and principles .
Chapter 1 Value Creation Every successful business creates something of value .
The world is full of opportunities to make other people ’s lives better in some way , and your job as a businessperson is to identify things that people do n’t have enough of , then find a way to provide them .
Key Ideas in Chapter 1 →
Chapter 2 Marketing
Offering value is not enough .
If no one knows ( or cares ) about what you have to offer , it does n’t matter how much value you create .
Without marketing , no business can survive — people who do n't know you exist can't purchase what you have to offer , and people who are n’t interested in what you have to offer wo n't become paying customers .
Key Ideas in Chapter 2 → Chapter 3 Sales Every successful business ultimately sells what it has to offer .
Having millions of prospects is n't enough if no one ultimately pulls out their wallet and says , " I 'll take one . "
The sales process begins with a prospect and ends with a paying customer .
No sale , no business .
Key Ideas in Chapter 3 →
Chapter 4 Value Delivery
Every successful business actually delivers what it promises to its customers .
There ’s a term for a person who takes other people ’s money without delivering equivalent value : " scam artist . "
Key Ideas in Chapter 4 → Chapter 5 Finance Finance is the art and science of watching the money flowing into and out of a business , then deciding how to allocate it and determining whether or not what you ’re doing is producing the results you want .
Key Ideas in Chapter 5 →
Chapter 6 The Human Mind Businesses are built by people for people .
Understanding how we take in information , how we make decisions , and how we decide what to do or what not to do is critical if you want to create and sustain a successful business venture .
Key Ideas in Chapter 6 → Chapter 7 Working With Yourself
In today ’s busy business environment , it ’s easy to get stressed about everything that needs to be done .
Learning how to work effectively and efficiently can be the difference between a fulfilling career and a draining one .
Key Ideas in Chapter 7 →
Chapter 8 Working With Others
Working with other people is an ever - present part of business and life : you ca n’t escape it , even if you want to .
If you want to do well in this world , it pays to understand how to get things done with and through other people .
Key Ideas in Chapter 8 → Chapter 9 Understanding Systems Businesses are complex systems that exist within even more complex systems : markets , industries , and societies .
A complex system is a self - perpetuating arrangement of interconnected parts that form a unified whole .
Key Ideas in Chapter 9 →
Chapter 10 Analyzing Systems
Before you can improve a system , you must understand how well it 's currently operating .
Unfortunately for us , that ’s tricky business : it 's not possible to stop the world however long you want while you take careful measurements .
Systems must be analyzed as they ’re working .
Key Ideas in Chapter 10 → Chapter 11 Improving Systems Creating and improving systems is the heart of successful business practice .
The purpose of understanding and analyzing systems is to improve them , which is often tricky : changing systems can often create unintended consequences .
Key Ideas in Chapter 11 →
Reviewers say ...
" The Personal MBA is the single best business book I 've read .

KEVIN KELLY , founding executive editor of Wired & author of What Technology Wants
The Transportation Security Administration , starting last December , decided to try out the approach at about a dozen airports , including Logan .
At each airport , it used six officers who had once been routine screeners , had received an extra four days of classroom training in observation and questioning techniques , and had three days of field practice .
T.S.A. officers do not have law enforcement powers , so if they observe someone suspicious , they can chat with the person but cannot conduct a more formal interrogation .
That leaves them with the option of requiring the passenger to go through a more intense checkpoint search , as they did with the man at Dulles on Wednesday .
Or if the suspicion is serious enough , they call the local police assigned to the airport to take over the inquiry .
In nine months — a period in which about seven million people have flown out of Dulles — several hundred people have been referred for intense screening , and about 50 have been turned over to the police for follow - up questioning , said John F. Lenihan , the transportation agency ’s security director at Dulles .
Of those , half a dozen have faced charges or other law enforcement follow - up , he said , because the behavior detection officials succeeded in picking out people who had a reason to be nervous , generally because of immigration matters , outstanding warrants or forged documents .
“ It is an extra layer of security that is on top of what we have , ” Mr. Hawley said of the program .
But Rafi Ron , the former director of security at Ben-Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv , who was a consultant who helped train the officers at Logan Airport , said that the agency ’s system , while a welcome improvement to airport security , was still flawed .
Most importantly , he said , too few of the passengers pulled aside were more formally questioned as in the Israeli system , and when questioning was done , it was handled by local police officers who might not have had the necessary behavioral analysis skills .
He cited the case of Richard Reid , known as the shoe bomber , who aroused suspicion when he arrived at Charles de Gaulle International Airport outside Paris , but was ultimately allowed to board after the police had questioned him .
“ If you do n’t do the interviews properly , you are missing what is probably the most important and powerful part of the procedure , ” he said .
“ These accounts , coming from the front lines , point a big red arrow at the large problem of taxpayers being stiffed , ” said Senator Ron Wyden , Democrat of Oregon , who has been investigating the accusations .
“ If it was one isolated instance , you could say that ’s somebody who had a bad experience and was frustrated , ” Mr. Wyden said .
“ But when you have three or four professional , nonpolitical , independent auditors all bringing the same message , that is too important to ignore . ”
By any measure , the Interior Department under President Bush has placed top priority on increasing oil and gas production in the United States .
Under its business - friendly agenda , the department has increased incentives for drilling in risky areas , has speeded approvals for drilling applications and has campaigned to open more coastal areas for oil exploration .
Lawyers who have specialized in lawsuits under the False Claims
Act said they had never seen a group of government investigators use the law against their own agency .
“ Most whistle - blowers are insiders at a company who spot something that government auditors have missed , ” said James Moorman , president of Taxpayers Against Fraud Education Fund , a nonprofit organization supported by lawyers that specializes in the False Claims Act .
“ But here you have auditors saying , ‘ We did our job , we found the problems and our superiors do n’t want to hear about it , ’ ’’ Mr. Moorman said .
“ If it were just one auditor , you could dismiss it .
But with four auditors , that ’s a pattern of practice . ”
In their suits , the auditors contend that they had no choice but to go outside the agency because their supervisors ordered them to “ cease work ” on five separate investigations and drop their claims .

An Emoticon in Typewriter Era
Koichi Yasuoka
The article shown right is from The Typewriter World ( Chicago ) , Vol.I , No.2 ( October 1897 ) , p.46 , which I found in The New York Public Library .
You see the sentense " he Said it would Be a thxng of beavty & jOy FORever " is followed by a combination of punctuation marks , a semicolon and a right parenthesis , which is one of the so - called emoticons nowadays .
I cannot make sure that it was really intended to represent a winking smile , but I need to check Berkshire News ( Great Barrington , Massachusetts ) of February 6 , 1890 .
How do you think about this ?
" Roomba " , ein vollautomatischer Staubsauger - Roboter mit Rollen als Füßen , Infrarotsensoren als Augen und einer besonderen Vorliebe für Hundehaare , ist der bislang erfolgreichste Consumer - Roboter in der Geschichte .
Sein Produzent , die US - Firma iRobot , setzte seit dem Verkaufsstart im September 2002 mehr als 1,5 Millionen Stück des Frisbee - förmigen Gadgets ab .
Und viele Kunden lieben ihre Roombas – sie kaufen sie für weitere Familienmitglieder , schreiben überaus positive Testberichte auf Review - Websites und formieren Internet - Fanclubs samt Foren .
Es gibt sogar Roomba - Besitzer , die den Staubsauger wie ein Haustier ausstaffieren .
Bei all dem Erfolg und Enthusiasmus für das Produkt sollte man eigentlich erwarten , dass inzwischen zahlreiche Roomba - Klone auf dem Markt sein müssten .
Nach fast vier Jahren folgte jedoch nur ein einziges Produkt dem Staubi - Robi nach – " Scooba " , ein Roboter - Wischmopp , der mit seiner eigenen Reinigungsflüssigkeit kommt und harte Böden wie Holz , Fließen und Linoleum putzt und trocknet .
Allerdings stammt " Scooba " ebenfalls von iRobot .
Das Gerät wurde in diesem Quartal offiziell vorgestellt , ob es ein Erfolg wird , bleibt abzuwarten .
Die Idee , Roboter in jedem Haushalt zu haben , wirkt heutzutage noch mehr wie Zukunftsmusik als beim Roomba - Verkaufsstart .
Warum das so ist , lässt sich nicht leicht sagen .
Vielleicht ist es mangelndes Kundeninteresse , vielleicht aber auch die fehlende Vorstellungskraft der Produktentwickler .
Oder :
Es ist unklar , ob sich Roboter überhaupt für bestimmte Tätigkeiten eignen .
Helen Greiner gehört zum dreiköpfigen iRobot - Gründerteam und glaubt , dass der Markt für Heim - und Büroroboter noch deutlich wachsen wird .
Sie gründete iRobot 1990 mit ihrem Informatik - Studienkollegen Colin Angle sowie Rodney Brooks , einem Professor am MIT - Labor für Computerwissenschaften und künstliche Intelligenz .
Greiner besitzt einen Bachelor - Abschluss in Maschinenbau und einen Master - Abschluss in Informatik .
Technology Review : Ihr Staubsauger - Roboter Roomba hat gezeigt , dass es einen Markt für Heim - Roboter gibt .
Trotzdem sind inzwischen seit seiner Einführung mehr als vier Jahre vergangen – und weder iRobot noch seine Konkurrenten haben Consumer - Roboter für andere Aufgaben herausgebracht .
Warum ?
Helen Greiner : Im Gegenteil , wir haben .
Unser Bodenreinigungsroboter Scooba ist gerade fertig geworden .
Er ist ein ganz anderer Roboter als Roomba .
Staubsaugen und die Bodenreinigung sind zwei völlig verschiedene Haushaltsarbeiten .
TR : Verzeihen Sie unseren Fehler .
Was wir meinten , war folgendes :
Was macht Roomba so besonders – und warum hat es bislang niemand geschafft , seinen Erfolg zu kopieren ?
Greiner : Der große Unterschied zwischen Roomba und den Robotern , die vor ihm kamen , liegt in der Praxistauglichkeit des Systems und seinem Preis .
Er kostet ungefähr soviel wie ein normaler Staubsauger .
Gleichzeitig muss man ihn nicht durch die Gegend schieben .
Er kann unter Möbel und Betten saugen .
Sein
Wert übersteigt den Preis , den die Kunden zahlen müssen – bei Robotern für 1500 oder 2000 Dollar wäre das nicht so .
TR : Um den Preis des Roomba günstig zu halten , mussten Sie Funktionen weglassen .
Wie haben
Sie entschieden , was man braucht und was nicht ?
Greiner : Das war schwer .
Wie Sie wissen , kommen wir selbst vom MIT und sind allesamt Technologen .
Unser erster Roomba kostete 199 Dollar und man schaltete ihn einfach an und er erledigte seinen Job .
Genau das brauchte der Kunde .
Wir wussten , dass wir Dinge wie eine Fernsteuerung oder eine Ladestation hätten mitliefern können , was ja an sich tolle Sachen sind , aber das hätte den Preis erhöht .
Als sich die Leute dann daran gewöhnt hatten , dass man sich diese Dinger für einen vernünftigen Preis ins Haus holen kann , kamen sie selbst mit Ideen auf uns zu .
" Wäre es nicht cool , wenn er sich selbst aufladen könne ? " oder " Wäre es nicht toll , wenn er sich jeden Tag zur gleichen Zeit einschalten könnte ? " waren solche Fragen .
Erst dann haben wir diese Zusatzfeatures herausgebracht .
( Heute gibt es vier Roomba Modelle – vom High - End- Modell " Scheduler " für 340 Dollar bis hin zum " Roomba Red " für 150 Dollar , Anm. d. Red. )
TR : Neben dem günstigen Preis ist der Roomba auch leicht zu bedienen .
Er besitzt ein sehr einfaches Benutzerinterface : Einen Anschalter , einen Reinigungs - Knopf und einen " Hier Reinigen " - Button .
Wie viel Gehirnschmalz hat man in dieses Interface gesteckt ?
Greiner : Wir wussten , dass wir das Gerät ganz einfach gestalten mussten .
Unser erster Roomba war noch nicht einfach genug – er hatte Einstellungen wie " klein " , " mittel " und " groß " für verschiedene Raumgrößen .
Aber die meisten Leute wissen gar nicht , wie viel Quadratmeter ein Raum hat .
Nun schaltet man Roomba einfach auf " Reinigen " und er findet das selbst heraus .
Er macht einfach weiter , bis er fast keinen Saft mehr hat .
Das ist ein wesentlich leichteres Interface .
Diese Einfachheit ist ein großes Unterscheidungsmerkmal im Vergleich zu anderen Robotern und Computersystemen .
Man drückt einen Knopf und schon geht 's los .
Greiner : Der Scooba bewegt sich ähnlich durch den Raum , was für uns natürlich praktisch war .
Der tatsächliche Reinigungsmechanismus ist aber ein völlig anderer , weil er mit Flüssigkeiten zu tun hat .
Wir mussten uns sogar mit der Chemie der Seife auseinandersetzen .
Wir arbeiteten mit Clorox zusammen , um eine Seife zu entwickeln , auf der der Roboter nicht ausrutscht .
Es muss ein Roboter - freundliches Reinigungsmittel sein .
Und dann wäre da noch der Umgang mit Flüssigkeiten an sich .
Scooba nimmt erst Schmutz auf , gibt die Reinigungsflüssigkeit ab , schrubbt und saugt sie dann in seinen hinteren Bereich .
Schmutziges und klares Wasser werden dabei getrennt behandelt .
TR : Ist das Ziel erreicht , Roboter einfach und preiswert zu gestalten , wird es Zeit , sich Aufgaben für neue Roboter zu suchen .
Welche könnten das bei iRobot sein ?
Greiner : Man könnte etwa an professionelle Reinigungsdienste denken .
Jeder Boden in jedem Büro , jedem Geschäft und jeder Schule wird in der Nacht gereinigt .
Außerdem gibt es immer mehr alte Menschen – und die wollen unabhängig zu Hause weiterleben können .
Man könnte sich also etwa Fensterwäscher , Badreiniger , Toilettenputzer , Rasenmäher oder auch Schnee - und Laubbeseitiger vorstellen .
Es geht grundsätzlich immer um Sachen , die die Menschen ungern erledigen , beziehungsweise nicht häufig genug tun .
Genau hier ist der Endkundenbedarf groß .
TR : Warum gibt es nicht mehr Firmen , die Heimroboter herstellen ?
Greiner : Ich denke , dass das Zusammenbringen so vieler Teile für ein solches Gerät nicht besonders einfach ist .
Roboter erfordern Elektrotechnik , Maschinenbau , Informatik , Produktentwicklung und einen genauen Blick auf die Kostenstruktur und den Bedarf der Menschen in ihren Haushalten oder , wie in unserer anderen Abteilung , beim Militär .
Es gibt höchstens noch andere Firmen , die sich gut mit Roboter - Software auskennen .
Wir selbst haben hier ein Team versammelt , das alle Disziplinen vereint .
Und dieses
Team konzentriert sich immer auf den Kunden .

WHAT BLOGS COST AMERICAN BUSINESS In 2005 , Employees Will Waste 551,000 Years Reading Them
By Bradley Johnson
LOS ANGELES ( AdAge.com ) —
Blog this : U.S. workers in 2005 will waste the equivalent of 551,000 years reading blogs .
Currently , the time employees spend reading non-work blogs is the equivalent of 2.3 million jobs .
About 35 million workers — one in four people in the labor force — visit blogs and on average spend 3.5 hours , or 9 % , of the work week engaged with them , according to Advertising Age ’s analysis .
Time spent in the office on non-work blogs this year will take up the equivalent of 2.3 million jobs .
Forget lunch breaks — blog readers essentially take a daily 40 - minute blog break .
Bogged down in blogs
While blogs are becoming an accepted part of the media sphere , and are increasingly being harnessed by marketers — American Express last week paid a handful of bloggers to discuss small business , following other marketers like General Motors Corp. and Microsoft Corp. into the blogosphere — they are proving to be competition for traditional media messages and are sapping employees ’ time .
Case in point : Gawker Media , blog home of Gawker ( media ) , Wonkette ( politics ) and Fleshbot ( porn ) .
Said Sales Director Christopher Batty : “ The Gawker audience is very at - work ; it ’s an at - work , leisure audience — a.k.a. , people screwing off on the job . ”
Bosses accept some screwing off as a cost of doing business ; it keeps employees happy and promotes camaraderie .
Andy Sernovitz , CEO of the Word of Mouth Marketing Association , said blogs have become the favored diversion for “ office goof - off time , ” though he notes it ’s hard to segregate blog time since blogs often bounce readers to professional media sites .
But at the end of the day , more blogging means less working .
Jonathan Gibs , senior research manager at Nielsen / NetRatings , said at - work blog time probably comes in addition to regular surfing — meaning more time on the Web but less time on the job .
Expansion of online behavior
“ Since for the most part blog readers tend to be the most engaged readers of online content , ” he said , “ they do not appear , at least for now , to be sacrificing time from their favorite news sites .
Instead , it looks like blog usage is in addition to existing online behavior . ”
Some blogs do relate to work , but deciding just how relevant they are to the employer is open to debate .
For this analysis , Ad Age chose a simple score : Count all business blog traffic , half of tech and media blogs and one - fourth of political / news blogs as directly related to work .
Based on ComScore ’s tally of blog categories , this suggests just 25 % of blog visits directly connect to the job .
Employees this year will spend 4.8 billion work hours absorbing wisdom from other blogs that may enlighten visitors but not amuse the boss .
Wasted time
Hard and detailed data on blogging time is limited , so Ad Age ’s analysis is a best - guess extrapolation done by reviewing blog - related surveys and data .
By Ad Age estimates :
Work time spent reading and posting to blogs this year will consume 2.2 % of U.S. labor force hours .
Work time spent at blogs unrelated to work will eat up 1.65 % of labor force hours .
U.S. workers this year will waste the equivalent of 551,000 years ( based on a 24 - hour day ) or 2.3 million work years ( based on a typical nearly 40 - hour work week ) reading blogs unrelated to the job .
There is strong evidence of workday blogging .
Server traffic for Blogads , a network of sites that take ads , spikes during business hours , reflecting page views on about 900 blogs .
FeedBurner , a blog technology company , also sees a jump in work - time hits .
Workday traffic patterns
“ Traffic rockets at 8 a.m. EST , peaks at 5 p.m. EST and then slides downward until L.A. leaves the office , ” said Blogads founder Henry Copeland .
“ You see the same thing in the collapse of traffic on weekends … .
Bottom line :
At work , people can’t watch TV or prop up their feet and read a newspaper , but they sure do read blogs . ”
And they create and post to them .
Technorati , a blog search engine , now tracks 19.6 million blogs , a number that has doubled about every five months for the past three years .
If that growth were to continue , all 6.7 billion people on the planet will have a blog by April 2009 .
Imagine the work that wo n’t get done then .

Cheney Authorized Libby to Disclose Classified Documents
Once upon a time , a former agent of Italian military intelligence named
Rocco Martino , who had had some experience in the African country of Niger , came into possession of some forged , fraudulent documents .
These alleged Iraqi purchases of yellowcake uranium in 1999 .
In fact , the signatures were of Nigerien officials who had been in power a decade earlier , in the late 1980s .
So they were clumsy forgeries .
Martino passed them on to the Italian magazine Panorama , which passed them to the US embassy .
Tantalizingly , President George W. Bush ’s chief political adviser , Karl Rove , has an indirect connection to Italian intelligence .
Rove ’s chief adviser on Iran policy is Neoconservative wildman and notorious warmonger Michael Ledeen ,
who has a longstanding connection to the darker corners of Italian intelligence .
Vice President Richard Bruce Cheney heard of the alleged uranium purchase .
Cheney asked George Tenet to look into the allegation .
The issue went to the Directorate of Operations secret unit on counter - proliferation .
Among the field officers there was Valerie Plame Wilson , who had spent her life fighting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction under cover of a dummy corporation .
Valerie Plame Wilson was married to former US Ambassador Joseph Wilson IV , who had served bravely as acting ambassador in Iraq in 1990 , and when threatened by Saddam he showed up to a press conference wearing a hanging noose instead of a necktie .
President George H. W. Bush highly praised him .
Joe Wilson had not only served in Iraq , he also had been ambassador to the West African countries of Gabon and Sao Tome , and spoke fluent French .
When Plame Wilson ’s superiors brought up the possibility of sending him as a private citizen to look into the plausibility of the report that Saddam had bought Nigerien uranium , she was consulted and agreed ( she was not part of the decision loop ) .
He went , and soon saw that the uranium industry in Niger was actually under the control of French companies and was strictly monitored .
There was no possibility of corrupt Nigerien officials selling it off under the table .
A separate military mission led by Marine General Carlton Fulford , Jr , deputy commander of the United States European Command ( EUCOM ) , went to Niger the same month , February 2002 .
Fulford quickly came to the same conclusion as Wilson , that it was implausible that al - Qaeda or anyone else could secretly buy uranium from Niger .
Wilson came back and was orally debriefed by people who wrote a report for Tenet , expecting that Tenet would pass it on to the high officials of the Bush administration .
Wilson was amazed when the Niger uranium story was put into Bush ’s State of the Union address .
Then Libby
wanted Secretary of State Colin Powell to make allegations about Saddam and al - Qaeda before the United Nations Security Council .
Powell was also pressed by someone to bring up the Niger uranium story .
Powell is said to have exclaimed , “ I ’m not reading this bullshit ! ”
Libby appears to have been a big influence on the speech Powell gave , almost every detail of which was inaccurate , and at which United Nations officials who heard it openly laughed .
After the war , Wilson wrote an opinion piece for the New York Times in which he revealed his mission and again called into question the Bush administration assertion that Iraq had an active nuclear weapons program .
Cheney was extremely upset by Wilson ’s op - ed .
He saw it as an allegation that he had personally sent Wilson and then ignored Wilson ’s report .
Or at least that was the spin .
But Wilson had said no such thing in the article .
He simply said that Cheney had asked Tenet to look into the story , which Cheney probably did .
Cheney was afraid that if the American public became convinced that there had been no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq , the war effort would collapse , along with all those billions of no -bid uncompetitive contracts for Halliburton .
Cheney , it has now come out , then authorized Libby to leak the classified 2002 National Intelligence Estimate to the press .
The NIE , which may have been produced under pressure from Cheney himself , had incorrectly suggested that Iraq was only a few years from having a nuclear weapon .
In fact , Iraq did not have an active weapons program at all after the early 1990s when it was dismantled by the UN inspectors .
The pre-war NIE in any case was just old bad intelligence , which was contradicted by David Kay ’s team on the ground in post - war Iraq , which just was n’t finding much .
Libby now began telling reporters that Wilson ’s wife was a CIA operative , itself classified information , since she was an undercover operative .
Karl Rove engaged in the same routine .
Apparently Cheney , Rove and Libby ( and Bush ? ) believed that Wilson ’s credibility would be undermined if the Washington press corps could have it intimated to them that his story was a CIA plant .
Robert Novak used the information given him by the White House staff to out Valerie Plame Wilson as an undercover operative .
Her career was ruined .
All her contacts in the global South were burned , and their lives put in danger .
The CIA ’s careful project combating weapons of mass destruction collapsed .
The same administration that alleges it should be able to listen to our phone calls at will for national security purposes deliberately undermined US security for petty political purposes , making us all much less safe .
The likelihood is that the crimes of Bush , Cheney , Libby and Rove so far revealed are only the tip of the iceberg .

Joseph Stiglitz shared the Nobel Prize in 2001 partly on the basis of an important paper of his ( with Greenwald ) : " Externalities in Economies with Imperfect Information and Incomplete Markets . "
In that paper he says : " There exist government interventions ( e.g. , taxes and subsidies ) that can make everyone better off . "
Stiglitz is a prolific , outspoken , and outstanding spokesman for the pro-government school .
Stiglitz sees market imperfections that are remediable by government everywhere he looks ; and this paper is supposed to provide the intellectual and analytical foundation for government intervention .
I will argue that this important and oft - cited paper completely fails to prove the potential worth of government interventions .
Murray Rothbard 's views directly oppose those of Stiglitz .
In his paper " Toward a Reconstruction of Utility Theory and Welfare Economics , " Rothbard writes : " We conclude therefore that no government interference with exchanges can ever increase social utility , " ( his emphasis ) .
Whose view is correct is tremendously important as it touches upon the entire realm of political organization .
If Stiglitz 's pro-state view is correct , it provides justification for the interventionist state .
If Rothbard 's anti-state view is correct , then it removes the justification for all government activities , including those supposedly justified by externalities .
Since the set of externalities can be made almost indefinitely large by liberal interpretation , it is important to assess Stiglitz 's arguments that the state should or can raise social utility by operating on externalities .
I will examine Stiglitz 's views primarily on his home ground , that is , with reference to his theorizing or his model .
This shall be done in a way that does not burden the reader with his mathematics yet is completely faithful to his equations .
At the end of the argument , the reader will understand exactly why we can reject his conclusion .
The Stiglitz Model
The Stiglitz model has no mathematical errors in it that I know of .
The equations follow one another correctly .
The implications are correctly deduced from the premises .
The problems with the model are deeper than mathematical .
The fundamental problems with the model involve its treatment of government and the treatment of externalities .
Stiglitz grafts these onto the standard neoclassical model of exchange and production .
The grafts , however , are ad hoc , incomplete , and inconsistent with what they are grafted onto .
The resulting theory provides no support for government .
Stiglitz starts with a standard timeless neoclassical model of general equilibrium under certainty , and part of the paper extends it to uncertainty .
The paper 's innovations include ( 1 ) a simple method by which to tell whether in the model there is a set of taxes , subsidies , and lump - sum transfers that indicate a positive net " government " revenue while leaving household utilities unchanged , and ( 2 ) applications of the model to several situations that had previously been treated in disparate fashion .
These innovations , which I do not criticize , are responsible for the paper 's fame .
Model Basics
There are two sectors in the basic model , households and firms .
In standard neoclassical fashion , the households maximize utility and the firms maximize profits .
Firms are " black boxes " that process inputs into outputs according to some fixed technology , so they do nothing interesting in the model .
The paper 's purpose is to explore the effects of externalities on the Pareto optimality of household and firm optimizations .
The paper extends the neoclassical model .
We could dismiss the whole exercise as flawed because of its neoclassical unreality , but , as I have said , I propose to entertain the neoclassical model core and show that even if we accept it , Stiglitz 's extensions are unacceptable .
Stiglitz ( and other neoclassical economists ) model utility as depending on two sorts of items .
One is goods that are produced , traded , and have prices .
( Later in the model , the " government " will be alleged to do particular things regarding these goods such as tax them . )
The second is items ( called externalities ) that are not traded and do not have prices in the model .
They do not appear in the budget constraints of the households ( or firms ) as costing anything , but the household utilities are affected by them .
Because they do not appear in budgets and cannot be traded but do affect utility , household optimizations leave possible utility gains on the table .
The equilibrium is therefore not Pareto optimal when these externalities are present .
Government in the model is an entity that leaves each household 's utility unchanged while maximizing its excess of tax revenues over lump sum transfers to households .
This is its behavior function .
The only way that it can have such an excess is when there are externalities .
When such an excess occurs , it amounts to money or utility left on the table by households and firms .
Such sub-optimization has to occur by the assumption that neither is able to trade certain goods that affect profits and utility .
The implications follow implacably from the assumptions .
Four Main Criticisms
Now , what are the fundamental criticisms of this model ?
There are four big questions .
In the model , the households and the firms optimize , yet somehow they are still not as well off as they can be .
They leave gains on the table that are sopped up by government .
Why do n't households and firms fully optimize , that is , take into account the externalities ?
In the model , why is government able to recognize the externalities and compensate for them by a series of taxes , subsidies , and transfers while households and firms cannot and do not ?
In the model , what sort of entity is this government and how does it relate to the entities that it is taxing ?
What does the entity called government have to know in order to effect the taxes , subsidies , and transfers ?
I consider each of these questions in turn .
Why do n't households and firms optimize fully ?
Stiglitz posits that they optimize utility , which is standard neoclassical economic theorizing .
Assume that there are externalities .
A genuine theory would explain how the externalities arise even while households and firms optimize .
It would introduce a theory of costs or some other factors that cause externalities .
This is essential if it is to be argued that government can recognize and overcome these externalities .
Stiglitz provides no such theory .
He simply inserts the externalities into utility and production functions without prices and then allows households and firms to optimize .
This procedure can be done mathematically , which is what Stiglitz does , but it is entirely ad hoc .
It lacks theoretical justification because the externalities in the model do not themselves arise in the context of other optimizing actions of the economic actors .
I do not say that there should never be ad hoc theorizing .
There is a cost and benefit to it , and there will be times when it is worth doing .
But in a case where the central message is to promote government and downplay markets , it just will not do to introduce the reason for government in an ad hoc manner .
There is a further problem with introducing externalities in an ad hoc fashion , namely , model inconsistency .
The Stiglitz model is an equilibrium model , which means that everyone has already done the best they can possibly do .
From that perspective , private parties already have done the best they can do in order to internalize the externalities ( create contracts , exchanges , and prices for them ) .
It is then inconsistent with the spirit of optimizing models and equilibrium models to introduce ad hoc externalities .
Where do they come from , and why are n't they already priced out ?
The Stiglitz model contains at its core an ad hoc element that drives all the results and that is inconsistent with the optimizing and equilibrium assumptions of the model .
It assumes that actors who otherwise are absolutely punctilious about optimizing utility and profits ignore the potentialities of taking externalities into account .
The model has inconsistent assumptions .
Why is government capable of optimally rectifying externalities ?
Households and firms ignore the externalities , but the optimizing government does not .
Why is government so perspicacious ?
In fact , to Stiglitz his key equation " provides a simple set of necessary conditions characterizing the optimal level of taxes in the presence of externalities . "
It is true that this equation makes sense within the model — once one grants the existence of externalities and the existence of an entity called government with the properties that the model endows it with .
It says that the government should push the tax to the point where its marginal cost ( in terms of consumption and utility losses ) equals its marginal gain ( in terms of lowering a negative externality . )
But why does the government optimize a measure of profits by taking into account the externalities and the other sectors do not ?
The theory provides no explanation .
Stiglitz introduces this optimization as a mathematical convenience , employing it as a simple way to test for Pareto optimality .
But he also regards government as a separate entity that interacts with households and firms which are the other entities of the model .
If government is a real entity as he supposes , how and why does it have an optimizing capability that households and firms lack ?
Stiglitz never tells us .
He places another basic inconsistency at the heart of the model .
What actually is government in the model ?
This issue is very important because there is absolutely no doubt that Stiglitz considers the government in his model to be a basis for government policies and government interventions to improve upon market economies , not only in this paper but in many subsequent writings of his .
Logically , within the model 's confines , the government is either a creature of the other economic actors ( households and firms ) or it is not .
If it is an institution created and run by the household and firm sectors to rationalize externalities , then ( assuming that it can and will do this and that it is the optimal means of doing this ) , we actually are not dealing with government at all in the usual sense of the word .
We are dealing with a voluntary means of negotiating exchanges , a kind of a market , and we are not dealing with coerced taxes .
There is in this case no warrant whatever for speaking of the model 's government as representative of the state .
Real government is not an ongoing type of firm created and managed by the private sector to iron out certain problems .
If it were , it would not be marked by the extensive power that it has to impose measures .
It would not be marked by life and death debates over its every action .
It would not be marked by divisions between one part of it and another and between it and society .
It would not be marked by what seems to be its creation of conflicts and externalities that rive society .
It would hardly be the destroyer of money or of wealth or the inefficient manager of every activity that it touches .
On the other hand , if the government is the coercive institution in the model that we know it to be in reality , then how is this to be explained ?
What actors in the model create the government ?
What actors run the government ?
What are their optimizing behaviors in running it ?
What are their costs and how are they spread over the other actors ?
The fact is that Stiglitz never describes what this government is or how it comes about .
He never even describes its basic properties .
Government in the model is basically ad hoc .
It is motivated to produce taxes , subsidies and transfers to achieve optimality in a manner that is nowhere described .
It simply does it .
There is no warrant for making this assumption and there is no warrant for taking it to be characteristic of actual government .
Stiglitz cannot sensibly talk about what government should or should not do without a theory of government .
What does government have to know in the model in order to accomplish its task ?
The list is staggering :
For each and every household , the marginal effect that a tax has on each and every good that that household consumes ;
The rate of change of each firm 's profits with a change in each externality ( holding all else constant ) and the rate of change of each firm externality with a change in tax , all else held constant ;
The rate of change of each household 's spending with a change in each externality ( all else constant ) and the rate of change of each household externality with a change in tax ( all else constant ) .
If we again stay within the confines of the model itself , there is nothing in it that tells us how the actors who govern are supposed to acquire this information or what the acquisition costs are .
If we think of the model as being re-optimized as time passes , then there is variation in the parameters and the governing actors would have to acquire even more information .
In or out of the model , the information requirements present an impossible task .
Where does the knowledge of the required rates of change reside ?
Preferences and production technologies are not self - evident .
They are internal to human beings .
It is not clear that humans either know them or can communicate them , certainly not in the detail required by a social planner .
They possibly learn them over time and they surely alter over time .
Under these conditions , the economic actors affected can surely not rely on a set of social planners or engineers to tell them what they , the actors , prefer or how they plan to produce a good , or even what goods they plan to produce .
If a government is introduced into the model as a device to tax , subsidize , and make transfers , it is entirely an ad hoc device .
There is no economic theory of how it can accomplish these tasks optimally , or how the actors expect it to do so , or empower it to do so .
In sum , in terms of real economic theory the Stiglitz model is about as empty on the issue of externalities and government as it can possibly be .
It is simply a mathematical representation of ad hoc assumptions .
Not only that , these assumptions conflict with the optimizing and equilibrating that goes on in the rest of the model .
Other Problems
I will now mention a few other serious problems that the Stiglitz model ignores , although my intent is not to provide a complete list .
There is not in reality a fixed set of goods or production technologies .
The problem faced by a Stiglitz government is a dynamic one .
But it can't even identify the sets of items that the household and firm sectors are optimizing over at an instant in time .
In or out of the model , it is not at all clear that government , however constituted , is somehow better suited to handling externalities than free markets .
The real economic questions concerning externalities are why they arise , how they relate to property rights , what to do about them , or when it pays for interested parties to do something about them .
In a sense , they are no different than any other kind of inefficiency .
Therefore , the presumption is that free exchanges can address the perceived costs and benefits associated with them whereas government is ill - suited to the task .
Stiglitz , by introducing externalities in an ad hoc way , simply assumes that free markets have already failed .
This is why the Stiglitz government appears as the promoter of economic efficiency .
In the Stiglitz world , some goods are taxed , others subsidized , everyone adjusts , and then some find themselves better off as a consequence , and no one is worse off .
This is done continuously as the economy evolves .
As prices alter , the pertinent taxes and subsidies alter too .
If it is not done continuously , quite possibly an imposed tax will lower welfare when tastes , conditions , and prices shift .
So , logically , to assure betterment , it will have to be done continuously .
This means an infinite cost of transacting .
Hans -Hermann
Hoppe has correctly pointed out that so - called public goods can change their character and become private goods ( and vice versa ) depending on the state of mind of the actor .
This adds to the burden of the government 's already - impossible information requirements .
The model ignores the fact that future opportunities are altered when the government intervenes .
With government in the picture preempting action , no private sector actor has an incentive to overcome the reasons for the initial inefficiency by internalizing the externalities .
The means have been pre-chosen as the tax , subsidy , and transfer schemes .
Therefore innovation is stifled .
If a lower cost or superior method could have been found , it will not be if the solution is government .
In an economy with Stiglitz government interference , whenever any new product is invented , there is uncertainty about its relations with other products and processes .
The producer has no way of telling what externalities the government will deem important enough to intervene in the markets .
The presence of the state will chill many markets and potential markets .
The chances are that future production , trade , and original appropriation will all be deterred .
Of course , Stiglitz entirely ignores any malicious acts by government .
He ignores any power dynamics .
If government is capable of intervening in markets across the entire economy on the basis of externalities , the chances of gains in power are greatly increased .
Stiglitz ignores any error - correction mechanism when government makes mistakes in its assessments , that is , government failure .
If government were to be the institution to handle externalities , we can be quite sure that its incentive structure would make it inferior to free markets in correcting mistakes .
Conclusion
Stiglitz believes that his theory ( model ) demonstrates an economic role for government in principle .
Upon this basis he has for years promoted government solutions and denigrated free markets .
Stiglitz believes only in mathematical neoclassical models .
Even if we grant him his preference , he has still completely and entirely failed to prove his point that government has a potential role in alleviating externality losses .
He has given us an inadequate and incomplete theory with inconsistent and ad hoc assumptions .
His equations contain no theory of government whatever and for that reason alone they cannot possibly provide us with real - world prescriptions .
We can have no confidence that the Stiglitz model captures the essential aspects of real world economizing that it purports to .
We therefore can have no confidence in any belief that rests upon this or similar theories that government has a proper role to play in increasing economic efficiency or social welfare by use of taxes , subsidies , and transfer payments .

With a zealot ’s enthusiasm , Randy Rossi has been firing bullets into lots of things lately .
Car doors , Sheetrock , wood walls , gelatin with the consistency of human bodies .
On the base of each mashed slug is a series of tiny , mostly legible numbers that have been inscribed by a laser .
To Rossi , head of Atty .
Gen. Bill Lockyer ’s firearm division , these markings represent a solution for one of law enforcement ’s most trying problems : the anonymity of ammunition .
“ This is nothing fancy , just simple technology , ” he said on a recent day , after proudly showing that the identification numbers on several slugs remained readable after the bullets were fired into a bulletproof vest .
With 45 % of the state ’s homicides unsolved in 2003 , the most recent data available , the California Legislature is moving ahead with two potentially landmark measures that would require that identifying marks be embedded on projectiles from guns .
Advertisement
One proposal would have all bullets sold in the state marked during manufacture with codes .
The other would mandate that guns be equipped with stamping mechanisms that would hammer telling marks onto every cartridge fired .
That could allow investigators to link the cartridge to the gun ’s purchaser even if they could not find the firearm .
The approaches depart from law enforcement tactics elsewhere in the country , which have focused on creating computer registries of fired bullets .
Those allow for investigators to match projectiles from different crimes , linking ones committed with the same weapon .
The issue of marking ammunition has become the most contested law enforcement topic in Sacramento this year .
One of the bills has split California ’s law enforcement community and infuriated the nation ’s ammunition manufacturers , weapons sellers and firearms enthusiasts , including the National Rifle Assn .
Several police groups in California are also opposed .
The hyperbolic debate has even ricocheted into Congress .
In April , Rep. Duncan Hunter ( R - El Cajon ) , chairman of the House Committee on Armed Services , warned Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger that requiring serial numbers on ammunition would increase the cost of bullets so much that the military would scale back target practice .
Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , also a Republican , is also against the proposal , which he said would hurt manufacturers in his state .

Nationwide , there were 347,705 crimes committed with firearms in 2003 .
In California , those included 44,466 robberies and aggravated assaults , and 1,733 murders .
Although handgun serialization has been a required practice for decades , forensic advances in tracking the sale of ammunition -- which is far more likely to be left at a crime scene -- have been limited .
Since 1994 , law enforcement agencies have been experimenting with ballistics imaging technology that makes computer pictures of bullets recovered from crime scenes .
Those images are compared in hopes of linking crimes in which the same weapon was used .
The federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives has established a database with 862,000 images that authorities say have led to 11,300 matches .
Maryland and New York have established their own programs but have been criticized for failing to provide enough substantial leads .
The first time Maryland ’s database contributed to a murder conviction was in April , four years after its creation .
Advertisement
California lawmakers debated the same strategy in 2000 but decided instead to study it .
A 2003 report from Lockyer ’s office provided greater caution after concluding that constructing such a large database would be “ impractical ” and finding that it was often difficult to match images of bullets fired from the same gun .
The ammunition bill , SB 357 -- numbered to correspond with a popular caliber -- was introduced by Sen. Joe Dunn ( D - Santa Ana ) on Lockyer ’s behalf .
It has passed the Senate and an initial Assembly panel .
It is the one that has drawn the most intense opposition .
For any box of ammunition sold in California , the bill would require manufacturers to engrave each bullet with the same serial number , which would also be affixed to the box .
Retailers would record who purchased each box and would provide that information to the state Department of Justice .
Ammunition Coding Systems , a Seattle company that provided demonstration bullets to California police , uses a laser to etch the number , but the bill does not specify what technology manufacturers would have to use .
Advertisement
Initial testing indicates that the serial numbers almost always survive impact .
The San Bernardino County Sheriff ’s Department was able to identify serial numbers on 21 of 22 bullets it tested and recovered .
The attorney general ’s office identified 180 serial numbers on 181 bullets .
The other , less cleverly numbered , bill , AB 352 by Assemblyman Paul Koretz ( D - West Hollywood ) , has passed the Assembly and one Senate panel .
The bill , sponsored by the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence , would require that semiautomatic pistols be equipped with technology that could imprint microscopic identifying information on each cartridge case fired from the gun .
NanoMark Technologies of Londonderry , N.H. , has patented one technology that uses the firing pin to emboss the identification mark onto the chamber while it is in the breech of the gun .
Although Ammunition Coding Systems ’ marks can be read with the aid of a regular magnifying glass , NanoMark ’s require more powerful imaging equipment used by forensic experts .
It remains unclear what Schwarzenegger will do if either measure makes it to his desk .
Last year the governor proved himself unpredictable on gun legislation by banning .50 - caliber BMG rifles -- powerful hunting weapons that can penetrate thick surfaces from great distances -- but rejecting a measure requiring ammunition vendors to keep records of all purchasers .

“ Forensic testing of ammunition used in a crime is the most effective way of tracing criminal activity , ” Schwarzenegger wrote in that veto message .
Ammunition manufacturers , who together produce 8 billion rounds nationally each year , say Dunn ’s legislation would bankrupt them .
The industry , which makes $ 626 million worth of wholesale civilian sales each year -- on top of unknown amounts to law enforcement and the military -- insists that marking each piece will slow their production and substantially drive up the cost of bullets .
Some fear that using lasers in factories filled with gunpowder would be unsafe .
“ The question is , ‘ Can it be done on a mass level ? ’ and the answer is , ‘ No , not without building a new factory , ’ ” said Lawrence Keane , general counsel for the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers ’
Institute , the industry association .
Makers of coding equipment , which etches and reads serial numbers on hundreds of products , insist that it could be done for a penny or less per bullet .
Advertisement
Carl Rennard , a consultant from Lincoln , R.I. , who owns several coding patents , said the ammunition industry “ is really uninformed about the technology available , how unobtrusive it would be to the product line .
They ’re just being afraid . ”
Advocates say the industry has been unwilling to meet with consultants who help integrate such technology into their production lines .
The debate has also incorporated a disagreement on the craftiness of criminals .
Opponents complain that criminals will refit their guns to get rid of firing pins that stamp codes onto cartridges and will shave numbers off bullets , even though that would require them to take the bullet out of its cartridge .
More likely , they say , criminals will simply avoid these weapons and buy their wares out of state or use black market items .
Advertisement
“ Criminal street gang members and other perpetrators of crime , who are often under the legal age for buying handguns and ammunition , would have no trouble getting both from sources other than retailers , ” Robert Baker , president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League , wrote in opposition to Dunn ’s bill .
Some forensics experts say that is giving too much credit to criminals who often do not bother to use gloves during crimes or take other precautionary measures .
“ Yes , there would be ways to get around that , but it ’s not an easy thing to do , ” said Joe Vince , a former agent with the federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms who is now a forensics consultant in Frederick , Md. “ In L.A. in particular , you have ghetto rounds , which is whatever you have in your pocket . ”
Lawrence Kobilinsky , a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City , said serializing ammunition was “ probably something that should have been done long ago ” but cautioned that its use would be limited so long as the requirement was limited to California .
Advertisement
“ To have one state is well and good , but in order to be effective , it has to be national , ” he said .
But backers of the legislation hope that , as with many other California mandates , the state ’s market is so large that manufacturers will find it cheaper to adopt the practices for all their wares rather than just for California’s .
Advocates say they do not expect the technology to automatically solve every case but say they believe it would often provide a valuable clue .
“ It ’s like any other tool , like fingerprints or copying down a license number , ” Rossi , the state firearms chief , said .
“ There are limitations , but it can still be valuable . ”

Adidas 's Teamgeist World Cup ball has already been criticised by Germany and Arsenal keeper Jens Lehmann for its unpredictability , but is there any scientific basis for perennial concerns over swerving balls ?
In the early 1950s a young Brazilian midfielder nicknamed Didi invented the swerving free kick .
He realised that a ball kicked with spin would deflect significantly in flight .
It is no accident that the technique emerged first in the South American game .
The leather ball of that era was very prone to water absorption and the weight increase made it much less responsive to the aerodynamic forces caused by the spin .
This was seldom a problem in the warm , dry conditions of Brazil but a serious drawback in Europe 's winter game .
GRAPHIC 1 Ball travelling under 12 mph suffers considerable turbulence
Not until a ball with a synthetic , impermeable surface was introduced in the 1960s could the technique catch on .
European players then became as adept as their Brazilian masters and a long line of expert free - kickers stretches from Didi to the present day .
Few can forget David Beckham 's marvellous last - gasp equaliser against Greece in 2001 .
This wickedly swerving and dipping shot took England to the 2002 World Cup in Japan and Korea and England 's recent warm - up games against Hungary and Jamaica show that Beckham is back to top form .
GRAPHIC 2 Turbulence moving backwards creates a thin layer of air flow next to the ball With air flow clinging more closely , turbulence is reduced and drag plummets
This is called " tripping " the boundary layer
It took the modern science of fluid dynamics to understand exactly what happens in a swerving free kick .
When a football moves through the air at low speed the air flow separates from its surface at characteristic points - see graphic 1 .
A sphere is not a very efficient aerodynamic shape and when this early separation occurs turbulence is created behind the ball .
Turbulence always causes drag and if things remained like this a football would be a very sluggish object when kicked .
Above a certain speed - about 12 mph for a football - a miraculous thing happens .
Turbulence begins to move backwards , producing a boundary layer - a layer of very thin flow very close to the ball 's surface - and this has the effect of causing the air flow to cling more closely to the ball 's surface - graphic 2 .
GRAPHIC 3 Spinning ball distorts air flow around ball
Turbulence is reduced and the drag plummets .
When this happens we say that the boundary layer is " tripped " and since most of footballs ' actions such as kicking or throwing take place above the critical speed the ball can be moved around in a pacey manner .
When the ball rotates - see graphic 3 - the boundary layer remains tripped but the air flow separation around the ball is distorted .
Separation occurs earlier on the side rotating against the flow and later on the side rotating in the same sense as the flow .
This causes a pressure differential and a deflecting force which is responsible for moving the ball in the air in a free kick .
A baseball has only two panels
It was not realised for many years that the boundary layer was tripped by surface " imperfections " , in fact by the slight indentations where the ball 's panels are joined together .
More panels means more seams and greater aerodynamic stability but panel designs have varied enormously over the years .
For example , the familiar hexagon - pattern ball has 32 , the classic English model 26 .
The new World Cup ball , Adidas ' Teamgeist , has only fourteen panels , however .
Might this be the factor behind the disquiet expressed by Jens Lehmann ?
To see why this might be so we can take a look at a very simple object , the baseball which has only two panels separated by a continuous seam .
TEAMGEIST BALL
When it rains it 's not going to be very comfortable for us , it gets very slippery - it also moves a lot in the air
Jens Lehmann
Baseball pitchers conventionally swerve the ball by throwing it with spin .
This " curveball " is very similar to a swerving free kick and the rotating seam trips the boundary layer in much the same way as a football does .
Occasionally though , pitchers serve up a wicked delivery known as the " knuckleball " .
This bobs about randomly in flight and is very disconcerting for batters .
It happens because pitchers throw the ball with very little spin .
Then , as the limited seam rotates lazily in the air flow , it trips the boundary layer at certain points on the surface .
This causes an unpredictable deflection which may be completely reversed when another portion of the seam rotates into the critical position .
The key , of course , is to ensure a very low spin rate , easier to achieve in a baseball throw than a kick .
But this does occasionally happen in football and then the panel pattern can have a big influence on the trajectory .
Mitre ball with 26 panels
The Teamgeist ball with its 14 panels is aerodynamically closer to the baseball than either English ball with 26 panels or the 32 panel hexagon pattern .
So no problem when the Teamgeist spins but watch out if it is kicked with a very slow rotation rate .
Goalkeepers are often criticised for punching or palming away balls which are moving unpredictably , rather than catching them cleanly , but they can be forgiven if they are facing football 's equivalent of a knuckleball .
There will be plenty of spectacular scoring free kicks at the forthcoming World Cup and elite performers like David Beckham , Thierry Henry and Ronaldinho must be itching to get the ball at their feet .
Watch the slow motion replays for the tell - tale movement of the markings on the ball , the best indicator for revealing the kind of spin applied in the shot : sidespin for players like Henry and Ronaldinho but a vital component of topspin when Beckham unleashes his special delivery .
International ball with 32 panels
Most of all look for the rare occasions when the shot produces little or no rotation and the frantic efforts of the poor goalkeeper struggling to come to terms with the ball 's chaotic , meandering flight path .
We are in for an enthralling four weeks of football .
Dr Ken Bray will be taking part in Material World : Science of Football on Radio 4 on Thursday 8 June at 1630 BST .
Scarlett Johansson and Reebok are partnering up on a new project .
Details are very sketchy at the moment while the althetic company keep the details quiet .
At least until July 25 , when their collaborative plans will be unveiled at a New York fete .
No doubt Scarlett will be modeling whatever she is collaborating on with Reebok though .
Already a spokesmodel for L’OrÃ©al , she is also the face of Calvin Klein fragrance , Eternity Moment .
Throw in her stint as a model in Louis Vuitton ’s Fall 2004 advertising campaign , at the grand old age of 21 , she ’s done quite a lot .

Everyone knows that NASA studies space ; fewer people know that NASA also studies Earth .
Since the agency ’s creation almost 50 years ago , NASA has been a world leader in space - based studies of our home planet .
Our mission has always been to explore , to discover , and to understand the world in which we live from the unique vantage point of space , and to share our newly gained perspectives with the public .
That spirit of sharing remains true today as NASA operates 18 of the most advanced Earth - observing satellites ever built , helping scientists make some of the most detailed observations ever made of our world .
In celebration of the deployment of its Earth Observing System , NASA is pleased to share the newest in its series of stunning Earth images , affectionately named the “ Blue Marble . ”
This new Earth imagery enhances the Blue Marble legacy by providing a detailed look at an entire year in the life of our planet .
In sharing these Blue Marble images , NASA hopes the public will join with the agency in its continuing exploration of our world from the unique perspective of space .
To learn more about the development of NASA ’s imagery of the Earth as a whole , read the History of the Blue Marble .
Enhancements Blue Marble : Next Generation offers greater spatial detail of the surface and spans a longer data collection period than the original .
The original Blue Marble was a composite of four months of MODIS observations with a spatial resolution ( level of detail ) of 1 square kilometer per pixel .
Blue Marble : Next Generation offers a year ’s worth of monthly composites at a spatial resolution of 500 meters .
These monthly images reveal seasonal changes to the land surface : the green - up and dying - back of vegetation in temperate regions such as North America and Europe , dry and wet seasons in the tropics , and advancing and retreating Northern Hemisphere snow cover .
From a computer processing standpoint , the major improvement is the development of a new technique for allowing the computer to automatically recognize and remove cloud - contaminated or otherwise bad data — a process that was previously done manually .

It 's easy to knock the telcos nowadays , especially in the wake of the Net neutrality debates .
AT&T and Verizon are lumbering old dinosaur behemoths from the post - war era who are steadily being displaced by the smaller , more agile , more innovative mammals of the Internet ageor so the standard narrative goes .
But before we write off the telcos in general and AT&T in specific , I think it 's worth looking at their legacy of innovation and how that legacy has evolved .
It 's also worth asking if the best metaphor for their troubles in the fast - moving innovation economy is really " dinosaurs being replaced by mammals . "
For my part , I think a better metaphor might be " old people blowing money in an effort to compete with the young , fabulous , and deeply in debt . "
Making fun of the grandparents
When you 're young and fabulous , it 's easy to make fun of old people .
Take this Business Week article , which looks at the state of research and development at the nation 's two largest telcos , AT&T and Verizon , and concludes that said R&D is practically nonexistent .
These old - line companies relics of the bygone telecommunications revolution are now threatened by technological innovation , the author argues , because their business model is centered on extracting tolls from their existing pipes .
Hence the noises about double - charging companies like Google ( once for bandwidth , and then again for access to customers ) .
AT&T's Project Lightspeed , where the company plans to use its pipes to offer its customers moving pictures beamed directly into the home ( this looks suspiciously like " television " ) , was allegedly put forth to Business Week by executives as the premier example of the company 's innovative prowess .
This was supposed to counter the notion that AT&T 's only innovations nowadays are aimed at coming up with new ways to squeeze young Internet upstarts .
The article 's " greedy , out - of - touch old pensioners trying to nickel and dime the kids " narrative is attractive , but the real story is both more complicated and more troubling .
While AT&T may have shown some Business Week author a IPTV demo to pitch him on what the company is doing in the consumer services market , the company has by no means abandoned R&D. AT&T Labs is still open , and it still has multiple active research programs .
In particular , AT&T researchers are working in the areas of voice recognition , network traffic analysis and shaping , the use of graphics processing units for nongraphics DSP algorithms , data mining , information security , wireless networking , and the list goes on ( and on and on ) .
The lab remains one of the largest and most productive in the country , in spite of numerous high - profile splits over the years and quite a bit of downsizing .
The real problem is that what AT&T is doing today is not your grandfather 's R&D , and neither is the work coming out of Google 's labs , or Microsoft's , or the labs of any of the other information economy wunderkinds .
Of pocket protectors and unlimited budgets
The Cold War , with its " Pentagon socialism " , combined with large corporate monopolies that were expected to provide lifetime employment and pensions , made for something of a golden age for American technological innovation .
This is the era that brought us the transistor and the predecessor to the Internet , an era where all the seeds of today 's " information economy " were sown and carefully cultivated at great private and public expense .
The great labs of this eraBell Labs , Xerox PARC , and IBM 's labs were places with massive budgets , where the world 's top scientists were invited to pursue " blue sky " research into areas with no immediately apparent commercial applications .
The facilities were state - of - the - art , and there was no pressure from management or shareholders to do anything but science for science 's sake .
To be able to fund such a lab was a mark of corporate prestige , and the labs themselves , along with their public counterparts like NASA , were major sources of national pride .
For a company like Xerox or AT&T , what it meant to have a blue sky research lab was very much like what it means for a city to host a winning sports team ; it was a source of pride and an anchor of collective identity .
So much like the science that they produced , these labs were ends in themselves .
You might think of these private and public laboratories , with their hordes of young , energetic PhDs and blue - sky research programs , as producers of a kind of scientific capital .
This painstakingly built fund of scientific capital that the postwar era left us was what the later generation of engineers the fabled " two guys in a garage in Silicon Valley " drew on to produce the information revolution that began to burgeon even as the Soviet menace was disintegrating .
Dropping out of school and spending the family fortune
It 's no coincidence that many of those who went on to lead the information revolution were dropouts from either PhD programs or top - notch undergraduate programs .
Even those who finished their doctoral work did n't end up doing open - ended research at the new companies they either founded or joined .
The information economy demanded go - getters who would put their energy towards turning basic science into marketable products , and that economy rewarded those who opted out of more traditional research careers with a mix of world - altering power and cold , hard cash .
Thus many of the truly ambitious adjusted their career aspirations away from the blue sky research labs where their parents might have dreamed of working and focused instead on the new brass ring : the profitable start - up .
Start - ups aimed not at producing scientific capital but at turning it into technological wizardry , and from there into real moneyor , rather , into stock value .
Now , I think it 's important not to oversimplify things too much , or to caricature anyone .
The more agile start - ups played an important structural role in making pure research careers less attractive .
It 's not that everyone was suddenly lured away from doing science by the promise of instant wealth .
The competitive pressure that start - ups and new industries put on established businesses ultimately combined with trust - busting , structural changes in the economy , social shifts , and an array of other factors to turn expensive prestige items like research labs into unaffordable luxuries .
Thus it stands that to one extent or another , all of the aforementioned labs have been downsized and / or transformed over the years into places where research programs must now yield commercial fruit .
In today 's more agile economy , where workers hop from job to job and businesses spring up from nowhere to dominate an industry in the span of half a decade , there 's no longer anything in the private sector like the enduring safety of the Ma Bell monopoly to lavishly support a blue sky research lab .
The closest we have today is Google 's " 20 percent time , " where engineers are encouraged to spend 20 percent of their time working on whatever research project strikes their fancy .
But 20 percent is n't 100 percent .
With today 's short - term corporate focus on maximizing shareholder value by inflating the stock price at all costs , the pressure to innovate comes from the boardroom and the marketing department .
Hence all the men and women in R&D have to be able to make a case for the eventual marketability of what they 're working on or risk being downsized .
We 've come a long way from men with pointy glasses and pocket protectors who spend decades just doing pure science on the corporate dime .
There 's no doubt that the information economy continues to create a lot of wealth , but I think it 's fair to ask if it's also creating enough science to replenish the stock of scientific capital that it 's still burning through .
I think it 's clear that chaotic , market - driven change is a good way to bring ideas quickly and efficiently from concept to profitable product .
However , such a rapid churning of the institutional and cultural landscape ultimately may not be conducive to the kind of steady , expensive , long - term investment in fundamental research that produces the really big ideas that somewhere , at some completely unforeseeable point in the future , change the world .
( And no , before you suggest it , the academy is n't all that insulated from rapidly changing market pressures anymore .
Grant money is doled out to academics by private - sector corporations who are looking for a return on their investment .
But this issue would take up a whole other article . )
Not your grandfather 's Soviet competition , either
I think it's also worth asking ourselves if certain aspects of our current competitive environment are n't setting us up for a future drubbing by countries that are not only willing to spend the kind of money to fund blue sky research both in the private and the public sectors that America once spent in her generation - long effort to out - innovate the Soviets , but also do n't have some of the structural problems that threaten to keep the two guys in the garage from ever bringing a product all the way to market .
The South Koreans and the Chinese in particular have no qualms about building public broadband infrastructure and pumping state money into shiny new research facilities , and while their IP laws are ( thankfully ) tightening , they are not yet headed in the direction of an IP regime that actively stifles innovation and keeps new players out of the market .
Meanwhile , back in America , a perfect storm of rent - seeking behaviors by entrenched players , a broken patent system , a lack of substantial corporate oversight , and old - fashioned executive greed threatens to drown the fabled " two entrepreneurs in a garage " just as surely as those two guys helped sink the blue sky research labs of the Cold War era .
In sum , I worry that not only is the information economy not replenishing the fund of scientific capital that it inherited from the great Cold War - era research labs , but that new start - ups are being actively locked out of the market by means of patent and trade secrets litigation so that a combination of old and new interests can fight over what 's left of the shrinking pie .
World ’s First Sample Of Bio-Diesel From Algae
Aquaflow Bionomic Corporation
MEDIA RELEASE
May 11 , 2006 . 8.00 a.m .
Marlborough Company Produces World ’s First Sample Of Bio-Diesel From Algae Extracted From Region ’s Sewerage Ponds
Marlborough - based Aquaflow Bionomic Corporation announced today that it had produced its first sample of home - grown bio - diesel fuel with algae sourced from local sewerage ponds .
“ We believe this is the world ’s first commercial production of bio - diesel from algae outside the laboratory , in ‘ wild ’ conditions .
To date , bio - diesel from algae has only been tested under controlled laboratory conditions with specially selected and grown algae crops , ” explains Aquaflow spokesperson Barrie Leay .
Bio - diesel could eventually become a sustainable , low cost , cleaner burning fuel alternative for New Zealand , powering family cars , trucks , buses and boats .
It can also be used for other purposes such as heating or distributed electricity generation .
The breakthrough comes after technology start - up , Aquaflow , formed an agreement late last year with Marlborough District Council to undertake a pilot to extract algae from its excess pond discharge .
Algae are the simplest plant organisms that convert sunlight and carbon dioxide in the air around us , into stored energy through the well understood process of photosynthesis .
Although the exact bio - diesel manufacturing technology is a well - guarded secret , the process involves processing the algae pulp before extracting lipid oil which is turned into bio -diesel .
“ Although algae are good at taking most of the nutrients and chemicals out of sewage , too much algae can taint the water and make it smell .
So , councils have to find a way of cleaning up the excess algae in their outflow and recycling the waste product .
And that ’s where Aquaflow comes in , ” says Leay .
By taking the waste product , Aquaflow can create bio -diesel and remove a problem for councils by producing useful clean water , a process known as bio-remediation .
Dairy farmers , and many food processors too , could also benefit from recycling their waste streams that algae thrives in .
Blended with conventional mineral diesel , bio - diesel could run vehicles without the need for vehicle modifications .
It would also help to meet the New Zealand Government B5 ( 5 % blended ) fuel targets by 2008 moving up to B20 as bio - fuel production increases .
Aquaflow was formed in October 2005 and its major shareholders are technology start - up expert , Nick Gerritsen ; and successful renewable energy developers Vicki Buck and Barrie Leay .
CEO Teresa Williams , who has a background in information technology and management from the UK , was appointed in December 2005 .
The company ’s technical expert is Bill Rucks who has a background in aquaculture .
Aquaflow ’s next step is to increase the production from its new technology and test its product in a range of diesel engines .
It has recently applied for funding for further research and development of the technology from the Foundation for Research , Science and Technology .
There will be an opportunity for further private investment when Aquaflow updates its share register shortly .
“ The market potential for this product is almost unlimited in the ‘ Peak Oil ’ environment we are in , as there is now a global demand for bio - diesel of billions of litres per year , ” says Leay .
Leay adds that Aquaflow would begin commercial production immediately on a small scale , and gradually build it up as optimal scale manufacturing technology was proven .
Production is somewhat weather - dependant as algae thrive better on high sunshine levels .
Consequently , sunny Blenheim was selected as the ideal environment to start in .
“ We expect to produce at least 1,000,000 litres of bio - diesel per year from Blenheim , ” says Leay .
Aquaflow could reproduce the bio - diesel process in many other areas of New Zealand and overseas countries could also be interested in the technology .
Unlike some bio-fuels which require crops to be specially grown and thereby compete for land use with food production , and use other scarce resources of fuel , chemicals and fertilizers , the source for algae - based bio - diesel already exists extensively and the process produces a sustainable net energy gain by capturing free solar energy from the sun .

Cato's Letter No. 25
Considerations on the destructive Spirit of arbitrary Power .
With the Blessings of Liberty , and our own Constitution
Thomas Gordon ( Saturday , April 15 , 1721 )
It is the hard fate of the world , that there should be any difference in the views and interests of the governors and governed ; and yet it is so in most countries .
Men who have a trust frankly bestowed upon them by the people , too frequently betray that trust , become conspirators against their benefactors , and turn the sword upon those who gave it ; insomuch that in the greatest part of the earth , people are happy if they can defend themselves against their defenders .
Let us look round this great world , and behold what an immense majority of the whole race of men crouch under the yoke of a few tyrants , naturally as low as the meanest of themselves , and , by being tyrants , worse than the worst ; who , as Mr. Sidney observes , use their subjects like asses and mastiff dogs , to work and to fight , to be oppressed and killed for them .
Even the good qualities and courage of such subjects are their misfortune , by strengthening the wicked hands of their brutal masters , and strengthening their own chains .
Tyrants consider their people as their cattle , and use them worse , as they fear them more .
Thus the most of mankind are become the wretched slaves of those , who are or should be their own creatures ; they maintain their haughty masters like gods , and their haughty masters often use them like dogs :
A fine specimen of gratitude and duty !
Yet this cruel spirit in tyrants is not always owing naturally to the men , since they are naturally like other men ; but it is owing to the nature of the dominion which they exercise .
Good laws make a good prince , if he has a good understanding ; but the best men grow mischievous when they are set above laws .
Claudius was a very harmless man , while he was a private man ; but when he came to be a tyrant , he proved a bloody one , almost as bloody as his nephew and predecessor Caligula ; who had also been a very good subject , but when he came to be the Roman emperor , grew the professed executioner of mankind .
There is something so wanton and monstrous in lawless power , that there scarce ever was a human spirit that could bear it ; and the mind of man , which is weak and limited , ought never to be trusted with a power that is boundless .
The state of tyranny is a state of war ; and where it prevails , instead of an intercourse of confidence and affection , as between a lawful prince and his subjects , nothing is to be seen but jealousy , mistrust , fear , and hatred :
An arbitrary prince and his slaves often destroy one another , to be safe :
They are continually plotting against his life ; he is continually shedding their blood , and plundering them of their property .
Cuncta ferit , dum cuncta timet .
I think it was Justinian , the Emperor , who said , " Though we are above the law , yet we live according to the law . "
But , by his Majesty 's favour , there was more turn than truth in the saying ; for princes that think themselves above law , act almost constantly against all law ; of which truth Justinian himself is a known instance .
Good princes never think themselves above it .
It is an affecting observation , that the power given for the protection of the world , should , in so many places , be turned to the destruction of it .
" As if the law was in force for their destruction , and not for their preservation ; that it should have power to kill , but not to protect , them : A thing no less horrid , than if the sun should burn us without lighting us , or the earth serve only to bury , and not feed and nourish us , "
says Mr. Waller in a speech of his in Parliament .
Despotick power has defaced the Creation , and laid the world waste .
In the finest countries in Asia , formerly full of people , you are now forced to travel by the compass :
There are no roads , houses , nor inhabitants .
The sun is left to scorch up the grass and fruits , which it had raised ; or the rain to rot them :
The gifts of God are left to perish ; there being none of his creatures , neither man nor beast , left to use and consume them .
The Grand Seignior , who ( if we may believe some sanctified mouths , not addicted to lying ) is the vicegerent of heaven , frustrates the bounty of heaven ; and , being the father of his people , has almost butchered them all .
Those few ( comparatively very few ) who have yet survived the miserable fate of their brethren , and are reserved for sacrifices to his cruelty , as occasion offers , and his lust prompts him , live the starving and wretched property of ravenous and bloody bashaws ; whose duty to their master , as well as their own avarice , obliges them to keep the people , over whom they preside , poor and miserable .
But neither bashaws , nor armies , could keep that people in such abject slavery , if their priests and doctors had not made passive obedience a principle of their religion .
The holy name of God is profaned , and his authority belied , to bind down wretchedness upon his creatures , and to secure the tyrant that does it .
The most consummate of all wickedness , and the highest of all evils , are sanctified by the teachers of religion , and made by them a part of it .
Yes , Turkish slavery is confirmed , and Turkish tyranny defended , by religion !
Sir Paul Ricaut tells us , that the Turks maintain , " That the Grand Seignior can never be deposed , or made accountable for his crimes , whilst he destroys carelessly of his subjects under a hundred a day " : ' Tis made martyrdom to die submissively by the hand of the tyrant ; and some of his highest slaves have declared that they wanted only that honour to complete their felicity .
They hold , that it is their duty to submit , though their tyrant " command a whole army of them to precipitate themselves from a rock , or to build a bridge with piles of their bodies for him to pass a river , or to kill one another to afford him pastime and pleasure . "
Merciful God !
Is this government !
And do such governors govern by authority from thee !
It is scarce credible what Monsieur de L'Estoille tells us :
He says he travelled in the Indies for above twenty days together , through lanes of people hanged upon trees , by command of the King ; who had ordered above a hundred thousand of them to be thus murdered and gibbeted , only because two or three robberies had been committed amongst them .

It is one of the great evils of servitude , that let the tyranny be ever so severe , 'tis always flattered ; and the more severe ' tis , the more 'tis flattered .
The oppressors of mankind are flattered beyond all others ; because fear and servitude naturally produce , as well as have recourse to , flattery , as the best means of self - preservation ; whereas liberty , having no occasion for it , scorns it .
Sir Paul Ricaut ascribes the decay of the Ottoman Empire to the force of flattery , and calls the Turkish court , a prison and banniard of slaves .
Old Muley , the Lord 's anointed of Morocco , who it seems is still alive , is thought to have butchered forty thousand of his subjects with his own hands .
Such a father is he of his people !
And yet his right to shed human blood being a genuine characteristick of the church of Morocco , as by law established , people are greedy to die by his hand ; which , they are taught to imagine , dispatches them forthwith to paradise : Insomuch that , though , as I am told , every time he mounts his horse , he slices off the head of the slave that holds his stirrup , to shew that he is as good an executioner as he is a horseman , yet there is a constant contention among his slaves , who shall be the happy martyr on that occasion ; so that several of them crowding to his stirrup at once , for the gracious favour , his Majesty has sometimes the honour to cut off two heads , and to make two saints , with one blow .
The exercise of despotick power is the unrelenting war of an armed tyrant upon his unarmed subjects : it is a war of one side , and in it there is neither peace nor truce .
Tacitus describes it , Saeva jussa , continuas accusationes , fallaces amicitias , perniciem innocentium : " Cruel and bloody orders , continual accusations , faithless friendships , and the destruction of innocents . "
In another place he says , that
" Italy was one continual shambles , and most of its fair cities were defaced or overthrown ;
Rome itself was in many places laid in ashes , with the greatest part of its magnificent buildings : virtue was despised , and barefaced debauchery prevailed .
The solitary islands were filled with illustrious exiles , and the very rocks were stained with slaughters : but , in the city itself , cruelty raged still more ; it was dangerous to be noble , it was a crime to be rich , it was capital to have borne honours , and high treason to have refused them ; and for virtue and merit , they brought sure and sudden destruction . "
These were some of the ravages of absolute dominion !
And as to the common people , the same author says , " They were debauched and dispirited , and given up to idleness and seeing shews . "
Plebs sordida circo & theatris sueta .
Oh ! abject state of such as tamely groan
Under a blind dependency on one !
This is a sort of government , which is too great and heavy a curse for any one to wish , even upon those who are foolish enough , or wicked enough , to contend for its lawfulness ; or , which is the same thing , for submission to it :
But surely , if ever any man deserved to feel the merciless gripesof tyranny , it is he who is an advocate for it .
Phalaris acted justly , when he hanselled his brazen bull with the wretch who invented it .
As arbitrary power in a single person has made greater havock in human nature , and thinned mankind more , than all the beasts of prey and all the plagues and earthquakes that ever were ; let those men consider what they have to answer for , who would countenance such a monstrous evil in the world , or would oppose those that would oppose it .
A bear , a lion , or a tiger , may now and then pick up single men in a wood , or a desert ; an earthquake sometimes may bury a thousand or two inhabitants in the ruins of a town ; and the pestilence may once in many years carry off a much greater number :
But a tyrant shall , out of a wanton personal passion , carry fire and sword through a whole continent , and deliver up a hundred thousand of his fellow creatures to the slaughter in one day , without any remorse or further notice , than that they died for his glory .
I say nothing of the moral effect of tyranny ; though ' tis certain that ignorance , vice , poverty , and vileness , always attend it .
He who compares the world now with what it was formerly , how populous once , how thin now ; and considers the cause of this doleful alteration , will find just reason to fear , that spiritual and temporal tyranny , if they go on much longer , will utterly extinguish the human race .
Of Turkey I have spoken already :
The great continent of America is almost unpeopled , the Spaniards having destroyed , tis thought , about forty millions of its natives ; and for some kingdoms in Europe , especially towards the north , I do not believe that they have now half the inhabitants that they had so lately as a hundred years ago .
Blessed be God , there are still some free countries in Europe , that abound with people and with plenty , and England is the foremost .
This demonstrates the inestimable blessing of liberty .
Can we ever over - rate it , or be too jealous of a treasure which includes in it almost all human felicities ?
Or can we encourage too much those that contend for it , and those that promote it ?
It is the parent of virtue , pleasure , plenty , and security ; and 'tis innocent , as well as lovely .
In all contentions between liberty and power , the latter has almost constantly been the aggressor .
Liberty , if ever it produce any evils , does also cure them :
Its worst effect , licentiousness , never does , and never can , continue long .
Anarchy cannot be of much duration : and where 'tis so , it is the child and companion of tyranny ; which is not government , but a dissolution of it , as tyrants are the enemies of mankind .
Power is like fire ; it warms , scorches , or destroys , according as it is watched , provoked , or increased .
It is as dangerous as useful .
Its only rule is the good of the people ; but because it is apt to break its bounds , in all good governments nothing , or as little as may be , ought to be left to chance , or the humours of men in authority :
All should proceed by fixed and stated rules , and upon any emergency , new rules should be made .
This is the constitution , and this the happiness of Englishmen ; as hath been formerly shewn at large in these letters .
We have a constitution that abhors absolute power ; we have a King that does not desire it ; and we are a people that will never suffer it :
No free people will ever submit to it , unless it steal upon them by treachery , or they be driven into it by violence .
But a state can never be too secure against this terrible , this last of all human evils ; which may be brought upon them by many causes , even by some that at first sight do not seem to threaten any such thing :
And of all those causes , none seems more boding than a general distress , which certainly produces general discontent , the parent of revolutions ; and in what such a circumstance of affairs may end , no man can ever foresee :
Few are brought about without armies ; a remedy almost always worse than the disease .
What is got by soldiers , must be maintained by soldiers ; and we have , in this paper , already seen the frightful image of a military government ; a government , which , at best , is violent and bloody , and eternally inconsistent with law and property .
It is therefore a dreadful wickedness to have any share in giving occasion for those discontents , which are so apt to burst into rage and confusion .
A state sometimes recovers out of a convulsion , and gains new vigour by it ; but it much oftener expires in it .
Heaven preserve me from ever beholding contending armies in England !
They are different things from what they once were .
Our armies formerly were only a number of the people armed occasionally ; and armies of the people are the only armies which are not formidable to the people .
Hence it is , that , in the many revolutions occasioned by the strife between the two royal houses of York and Lancaster , there never was any danger of slavery from an armed force :
A single battle decided the contention ; and next day these popular soldiers went home , and resumed their ordinary arms , the tools of husbandry .
But since that time armies have not been so easily parted with ; but after the danger was over for which they were raised , have often been obstinately kept up , and by that means created dangers still as great .
Some quacks in politicks may perhaps venture publick disturbances , out of an opinion that they shall be able to prevent them by art , or suppress them by force .
But this shews their capacity , as well as their wickedness :
For , not to mention the malignity of their hearts , in risking publick ruin , to gratify a private appetite ; how can any event be certainly foreseen , when the measure of the cause cannot be certainly known ?
They can never ascertain the degree of opposition ; they cannot foreknow what circumstances may happen , nor into whose hands things may fall .
Cicero did not dream , when he employed Octavius for the commonwealth , that his young champion for liberty would ever be the tyrant of his country .
Who could foresee that Cromwell would enslave those whom he was employed to defend ?
But there is no trusting of liberty in the hands of men , who are obeyed by great armies .
From hence may be seen what a fatal and crying crime it would be , in any free country , to break the confidence between the prince and his people .
When loyalty is once turned into indifference , indifference will soon be turned into hatred ; hatred will be returned with hatred ; resentment may produce tyranny , and rage may produce rebellion .
There is no mischief which this mutual mistrust and aversion may not bring forth .
They must therefore be the blackest traitors , who are the first authors of so terrible an evil , as are they who would endeavour to protect them .
Henry III of Castile said , that he feared the curse of his people more than he did the arms of his enemies :
In which saying he shewed as much wisdom as humanity ; since , while he was beloved at home , he had nothing to fear from abroad , and the curses of his subjects were the likeliest means to bring upon him the arms of his enemies .
G. I am , &c .
The path into bankruptcy is now rougher , the path out is steeper , and the change could hardly come at a more difficult time for many US consumers .
An overhaul of the bankruptcy code - which takes effect Monday - means that Americans will face higher fees and higher burdens of proof before having any debts wiped clean in court .
The law aims to encourage more responsible behavior by a debt - drenched nation , and to rein in abuses of bankruptcy protection .
The motive is laudable , many say .
But the new law also creates additional burdens for many Americans at a time of rising pocketbook challenges .
Energy prices have surged .
Interest rates are rising .
Credit - card firms are boosting rates for high - risk customers while raising minimum payments .
And a trend of rising home values , which has helped sustain consumer spending , may be slowing .
" If that goes ... you 've got a very combustible situation , " says Brad Stroh , who heads Freedom Financial Network in San Mateo , Calif .
" We think the fourth quarter could be very , very difficult for the American consumer . "
Consumer spending now drives more than two - thirds of US economic activity , and an era of low interest rates has helped borrowers do much of that spending .
Now the climate appears to be shifting .
Even as the price of goods accelerates , so is the price of borrowing .
At the same time , the hurdles for people who get into financial trouble just got higher .
By making bankruptcy tougher , the new law affects more than 1 million people annually who typically face a combination of debt and dire straits , such as illness , a job loss , or divorce .
" In some ways it 's going to affect everyone who files for bankruptcy , because the cost is going to go up , " says Deborah Thorne , an Ohio University sociologist who has researched bankruptcy .
Lawyers may charge another $ 500 or so because of new paperwork requirements .
And the government 's fee for a Chapter 7 filing is now $ 274 , up from $ 209 .
But the law 's main impact is targeted toward those with reasonably strong incomes .
Its core feature is a means test , designed to steer more of these people toward Chapter 13 bankruptcy ( in which they pay what they can to creditors over a five - year period ) rather than Chapter 7 ( which quickly eliminates many debts ) .
Between the means test and higher bankruptcy fees , the result could be to discourage some people from filing for protection from creditors .
The ranks of those " underground " - struggling to avoid creditors and get by - could grow .
Others would achieve greater financial discipline , in or out of court .
Here 's how the new system compares with the old :
Until now , the system relied strongly on a judge 's discretion .
Petitions for Chapter 7 could be accepted or rejected , but there was no standard means test .
The new system has a multistep test for entering Chapter 7 .
First , the filer 's family income over the past six months is considered .
If it 's below the state median , Chapter 7 is available .
If it 's higher than the median , the court will examine the filer 's ability to pay debts .
The judge considers whether , after allowing for living expenses , the filer can pay at least $ 100 a month to creditors - and whether within five years the total payments can reach either $ 10,000 or 25 percent of unsecured debts ( such as credit cards ) .
If so , the door to Chapter 7 slams shut .
Probably .
The law also provides for extraordinary circumstances to qualify people for Chapter 7 protection .
A severe illness is one example .
Another is hurricane Katrina .
Storm victims are being given some extra leeway .
Some data suggest that 15 percent of Chapter 7 filers may be above the median income in the states where they live , says Nathalie Martin , a scholar at the American Bankruptcy Institute in Washington .
But it may be only about 5 percent , she reckons , who actually get bumped out of Chapter 7 by the new law .
Still , for those affected , the shift is significant .
If they file under Chapter 13 , a judge will determine how much of their income they can use for living costs - a budget now based on formulas developed by the Internal Revenue Service .
The rest will go to creditors , generally for a five - year period .
It can be a grueling financial workout , judging by the two - thirds dropout rate of debtors who try to navigate Chapter 13 .
Creditors , including the bank - card industry , lobbied for years to get the new law through Congress .
But in the end , America 's bankruptcy woes are partly the making of lenders themselves , some observers say .
Lenders aggressively market everything from credit cards to interest - only home loans , and bankruptcy rates have risen in proportion with consumer debt .
" Bankruptcy filings were up , but nowhere near as much as credit - card profits , " Brad Botis , an Alabama bankruptcy attorney , said Friday as he raced to help people rushing to file before the law took effect .
The legal change comes alongside voluntary steps by the industry to crack down on delinquent payers .
In the past year , it has become common for consumers to see interest rates rise on all of their cards if they miss a payment on one , for example .
Another change , forced on consumers by the federal government , will test borrowers ' wherewithal starting this winter .
New rules require sizable minimum - payment hikes , to make sure each monthly payment covers at least 1 percent of the balance on a card .
" The end goal is a good one " - to help people avoid years of debt buildup , says Mr. Stroh , whose firm tries to help people avoid bankruptcy .
" The unfortunate consequence is that some people living month to month are suddenly in serious trouble . "
Key provisions of the new bankruptcy law
• The law 's centerpiece is a means test , intended to force more bankruptcy filers to pay what they can to creditors ( Chapter 13 status ) , rather than allowing them to wipe out debt quickly ( Chapter 7 status ) .
• People must get credit counseling before filing , a move that may help some avoid bankruptcy .
• No one can exit bankruptcy without taking a course in managing finances .
• Some types of debt , such as certain education loans , have been added to a roster of obligations that cannot be erased through bankruptcy .
• Bankruptcy attorneys can face penalties if petitions contain incorrect information about a client 's finances .
• To crack down on " serial filers , " an individual can file under Chapter 7 only once in eight years ( up from six years ) .
• The law will help curb abusive practices , from big ones ( such as buying an expensive home to use it to try to shield assets from creditors ) to small ones ( such as buying a luxury item just before entering bankruptcy ) .

There ’s a Screwed Scenario that I missed .
Back in my Borland days , we were working hard on Paradox for Windows .
I was a QA engineer testing the database creation and modification functionality .
My counterpart in engineering , Jerry , was working hard , but getting absolutely nowhere .
We were mid-to - late in a 1.0 product cycle and most of the engineers were slowly moving from development into bug fix mode , but not Jerry , he was still implementing … over and over again .
That ’s the Screwed Scenario , you ’ve given a critical task to someone who is utterly unable to complete it .
Now , let ’s first give Jerry a break .
He was a fine programmer , but he had two major strikes against him .
First , Jerry had never programmed for Windows .
so he was learning while he was coding .
Second , this was also a 1.0 product .
I ’ve got an article kicking around my head about 1.0 product development … it ’s titled “ 1.0 spelled One point oh my god I ’m never going to see my family again and , dear lord , I ’m going to take the company out while I ’m at it . ”
Short version : 1.0 is incredibly hard and combined with his Windows inexperience , Jerry was in trouble .
Yet , Jerry has pride .
Jerry believed that he could pull it off , but being on the receiving end of his code , I observed a disturbing coding practice which we ’ll call “ moving crap around on your plate ” .
Jerry ’s approach to fixing his bugs was to move his code around in interesting ways much the way you used to shove food around on your plate in a feeble attempt to convince your Mom that you actually ate your beets .
Nothing substantively changes , it just looks different .
Another name for this coding practice might be “ Coding by hope ” .
The end result with Jerry ’s code was each time he ’d fix something , we ’d discover another fundamental problem with the feature .
Yes , small incremental progress was being made with each bug fix , but Jerry was in a losing situation because his basic architecture was crap .
When asked for status , his lists of excuses were astonishingly believable .
They were the excuses of a person who honestly believed he could pull it off and was willing to put in the hours to do it , but all the hours in the world was n’t going to help Jerry because he was in over his head .
If you ’re the manager in this scenario , you ’ve got to make a major change because you can not release crap .
There are companies that do this and end up making a tidy profit .
You are not that person because once you are rewarded for releasing crap , you begin a blind walk down a path of mediocrity that ends up with you working at Computer Associates on a product no one has heard of and that no one cares about .
It ’s a two step fix process .
We needed to make a Jerry adjustment and then we needed a miracle .
I ’ll start with the easy one .
We needed Jerry .
He ’s the only one who knows what the hell is going on in that pile of spaghetti and he can fix trivial bugs .
The engineering manager sat Jerry down and told him we need to focus on quantity .
There were scads of trivial little fixes all over the place that had been ignored and Jerry could handle those .
Yes , he was pissed , but in a few weeks , Jerry was cranking because people always work better when they know they have the ability to complete a task .
With Jerry adjusted , we had to face another fact , we were six months from shipping and we had a major portion of functionality that was cobbled together and barely working .
In this scenario , you need a unique talent .
You need a Free Electron .
The Free Electron is the single most productive engineer that you ’re ever going to meet .
I have not even provided a definition and I ’m guessing a person has already popped into your mind that fits the bill .
A Free Electron can do anything when it comes to code .
They can write a complete application from scratch , learn a language in a weekend , and , most importantly , they can dive into a tremendous pile of spaghetti code , make sense of it , and actually getting it working .
You can build an entire businesses around a Free Electron .
They ’re that good .
Free Electron Got ’chas :
» There are two classes of Free Electrons .
Sr. Electrons and Jr. Electrons .
Both have similarly productivity yields , but the Senior versions have become politically aware .
In technology savvy organizations , most CTOs fall into this category .
Think Bill Joy .
The Junior versions have all the ability , they just do n’t have the experience of dealing with people because they spent a lot of the youth writing their own operating system as a intellectual exercise .
These Junior electrons represent the single best hire you can make as a hiring manager .
If you get two in twenty years , you ’re doing something right .
» Misdirected Free Electron intensity can yield odd results .
On one project , I assigned a couple of slippery memory corruption bugs to a Free Electron who nodded quietly and promptly vanished for a week .
When he returned , the bugs were fixed and the entire database layer had been rewritten .
A piece of code that ’d taken two engineers roughly six months to design had been totally redone in seven days .
Sound like a great idea until you realize we were working on a small update and did not have the resources or time to test a brand spankin ’ new database layer .
Oops .
» Free Electrons sometimes will never engage and they ’ll never explain why .
Free Electrons are high functioning and have a strong opinion about everything … but they may never tell you that opinion .
If you ’re asking them to do something that they do n’t believe in , they are n’t going to do it … ask all you want .
The worst case is when you ask a Free Electron to pull of a diving save and they nod in the affirmative and promptly return to whatever they were doing before you distracted them with your useless request
One week later , you ’re going to be expecting the miracle , but the Free Electron is going to plainly say , “ Have n’t got to that ” .
One week more , your hair is going to be mostly pulled out , and then you ’re going to realize you did n’t need a miracle in the first place and inaction was the right move .
Your Free Electron knew that two weeks ago .
He / she just did n’t want to take the two hours to draw the picture for you …
Annoying , huh ?
You ’ll get over it .
» You might expect Free Electrons to exhibit the personality of other uber - nerds , but often they do not .
The main Free Electron at Netscape was the most decent human being I ’ve met in recent memory .
He also rode a unicycle .
» There are two primary tasks in an engineering organization .
Research and Development .
While the Free Electron is imminently capable of doing the development , their value in the organization is research .
They define the bleeding edge .
If you leave a Free Electron in the development role too long , they will vanish and you will have permanently damage the future productivity of your organization .
Back to Jerry .
Enter Bernard , Borland ’s resident Free Electron .
Up until he started poking around the code , I had no idea what Bernard actually did .
He had a office .
It was full of books .
He talked a lot and produced little visible work .
“ Blowhard ” is what I thought .
Bernard started tinkering with Jerry ’s code on a Friday afternoon .
The next Monday , I was able to run through my functional test matrix for the first time ever .
By the end of that week , Bernard had closed a majority of the high severity bugs and was beginning to tread in fix areas reserved for Jerry .
The following week I was racing to file bugs to keep Bernard engaged .
That is a Free Electron at work .
Sleep apnoea usually jolts people awake
They say a cumulative loss of cells in the area of the brain that controls breathing is to blame - triggering a condition called central sleep apnoea .
However , they believe many such deaths in elderly people are misdiagnosed as heart failure .
The study , by the University of California , Los Angeles , is published in Nature Neuroscience .
SLEEP APNOEA
Central sleep apnoea : Triggered by problems with the brain 's breathing centre Obstructive sleep apnoea : Breathing stops when the airway collapses
The researchers had previously pinpointed a region of the brainstem they dubbed the preBötzinger complex ( preBötC ) as the command post for generating breathing in mammals .
They had also identified a small group of cells within this area as being responsible for issuing the commands .
Cells killed
In the latest study , they injected rats with a compound to kill more than half of these cells - and then monitored the animals ' breathing patterns .
When the animals entered the rapid eye movement phase of sleep - when dreaming occurs - they stopped breathing completely , and were jolted into consciousness in order to start again .
Over time , the breathing lapses increased in severity , spreading to other phases of sleep , and eventually occurring when the animals were awake as well .
Rats possess 600 of the specialised cells .
The researchers believe humans have a few thousand , which are slowly lost over a lifetime .
Lead researcher Professor Jack Feldman said : " We speculate that our brains can compensate for up to a 60 % loss of preBötC cells , but the cumulative deficit of these brain cells eventually disrupts our breathing during sleep .
" There 's no biological reason for the body to maintain these cells beyond the average lifespan , and so they do not replenish as we age .
" As we lose them , we grow more prone to central sleep apnoea . "
The UCLA team believes that central sleep apnoea may pose a particular risk to elderly people , whose heart and lungs are already weaker due to age .
They also suspect the condition strikes people suffering the late stages of neurodegenerative disorders , such as Parkinson 's disease .
These people often have breathing difficulties during sleep , and the researchers believe their bodies eventually reach a point where they are unable to rouse themselves from sleep when they stop breathing .
The UCLA team plans to analyse the brains of people who die from neurodegenerative diseases to determine whether these patients show damage in their preBötzinger complexes .
Frank Govan , of the UK Sleep Apnoea Trust , told the BBC News website that previous work had linked cot death to obstructive sleep apnoea - caused by collapse of the airways .
However , he said science had failed to prove the link .
He said : " These chaps may well be right , that the link is between central sleep apnoea - rather than obstructive sleep apnoea - and cot death , and unexplained adult death . "
For months the world has been anticipating the arrival of the Brangelina baby .
Tabloids and bloggers have been speculating that this baby is destined to be the Most Beautiful Child Ever .
New York Magazine ruffled feathers when stating " Not since Jesus has a baby been so eagerly anticipated . "
What I 'd like to speculate is ..... what if the offspring of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt is n't as stunningly gorgeous as everyone assumes ?
What if she 's just a regular looking baby .... maybe even a little goofy looking ?
It could happen !
Just one look at the adorable baby Kevin Federline was able to produce for Britney Spears shows just how unpredictable the genetic lottery can be .
Congratulations to the growing Jolie - Pitt clan .
We 're happy to learn that little Shiloh Nouvel Jolie - Pitt has arrived healthy and without complication .
Despite my contrary speculation , there 's a high likelihood this kid is going to be a looker .

“ There are ominous signs that the Earth ’s weather patterns have begun to change dramatically , ” begins the April 28 , 1975 , Newsweek article reprinted today on the opposite page .
But this was n’t a prediction of global warming .
A new Ice Age worried Newsweek and its reporter , Peter Gwynne .
Future scenarios of widespread devastation , famine and starvation loomed because the Earth was getting cooler .
“ [ T ] he present decline has taken the planet about a sixth of the way toward the Ice Age average , ” Mr. Gwynne wrote .
The scientific community was abuzz with fear .
Melting the ice caps or diverting Arctic rivers to warm the globe were proposed .
It never amounted to anything .
Temperatures began rising again in 1975 , reversing the cooling trend that began in 1940 .
As for the food scarcity which was “ destined ” to impact “ the great wheat - producing lands of Canada and the U.S.S.R. in the North , ” plus the tropics , the opposite has happened .
We ’ve seen an explosion in agricultural productivity to sustain the world ’s burgeoning population .
We reprint this false alarm not to suggest that the current arguments about global warming are wrong .
We do n’t know them to be right or wrong ; there is too much scientific uncertainty clouding the issue .
Rather , we simply wish to point out that scientists and the journalists and government agencies who cite them have been wrong on the subject of climate change before , quite recently in fact .
The judgment of the scientific community — much less the judgment of international political entities or scribblers who cite them as authorities — should not control this debate .
“ The science is settled , ” say the proponents ; the consensus exists .
But too often the disclaimers and scientific qualifiers get edited out of those press releases .
And science is not about consensus in any event .
It is about testing hypotheses and building evidence through experimentation .
In 1975 , Newsweek ’s correspondent was convinced that politicians would fail to prevent the coming Ice Age .
“ The longer the planners delay , the more difficult will they find it to cope with climatic change once the results become grim reality , ” Mr. Gwynne intoned darkly .
Thankfully , they did not take the global - cooling bait .
The global - warming enthusiasts who now control this debate may or may not turn out to be this generation ’s Peter Gwynnes .
But clearly they have been far too quick in their rush to judgment .
Time and scientific evidence will tell the true story behind climate change .
The policy solutions , if any are needed , will follow .

We have made Linux ready .
Now let 's make the users ready too .
Part I .
I was lazily reading last OSnews when I got stuck into a link to this post by mr.akaimbatman .
It is just one of the bazillion articles / blog posts I 've read about what the Linux desktop would have to be .
But now I 'm tired , and so I rant .
After a long Windows - only experience , it 's two years I happily use Linux on the desktop 24/7 ( with the exception of the Windows XP box I still have to use at work ) , and it's two years I read this kind of articles .
These articles just get me sick .
They get me sick because they invariably miss the point .
They take a lot of myths about the lack of adoption of Linux on the desktop and they try to solve them with titanic scenarios of complete desktop environment / filesystem refactoring .
While there could be many nice individual ideas in their proposed solutions , they completely lack the sense of time and pragmatism .
The reason is simple .
All your super ideas about rebuilding the filesystem hierarchy of Linux or merging GNOME and KDE in a single , ultra-cool , ultra -easy desktop environment can be all the best you can think about ( most of time they 're not , but let 's give them a chance ) .
The fact is simply that , given the number of developers and the pace of development of open source software , when all this will happen - if it will happen - we will be already be light years behind other operating systems .
Period .
To make Linux a practical desktop solution for the masses we do not need to turn the guts of Linux and X upside down .
This is a sin of naivete .
We just need a little rational change of mind from the community , and a big effort from the software industry .
Let me explain .
It will take some post to do it , so prepare to read .
Ok ?
Well , start with
Part I .
I. Linux IS easy and ready for ( most of the ) desktop .
People must just learn its basics .
We who use Linux on the desktop do n't find it hard .
To me Linux is pretty easy when it comes to everyday tasks - even easier than WinXP .
So where 's the point ?
When John ' PC User '
Doe hears about Linux he usually hears a lot of enthusiastic geeks that assure him that Windows is shit and that Linux is the solution of all John Doe problems .
Then John Doe will reply " but I heard Linux is good on servers but not on the desktop " and geeks will point him on the latest - and - greatest Mandriva or SuSE .
Until now everything looks almost OK .
What will happen then ?
What will happen is that John Doe , assured that his new shiny Linux will be easy to use , will try to install and use it on his desktop or - much worse - on his laptop .
Then John
Doe will fill a hundred of forums asking for silly questions like " how do I install the drivers of the webcam I have on the webcam CD ? " or " how do I play my iTunes DRM - protected files ? " or " why does not my USB ADSL modem works ? "
More sooner than later most John Doe 's will throw the towel and return to Windows , hastily disgusted from Linux .
Now , the commonplace deduction is : John
Doe bad experience has shown that Linux is not ready for the desktop , because " this is hard , that is inconsistent , that else is awkward " .
Is this right ?
No .
It does n't mean Linux is perfect - it is absolutely not .
But this is not the reason John Doe finds Linux difficult or even unusable .
John
Doe did find Linux difficult to use becase he did not learn its basics .
He did not learn about it .
He never read the instruction manual .
When a friend asks me to introduce him into Linux , he almost always says " hey , help me install it , then I will learn it by myself " .
This will just lead them into troubles .
Most PC users have known just DOS and Windows , and just cannot think about something so different .
They expect a drive C : or a self - extracting , graphical installer just because they never have known anything else , not because it is intrinsecally easier .
What I answer to my John Doe 's that want to install Linux is : read documentation first .
Please understand to the last word : f i r s t .
This does not mean at all forcing them reading kilotons of man pages .
This means telling them the truth : that Linux is different from Windows , and that if they do not readily know the basic differences between the systems before the switch , they will be lost , not less than I would be lost if parachuted in the center of an unknown city .
Tell them to look on Google and the Wikipedia , to get familiar with the filesystem hierarchy , the distribution diversity , the meaning of magic words like " shell " , " kernel " , " window manager " , " mount point " , " package manager " and so on .
They do n't need to become gurus .
They just need simple , clear concepts like " X is the program that controls the graphics on Linux .
It is a separate program , not a part of the OS like in Windows .
X itself just controls the basics , but your desktop behaviour and appearance will depend on another program , that 's the window manager or desktop manager .
There are quite a few , you can try some of them and then pick up the one you like , so your desktop can fit your needs and tastes much better . "
Tell them even to look at screenshots of KDE and GNOME , so they will be already familiar with their new graphic environment .
Tell them the command line exists and that they do n't have to fear it .
Show them simple examples of how it works , and why it is more flexibile and fast than GUI alternatives for simple tasks like " how much space do I have on my partitions ? " .
Only once they will have some familiarity with Linux concepts , give them a live cd .
Tell them they can play with the live cd as much as they want , and they will understand the concepts they 're read about and can begin to " feel " Linux under their hands .
Most people will gladly listen and understand such explanations and will actively do it if politely but firmly advised it 's good for them to do so .
If they say " oh , I will learn it later , just install it " explain them that it 's nothing hard , but that they will be LOST if they do n't learn , and that it 's like to pretend to be able to drive a train just because you can drive a car .
If they still insist , well , advice them not to switch , or to prepare for pain .
I know what I say because I had the luck to be prepared to Linux with this approach .
When I first considered switching , I just wanted to download all Debian Woody CDs and install them .
A friend of mine ( the other dude writing on this blog , BTW ! ) warned me , pointed me to Knoppix and Mandrake and told me that things would have been easier by learning something before .
So I downloaded a bunch of tutorials about Linux , I bought a couple of Linux magazines and I spent a couple of weeks by googling and reading stuff .
Only after I felt ready to boot a Knoppix , and after some day spent by playing around with Knoppix I finally installed Mandrake 9.1 .
I remember I was almost disappointed by how easy the transition was , but I realized immediately it was so easy because I was already knowing the basics .
And when I see newbies ranting on forums about how bad Linux is , everyone realized they just did n't take the time / will to learn BEFORE installing .
Now to my corollary , point I.a :
I.a : Installing Linux applications is damn easy .
I sadly laughed when I read that he still thinks installing applications on Linux is hard .
This was perhaps true years ago , it is pure FUD now .
Let me say it clearly :
There 's nothing easier in XXI - century computing than installing Linux applications with a package manager .
I repeat with other words :
There 's nothing easier than an apt - get or an emerge that can be done on computers today .
There are a billion of potentially difficult or awkward things on Linux , but installing applications is not one of these .
In fact , strange as it may seem , I started using Linux and I continue to use it almost mainly for this precise reason .
With Linux I have literally thousands of applications that I can install instantly , free of charge and that I can trust because they are Open Source .
Do this thought experiment .
Imagine a world where Debian or Gentoo are the main operating systems of the planet , and where a new player - Windows - is struggling to conquer the desktop .
Now a newbie Windows user tries to install his favourite music player .
He is accustomed to XMMS , which he installed simply by ( 1 ) firing the command line ( 2 ) getting root and ( 3) typing " apt - get xmms install " , and now wants to install Winamp .
Imagine him knowing well his Debian - based distro but knowing almost nothing about Windows .
I 'm sure he will first look for a " Package manager " or " Software install " program on his Start menu and / or Control Panel .
He wo n't find anything useful .
He will try the command line , but nothing seems to come from there .
So he will look on the Internet what kind of package management Windows has ; he will find it is almost none .
Amazed and disappointed , he will eventually look for Winamp on the Internet and he will download it .
He will find himself with an executable file , something he has never associated with software packages .
He will eventually double - click it , and he will find an overwhelmingly annoying graphical install that will ask him silly questions like " where do you want to install me ? " , and he will stare in confusion by understanding that no /usr / bin exists on Windows .
If he 's clever he will eventually understand the logic of the process : he will find it also awkward and unnecessarily complex .
I expect also him quite upset when he will understand there 's no " emerge - Du world " that will help him upgrade all his software , but that he will have to do program - by - program , painfully .
So here 's explained the ridicule of this assertion by akaimbatman ( the author of the post linked above ) :
Package management is one of those concepts that seems great on the outset , but fails in practice .
The issue is that each package has a complex chain of dependencies unique to itself .
In order to be certain that a package is compatible with all installations , all combinations of installed packages must be tested !
As it is unlikely that anyone would go through so much trouble , the incompatibilities between packages accumulate , and before long the packaging system is rejecting new installs .
And that 's assuming that a graphical installer exists !
If a graphical installer does not exist , then life becomes even more difficult for the end user .
Instead of launching a GUI and selecting the applications he wants , the user must open a terminal and begin typing cryptic commands for which he has no training for .
Many proponents of packaging systems downplay these issues by stating that packaging errors do n't exist on system XYZ ( despite proof to the contrary ) , and that if the user is running Linux he should be " smart enough " to know how to use the command line .
Such statements are just silly .
Users want the computer to make their lives easier .
Any barrier thrown in their way will only drive them to a different platform .
Unfortunately , package managers still drive most Linux desktop distributions ..
You 're utterly wrong .
The packaging system is one of the biggest strenghts of Linux , because it makes installing application easy .
Take your Windows fellow and let him see you can start from zero to a fully Internet - aware desktop by typing something like " apt - get firefox gaim xchat thunderbird gftp amule install " instead that downloading and installing a thousand of separate applications from their respective web pages .
Oh , your friend does not like typing ?
Well , let him point - and - click on Guitoo or Mandrake graphic urpmi or something similar .
But do n't be ridicolous tellimg me that typing " emerge gaim " is difficult , please .
The fact the user has no training for typing " emerge foo " IS WRONG , not the package manager .
Users need to learn , THEN to use the system .
Would you click on an executable installer , if no one ever told you that 's the way to install software ?
Mr.akaimbatman for some reason also tells me that package managers do n't work , that they fail continuously .
This is pure FUD .
Packaging errors are incredibly rare , despite theorical arguments for the contrary .
In 2 years of Linux I just found one real package management error , in an obscure bioinformatic Gentoo ebuild .
Mailing the package maintainer solved the issue in 48 hours .
That 's what open source is for .
We should tell to newbie that want to switch how powerful are the package management systems of Linux .
Surely it would be nice to have them somehow unified ( but why do n't we write a wrapper around all three main package managers ?
It would be even easier , and transparent , and it would n't involve improbable revolutions ) .
But they work .
They are damn easy and powerful .
Tell our friends Linux is better , because of package management .
I.a.1. : Dealing with non-packaged applications
There is still the problem of applications not included as packages of your current distribution .
Finding software is still much easier than on Windows , because you can look for it on Freshmeat or Source Forge or on Savannah , that is , on centralized repositories .
The problem is installing tarballs .
There are solutions for this problem , that this time belong to the Linux community instead of the end user maybe , but they 're do n't require any massive rewriting of core components .
First solution , write a compiling packages helper .
This requires not much more than being a simple text - based and / or GUI - based thing that gently unpackages the tarball , executes " ./ configure " , " make " and " make install " ( or , better , " checkinstall " ) , and gently prompts any error encountered in a comprehensible way .
( Hey , I just found the Python project I was looking for to cut my teeth on ! )
This still requires advanced feedback from the end user if something goes wrong , or if customization is needed , but if everything is right it would be nothing harder than an apt - get or a double - click installer .
Second solution , distribute static binaries .
If dependency hell is your problem , this is perhaps the best solution .
I actually love the shared library concept , but I can see that has drawbacks .
For big , common libraries like GTK or QT , they can actually be something that the user do n't want to install properly , because he / she wo n't need them except than for one single app , and he / she wants to be sure that single app just works ( so we do n't want to go into things like " it works with GTK 2.2.3 but not 2.4.1 " ) .
For obscure , little dependencies it can be a hell to find them , and it 's sad many good apps fall into oblivion just because they depend on a bunch of libnotinstalledonanysystem .so .
Building static binaries would solve it : moreover static binaries will run happily compiled with their older libs if newer , not retro-compatible ones are already installed , allowing to avoid contorsionisms like installing KDE 2 libs on a KDE 3 system , for instance .
I think it would be foolish to install and distribute static binaries only , but they should be presented as an option by all free software developers ( and commercial too ) .
The second part of akaimbatman critics the filesystem hierarchy of Linux .
Here I declare :
I.b : The filesystem structure of Linux is no problem for the end user .
I can't see why the end user should see the directory structure of Linux as a problem ( or at least as a major problem ) .
Most of the time they will use only their / home directory , and that 's actually one of the things that makes Linux easier and friendlier than Windows .
They have no problem to know where is their program , because they will know it is almost always is /usr / bin / program , if they ever need to .
Again , it is simply matter of " hey , newbie Linux user , read about the Linux directory structure !
You will find it is really rational and simple : all general configuration files are in /etc , all everyday program binaries are in / usr / bin and so on " .
It is also much friendlier to know your cdrom drive is always / mnt / cdrom than an odd D : , E : or Q : .
Again , it is nothing hard if you take the time to understand it before actually using it instead of diving into it expecting that every OS on the planet must be a Windows clone .
All advices to change directory structure and all the GoboLinuxes of this world are plain useless , desperate attempts to make of Linux filesystem a fake Windows filesystem .
There 's nothing bad about both filesystems : they are just different , they need to be understood , and they are out of the user way most of time .
We can always try to improve a bit the current scheme , but in general it has nothing bad or awkward .
Init scripts structures ( SysV or BSD ) are surely something that can be improved in the sense of clarity and easiness , for example .
But for most part all criticism I 've read is basically " This is not Windows " , and as such is of no importance .
Ok , enough for now .
Of course there are things with Linux that are not good , but they 're simply not always the ones that are believed to ( and definitely NOT what akaimbatman thinks they are ) .
We 're just smashing some involuntary FUD here .
New chapters will follow .
Comment ANTs
Software , otherwise known simply as ANTs ( which actually stands for Asynchronous Non-preemptive Tasks ) , is little known , yet it is a public company that has been around since the 80s .
It started life working on parallel supercomputers but then faded into dormancy for the best part of a decade .
It then re-emerged in 1999 as a project to implement its MPP ( massively parallel processing ) expertise within the database field .
As a result the ANTs Data Server ( ADS ) was launched last November .
There are a number of interesting things to say about ADS .
The first is that it contradicts almost everything that I used to write about databases back in the 90s .
Then , we regularly used to castigate the likes of Sybase for being late in implementing row - level locking , which we regarded as being essential for OLTP ( on - line transaction processing ) environments .
Well , ADS not only does not implement row - level locking it promises a lock - free environment altogether .
There are a number of facilities that allow this .
First , it allows simultaneous updates to a row , provided that different fields are being updated .
Secondly , it treats separate updates to the same field ( say , adding three stock and deducting two ) as arithmetic operations where these are commutative ( that is , where operations can be performed in any sequence and produce mathematically consistent results ) .
It is only when neither of these conditions applies that the software has to resort to traditional means : serialising the process of update based on user - defined priorities .
The second interesting thing about ADS is that ANTs claims that it typically runs five to 15 times faster than standard relational databases .
The fact that it offers a lock - free environment is one reason for this .
Another is that it uses a process called " preparation by compilation " which effectively means that SQL is compiled into binary code and then held in memory , where it can be ( re -) executed as required .
A third reason for its performance advantage is that ADS treats memory as its main area for processing .
However , unlike in - memory databases such as TimesTen ( now part of Oracle ) ADS overflows to disk where necessary .
Finally , a fourth reason is that ADS creates multiple threads when it is started but it never closes them - keeping them open and re-assigning them as needed , thus saving the overhead of starting up threads .
The third interesting thing about ADS is that its superior performance does not seem to have compromised scalability .
For example , Nextel , one of its customers , is processing 10 million transactions per day using ADS .
The fourth interesting thing about ADS is that as standard it comes with support for Oracle schemas , stored procedures ( PL / SQL ) , triggers and so on .
In principle , you can take an Oracle database with all of its logic and implement it , without change , on ADS .
What 's more , this facility is not limited to Oracle but also applies to Sybase and SQL Server with support for Transact - SQL and T - SQL .
In the next two releases , due before Christmas , this support will be extended to other well - known databases .
The last sentence may raise some eyebrows : two releases before Christmas !
ANTs makes a big play of its combined R&D and QA capabilities .
It has 500 + servers in its data centre and all new code is checked in and quality tested hourly .
Typically , it claims to do 3,000 hours of automated QA testing every day , across all supported platforms ( 11 of them ) - so that 's why it reckons to be able to turn out new releases so quickly .
Finally , there is one more interesting thing about ADS : it is less expensive than any of the products it is aiming to replace .
In fact , the company is not solely aiming at the replacement market but it is also addressing the high performance OLTP market in its own right , as well as the SMB sector .
In this last case , its entry - level pricing is $ 1,995 per server per year for a maximum of 2 CPUs ( which may be dual core ) including , where appropriate , some migration services .
To conclude , ANTs may still be a strange name for a database company but it has a product that it is certainly worth watching .

XKeymacs
XKeymacs is a keyboard utility to realize emacs like - useability on all windows applications .
With XKeymacs you can use emacs keybindings with any windows application .
You can create a keyboard macro and assign any shortcut key too .
You also get bash - like command completion in your DOS shell .
If you do not know Emacs , Xemacs , Mule or Meadow , you probably want nothing to do with XKeymacs .
I began to make XKeymacs because I wanted to add C-t and C-l to Keymacs .
Now that all the functions I want are available , I think I will burnish XKeymacs by adding new functions that users want and to fix bugs .
Supported OS : Windows 95 , 98 , Me , NT 4.0 , 2000 , XP , 2003 , Vista ( Internet Explorer 5.0 is required on Windows 95 , 98 or NT 4.0 . )

We are mortgaging ourselves to foreigners on a scale that would make George Washington cry .
Every day — every single day — we borrow a billion dollars from foreigners to buy petroleum from abroad , often from countries that hate us .
We are the beggars of the world , financing our lavish lifestyle by selling our family heirlooms and by enslaving our progeny with the need to service the debt .
I do n't see this — except for the taxes — as a Republican thing or a Democratic thing .
It 's just the way we live today .
Drunken sailors from the Capitol to the freeways .
Heirs living on their inheritance and spending it fast .
The titans of corporate America getting as much as they can get away with and hiring lawyers and public - relations people if there is a problem .
It is later than anyone dares to think .
Is this America , where far too many of the rich endlessly loot their stockholders and kick the employees in the teeth , the America that our soldiers in Ramadi and Kirkuk and Anbar Province and Afghanistan are fighting for ?
Is this America , where we will end up so far behind the financial eight ball we wo n't be able to see because of mismanagement by both parties , the America that our men and women are losing limbs for , coming home in boxes for ?
The Saturday before Memorial Day , I spoke at a gathering of widows and widowers , parents and children of men and women in uniform who have lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The person who spoke before me was a beautiful woman named Joanna Wroblewski , whose husband of less than two years — after four years dating at Rutgers — had been killed in Iraq .
She cried as she spoke , and she was right to cry , but she said she tried to keep love and trust in her heart .
She spoke of her devotion to her country and her husband 's pride in the flag .
There was not a dry eye in the room , nor should there have been .
ARE we keeping the faith with Joanna Wroblewski ?
Are we keeping the faith with her husband ?
Are we maintaining an America that is not just a financial neighborhood , but also a brotherhood and a sisterhood worth losing your young husband for ?
Is this still a community of the heart , or a looting opportunity ?
Will there even be a free America for Mrs. Wroblewski 's descendants , or will we be a colony of the people to whom we have sold our soul ?
Are we keeping the faith with this young widow ?
That is the question I ask about this beloved and glorious America for which her husband , Lt. John Thomas Wroblewski , died .
If we are , we should be proud .
If we are not , we 'd better change , and soon .
Visit the wrong website and your computer could be compromised
All three flaws affect the software giant 's Internet Explorer browser .
Security firms said the vulnerabilities were already being targeted by malicious hackers keen to catch out unsuspecting users .
Microsoft said it would produce patches for the vulnerabilities in its next security update due on 11 April .
Attack vector
The first of the problems discovered in Internet Explorer will simply make the browser program crash if it is used to visit a specially crafted webpage .
The other two vulnerabilities are potentially more serious because they can be used to take control of a victim 's computer .
Security firms said specially written websites and hijacked servers were already being used to host the malicious code that uses the loopholes to invade vulnerable machines .
In security bulletins about the trio of bugs , Microsoft played down the threat and said : " The attacks are limited in scope for now . "
Microsoft usually issues security updates on the second Tuesday of every month and its security team is working towards this date , 11 April , to produce patches for the bugs .
However , it said the patches would be released earlier if the threat grew significantly .
Those using the patched versions of IE bundled with Windows 2000 , Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 are vulnerable to these bugs .
People trying out the Beta 2 version of Internet Explorer 7 are safe .
To avoid falling victim , Microsoft urged users to avoid websites they did not trust and to refrain from opening attachments on e-mail messages from unknown senders .

Algae — like a breath mint for smokestacks By Mark Clayton , The Christian Science Monitor BOSTON  Isaac Berzin is a big fan of algae .
The tiny , single - celled plant , he says , could transform the world 's energy needs and cut global warming .
A smokestack at the Mitchell Power Plant in Moundsville , W. Va. Charles P.Saus , AP Overshadowed by a multibillion - dollar push into other " clean - coal " technologies , a handful of tiny companies are racing to create an even cleaner , greener process using the same slimy stuff that thrives in the world 's oceans .
Enter Dr. Berzin , a rocket scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
About three years ago , while working on an experiment for growing algae on the International Space Station , he came up with the idea for using it to clean up power - plant exhaust .
If he could find the right strain of algae , he figured he could turn the nation 's greenhouse - gas - belching power plants into clean - green generators with an attached algae farm next door .
" This is a big idea , " Berzin says , " a really powerful idea . "
And one that 's taken him to the top — a rooftop .
Bolted onto the exhaust stacks of a brick - and - glass 20 - megawatt power plant behind MIT 's campus are rows of fat , clear tubes , each with green algae soup simmering inside .
Fed a generous helping of CO2 - laden emissions , courtesy of the power plant 's exhaust stack , the algae grow quickly even in the wan rays of a New England sun .
The cleansed exhaust bubbles skyward , but with 40 % less CO2 ( a larger cut than the Kyoto treaty mandates ) and another bonus : 86 % less nitrous oxide .
After the CO2 is soaked up like a sponge , the algae is harvested daily .
From that harvest , a combustible vegetable oil is squeezed out : biodiesel for automobiles .
Berzin hands a visitor two vials — one with algal biodiesel , a clear , slightly yellowish liquid , the other with the dried green flakes that remained .
Even that dried remnant can be further reprocessed to create ethanol , also used for transportation .
Being a good Samaritan on air quality usually costs a bundle .
But Berzin 's pitch is one hard - nosed utility executives and climate - change skeptics might like :
It can make a tidy profit .
" You want to do good for the environment , of course , but we 're not forcing people to do it for that reason — and that 's the key , " says the founder of GreenFuel Technologies , in Cambridge , Mass .
" We 're showing them how they can help the environment and make money at the same time . "
GreenFuel has already garnered $ 11 million in venture capital funding and is conducting a field trial at a 1,000 megawatt power plant owned by a major southwestern power company .
Next year , GreenFuel expects two to seven more such demo projects scaling up to a full pro- duction system by 2009 .
Even though it 's early yet , and may be a long shot , " the technology is quite fascinating , " says Barry Worthington , executive director of US Energy Association in Washington , which represents electric utilities , government agencies , and the oil and gas industry .
One key is selecting an algae with a high oil density — about 50 % of its weight .
Because this kind of algae also grows so fast , it can produce 15,000 gallons of biodiesel per acre .
Just 60 gallons are produced from soybeans , which along with corn are the major biodiesel crops today .
Greenfuel is n't alone in the algae - to - oil race .
Last month , Greenshift Corporation , a Mount Arlington , N.J. , technology incubator company , licensed CO2 - gobbling algae technology that uses a screen - like algal filter .
It was developed by David Bayless , a researcher at Ohio University .
A prototype is capable of handling 140 cubic meters of flue gas per minute , an amount equal to the exhaust from 50 cars or a 3 - megawatt power plant , Greenshift said in a statement .
For his part , Berzin calculates that just one 1,000 megawatt power plant using his system could produce more than 40 million gallons of biodiesel and 50 million gallons of ethanol a year .
That would require a 2,000 - acre " farm " of algae - filled tubes near the power plant .
There are nearly 1,000 power plants nationwide with enough space nearby for a few hundred to a few thousand acres to grow algae and make a good profit , he says .
Energy security advocates like the idea because algae can reduce US dependence on foreign oil .
" There 's a lot of interest in algae right now , " says John Sheehan , who helped lead the National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL ) research project into using algae on smokestack emissions until budget cuts ended the program in 1996 .
In 1990 , Sheehan 's NREL program calculated that just 15,000 square miles of desert ( the Sonoran desert in California and Arizona is more than eight times that size ) could grow enough algae to replace nearly all of the nation 's current diesel requirements .
" I 've had quite a few phone calls recently about it , " says Mr. Sheehan .
" This is not an outlandish idea at all . "
Download Jython from www.jython.org/download.html
Jython is shipped as a single class file which you run in order to install it on your system .
The installation instructions are straighforward : www.jython.org/install.html
As always , there are platform - specific nuances .
Check out your platform on /www.jython.org/platform.html.
My setup is that I have Jython installed in d:\jython - 2.1 .
I have added that directory onto my Windows path so that I can invoke Jython from the command line from any directory .
When you first fire up Jython from a command window it will search through your classpath and create a cache of all the stuff it finds there .
You should see something like this : ( click for large version )
You will find yourself at the Jython command prompt :
Welcome to interactive Java :-)
Note to emacs users .
Jython works just fine from the emacs shell .
Unlike CPython , it does not require the " - i " switch in order to recognize an interactive session .
No , I do n't know why that is .
Now we can do something predictable and boring :
You are stunned into silence , I know .
To get out of Jython 's interactive shell you can press ^c twice or press ^d once .
I prefer the former because the latter causes Emacs to close its interactive shell window .
^z does n't work for me on Windows .
No , I do n't know why that is .
Pedants , purists and epicures may prefer :
Which closes Jython gracefully .
Now for something more interesting .
Fire up Jython again and try this :
Nothing happens .
That 's good .
You have now succesfully loaded the Java String class into Jython .
Because we have an interactive shell , we can poke around to find stuff .
Try this :
This time you will get output .
Something like this :
This is a list of all the attributes of the java.lang .
String class that Jython can see .
Now lets make use of that information :
First , create a java.lang .
String object called S. Initialize it to the obligatory " Hello world " :
Now convert the string to lowercase using the toLowerCase method :
Cute eh ?
This is the sort of seamless integration with Java classes that brings so much power to Jython and greases the wheels of application development and debugging something wonderfull .
Installing Tomcat
You can download Tomcat from jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/
The version I used is Tomcat 5 - 0 - 28 .
I have installed mine in d:/data/tomcat-5-0-28 .
You need to set the CATALINA_HOME environment variable to point to the root of your Tomcat install .
You also need the JAVA_HOME environment variable pointing at your Java install but you probably already have that .
Start up Tomcat by executing the startup command in the bin subdirectory of your Tomcat install .
You should see something like this :
Tomcat fires up a second window where all subsequent action takes place .
It should look something like this :
Now to point a web browser at it .
By default , Tomcat fires up on port 8080 .
Point at browser at localhost : 8080 and you should see this :
So far , so far .
Now lets proceed to create a Java servlet the classical ( baroque ? ) way in order to make sure that all our Java kit is functioning as required .
Configuring Tomcat to run Jython Servlets
First things first .
We need to ensure that we can run Java servlets before we venture into Jython servlets .
Make sure that your Java compiler can see the javax .
servlet jar file that Tomcat provides .
It lives in common\lib\servlet - api.jar .
You can put this on your CLASSPATH or you can specify it on the command line to javac like this :
javac - classpath %CLASSPATH %;%CATALINA_HOME%\common\lib\servlet-api.jar
Create a subdirectory in %CATALINA_HOME \webapps called jythondemo .
Create a WEB -INF subdirectory and then create a classes subdirectory of WEB - INF .
In the classes directory , create a Java file called ServletTest.java with this code :
import java.io.* ; import javax.servlet .* ; import javax.servlet.http.* ; public class ServletTest extends HttpServlet { public void doGet ( HttpServletRequest request , HttpServletResponse response ) throws ServletException , IOException { doPost ( request , response ) ; } public void doPost ( HttpServletRequest request , HttpServletResponse response ) throws ServletException , IOException { response.setContentType ( " text / html " ) ; PrintWriter toClient = response.getWriter ( ) ; toClient.println ( " Servlet Test " + " Servlet Test " ) ; } }
This thorougly unexciting Servlet simply creates a HTML test page to be sent back to the browser .
Compile it into a .class file .
By default , the .class file will be in the same directory .
That is fine for our purposes .
Now we need to tell Tomcat about our jythondemo application .
We do this by creating a web.xml file in the WEB - INF subdirectory of the jythondemo directory .
Here are the required contents of the web.xml file :
ServletTest ServletTest ServletTest / ServletTest
Shutdown your Tomcat process if you have not already done so and start it up again .
The shutdown command is :
%CATALINA_HOME\bin\shutdown
When you bring Tomcat back up again , the following URL should work : localhost:8080 / jythondemo/ServletTest .
All going well , you will see this :
Now we can proceed to create the Jython version of this servlet .
Jython servlets work by means of an intermediate Java servlet know as PyServlet .
Simply put , this is the servlet that Tomcat runs and it , in turn , invokes Jython programs .
Got it ?
So , the first thing we need to do is tee up PyServlet .
PyServlet lives in jython.jar .
The preferred way to make jython . jar available to you webapps it to put it in a WEB - INF / lib subdirectory of your context - in this case in a lib sub directory of the jythondemo directory : jythondemo/ WEB-INF /lib .
Now we tell Tomcat about PyServlet and tell it that PyServlet is to be invoked whenever a request for a resource matching *. py is made .
To do that , we make the following additions to the web.xml file :
PyServlet org.python.util.PyServlet 1 PyServlet *.py
The full web.xml now looks like this :
ServletTest ServletTest PyServlet org.python.util.PyServlet 1 ServletTest / ServletTest PyServlet *.py
Now it is time to create a Jython equivalent of the Java Servlet above .
Here it is ( JythonServlet1.py ) :
from javax.servlet.http import HttpServlet class JythonServlet1 ( HttpServlet ) : def doGet ( self , request , response ) : self .doPost ( request , response ) def doPost ( self , request , response ) : toClient = response.getWriter ( ) response.setContentType ( " text / html " ) toClient.println ( " Servlet Test " + " Servlet Test " )
Is that it ?
I hear you say ?
Yes .
Put it into the jythondemo subdirectory .
Restart your Tomcat one more time just as before .
Now this URI should work : localhost :8080 / jythondemo/JythonServlet1.py
Same output as before right ?
Now comes the fun part .
Change the servlet in some trivial way .
e.g. change the text in the HTML page it produces .
What do you need to do to re-deploy the changed Jython servlet .
These three things :
zilch nada nothing
What do you need to do in order to deploy a second Jython servlet , called , says JythonServlet2.py ?
Apart from creating the file and putting it into the jythondemo directory , you have to do these three things :
zilch nada nothing
Welcome to Java rapid development :-)
You might want to take a moment or two to contemplate the significance of the simplcity of all this .
Think how easy you can make it to change stuff in installations of your software by making some / all of the servlets . py files .
" Configuration files " takes on a whole new meaning does n't it ?
Running Jython Servlets from the command line
Python ( and thus Jython ) takes the concept of application testing very seriously indeed .
As well as being sound engineering practice , application testing is critical in dynamically typed programming languages because so much of the language machinery executes at run time .
( There is actually a compile - time step in Jython execution .
Behind the scences , the jython interpreter creates JVM byte code on the fly .
You do n't see it happening though . )
We wo n't get into a debate about the merits / de-merits of dynamic typing .
I 'm a firm advocate of dynamic typing and my shortest argument as to why I advocate it is this :-
Static typing prevents certain types of failures but , in so doing , it prevents certain types of successes .
Now you either believe this or you do n't .
If you do n't - nothing I could say here will convince you otherwise .
All I can say is , if you have never tried a dynamic typing approach , stick with me until the end of this tutorial .
At least try it once .
You will not be sorry .
What is the worst that can happen ?
You will end up with more ammunition to fight the dynamic typing zealots .
How bad can that be ?
A useful device for testing servlets is to be able to run them " in batch " without requiring the machinery of a servlet engine .
Setting up a scenario in which servlets can be executed standalone is very simple with Jython .
Take a look at the following Jython Servlet : JythonServlet2.py :
import sys from java .
io import * from javax.servlet.http import HttpServlet from JythonServletUtils import * class JythonServlet2 ( HttpServlet ) : def doGet ( self , request , response ) : self .doPost ( request , response ) def doPost ( self , request , response ) : toClient = response.getWriter ( ) response.setContentType ( " text / html " ) toClient.println ( " Servlet Test 2 " + " Servlet Test 2 " ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : JS2 = JythonServlet2( ) dummyRequest = DummyHttpRequest ( ) dummyResponse = DummyHttpResponse( ) JS2.doPost ( dummyRequest , dummyResponse )
The last 5 lines are a test harness for the servlet .
Simply put , when Jython executes this program from the command line it will execute these 4 lines :
JS2 = JythonServlet2( ) dummyRequest = DummyHttpRequest ( ) dummyResponse = DummyHttpResponse( ) JS2.doPost ( dummyRequest , dummyResponse )
If it is n't - either because this program has been imported into another program or because it is being executed by a servlet engine - these lines are not executed .
What do these lines do ?
The first line creates an instance of the Servlet
The second line creates a dummy HttpRequest object ( more on this is a tick . )
The third line creates a dummy HttpResponse object ( more on this is a tick . )
The last line invokes the doPost method of the servlet , passing in the dummy objects .
In English this is what is going on :
" If I 'm executing as the main program , create an instance of the servlet , fake up a couple of request / response objects and run the POST method of the servlet . "
D>jython JythonServlet2.py Content - Type:text / html Servlet Test 2 Servlet Test 2
There is no need for Tomcat to be running for this to work .
We are faking it in the interests of having a simple , robust testing strategy for servlets
So , all the magic to make this work must be in the JythonServletUtils module right ?
Well , here it is , there is no magic :
from java.lang import System class DummyHttpRequest : pass class DummyHttpResponse : def setContentType(self , t ) : System.out .
println ( " Content - Type : %s " % t ) def getWriter ( self ) : return System.out
All I have done is fake up a couple of classes and implemented the few methods that my servlets actually use .
Obviously , I can extend this with more methods from the HttpRequest / HttpResponse classes as required .
I have complete flexibility in what these fake methods do so I can tee them up to fit by test strategy .
In this case the key thing I have done is to say that calling getWriter on the HttpResponse object will return stdout and thus my servlets can run standalone writing their output to stdout rather than to servlet containers .
Accessing the Jython library
Jython ships with a bevvy of useful modules .
These , combined with all the class files and jar files of the entire world create the vista of code re-use opportunities perused by the discerning Jythoneer .
Take Jython 's calendar module for example .
It prints nicely formatted calendars .
I can never remember the details of what classes / methods it has .
I do n't need to , to be honest .
I just fire up Jython and poke around :
Lets fire up Jython ...
Jython 2.1 on java 1.4.1_05 ( JIT : null )
Type " copyright " , " credits " or " license " for more information . >>>
I know the module is called calendar .
Lets take a look ...
>>> import calendar >>> dir( calendar ) [ ' EPOCH ' , ' FRIDAY ' , ' February ' , ' January ' , ' MONDAY ' , ' SATURDAY ' , ' SUNDAY ' , ' THURSDAY ' , ' TUESDAY ' , ' WEDNESDAY ' , ' __all__ ' , ' __doc__ ' , ' __file__ ' , ' __name__ ' , ' _center ' , ' _colwidth ' , ' _firstweekday ' , ' _spacing ' , ' calendar ' , ' day_abbr ' , ' day_name ' , ' error ' , ' firstweekday ' , ' format3c ' , ' format3cstring ' , ' isleap ' , ' leapdays ' , ' localtime ' , ' mdays ' , ' mktime ' , ' month ' , ' month_abbr ' , ' month_name ' , ' monthcalendar ' , ' monthrange ' , ' prcal ' , ' prmonth ' , ' prweek ' , ' setfirstweekday ' , ' timegm ' , ' week ' , ' weekday ' , ' weekheader ' ]
The calendar thing looks promising .
I wonder what it is ?
>>> type ( calendar.calendar )
Hmmm .
Its a function .
Sounds promising .
Any docstrings I wonder ?
>>> calendar.calendar.__doc__
" Returns a year 's calendar as a multi- line string . "
Sounds good .
Lets have one of them ...
>>> c = calendar.calendar ( )
Traceback ( innermost last ) : File " " , line 1 , in ? TypeError : calendar ( ) takes at least 1 argument ( 0 given )
Oops !
It needs at least one argument .
What are the chances that the first parameter is a year ?
>>> c = calendar.calendar( 2004 )
So far , so good .
What type is c ?
>>>type(c )
Houston ?
We have a string !
Lets take a look ...

So , how hard would it be to invoke this function from within a Servlet ?
No problem at all as long as Tomcat knows where the Jython library of goodies lives .
It is a good idea to create self - contained servlet contexts - it makes them more portable .
To this end , we will hoof all the Jython library stuff into the jythondemo context .
The place to put it all is jythondemo \WEB -INF\lib\Lib
I normally just xcopy over the entire \ jython2 - 1 \lib directory and suggest you do the same .
You should at this stage have the following directory structure :
jythondemo WEB -INF classes lib cachedir packages Lib cachedir packages encodings jxxload_help pawt test xml dom ext reader html parsers xmlproc sax drivers2 utils
To test that it we have access to the Jython library , here is a servlet JythonServlet3.py that returns a calendar for the current year as its response .
Notice the use of the test harness mentioned previously .
This allows me to test the servlet outside of Tomcat .
Note also the use of the Jython time module which provides a localtime function .
The first element in the list returned by localtime is the current year .
import sys , calendar , time from java .
io import * from javax.servlet.http import HttpServlet from JythonServletUtils import * class JythonServlet3 ( HttpServlet ) : def doGet ( self , request , response ) : self .doPost ( request , response ) def doPost ( self , request , response ) : toClient = response.getWriter ( ) response.setContentType ( " text / html " ) toClient.println ( " Servlet Test 3 " ) toClient.println ( " Calendar %s " % calendar.calendar(time.localtime ( ) [ 0 ] ) ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : JS3 = JythonServlet3 ( ) dummyRequest = DummyHttpRequest ( ) dummyResponse = DummyHttpResponse( ) JS3.doPost ( dummyRequest , dummyResponse )
Pointing a webbrowser at localhost : 8080 / JythonServlet3.py should product this output :
Summary and pointers to other stuff
In this section we have seen how to set up Jython to work within Tomcat .
The same procedure - with a few tweaks - will make it work in any Servlet container .
We have seen how easy it is to modify existing servlets and add new ones once Jython is properly set up .
We have seen how to set up servlets so that they can easily be tested outside of a servlet container environment .
Finally , we have seen a few examples of how poking around with Jython 's interactive mode really speeds up finding stuff and finding out how it works .
A full treatment of Jython Servlets would take a whole book .
Some of the fun stuff that we have not covered :
You can compile jython to native java class files using the Jython compiler - jythonc .
You can use Jython in JSP pages
You can implement beans ( of all forms ) in Jython .
For example , you can create beans for use in JSP pages .
You can implement tag libraries in Jython
In the next section of this tutorial , we will look at accessing the rich and varied and mission critical world of asynchronous messaging via the JMS API from Jython .
Actually , we might do some XML work first .
I have n't decided yet .

良い乱数・悪い乱 数
Ｃ言語標準ライブラリの乱数rand ( ) は質に問題があり、禁止している学会もある。
他にも乱数には様々なアルゴリズムがあるが、多くのものが問題を持っている。
最も多くの人に使われている乱数であろう
Visual Basic の Rnd の質は最低である 。
そもそも乱数と は
乱数とは、本来サイコロを振って出る目から得られるような数を意味する。
このような乱数は予測不能なものである。
しかし、計算機を使って乱数を発生させた場合、
次に出る数は完全に決まっているので、予測不能とはいえない。
そこで、計算機で作り出される乱数を疑似乱数( PRNG)と呼び区別することがある。
ここでは、特にことわらない限り乱数とは疑似乱数のことを指すとする。
計算機でソフト的に乱数を発生させることの最大のメリットは、
再現性があることである。 初期状態が同じであれば、発生する乱数も全く同じものが得られる。
このことは、パラメータを変更して実験する場合、
乱数による揺らぎを完全に無くすのに便利である。
もちろん、サイコロを振って得られる乱数には再現性がない。
ほとんどの乱数生成プログラムは、種と呼ばれる数値を受け取って、
それに対応する乱数列を発生する。 実験のとき、種を別のものにすることによって、
簡単に異なる乱数列を得ることができる。
「 乱数はもともとでたらめなので、いい加減な方法を使っても問題は起きない 」
という考えがある。この考えは、危険である。 例えば、現在C言語の入門書などで広く紹介されている rand( ) という乱数は、 期待するほどでたらめではなく、ある意味で規則的な数列を返す。 従って、例えば rand ( ) を使って実験を行ない、 統計処理した場合、結果の信頼性が低くなる。
このページの目的は、従来の乱数の問題点を指摘し、 すばらしい乱数、 「 メルセンヌツイスタ 」 の普及を促進することである。
また、乱数のことについて深く解説した杉田洋氏のページ
モンテカルロ法，乱数，および疑似乱数も紹介しておく。
従来の乱数生成プログラムの問題点
rand ( ) その１
UNIX の /usr / ucb / cc を解析した結果、 rand ( ) は以下の動作をすることがわかった。
static long x=1 ; void srand ( long s ) { x=s ; } long rand ( ) { x=x*1103515245+12345 ; return x&2147483647 ; }
これは、非常にシンプルな線形合同法である。
この乱数の最下位ビットは0と1の繰り返しになる。
すなわち、偶数と奇数が交互に生成される。
このことから、この乱数で下位ビットを乱数として使うのは危険であることがわかる。
また、ある乱数が得られたら、次に現れる乱数が１種類しかないという欠点も持つ。
rand ( ) その２
多くの rand ( ) が以下のアルゴリズムによって生成されている。
static long x=S ; int rand ( ) { x=x * A+C ; return ( int ) ( x>>16 ) &32767 ; } void srand ( long s ) { x=s ; if ( F ) rand ( ) ; } /usr /5bin/cc , LSI -C A=1103515245 , C=12345 , F=0 , S=1 TurboC 1.5 A=22695477 , C=1 , F=0 , S=1 Visual C++ A=214013 , C=2531011 , F=0 , S=1 。 Borland C++ A=22695477 , C=1 , F=1 , S=22695478 。
これらのソースも筆者が独自に解析した結果、得られたものである。
rand ( ) その１、その２に共通していることは、線形合同法を使っていることである。 すなわち、変数xは漸化式
X [ n ] =A * X [ n - 1 ] +C ( mod 4294967296 )
に基づいて計算される。 ( mod 4294967296 ) とは4294967296で割った余りという意味である。 多くの計算機では余りを求める演算をわざわざ行なわなくても、
掛け算と足し算の結果オーバーフローした部分を無視することによって、
自動的にこの結果が得られる。
X [ n ]
の持つ重要な性質は、最下位ビットの周期が2、すなわち0と1が交互に現れ、
その隣のビットの周期が4、さらにその隣のビットは8、となり、
最上位ビットの周期は4294967296となることである。 これらのrand ( ) はxの最上位ビットを無視するので、全体の周期は2147483648になる。 rand ( )
のマニュアルには周期は4294967296と書いてあるがそれは間違いである。
実際、この周期は、乱数を使った実験では短すぎる場合が多い。
また、以前パチスロで一定周期で当たりが出やすくなるという問題が起きたが、 その原因は rand( ) を使っていたためと私は推測する。
rand ( ) その ２ は X [ n ] の下位 16ビットを捨て、 上位16ビットを右シフトしてそのうちの下位15ビットを返す。
従って最下位ビットでも周期は131072になるので、 「 rand ( )
その１」のような下位ビットを使った極端な問題は起きない。
しかし、乱数の返す数値の範囲が、0から32767までしかない。
言い換えれば、精度が15ビットしかない。 そのため、例えば、Box-Muller法で正規分布に従う乱数を発生させたり、
逆関数法で指数分布に従う乱数を発生させたりするとき、
端の方で理論的な分布と、生成された乱数の分布との違いが大きくなる。
下の表は全周期で最大値や最小値を調べた結果である。
正規分布 指数分布 最小値 最大値 最大値 rand ( ) そ の１ - 6.53 σ 6.35 σ 21.49 λ rand ( ) その２ - 4.56 σ 4.56 σ 10.40 λ
rand ( ) の一番大きな欠点は、移植性がないことである。 rand ( ) その１の最大値 は 2147483647 であるのに対し、 rand( ) その２ は 32767 なので、異なるコンパイラでプログラムの移植するときに、
ソースコードを書き換えなくてはならない。 また、rand ( ) その２の間でもパラメータが違うものがあるので、
一方のコンパイラで起きたことを、他方のコンパイラで再現することが不可能である。
さらに、rand ( ) に共通する欠点として、違う種をsrand( ) に与えても、 同じ乱数列が発生する場合があることも挙げられる。 例えば、srand (0 ) とsrand ( 0x80000000 ) で初期化された乱数列は、互いに同じものになる。
Visual Basic の Rnd
Visual Studio やエクセルなどで使われる Visual Basic の
Rnd は簡略化して書けば以下のようになっている。
static long x=327680 ; float Rnd( void ) { x=x*16598013+12820163&16777215 ; return x*( 1.0/16777216.0 ) ; }
見てわかるように、24ビット線形合同法を使っている。 周期はたったの 1677万しかない。ちょっとした実験なら一周してしまううえ、精度も24ビットしかない。
もっと大きな問題は、乱数を初期化する Randomize にある。 これは与えられた種
を16ビットの整数に変換して初期化する。従って、65536種類の
系列しか得られない。違う種を指定して実験しても、
かなりの確率で、まったく同じ系列が返される危険がある。
参考までに 、Rnd と Randomize と全く同じ動作をする Rnd2 と Randomize2 を以下に示す。
Ｃ言語 やVisual Studioなら乱数のプログラムを書いて、対処できるが、 エクセルの場合、整数のオーバーフローを認めていないので、性能のよい乱数を使いたいなら、
Ｃ言語などでダイナミック・リンク・ライブラリのプログラムを書いて、それを呼び出すしかない。 多くの乱数は 32 ビット整数演算をしているのでエクセルＶＢＡの
Long 型では計算できない。 以下のプログラムは後述する Xorshift とメルセンヌツイスタを 31 ビットにし てＶＢＡ で書いたもである 。
ＶＢエディターを開いて、標準モジュールを追加し、そこに貼り付ければ使うことができる。
Xorshift は周期を最大化するパラメータを探すプログラムを自分で書いて
31×4 ビットのものを得た。 メルセンヌツイスタは 、
http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/mt.html にある、Dynamic Creatorを使って 31 ビットに対応したパラメータを計算して求めた。
メルセンヌツイスタの方が品質も良く周期も長いが、Xorshift に比べて遅い 。Core 2 Duo E6600 の エクセル2007で１億個発生させるのに Xorshift で約１分、メルセンヌツイスタで約５分かかった。
スピードを求めるなら乱数ライブラリのダイナミック・リンク・ライブラリを使うべきであろう。
( メルセンヌツイスタの周期:4.31e6001、Xorshiftの周期:2.12e32 )
drand48 ( )
UNIXでは、drand48 ( ) と呼ばれる乱数パッケージを使うことができる。 使い方は、man drand48 で知ることができる。 以下にdrand48 ( ) の一部の機能を実現するソースを示す。
static long long x=0x1234ABCD330E ; double drand48 ( ) /* 0.0 以 上1.0未満 */ { x = x*0x5DEECE66D + 0xB ; return ( x&0xFFFFFFFFFFFF )*( 1.0/281474976710656.0 ) ; } long lrand48 ( ) /* 0以上2147483647以下 */ { x = x*0x5DEECE66D + 0xB ; return ( long ) ( x>>17) &0x7FFFFFFF ; } long mrand48 ( ) /* -2147483648以上214748367以下 */ { x = x*0x5DEECE66D + 0xB ; return ( long ) ( x>> 16 ) &0xFFFFFFFF ; } void srand 48 ( long s ) { x = s ; x = ( x << 16 ) +0x330 E ; }
ソースを見てわかるように、drand48 ( ) も線形合同法を使っている。 rand ( )
は32ビットの線形演算を行い、そのうち31ビットを使っていた。 これに対して、drand48 ( ) は64ビットの線形演算を行い、そのうち、48ビットを使っている。 従ってdrand48 ( ) は２の４８ 乗の周期を持つ。 この周期の長さは rand( ) に比べて十分長い。 ただし、mrand48 ( ) の最下位ビットの周期 は 131072 しかないことに注意すること。
また、64ビットの掛け算を行っているため、 実行時間が rand( ) に比べかなり遅くなっている。
drand48 ( ) の長所として、移植性の高さが挙げられる。 ほとんどの UNIX で drand48 ( ) が使用でき、全く同じ動作をする。 Visual C++で drand48 ( ) が使用できないのが残念に思われる。
線形合同法の欠 点
rand( ) その 1、rand( ) その２、drand48 ( ) は線形合同法で乱数を 発生させている。この方法に共通する欠点は、ある乱数が得られたら、 次に現れる乱数が限られてしまうことだ。とくに、rand( ) その１と 、 drand48 ( ) は、次の乱数が完全に決まってしまう。
この欠点は乱数を組にして使うと問題になる。
例えば２次元ベクトル(x , y ) を線形合同法で発生させると、 限られたベクトルしか現れない。
ちなみに、メルセンヌツイスタでは６２３次元のベクトルを発生させても、
全周期で、全ての組み合わせのベクトルが現れる。
random ( )
unsigned x [ 32 ] ; int random ( void ) { unsigned n=( unsigned ) x [ 0 ] ; if ( n==31 ) n=1 ; else n++ ; x [ 0 ] =n ; x [ n ] +=( n> 3 ? x [ n - 3 ] :x [ n+31 - 3 ] ) ; return ( x [ n ] >>1) &0x7 FFFFFFF ; } /* 以前の srandom */ void srandom ( int s ) { int i ; x [ 0 ] =3 ; x [ 1 ] =( unsigned )s ; for ( i=2 ;i< =31 ;i++ ) x[ i ] = 1103515245*x [ i-1 ] + 12345 ; for ( i=0 ; i<310 ;i++ ) random ( ) ; } /* 現在の srandom */ void srandom ( int seed ) { int i ; long long s=seed ; if ( s==0 ) s=1 ; x [ 0 ] =3 ; x [ 1 ] =( unsigned ) s ; for ( i=2;i<=31 ;i++ ) { s=( 16807*s ) %2147483647 ; if ( s <0 ) s+=2147483647 ; x[i ] =( unsigned ) s ; } for ( i=0 ;i< 310 ;i++ ) random ( ) ; }
random ( ) は足し算法を使っている。すなわち、変数Xnは漸化式
X [ n ] =X[ n - 3 ] + X [ n - 31 ] ( mod 4294967296 )
に基づいて計算される。最下位ビットの周期は2147483648で、
全体の周期は約２の６２乗である。 random ( ) の優れた点は生成するときの実行時間が短いことである。
乱数の質が問題にならず、速度だけが問題になる時は、この乱数を使うとよい。
しかし、random ( ) には統計的な欠陥が見つかっているので注意が必要である。
中心極限定理により、乱数を多数加えると正規分布に従うはずであるが、 random ( )
を使った場合は正規分布から少し外れてしまう。
また、新しい srandom ( ) の場合、 種を０にした場合と１にした場合に、
全く同じ結果となる。この事は man 3 random、man 3 random_r と得られるマニュアルに 書かれておらず、ソースコードのコメントにも書かれていない。マルチスレッドで、 srandom_r ( )
にスレッドの番号を渡すようなプログラムを組むような場合注意が必要である。
最下位ビットの問 題
random ( ) のマニュアルには全てのビットがランダムで、 使用可能と書かれているが、以前の srandom ( ) の初期化がまずいため、 下位ビットを使うのが好ましくないことがある。
例えば、以下のプログラムは、以前の random ( ) を使って種を４つおきにして初期化し、 62 個の最下位ビットを表示するものだが、
/* TEST1 */ main ( void ) { int i , j , k ; for ( i=0 ; i < 4 ; i++ ) for ( j=0 ; j < 4 ; j++ ) { printf ( " %4d " , i+j * 4 ) ; srandom ( i+ j * 4 ) ; for ( k=0 ; k < 62 ;k++ ) printf ( " %ld " , random ( ) &1 ) ; printf ( "
" ) ; } return 0 ; }
結果は、
0 11010110001011101100111001101000101011011001111010001101111001 4 11010110001011101100111001101000101011011001111010001101111001 8 11010110001011101100111001101000101011011001111010001101111001 12 11010110001011101100111001101000101011011001111010001101111001 1 10101101101110111000010011110101100110000111101101100001101111 5 10101101101110111000010011110101100110000111101101100001101111 9 10101101101110111000010011110101100110000111101101100001101111 13 10101101101110111000010011110101100110000111101101100001101111 2 01110010110101000011011001011011100000011110010000101001000111 6 01110010110101000011011001011011100000011110010000101001000111 10 01110010110101000011011001011011100000011110010000101001000111 14 01110010110101000011011001011011100000011110010000101001000111 3 00001001010000010111110011000110101101000000000111000101010001 7 00001001010000010111110011000110101101000000000111000101010001 11 00001001010000010111110011000110101101000000000111000101010001 15 00001001010000010 111110011000110101101000000000111000101010001
となる。以前の random ( ) では４種類の全く同じ系列が順番に現れることがわかる。 この問題は現在の random ( ) では解決されている。 しかし、この問題はlrand48 ( ) で生じる。 従って、種を変 え
て100回 実験をしても、得られる結果は4通りしかない。
次の表に、各乱数の最下位ビットの特性をまとめてみた。
周期 系列の種類の数 rand ( ) その １ 2 2 rand ( ) その２ 131072 131072 random ( ) 4294967294 4 lrand48 ( ) 262144 4 mrand48 ( ) 131072 2
これを見てわかることは、最下位ビットを使って実験するとき、 以前の random ( ) や lrand48 ( ) を使うよりも rand ( ) その２の方が 、 ましな結果が得られるということである。
. NET の Random クラス
Random クラスは Knuth の 引き算法を使っている。基本的には random ( ) と変わりがない。 以下にコンストラクタ と
Next ( ) と NextDouble ( ) を簡略化したソースを示す。 Next ( ) の最大値 が 2147483646 であることに注意
static int index , x[ 56 ] ; void Init ( int seed ) { int i , j , k ; seed =161803398 -( seed <0? - seed : seed ) ; x [ 55 ] =seed ; k=1 ; for ( i=1 ; i< 55 ;i++ ) { j=( 21*i)%55 ; x [ j]=k ; k=seed -k ; if ( k <0 ) k+=2147483647 ; seed=x[j ] ; } for ( j=1 ; j < 5 ; j++ ) for ( i=1 ; i < 56 ;i++ ) { x [ i ] - =x [ 1+ ( i+30 ) %55 ] ; if ( x [ i ] < 0 ) x [ i ] +=2147483647 ; } index=0 ; } int Next ( void ) { int r ; if ( ++index > =56 ) index=1 ; r=x[index ]-x[ index<=34?index+21:index -34 ] ; if ( r <0 ) r+=2147483647 ; x[ index ] =r ; return r ; } double NextDouble ( void ) { return Next ( ) *( 1.0/2147483647.0 ) ; }
上位ビットの問 題
例えば、以下 のＣ＃プログラムは、0 から 63 までを種として初期化し、 100 個の乱数の最上位ビットを表示するものだが、
/* TEST2 */ using System ; class Program { static int SkippedRand ( int seed , int NumOfSkip ) { Random r=new Random ( seed ) ; for ( int i=0 ; i< NumOfSkip ; i++ ) r. Next ( ) ; return r. Next ( ) ; } static void Main ( string [ ] args ) { for ( int i=1 ; i< =100 ;i++ ) { Console . Write ( " {0,2} 番目 : " , i ) ; for ( int s=0;s <64 ;s ++ ) Console . Write ( " {0} " , SkippedRand(s , i-1 ) >>30 ) ; Console .
WriteLine ( ) ; } } }
結果は、

となり、長さがまちまちであるが、周期的になっている。
この性質が引起こす問題は、例えば種が小さいときは、
65番目の乱数は必ず小さい数になるといった規則性を持つことである。
この現象はrand ( ) 、lrand48 ( ) 、mrand48 ( ) 、以前の random ( ) でも起こる。 線形合同法と引き算法は根本的に異なるアルゴリズムであるが、 この現象は共通して起こる。 例えば 、Visual C++のrand ( ) の場合最初の乱数の最上位ビットは、
種が-11〜5005の間で0である。また、Borland C++の場合、79番目の 乱数は7407〜7408の間隔で最上位ビットが不変である
さらに、この現象は種を一定間隔に離しても起こる。
以下のプログラムは種を100おきに変化させながら最上位ビットを表示する。

今度は15番目と18番目の乱数で最上位ビットの周期が長くなっている。
この現象の原因は解明したが、その説明はここでは省く。
ここ( 英文 ) に詳しい解説がある。 この現象のため、以前の random ( ) 、rand ( ) 、lrand48 ( ) 、mrand48 ( ) 、drand48 ( ) 、 .NET の Random クラスを使って実験をする場合、種は慎重に選ばなければならない。 連続して実験を行う場合に、安易に、システム時間等を使って種を設定すると、 種が一定間隔になり、実験結果に悪影響を及ぼす可能性がある。種を選ぶときには、 例え ば
123456789、987654321、12121212などのように、十分大きな桁で、 無関係になるように工夫しなければならない。
悪い乱数のリスクを視覚的に明らかにするも参照のこと。
一方、現在の random ( ) やメルセンヌツイスタでは、このような心配はいらない。
違う種を選べば、相関のない系列が得られる。
JAVAの乱数
JAVA の乱数は48ビット線形合同法を使っている。そして、統計的に問題がある。 nextDouble ( ) で diehard test ( http://i.cs.hku.hk/~diehard/)
を行ったところ、OQSO test と DNA test で異常な結果が起こったからだ 。
さらに、初期化ミスのため、例えば以下のプログラムを
JAVA で実行すると、
public class RandTest { static java.util.Random r=new java.util.Random ( ) ; public static void main ( String [ ] args ) { double x , Min=1 , Max=0 ; for ( int i=0 ; i< 1024 ;i++ ) { r.setSeed(i ) ; x=r.nextDouble ( ) ; if ( x > Max ) Max=x ; if ( x < Min ) Min=x ; } System.out.println ( " Min= " + Min + " Max= " + Max ) ; } }
結果は、
Min=0.6753377750582709 Max=0.7669794809891215
となり、０から１０２３までの種で初期化したにもかかわらず、
最初の乱数は０.７近辺しか現われない。
また 、Math.random ( ) は種を与える機能がない。 従って、実験などを再現することができないので、使い物にならない。
そもそも JAVA は遅く、乱数を使ったシミュレーションに向いていない。
さらに、48ビット線形合同法を使っていることが、その遅さにわをかけている。
メルセンヌツイス タ
繰り返すがメルセンヌツイス タ http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/mt.html は、乱数としてすぐれている。
メルセンヌツイスタ はM系列乱数( GFSR ) の子孫である 。M系列乱数とは、 組み合わせ論から導き出された乱数で、各ビットが独立してk次均等分布していた。 k次均等分布とはk次元のベクトルを取ったときにk個がすべて0の場合を除いて、
全ての組み合わせが全周期で等しい回数だけ現れるというものである。
GFSRは各ビットが独立して生成されていた。メルセンヌツイスタは
シフト演算を使って異なる位置のビットに影響を与えるようにした。
このアイディアにより、メルセンヌツイスタは、単一のビットのみならず、
３２ビットで見てもk次均等分布するようになった。
サイコロを１０回振って、全て１の目が現れた直後でも、
１１回目に１の目が出る確率は６分の１であることは明らかだ。
メルセンヌツイスタは６２３次均等分布しているので
例えば０が連続して１０回現れた後でも、 次にさらに０が現れる可能性がある。 メルセンヌツイスタは自然乱数の持つ性質を高レベルで実現している。
メルセンヌツイスタの周期は10進法で６千桁以上ある。 一般に 「天文学的数字」といった場合でも、
せいぜい20桁くらいなので、この周期の長さは形容のしようがないほど長い。 また、GFSRでは、内部テーブルの初期化が非常に複雑であったのが、
メルセンヌツイスタでは全て０の場合を除けば、どのようにテーブルを初期化しても、
周期など理論的な性質に問題が起きない。また、生成速度もアルゴリズムが複雑なわりに、
掛け算や割り算など遅い命令を使わないので、意外と速い。
メルセンヌツイスタ はTGFSR やTTGFSRと呼ばれていた時代から、
多くの研究者によって、テストされてきた。TGFSRの頃は問題が報告されていたが、
現在のメルセンヌツイスタに統計的な欠陥は見つかっていない。
筆者もいろいろテストしたが、問題は見つからなかった。
SFMT はメルセンヌツイスタの新しいものである。 SSE2 に対応した CPU で効率よく乱数を生成することができる。 また、旧メルセンヌツイスタでは、 ゼロを多く含む部分列が近くに集まりやすいという欠点があったが、SFMT では改善されている。 ただし、旧メルセンヌツイスタのこの欠点は、理論上の問題であり、 普通に種を与えて初期化していれば、統計上、全く問題は起きない。 なぜなら、非常に長い周期から見れば、極短い部分列での問題であり、 意図的に内部を操作しなければ、そのような部分列が現れることはまずない。
XorShift
高速な乱数に XorShift というのがある 。
unsigned long xor128 ( ) { static unsigned long x=123456789 , y=362436069,z=521288629,w=88675123 ; unsigned long t ; t=(x ^( x < < 11 ) ) ; x=y ; y=z ; z=w ; return ( w=(w ^ ( w >>19 ) ) ^( t ^ ( t > > 8 ) ) ) ; }
http://www.jstatsoft.org/v08/i14/
周期はメルセンヌツイスタほどはないが、実用上は十分といえる。
とりあえず、１億個の生成速度を XorShift を含めて Core 2 Duo E6600 ＋ VS2005 で計ったところ 、
zsfmt( SSE2 ) : 156ms SFMT ( SSE2 ) : 156ms zmtrand ( SSE2 ) : 250 ms zxor : 265 ms zmtrand : 266ms xor128 ( ) : 328 ms zsfmt : 375 ms mt19937ar : 625ms SFMT : 1046 ms rand ( ) : 1969ms

消えるルー プ
簡単だけど、よくありそうな例として、こんなのを考えてみよう。
入力テキストの行数を数える関数 count_lines を書きたい。 Cで書くとすれば、こんな感じだ。
/* 例 1 */ int count_lines ( void ) { int count = 0 , c ; for ( c=getchar ( ) ; c!=EOF ; c=getchar ( ) ) { if ( c == '
' ) count ++ ; } return count ; }
Schemeにも明示的なループを記述する do 構文がある。 敢え てC風に記述すれば、こんな感じになる。
; ; 例2 ( define ( count - lines ) ( let ( ( count 0 ) ) ( do ( ( c ( read - char ) ( read- char ) ) ) ; c=getchar ( ) ( ( eof- object ? c ) count ) ; EOF な らreturn count ; ( if ( char= ? c #
ewline ) ( set! count (+ count 1 ) ) ) ) ) )
do構文ではループ終了テストが2番目の引数に来ることを除けば、ほぼ一対一に
コードが対応しているのがわかると思う。 しかし、do構文はカッコがたくさんあってどうもわかりにくい
( *1 ) 。Scheme好きな私でさえそう思うくらいだ。
もちっと 、「 Schemeらしい 」 書き方( 私の主観だが ) をしてみよう。
;; 例3 ( define ( count - lines ) ( define ( loop count ) ( let ( ( c ( read - char ) ) ) ( cond ( ( eof- object ? c ) count ) ( ( char= ? c #
ewline ) ( loop (+ count 1 ) ) ) ( else ( loop count ) ) ) ) ) ( loop 0 ) )
ループ構文が消えてしまった。代わりにローカル関数 loop を定義して、 そいつを再帰的に呼び出している ( * 2 ) 。 そう 、Schemeプログラマは再帰が大好きで、 とにかくなんでもかんでも再帰で書きたがる。
手続き型言語では、再帰はイメージが悪い。 よく例に出され るQuick Sortみたいに 本質的に再帰的なアルゴリズムならともかく、ループで書けるものを
わざわざスタックを消費して再帰にするなんて、というわけだ。 だが、Schemerが再帰を好むのは、単に「ループは再帰で書き直せる」という
アルゴリズムのクラスの教科書の記述を確かめたいからじゃない。
ちゃんと実用上の利点があるんだ。
再帰は重いの か
まず、あなたが 「再帰は重い」という概念を持っているとしたら、
それを捨ててもらわなくちゃならない。
ローカル関数loopの定義をよく見てみよう、EOFの場合以外は、
それぞれ分岐した枝の最後でloopそれ自身を呼んでいる。
カッコをとっぱらって疑似コードで書いてみると分かりやすいかも。
; ; 例 4 define loop ( count ) c = read - char ( ) c == EOF な らcountを返す c == '
' なら loop ( count +1 ) を呼ぶ それ以外なら loop ( count ) を呼ぶ
関数ボディ内で、条件によって処理が3つに分岐している。こんなふうに、
処理がフォークのように分岐してゆくパターンは、普段のプログラミングで 良く出て来る。 関数の一番最後の処理(分岐がある場合は、それぞれの分岐した枝の先の最後の処理)
が関数呼び出しである場合、それを末尾呼び出し( tail call ) という。 この例のように、末尾呼び出しが再帰的に行われるのは末尾再帰という。
Schemeの大きな特徴は、tail callがgotoと等価になることだ( * 3 ) 。
すなわち、例4の疑似コードは、あたかも次の疑似コードのように評価される。
; ; 例 5 ( * 4 ) loop : c = read - char ( ) c == EOF な らcountを返す c == '
' なら count = count + 1 ; goto loop ; それ以外なら count = count ; goto loop ;
Gotoと言ってもブロックの先頭に飛んでいるだけだから、Perlでのnext文や Cのcontinue文と同じことだ。これは、理論上そうなるってだけじゃなくて、
実際に計算機の上で実行されるコードが、next文やcontinue文と同じってことだ。
例3に示した再帰のプログラムは、実行時型検査などの点を除けば
例1のCプログラムと同じように実行される。実際、型情報も取り扱えるように 拡張されたSchemeコンパイラなら、例1のCプログラムをコンパイルしたのと
ほとんど同じ機械語を生成するはずだ。
末尾再帰がループと同等に実行されるのは、コンパイラによるオプショナルな最適化ではない。
Schemeは、末尾呼び出しでスタックを消費しないことを言語規格上要求している。
Schemeプログラマは、例3のコードから例5の処理を一瞬で思い浮かべる。
いや、思い浮かべるというよりも、例3のコードと例5の処理は全く同一、
不可分なものとして認識されていると言ったほうがいいかな。
「処理」という漢字を見て「しょり」という読みを思い浮かべるみたいなもんだ。
もちろん、プログラムを書く時には、例5の様なアルゴリズムを考えて、
それを自然にコードに書き下すと、例3のコードになるというわけだ。
ループと末尾再帰のコードを同一視するには多少慣れが必要だけれど、
よく現われるパターンというのはある。 CやPerlのループ構文では、何もしなければループが継続し、
中断したいときは break や last を使う。 再帰で繰り返しを書く時には、逆に何もしないとループから抜けて、 繰り返したい時に末尾呼び出しを使うんだ。 これは 、Perlの名前つきブロックに良く似ている。
相互末尾再 帰
再帰より明示的ループの方がわかりやすいのに、なんでわざわざ再帰にするの?
という疑問がまだあるかもしれない。ちょっと問題を複雑にしてみようか。
今度は、行数のかわりに単語の数を数えてみよう。ここで、単語とはひとつ以上の空白文字
で区切られた文字列であるとする。Cで書くならこんな感じだ。コメント内の数字は、 後 のSchemeコードとの対応をわかりやすく示すためのものだ。
/* 例 6 */ int count_words ( ) { int count = 0 ; /* カウンタ */ int ws = TRUE ; /* 直前に読んだ文字が空白ならTRUE
*/ int c ; for ( c=getchar ( ) ; c!=EOF ; c=getchar ( ) ) { if ( isspace ( c ) ) { ws = TRUE ; /* [ 1 ] */ } else { if ( ws ) count ++ ; /* [ 2 ] */ ws = FALSE ; /* [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] */ } } return count ; }
再帰を使って書く場合、ループ内で変更される変数を引数にする。こんな感じだ。
; ; 例7 ( define ( count - words ) ( define ( loop c ws count ) ( cond ( ( eof- object ? c ) count ) ( ( char - whitespace ? c ) ( loop ( read - char ) #t count ) ) ; [ 1 ] ( ws ( loop ( read - char ) #f (+ count 1 ) ) ) ; [ 2 ] ( else ( loop ( read - char ) #f count ) ) ) ) ; [ 3 ] ( loop ( read - char ) #t 0 ) )
Cのコードにあった、代入やインクリメントが消えてしまった。それらは、再帰的に
呼び出す関数への引数渡しという形に変換されている。例えば、読んだ文字 c が空白文字で無く、かつフラグ ws が真の場 合 ( [ 2 ] ) 、 次の ループの ws には偽が渡され、 count には (+ count 1 ) が渡されている。 ( なお、ここでは読み込んだ文 字 c も引数にしてしまっているが、 スタイルの問題 。 例 3のように、loopのボディでlet文を使ってもいい。 私はわりと何でも引数にしてしまう質だ ) 。
ところで、上の実装では、直前に空白文字を読んでいるかどうかという
状態を記憶しておくためにフラグ ws を導入していた。 変数を使うかわりに、直前に空白文字を読んだ時に呼ばれる関数と そうでない場合に呼ばれる関数とを別々に定義しておいて、どちらの関数が 呼ばれているかで現在の状態を表す、という手法がある。 前者を in - space 、後者を in - word という 関数で表現してみたものが、次のコード例だ 。
; ; 例8 ( define ( count - words ) ( define ( in - word c count ) ( cond ( ( eof- object ? c ) count ) ( ( char - whitespace ? c ) ( in - space ( read - char ) count ) ) ( else ( in - word ( read - char ) count ) ) ) ) ( define ( in - space c count ) ( cond ( ( eof- object ? c ) count ) ( ( char - whitespace ? c ) ( in - space ( read - char ) count ) ) ( else ( in - word ( read - char ) (+ count 1 ) ) ) ) ) ( in - space ( read - char ) 0 ) )
in - space と in - word がお互いを 再帰的に呼び合っているので、相互再帰と言ったりする。 この場合でも、お互いの呼び出しは必ず関数のいちばん最後にあるから、 末尾再帰と言える。末尾呼び出しをgotoに置き換えて処理の流れを 疑似コードを示してみよう 。
; ; 例9 define count - words ( ) c = read - char ( ) ; count = 0 ; goto in - space ; in - word : if c == EOF return count ; if whitespace ( c ) { c = read - char ( ) ; goto in - space ; } else { c = read - char ( ) ; count += 1 ; goto in - word ; } in - space : if c == EOF return count ; if whitespace ( c ) { c = read - char ( ) ; goto in - space ; } else { c = read - char ( ) ; goto in - word ; }
さらに、ダブルクオートで囲まれた部分については、そのダブルクオートが閉じられるまでを
( 例え空白文字が中にあっても)一単語と数える、という仕様にしてみようか。
クオートされた文字列注にダブルクオートを含める場合はバックスラッシュでエスケープ するものとする。
現在、ダブルクオートで囲まれた文字列を読んでいる、という状態を
関数 in - quote に対応させてみたものが次のコードだ 。
; ; 例 10 ( define ( count - words ) ( define ( in - word c count ) ( cond ( ( eof- object ? c ) count ) ( ( char - whitespace ? c ) ( in - space ( read - char ) count ) ) ( ( char= ? c # \ " ) ( in -quote ( read - char ) (+ count 1 ) ) ) ( else ( in - word ( read - char ) count ) ) ) ) ( define ( in - space c count ) ( cond ( ( eof- object ? c ) count ) ( ( char - whitespace ? c ) ( in - space ( read - char ) count ) ) ( ( char= ? c # \ " ) ( in -quote ( read - char ) (+ count 1 ) ) ( else ( in - word ( read - char ) (+ count 1 ) ) ) ) ) ( define ( in - quote c count ) ( cond ( ( eof- object ? c ) ( error " EOF in quoted word " ) ) ( ( char= ? c # \ " ) ( in - space ( read - char ) count ) ) ( ( char= ? c # \\ ) ( read - char ) ( in - quote ( read - char ) count ) ) ( else ( in -quote ( read - char ) count ) ) ) ) ( in - space ( read - char ) 0 ) )
各々の関数が現在の状態を表しており、次に呼び出す関数が次の状態への遷移であると
考えると、上記のコードは状態遷移図そのままであるとも言える。フラグによって
状態を管理する実装と、どちらが見やすいか、というのはケースバイケースだが、
条件が入り組んで来ると、相互再帰で書かれたコードの方が見やすいと私は思う。
これでもまだ再帰のメリットに納得しない?
なら、こんな仕様はどうかな。 上記の仕様に加えて、開き括弧が出て来たら、閉じ括弧が出て来るまでを
一単語とみなす。但し、括弧はネスト可能、つまり、 `abc ( def ( ghi ) jkl ) mno' は、`abc ' , `( def ( ghi ) jkl ) ' , `mno ' の 3単語とみなすんだ 。 但しダブルクオートで囲まれた文字列の中では括弧は機能しないとする。さてどうだ ( * 5 ) 。
; ; 例 11 ( define ( count - words ) ( define ( in - word c count ) ( cond ( ( eof- object ? c ) count ) ( ( char - whitespace ? c ) ( in - space ( read - char ) count ) ) ( ( char= ? c # \ " ) ( in -quote ( read - char ) (+ count 1 ) # f ) ) ( ( char= ? c #\() ( in - paren ( read - char ) (+ count 1 ) # f ) ) ( else ( in - word ( read - char ) count ) ) ) ) ( define ( in - space c count ) ( cond ( ( eof- object ? c ) count ) ( ( char - whitespace ? c ) ( in - space ( read - char ) count ) ) ( ( char= ? c # \ " ) ( in -quote ( read - char ) (+ count 1 ) # f ) ) ( ( char= ? c #\() ( in - paren ( read - char ) (+ count 1 ) # f ) ) ( else ( in - word ( read - char ) (+ count 1 ) ) ) ) ) ( define ( in - quote c count nested ? ) ( cond ( ( eof - object ? c ) ( error " EOF in quoted word " ) ) ( ( char= ? c # \ " ) ( if nested ?
count ( in - space ( read - char ) count ) ) ) ( ( char= ? c # \\ ) ( read - char ) ( in - quote ( read - char ) count nested ? ) ) ( else ( in - quote ( read - char ) count nested ? ) ) ) ) ( define ( in - paren c count nested ? ) ( cond ( ( eof- object ? c ) ( error " EOF in parenthesis " ) ) ( ( char= ? c #\() ( in - paren ( read - char ) count # t ) ( in - paren ( read - char ) count nested ? ) ) ( ( char= ? c # \ ) ) ( if nested ?
count ( in - space ( read - char ) count ) ) ) ( ( char= ? c # \ " ) ( in -quote ( read - char ) count # t ) ( in - paren ( read - char ) count nested ? ) ) ( else ( in - paren ( read - char ) count nested ? ) ) ) ) ( in - space ( read - char ) 0 ) )
ネストした括弧の処理は、本質的に再帰的な処理だ。
だから、括弧の中を処理するルーチン in - paren の中で、 括弧やダブルクオートが出て来た場合に、それぞれを処理するルーチンを再帰的に 呼んでいる。ネストした処理に関わる in - paren と in - quote はネスト中かどうかのフラグを取り、もしネスト中であれば in - space に制御を渡さずにそのままリターンする ( 例11ではcountを返しているが 、 実はその結果は無視されるので何を返しても良い。)
単語の数を数えるという処理に限っていえば、Cでも括弧のネスティングレベルを
数えることにより実現できるけれど、もしこれが入力を解析して何らかの構造を
組み立ててゆくようなプログラムだったらどうだろう。
Cだと、結局自分でスタック的な構造を書くか、再帰を使うしかなくなるだろう。
Schemeでは、全く同じパターンでコードが書ける。
本質的な処理の流れが同じなら、コードも同じように書けてしかるべきだ。
これが、プログラミング言語の抽象化の能力だ。
開かれたルー プ
ま、再帰を使おうがフラグ＋ループ構文を使おうが、コードの見やすさは慣れの問題だ。
しかし、再帰コードには、ループ構文ではちょっと出来ない芸当もできる。
次のコードは、 例8 のコードに加え、引数 user - char で 与えられた文字に出会った際に、引数 user - proc で与えられた 関数に制御を移すものだ。つまり、この関数を使う人が振舞いをカスタマイズできる と思ってもらえば良い 。
( define ( count - words user - char user - proc ) ( define ( in - word c count ) ( cond ( ( eof- object ? c ) count ) ( ( char - whitespace ? c ) ( in - space ( read - char ) count ) ) ( ( char= ? c user - char ) ( user - proc ( read - char ) (+ count 1 ) ) ) ( else ( in - word ( read - char ) count ) ) ) ) ( define ( in - space c count ) ( cond ( ( eof- object ? c ) count ) ( ( char - whitespace ? c ) ( in - space ( read - char ) count ) ) ( ( char= ? c user - char ) ( user - proc ( read - char ) (+ count 1 ) ) ) ( else ( in - word ( read - char ) (+ count 1 ) ) ) ) ) ( in - space ( read - char ) 0 ) )
この関数を次のように呼び出せば、例10と同じ動作をする。
( define ( in - quote c count ) ( cond ( ( eof- object ? c ) ( error " EOF in quoted word " ) ) ( ( char= ? c # \ " ) ( in -quote ( read - char ) count ) ) ( else ( count - words ( read - char ) count ) ) ) ) ( count - words # \ " in - quote )
関数 count - words が複雑な動作をするブラックボックスであったとしても、 ユーザーは自分の好きな動作をプログラムした関数を渡して、部分的に処理を 置き換えることが出来る。 末尾再帰を正しく処理す るScheme実装ならば、 user - proc の末尾呼び出しはスタックを消費しない。 また、ユーザが定義した関数 in - quote から count - words を呼び出す時もスタックを消費しない。それぞれの関数ブロックへの先頭へジャンプすることで、 あたかも count - words と in - quote 全体が 一つのループになったかのように実行される*6 。
また、ユーザ関数は、繰り返しを続けたい時のみ count - words を呼べば良い。 繰り返しを途中で止めたければ、普通に値を返すだけだ。 それが最初に呼ばれた count - words の戻り値となる 。
Cでループ構文を使った場合でも、関数ポインタを渡すようにすれば
ユーザによる拡張は実現できる。しかし、ユーザ関数を呼ぶ時に
スタックフレームが消費されるし、ユーザ関数がループを中断できるようにするには
また別のメカニズムが必要になる。
in - quote は任意のクロージャで良いから、 in - quote 自身が 他の関数の内部で定義された関数であってもよい。次の関数は、 ユーザから渡された文字 quoter をクオート文字として、 count - words を呼び出す関数だ。 この例では、 二つの独立した関 数 ( count - words , count - words - with - quote ) の中でローカルに定義されたコードブロックをまたがって処理のループが構成されることになる。
( define count - words - with - quote quoter ) ( define ( in- quote c count ) ( cond ( ( eof- object ? c ) ( error " EOF in quoted word " ) ) ( ( char= ? c quoter ) ( in -quote ( read - char ) count ) ) ( else ( count - words ( read - char ) count ) ) ) ) ( count - words quoter in - quote )
Schemeプログラマが再帰を好んで使う理由は、こんな柔軟性なんだ。
