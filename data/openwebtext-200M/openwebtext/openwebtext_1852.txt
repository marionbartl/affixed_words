The Money Entry 2007 : Science Fiction Income
Last year , in response to a question from the peanut gallery , I spilled the beans on how much I made in a year from my writing .
This year I thought I ’d return to the subject , not in an overall sense ( in 2006 I did fine , thank you ) , but looking at one segment of my income :
The income I received from writing and editing science fiction .
2006 was an interesting year for me in this regard , primarily because it ’s the first year that , frankly , I ’ve gotten any substantial amount of income from science fiction .
To bracket this , allow me to note that I ’ve been making income off of science fiction since 1999 , which is the year that I first offered Agent to the Stars online as “ shareware . ”
So from 1999 through 2006 , here ’s how the income came down .
Note that I ’m breaking down the income as to when it was actually received , ie. , when I had cash in my hot little hands :
1999 : About $ 400 , from Agent readers
2000 : About $ 1000 , from Agent readers
2001 : About $ 1100 , from Agent readers and a short story sale at Strange Horizons
2002 : About $ 1000 , from Agent readers
2003 : About $ 6000 , from Agent readers and from first part of advance for Old Man ’s War
2004 : About $ 5000 , from Agent readers and from first part of advance for The Android ’s Dream
2005 : About $ 15,000 , from second part of OMW advance , first part of The Ghost Brigades advance , advance for Agent to the Stars hardcover , and short story sale to Subterranean Press .
2006 : About $ 67,000 .
As you can see , there ’s quite a jump from 2006 from the rest of the years ; I made more than four times as much in science fiction than the year before , and about twice what I made for all the years previous .
So what happened ?
Lots of things :
1. 2006 was the first year I received royalties on sales of Old Man ’s War .
The book had earned out on its advance roughly halfway through 2005 — but royalty statements are tallied up only twice a year ( halfway through the fiscal year and then again at the end ) and it takes a few months after that for the information ( and checks ) to be sent to agents and authors .
And even when your book is in the black , there ’s another publishing accounting practice called “ reserves against returns , ” in which the publisher holds some of your royalties in escrow just in case more than expected copies of your book come flooding back to the publisher from booksellers .
What this reserves does ( or , at the very least , did for me ) is to retard the flow of royalties to the author by one royalty statement , which is to say , by another six months .
So although Old Man ’s War was published in January 2005 , I waited seventeen months to get my first royalty check .
( There was also another another wrinkle here in that in addition to earning out its advance , OMW also had to earn out the advance of The Android ’s Dream , which I sold at the same time ; the contracts specified I would n’t see royalties from either until both were earned out — so theoretically it would have been possible that I would n’t have seen royalties from Old Man ’s War until deep into 2008 , since TAD was n’t published until late October 2006 .
Fortunately , OMW was up to the task — and because of that I get royalties from TAD from book one .
So buy it , damn it . )
Bear in mind it ’s not a guaranteed thing that an author will receive royalties ; the conventional wisdom is that most books either do n’t earn out for their authors or just about break even , and I suspect that most publishers try to calibrate their advances to authors based on what they expect the author to make from the book over the course of the book ’s run .
Indeed , I ’ve heard at least one author say to me that if you ’re getting royalties , that just means the publisher did n’t pay you enough up front .
We can have a philosophical debate as to whether it ’s better for an author to get a big chunk of money up front or a smaller flow out the back ; for now , however , I can say I ’m pleased to have the royalty income .
I should also note that while a time lag for royalties is standard operating procedure , there are times when royalties can come more quickly than not .
When the limited edition hardcover of Agent to the Stars sold out its print run midway through 2006 , Subterranean Press quickly cut me a check for the royalties I was owed .
This was partially because as a limited run , there was a finite timespan the book was available ( i.e. , up until the moment the last one sold ) and also a finite amount or royalty I would be owed , and as a small press Subterranean has pretty tight control of its inventory , all of which is not necessarily the case with an open - ended book run .
It ’s also partially because Subterranean Press publisher Bill Schafer is a hoopy frood who knows where his towel is , and also knows authors like to get paid sooner than later whenever possible .
All told , my royalty income in 2006 was about $ 15,000 .
2 . My fiction agent Ethan Ellenberg began to sell foreign - language rights for Old Man ’s War and The Ghost Brigades , and has been reasonably successful , as OMW has been sold in eight foreign languages now , and TGB in five .
The income from foreign language rights varies considerably : I made nearly as much for Old Man ’s War for the German language rights , for example , as I did for the English language rights .
The Chinese language rights ?
Not so much .
A whole lot depends on the the foreign market itself : whether SF is a popular genre , how much income the readers in the country have to buy books , how much books sell for in each market and so on .
In aggregate , however , it can add up to a comfortable amount .
The problem with foreign rights is that they are typically contingent on the success of the book in its original language and market — and then of course subsequent sales in that language will be charted against how one ’s previous editions do in that language .
So to make foreign language sales work your work has to be commercially adept in two different tongues .
Given how little control authors have on the sales of their work in their first language , they can expect even less control in the second language , so you basically hope everything works out in the end .
Naturally , in the case of OMW , I suspect that the fact it was Hugo - nominated is a substantial selling point for foreign - language editors ; me winning the Campbell Award does n’t hurt , either .
Theoretically it ’s possible that somewhere down the line I might see royalties from foreign - language editions .
That ’d be nice , but I ’m not waiting up nights for that .
All told , my foreign sales income in 2006 was about $ 20,000 .
3 . Because my sales of Old Man ’s War and The Ghost Brigades have been healthy , my advances have gone up commensurately ( having a good agent helps in this regard as well ) .
In 2006 , I signed a three - book contract with Tor , with each book bringing $ 25 k each , some of which I got upon signing .
One of the books ( The Last Colony ) is in the can ; the other two I have to write yet ( they ’re on hold while I bang out the follow - up to The Android ’s Dream , for which I have a separate contract ; yes , Tor will have me for a while . )
What do I think of $ 25 k for a novel ?
I think it ’s fine ; I ’ve seen my sales so far for my books and it ’s in line with that .
It ’s less than the advances I ’ve gotten for non-fiction but that ’s an “ apples and oranges ” comparison in terms of sales and distribution .
Other friends of mine who are writers are making more , but then again , they ’re selling more as well , and some of them are also in other segments of the publishing business that pay higher advances ; anecdotally it seems genre pays less in advances than mainstream or lit fic .
Would I like to get paid more up front per book ?
I would n’t mind .
However , inasmuch as a large portion of my writing income comes from outside of fiction writing ( and I have a spouse with a good , benefits - laden job ) I ’m not living from book advance to book advance either .
I can afford to look at intangibles as well .
In the case of Tor , for example , I ’ve been very pleased with their long - term strategy for promoting my work ( and me ! ) , and that has its value as well , in terms of the overall health of my fiction career .
My agent will probably stab me in the eye for saying this , but sometimes intangibles like that are worth as much as more money up front .
Mind you , this warm and fuzzy feeling for Tor and its folk does n’t stop me from approaching the business side of my career as a business — this is why I have an agent , after all : so I can say nice things about Tor while he wrestles and argues with them about money and rights and what have you .
Ethan earns his 15 % .
What I ’m saying is that from a business point of view , it behooves me to look at an entire package , of which money is one part , and many other things are many other parts .
In addition to the three - book contract discussed above , Tor also bought the rights to publish Agent to the Stars at some point in the future , most likely as a trade paperback ( I ’ll be revising that one prior to its Tor publication to bring some of the cultural references up to date ) .
All told , my advance income in 2006 was about $ 30,000 .
4. Miscellaneous income —
This includes my fee for guest editing Subterranean magazine issue # 4 and payment for the short story “ How I Proposed to My Wife : An Alien Sex Story ” ( “ The Sagan Diary , ” which I also wrote in 2006 , I took no upfront payment for ; some of you will recall that I wrote it in exchange for a $ 5 k bid on a draft copy of The Last Colony , the proceeds of which went to the John M. Ford Book Endowment — although SubPress is splitting the back - end profits with me , which will end up being nice , indeed ) .
I recognize that it might be offensive to some to label income from short story writing as “ miscellaneous , ” but please understand that it ’s strictly an economic designation ; I write little enough short fiction , and the payment for it is typically so low relative to other writing , that it does n’t really earn its own breakout designation .
My miscellaneous income was about $ 2,000 in 2006 .
( Caveat :
These numbers are n’t exact because I do n’t have all my 1099 tax forms spread out in front of me when I ’m writing this .
There ’s probably a margin of error of , oh , about $ 3 k . )
Now , what really happened in 2006 , in regard to my science fiction income , was that I had been in the science fiction publishing business for enough time , and had been successful enough at it ( for various reasons , one of which was being just damn lucky ) that this was the year that many potential revenue sources began to flow income in my direction .
In short , time was a major contributing factor — I ’ve now been doing this long enough , basically .
Should I expect this level of income from science fiction every year ?
I do n’t think so , as there are any number of ways this income could go down .
If one of my books sells poorly , that will have an impact on my future advances and on my royalties .
If my books sell poorly in other languages , that will have an impact on future foreign sales .
I could develop a massive writer ’s block or simply choose to write more in other fields and thus write fewer SF novels .
My publishers could suddenly have economic seizures and be unable to pay me what they owe me .
Rampant electronic piracy could eat away into my sales !
( sorry , had to throw that one in there for all the fearful Luddites out there . )
There are lots of ways this income could go away .
Writing SF is n’t a great way to have a stable income .
( Which is n’t to say it could n’t go up , mind you : OMW is selling very nicely in mass market , TGB is heading to mass market in April / May , I ’m touring with The Last Colony when it comes out , TAD is holding its own nicely , “ The Sagan Diary ” is doing mind - bogglingly well for a novelette , and so on .
And there are still foreign languages to sell in .
Do n’t get me wrong , I think I ’m going to do just fine in 2007 , as far as science fiction is concerned .
It ’s simply foolish to assume that just because I ’m doing well one year , that all years in the future will be equally cheery .
Anyone who has been a writer over the long haul will tell you that some years you ’re up , and some years you ’re down . )
In any event , this is what a reasonable amount of success in science fiction publishing looks like , circa early 2007 .
The floor is now open to questions and comments .
( Edited in later :
Why I write about my writing income , and some follow - up thoughts , based on comments and e-mails )
“ That colored boy . ”
I do n’t know why La Jara physician Vaughn Jackson picked that description .
He did n’t return my call .
Jackson ’s words while defending his son
Trey against charges of racism surprised a lot of people I talked to Tuesday .
“ I ’ve had that colored boy in my home , ” Jackson said of the teen son of an African - American high school basketball coach .
If the southern Colorado town of La Jara needs a place to start mending an ugly racial rift , Dr. Jackson ’s phrase would be a fine place to start .
Racial tensions led Centauri High School to postpone its prom and to close for a day for fear of violence .
To African - Americans or anyone who has dealt in race relations , Jackson ’s words in an interview with Denver Post reporter Electa Draper recall paternalism and second - class citizenship .
At the very least , referring to a black teenager as a “ colored boy ” shows a lack of understanding .
If black teenagers are still “ colored boys ” to adults in La Jara , the charge by parent Ra Vernon that the “ N - word ” has been tossed around a usually distinguished rural high school makes sad sense .
As for the clandestine raising of the Confederate battle flag on the Centauri High flagpole over Easter , well , that ’s hard to spin as anything but an attempt at racial intimidation .
Ditto for the Internet photo of four Centauri students , including Trey Jackson , holding rifles and a pistol while giving what looks like the Nazi salute .
Problems at Centauri
High stem from five white and Latino athletes who did n’t think they got enough playing time from basketball coach Larry Joe Hunt , who is black .
The recriminations have festered into a community crisis for La Jara .
Some folks blame school officials for not acting sooner on the sports situation .
But principals and administrators almost never mediate playing - time disputes .
And the hands - off approach almost never leads to public displays of racism .
The best news out of La Jara in the past week is the approach of the North Conejos school board .
It has committed not only to find out what happened , but also to reunite the school and the surrounding community .
School board president Leroy Salazar admits that the Confederate flag has become a symbol of “ oppression and intimidation ” to blacks and that every member of his community should know that .
He also does n’t use the term “ colored boy . ”
But Salazar says a lack of African - Americans in La Jara could lead to misunderstanding the phrase ’s offensiveness .
“ There are many more people of goodwill here than people of ill will , ” Salazar said Tuesday as he repaired fences on his farm .
“ Tonight , there is an interfaith , ecumenical church service to celebrate the things that bind us . ”
The school board asked for investigative help from the state police and the district attorney in sorting out the Centauri situation .
But the board also invited the University of Colorado ’s Center for the Prevention of Violence and a U.S. Department of Justice community relations program to help organize classes in diversity and cultural sensitivity .
No one should doubt the offensiveness of the phrase “ colored boy , ” said William King , a professor in the ethnic studies department at the University of Colorado at Boulder .
King called the phrase “ disparaging and dehumanizing . ”
Think N - word light .
“ Colored boy ” is the polar opposite of “ people of color . ”
“ In Colorado , not everyone was raised in a diverse environment , ” acknowledged Omar Montgomery , director of black student services at the University of Colorado at Denver .
But for African - Americans , “ ‘ colored boy ’ reduces us to that slave mentality .
It relates to the period of Jim Crow . ”
Think separate , but very unequal .
Salazar hopes the recent racial tensions will have everyone “ putting themselves in the other person ’s shoes . ”
With racially insensitive phrases and Rebel flags flying , it might be the only way to heal La Jara ’s wounds .

Stuck in a unrelenting cycle of hope and despair and hope and despair .
What a curse it is to be 23 and want to change the world .
What a curse to be so disillusioned so early in life .
What a curse to want to change a world that will not change ... that can not change ?
That can not change as long as we sit and wait for others to change it .
That cannot change as long as our elected Democrats refuse to take a principled stand .
That can not change until they - - until we -- appreciate the gravity of the situation before us : we are losing America .
This is not America .
I refuse to accept it .
America does n't torture .
America does n't jail people incommunicado for years .
America does n't sit idly by as an entire people are exterminated in Darfur .
America does n't stifle science .
America does n't conduct massive , secret spying on innocent citizens .
America does n't believe the individual is an annoyance , an impediment to supreme government power .
This is n't the greatest democracy on earth .
This is n't the nation that pioneered human rights .
This is n't the America that leads the world , that leads humanity towards a greater good .
No , I refuse to accept this America of shame .
This is not my America .
It is an America perverted by Republican stewardship .
A nation that under GOP rule has abandoned its founding ideals of freedom , liberty , and justice for all .
True Americans -- coast to coast , young and old - - now bow their heads silently in collective shame for a nation that has lost its way .
Obituary : Kurt Vonnegut , satirist and pessimist
By Sandy English
27 April 2007
The American writer Kurt Vonnegut died on April 11 at the age of 84 from injuries to his brain suffered during a fall several weeks earlier .
Vonnegut wrote 14 novels , three collections of short stories , and a smaller number of essays .
He was a popular writer , particularly among the young and disaffected .
His novels appeared in high - school curriculums and were sometimes banned in libraries , ostensibly because of their sexual content , but often , in reality , because of the way in which they mocked official society .
He was born in Indianapolis , Indiana in 1922 , the youngest of three children of a moderately wealthy German - American family .
His mother ’s parents were in the beer - brewing business , and his father was an architect and a painter .
Vonnegut grew up in a place and time when members of the American middle - class often had an attraction for radical and progressive ideas .
As a teenager , his relatives gave him books of speeches by the Socialist leader Eugene V. Debs ( also born in Indiana ) and the remarkable novels of American life by John Dos Passos .
Neither influence ever entirely left his intellectual sensibility .
As a boy and young man , he suffered personal tragedies , often connected with the upheavals experienced by American society .
The Great Depression robbed his father of a livelihood , and in this period his mother began to show signs of mental illness .
Vonnegut ’s college education at Cornell University was interrupted by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor .
He volunteered for the army and was sent to train at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh .
On leave to visit home for Mother ’s Day , he found that his mother had committed suicide .
The army assigned him to the 106th infantry division and he fought in the Battle of the Bulge , where most of his unit was destroyed .
Afterwards , he was taken prisoner and assigned to work in a factory in the German city of Dresden , making vitamins for pregnant women .
On February 13 , 1945 , the British and Americans bombed Dresden , which Vonnegut later called in an interview , “ a city full of museums and zoos — man at his greatest . ”
The bombing created a firestorm in which 135,000 people died — a major atrocity of the Second World War .
Vonnegut and his fellow POWs sheltered in a meat - storage area called Slaughterhouse Five .
When he returned to the surface , he found the city had been razed to the ground .
He and his fellow POWs were ordered to help dispose of the dead .
It was this event , more than any other , which conditioned his view of life .
He developed a hatred of violence and inhumanity .
When the war ended it appears that the young Vonnegut , along with millions of other war survivors , looked forward to a better , more equitable society .
In his last novel , Timequake ( 1997 ) , also a semi-memoir , he describes the final days of World War II when , as a released POW who had not yet met up with Allied forces , he was told by German soldiers that now the United States would have to fight the USSR .
“ We replied that we did n’t think so .
We expected the USSR to try to become more like the USA with freedom of speech and religion and fair trials and honestly elected officials and so on .
We in turn would try to do what they claimed to be doing which was distribute goods and services and opportunities more fairly .
‘ From each according to his abilities , to each according to his needs ’ .
That sort of thing . ”
But the German soldiers turned out to be right .
American society did not become more equal , but instead , after first compromising with the Stalinist leadership in the USSR , set out to isolate it .
The American ruling elite never abandoned its aim of reconquering Soviet territory for capitalism .
The Stalinist bureaucracy , for its part , far form reforming itself , launched further repression at home and helped decapitate revolutionary movements around the world .
These painful facts were to color Vonnegut ’s life and writing in ways that he probably never fully understood .
Vonnegut worked at various jobs after the war , first as a police reporter in Chicago and then as a public relations man for General Electric in Schenectady , New York .
After 1951 he began to write fiction full - time , though for many years he had to supplement his income with various jobs .
From his beginnings as a writer Vonnegut was intimately concerned with social problems .
Based on his experience working for GE , his first novel , Player Piano ( 1952 ) , depicts Paul Proteus , a head scientist at fictitious corporation in a place called Ilium , New York .
In this society , nearly everything is automated and most workers must either join the army or live off a kind of public make - work scheme .
Eventually , Proteus sides with workers who are losing their dignity .
He helps to lead a rebellion that destroys the machinery and hopes to reestablish a more primitive form of society .
Here were all the elements of his future work .
Player Piano satirized the hypocrisy of corporate life and the conformity of American society .
Vonnegut reasserted human dignity in the face of seemingly inexplicable forces .
But because life in America was , to him , largely inexplicable , Vonnegut also drew pessimistic conclusions about the possibility of changing society .
In the case of Player Piano , society had to take a technological step backward before people could free themselves .
For the rest of his life , Vonnegut proudly referred to himself as a Luddite .
The 1950s were a particularly hard time to begin writing creatively .
Genuine art and the inner and outer dissent that it both requires and nourishes tended to be stifled or muted by the reactionary atmosphere of McCarthyism and the Cold War prosperity .
Social satire was , for the most part , relegated to the genre of science fiction , where serious readers or critics might not notice it .
A number of critical views of society — including Ray Bradbury ’s Fahrenheit 451 ( 1950 ) and Fredrick Pohl and C. M. Kornbluth ’s The Space Merchants ( 1952 ) — that appeared in this genre were dark .
The future was regarded with trepidation .
While revolt played a role in this kind of writing , it was at best only partially successful .
The plots were strikingly similar , including a struggle for freedom by a small group , often abetted by a convert from the establishment , against an all - powerful society that was conformist , totalitarian and inhuman .
George Orwell ’s 1984 and Animal Farm had exerted a powerful influence in literary social criticism , as had Aldous Huxley ’s Brave New World and Yevgeny Zamyatin ’s We .
But this was not primarily a literary matter .
The American ruling elite had purged official artistic life of left - wing elements in the immediate postwar years .
The labor movement adopted anti-communism and class collaboration as its credo .
The illusions that America might be moving in a progressive direction , a further extension of the New Deal , toward some sort of US - style “ popular front , ” illusions which Vonnegut — along with many others — had shared , were rapidly dashed .
American capitalism , based on its preeminent world position and its colossal wealth , imposed intellectual conformity on society , and attempted to convince the population that the new reality was the best of all possible worlds .
Where was the dissident artist to turn ?
Vonnegut cannot be entirely blamed for arriving at dystopian conclusions .
In hindsight , it is easy to see that the world order that emerged after 1945 only appeared permanent .
Very few , and especially few artists , saw the future possibilities of genuinely humane social development at the time .
Nevertheless , a certain literary tradition of bleak glimpses at the future ( or perhaps the present ) was established , and Vonnegut was one of its best representatives .
His work is filled with a desire to criticize America , and he defended political and legal equality nobly .
But he also cynically dismissed the possibility of social equality as an equality of universal denial or leveling in the short story “ Harrison Bergeron ” ( 1961 ) , a staple in the American high - school English class reading lists today .
Human history , to his way of thinking , was in general incomprehensible .
Vonnegut added all sorts of amusing improbabilities — in the Sirens of Titan ( 1959 ) , aliens manipulated history to send signals to each other .
Escape became a common solution to social problems in his work .
In the Sirens of Titan physical escape from the Earth is the way out of troubled conditions .
His concern for the world - historical tragedies of the century was deep and undeniable , but he was not able to approach these historically .
As Doris Lessing wrote ( approvingly ) of Mother Night ( 1961 ) , about an American double - agent on trial for his role as a presumed Nazi propagandist : “ Whose fault was it all — the gas chambers , the camps , the degradations and the debasements of all our standards ?
Whose ?
Well , ours as much as theirs . ”
Vonnegut ’s ahistorical humanism floundered on his pessimism .
In Cat ’s Cradle ( 1963 ) , the narrator , an adherent of a kind and gentle religion , has been working on a book about the bombing of Hiroshima .
In the end , he witnesses the desiccation of the world by a man-made substance called Ice Nine .
Vonnegut ’s fame grew and reached its height at the time of the Vietnam War , when renewed mass political protest was beginning to create a healthier cultural atmosphere .
In 1969 he published Slaughterhouse - Five , based on his experiences in Dresden .
Artistically , the work is probably his best .
The narrative passes back and forth between the Dresden bombing , postwar American suburbia and a “ utopian ” and more humane existence on another planet .
While there was no real development in his overall worldview — ultimately the leading characters can only run away from the horrors of American life — the novel is a biting expose of American - British war crimes and the anxieties that underlay life in the postwar decades .
He continued to write in the same vein .
There were sometimes passages of sparkling frankness .
Breakfast of Champions ( 1973 ) contains a vision of American society as a stranger from another planet might see it :
“ A lot of citizens were so ignored and cheated and insulted that they thought they might be in the wrong country , or even on the wrong planet , that some terrible mistake had been made .
It might have comforted them some if their anthem and their motto had mentioned fairness or brotherhood or hope or happiness , had somehow welcomed them to the society and its real estate . ”
Vonnegut ’s sense of kindness , however , was not merely humane , but also a kind of retreat in the face of insurmountable odds .
In novel after novel his despairing view of society surfaced .
Slapstick ( 1976 ) is told from the ruins of the Empire State Building in a Manhattan known as the Isle of Death , after America “ bankrupt and falling apart ” has been destroyed by a plague .
In Galápagos ( 1985 ) , the human species has saved itself only by evolving beaks and flippers and eschewing the use of tools , which have caused so much trouble , or , as the writer Lorrie Moore called it in a review of the book , “ The huge spiritual mistake that is Western civilization . ”
On the whole , Vonnegut ’s characters and situations do not sufficiently challenge his readers .
He spoke to a social mood more than he fought for a new one .
If he was satirical , he was also a little too easy .
However , if he pulled back from the most radical conclusions about a social rot that he had seen spread for his whole working life as an artist , this had something to do with the intellectual conditions that made it difficult to characterize in an all - sided manner the age in which he lived .
The trenchant social criticism available to a Dos Passos in the mid-1920s was in short supply by Vonnegut ’s day .
The circumstances in which he wrote were unfavorable for characterizing American society as devastatingly as needed to be done , and also , frankly , the task was complex .
Toward the end of his life , Vonnegut spoke courageously and honestly about the Iraq War and the Bush Administration .
In his last book , Man Without a Country ( 2005 ) , he asked , “ What can be said to our young people now that psychopathic personalities , which is to say , persons without consciences , without sense of pity or shame , have taken all the money in the treasuries of our government and corporations and made it all their own ? ”
Don
Ho , an entertainer who defined popular perceptions of Hawaiian music in the 1960s and held fast to that image as a peerless Waikiki nightclub attraction , died yesterday in Honolulu .
He was 76 .
The cause was heart failure , his daughter Dayna Ho said .
Mr. Ho was a durable spokesman for the image of Hawaii as a tourist playground .
His rise as a popular singer dovetailed with a visitor boom that followed statehood in 1959 and the advent of affordable air travel .
For 40 years , his name was synonymous with Pacific Island leisure , as was “ Tiny Bubbles , ” his signature hit , which helped turn him into a national figure .
Born Donald Tai Loy Ho in the Honolulu enclave of Kaka‘ako , Mr. Ho had an ethnic background worthy of the islands ’ melting - pot ideal : he was of Hawaiian , Chinese , Portuguese , Dutch and German descent .
He grew up in Kaneohe , on the windward side of the island of Oahu , and it was there that he began his singing career at Honey ’s , a restaurant and lounge owned by his mother , Emily .
Mr. Ho enlisted in the United States Air Force in 1954 , receiving his certification as a fighter pilot in Texas but never seeing combat .
He transferred to Military Airlift Command and flew cargo transport routes across the Pacific before leaving the service the year that Hawaii joined the Union as the 50th state .

Owner of conservative radio station KSFO demands liberal critic quit using audio clips 1 / 3 Back to Gallery
A series of events involving a local liberal blogger , a San Francisco conservative radio station and the reaction of two of the larger corporate advertisers in the country -- Bank of America and MasterCard -- is revealing how slippery freedom of speech has become in the digital age .
The tale of Spocko , a self - described " fifth - tier " blogger who lives in San Francisco , exemplifies how one person with a computer and an Internet hookup can challenge the views of a major media corporation -- and what a media corporation will do to stop him .
For the past year , Spocko has been e-mailing advertisers of KSFO - AM with audio clips from its shows and asking sponsors to examine what they 're supporting .
Some sponsors have pulled their ads , after hearing clips like one of KSFO 's Lee Rodgers suggesting that a protester be " stomped to death right there .
Just stomp their bleeping guts out . "
Now , bloggers and media freedom advocates are concerned about the legal reaction from Disney / ABC - owned KSFO .
Shortly before Christmas , an ABC lawyer demanded that Spocko remove audio clips from his blog on the grounds that Spocko's posting of KSFO content was illegal .
Digital freedom advocates counter that the clips constitute fair use and worry that critical voices could be silenced by corporations threatening legal action for violation of copyright law .
" That 's inevitably been the modus operandi of the media companies in these types of situations , " said Ronald Coleman , legal counsel for the Media Bloggers Association , which provides legal support to bloggers .
" It does n't matter the size of the blogger . "
Spocko , who asked that his real name not be used because he fears retaliation , is a hobby blogger ; he says he gets 15 visitors a day -- and no advertisers -- to his political and media criticism blog .
A little over a year ago , he became so annoyed by the " violent " tone of commentary on KSFO - AM that he and some of his readers e-mailed more than three dozen of the station 's advertisers .
" I want to emphasize that if you withdraw your ads you are n't limiting their free speech , just removing your paid support of it , " Spocko wrote to advertisers .
In a statement Wednesday , KSFO program director Ken Berry said , " Many of the remarks attributed to KSFO on the Internet are old , lacking context and , in some cases , outright lies .
When our hosts have stepped over the line , they have apologized and have been reprimanded . "
Berry declined to specify Wednesday which remarks were old or lies or who was reprimanded .
Instead , at noon Friday , KSFO will pre-empt regular programming to allow four KSFO personalities cited in Spocko's e-mails to answer questions on - air about the controversy from the public , bloggers and media .
" I do n't tell people what to say , but I do think there will be some mea culpas there , " Berry said .
Berry said KSFO will invite Spocko to appear on the air , but the blogger has declined such invitations in the past , saying in an e-mail to The Chronicle , " I 'd be just another revenue generating ' event ' for them to their audience , and they would love that kind of ' controversy ' because it would MAKE them money and they still had control . "
The station did n't have control over what Spocko sent to sponsors .
Among the clips circulated to advertisers was one of morning show co-host Melanie Morgan saying of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , " We 've got a bull 's - eye painted on her big laughing eyes . "
Morgan said she has never called for anybody 's assassination and was speaking merely in political terms , as she is researching Pelosi 's background for a book proposal .
" Yes , this is a freedom of speech issue , and this individual is entitled to say what he wants to , " said Morgan .
" But he 's trying to take away my livelihood , and I 'm not trying to take away his . "
After his Internet service provider received a letter from ABC lawyers , Spocko pulled down the 30 audio clips on his blog .
But supporters have taken up his cause on influential liberal blogs like DailyKos and firedoglake , and reposted the clips all over the Web , arguing that Spocko's freedom of digital speech must be protected .
A supportive YouTube video featuring some of the clips drew more than 31,000 viewers within days .
" One thing the Internet is good for is holding people accountable for their speech , " said Karl Frisch , a spokesman for the liberal watchdog group Media Matters .
For months , the organization has posted an online petition urging media outlets to not give a platform to " conservative hate merchants " like Morgan .
An attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation said Spocko did n't do anything that millions of bloggers do n't do every day : post commentary alongside slices of copyrighted material .
" This is prototypical fair use of copyrighted material , " said Matt Zimmerman , an attorney with the San Francisco civil liberties and digital privacy organization .
EFF is not representing Spocko , but has reviewed his situation and is monitoring it .
" Bloggers should n't have to be worried about being sued every time they post a screen shot from ' The Simpsons . ' "
Spocko described himself as a communications professional , but is not a journalist and does not work for a KSFO competitor and is not a former or current station employee .
Most of the clips he circulated were pulled from a morning drive - time show on KSFO co-hosted by Morgan and Rodgers and from an evening program hosted by Brian Sussman .
In one audio clip making the rounds , Sussman tells a caller : " I would take it that you 're probably Muslim . "
" No , " the caller said , " I 'm independent .
I do n't subscribe . "
" Why do n't you right now say Allah is a whore and that would prove it to me , " Sussman said .
After receiving an e-mail from Spocko's group last spring about the station 's content , KSFO advertiser Bank of America reviewed other programming on the station .
Eventually , the corporation pulled its advertising after hearing material it felt was polarizing .
MasterCard , which received similar e-mails about KSFO 's programming , also decided not to advertise again on Sussman 's show .
The Michigan Economic Development Corp. asked its ad buyer to exclude KSFO if it purchases time on the ABC radio network .
Said spokesman Michael Shore on Wednesday : " The speech was about as offensive as one could imagine . "
Spocko said it would be dangerous to dismiss the comments he 's heard on KSFO as the sort of ratings - boosting hyperbole endemic to talk radio , even if it 's uttered in the name of entertainment .
" It 's entertainment until somebody is attacked , " Spocko said .
" Until it crosses the line , which I think this does . "
@bignaz2k
yes , i understand that those are n't extruders .
it 's fairly obvious that there is , in fact , a rack of jam jars at the back of the unit .
what i was trying to do , you see , was string specific english words together for comic effect , perhaps causing the reader to reexamine the photo and question whether there were actually play - doh extruders sticking out the back of a computer - keyboard waffle - maker — or , at the very least , to point out the resemblance said jam jars bear to the extruders mentioned above .
sorry for any confusion caused to you by my attempt ( such as it was , sans pun ) at humour .

US massacres of civilians spark protests in Afghanistan
By Joe Kay
5 May 2007
Bombing raids by US - led NATO forces in western Afghanistan last week killed at least 50 civilians and perhaps over 100 , reports from Afghan government officials and human rights organizations have confirmed .
The aerial bombings took place on April 28 and 29 in the Shindand District of the western province of Herat .
According to a statement by the US military , 136 “ Taliban fighters ” were killed in two separate bombing raids , but this claim provoked immediate anger and skepticism on the part of local residents , who insist that there are no Taliban in the region .
Earlier this week , thousands gathered to protest the killings and denounce the US - backed government of Hamid Karzai .
At least 20 were wounded when Afghan police opened fire on the demonstrators .
In recent days , reports have emerged from the province itself about the nature of the bombings .
Ghalum Nabi Hakak , the Herat representative of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission , told the Washington Post on Wednesday night , “ So far the people have buried 45 bodies , and they are still taking out more .
Yesterday they buried 12 children , ” he said .
“ The exact number of dead is not clear , but the people are very angry . ”
Those who visited the area said that by mid-week villagers were still attempting to dig out bodies from collapsed mud houses destroyed in the NATO raids on two villages .
Reports differ on the number of people killed and displaced by the bombings .
One resident said that more than 100 people had been killed , and all were civilians .
Many more were injured .
Adrian Edwards , spokesman for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan , said a separate investigation found 49 civilians killed and over 900 families displaced .
Farzana Ahmadi , a spokeswoman for the governor of Herat , said that 100 houses were destroyed and 1,600 people rendered homeless .
Ahmadi said that a report prepared by local officials concluded that “ some women and children were drowned in the river , and it was maybe in the heat of the moment that the children and people wanted to escape and jumped into the water . ”
While the exact nature of the events leading up to the bombings is unclear , it is known that US special forces were in the area conducting operations .
The US military claims that these forces met some resistance , but there is no independent confirmation of these claims .
NATO air support was called in , and the villages were bombed .
In response to this latest massacre , NATO military and Bush administration spokesmen repeated the same rationales given for every atrocity .
General Dan McNeill , commander of NATO ’s International Security Assistance Forces , declared that “ only firing insurgents were targeted . ”
White House spokesman Tony Snow tried to pin the blame for the deaths on Afghans , saying on Thursday that the Taliban was “ deliberately placing [ civilians ] in harm ’s way . ”
The nature of US operations in the western region of Afghanistan , which borders Iran , is unknown .
Most military actions in the past have concentrated on the south , near the border with Pakistan , where the Taliban has the most support .
Local residents insist that there are no members of the Taliban in the area .
It is possible that the US is seeking to establish a firmer grip on western Afghanistan in preparation for any planned operations against Iran .
The killings in western Afghanistan took place amid a broader “ spring offensive ” by US and NATO forces that has led to the deaths of scores of people throughout the country .
On Friday , Janan Gulzai , a provincial assembly member , said that at least 13 civilians were killed in a NATO bombing raid in southern Afghanistan on Tuesday night .
Gulzai told Reuters , “ I saw all the victims are civilians . ”
These civilians were apparently killed in a similar manner as those in Herat province .
NATO warplanes were summoned after ground forces came under fire .
The planes bombed the area indiscriminately , destroying three automobiles containing the 13 people killed .
An ongoing British - led NATO offensive in the south this week has killed at least 75 , all described by the NATO forces as “ Taliban . ”
These incidents follow two separate killing sprees by US forces near the eastern city of Jalalabad .
Six were killed during a raid on April 29 , including one woman and one child .
In March , US marines went on a rampage in the same area that left 12 civilians dead and 35 more injured .
It is difficult to derive any objective measure of the toll on the Afghan population from operations by US and NATO forces in recent months .
Media coverage of events outside of the capital of Kabul is based largely on statements by US and NATO military commanders .
An AP account found that 151 civilians have been killed this year , including 51 blamed on US and NATO forces ( not including the recent reports from Herat ) .
However this tally is based on figures provided by NATO and the Karzai government , and both have an obvious interest in underreporting civilian casualties .
Mounting civilian casualties have , however , led to a sharp increase in popular opposition to the occupation and the Karzai government .
The most recent killings in Jalalabad have led to several days of protests involving thousands of people , including many Afghan students .
The AFP quoted one student attending a protest on Wednesday asking , “ Why are they [ Karzai and Bush ] not accounting for the blood of innocent people who are being killed by the Americans on our soil ? ”
Another declared , “ The Americans have invaded our country .
They have made themselves the owners and us their slaves . ”
Opposition to the government is growing , and is not confined to supporters of the Taliban .
Demonstrations over the past week , including protests by hundreds of people on Friday , have clearly shaken the unstable puppet regime in Kabul , prompting Karzai to issue statements denouncing the civilian deaths .
One of the principal demands of the protests has been for Karzai ’s resignation .
Karzai insisted on Wednesday that his government can “ no longer accept ” civilian causalities .
“ The intention may be very good to fight terrorism , sometimes mistakes are made , but five years on , it is very difficult for us to continue to accept civilian casualties , ” he said .
“ It ’s not understandable anymore . ” Karzai warned of “ serious consequences for all ” if the violence against civilians is not curtailed .
Certainly he counts himself among those who might face these serious consequences .
In comments to the AFP , veteran Afghan journalist and commentator Ikhpolwak Safi noted , “ When civilians die — obviously not for good reason — and it is linked to [ Karzai ’s ] government , it will turn people against him .
Dropping bombs on villages because one individual attacked them is not a wise thing to do .
This is what the foreign troops have been doing . ”

Explanation :
It 's not the sky that 's falling .
More accurately , the Earth is rising .
The Earth 's rotation gives a continually changing view to all Earth observers , including those measuring the universe at the Paranal Observatory .
The observatory 's four , massive 8.2 meter telescope units are situated on top of the 2,600 meter high mountain , Cerro Paranal , in the dry Atacama Desert in northern Chile .
The individual unit telescopes can be used separately or in combination .
Their names , Antu , Kueyen , Melipal , and Yepun , are taken from the Mapuche language .
Fittingly they translate to Sun , Moon , Evening Star , and Southern Cross .
Together they are fittingly known as the European Southern Observatory 's Very Large Telescope .

Here 's something we all learned in the schoolyard :
If you 're the guy who says , " I'm the decider , " you 're not the decider .
Deciders just decide .
It 's like the guy who says , " I 'm the boss around here " -- he protests too much .
Bosses just boss .
If you have to say it , you 're already in trouble .
The Bush administration used to understand that .
( I almost typed " George W. Bush used to understand that , " but then I realized there is not enough evidence to support that .
Who runs the Bush administration ?
I 'm not sure of the answer to that question , but I do know that George W. Bush is way down on the list of probable candidates . )
The Bush administration embraced the arrogance of power with gusto .
Its motto was " Never complain , never explain , " which morphed into " Never explain , frequently complain , " which morphed into " Always complain , pretend to explain . "
" I'm the decider " is not an explanation .
It may not even be a statement of fact .
It used to be that there was only one constituency George W. Bush did not ignore : the religious right .
His dad got in trouble by ignoring " the base , " as it 's often called , and it was just not going to be like father , like son .
No one was going to out - Jesus the president , and no one has .
But suddenly he has to pay attention to another constituency : congressional Republicans .
They 're worried about losing their majority in the House .
They 're worried about the folks back home .
They 're worried about the down - ticket Republicans , the state candidates who may feel the heat , who may experience the wrath .
They 're all fine when commie pinko lefty atheists attack the Bush administration ; commie pinko lefty atheists are fun to run against .
Thanks to the Karl Rove ad hominem playbook , Republican pols are able to paint people in the opposition as traitors and cowards and socialists .
What happened to former Ambassador Joseph Wilson is just the most public example ; the Rove machine has been leaking lies about opponents forever .
Ah , the greatest hits : John McCain has an illegitimate black child .
Max Cleland was n't really a war hero .
Anthony Zinni is an embittered careerist .
But now , alas , it 's a bunch of officers who served in Iraq saying the plan for the war was flawed from the get - go , and the flaws were never corrected because Donald Rumsfeld never listens to anything except the voices inside his own head .
Hard to say they 're not patriotic .
Hard to say they 're not in possession of the facts .
Not that the Rove machine did n't try :
The dissenting officers were just chewing sour grapes ; they 're mad that their pet programs were not authorized ; they 're mad because their branch of the service was passed over .
This line of slander is not flying , and everyone knows it 's not flying .
But Rumsfeld has been loyal ( except , thinking long - term here , that leading your commander in chief into an unwinnable war is hardly the highest form of loyalty ) , and George Bush rewards loyalty .
He says he reads the front pages -- according to reliable reports , he does not actually read the front pages , but let 's call it a metaphor -- and he knows what people are saying , and he 's the decider : Rumsfeld stays .
Meanwhile , the administration has spent a week putting out the fire - Rumsfeld fires , almost as though it had nothing else to do .
This administration used to understand how to control the news cycle , but it can't do that anymore .
It has to play the chat show game .
Last week , it sent representatives scurrying to dismiss reports that it planned to bomb Iran as " wild speculation " -- not untrue , mind you , just not proved .
This week it 's devoting its resources to protecting Donald Rumsfeld .
This would all be gratifying in a " see Spot run scared " sort of way , were it not for the reality on the ground , the deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan , the obstructionism in the United Nations , the poisoned waters and the hungry children and the despairing immigrants , all put on hold by George " The Decider " Bush .
Not that the Bush administration is without power -- it is still much feared in Washington and elsewhere .
As you read the news stories , see how many people ask to be quoted anonymously " for fear of retaliation . "
One Associated Press story last week quoted two Republican members of the House of Representatives who sought anonymity in exchange for candor .
Presumably , they have home districts and political supporters and their own long - cultivated bases , but the big Bush whirlwind can come and knock them down anyway , and they know it .
It 's a cowardly form of dissent , but at least it 's starting to happen .
Who knows -- maybe even Democrats will join the chorus .
I am the boss of you , I really am , and I decide what is going to happen .
I 'm the guy .
I 'm it .
I have the title .
Are you listening ?
I am ... do n't you walk away when I 'm speaking to you !
I 'm the honcho , the cheese , the enchilada !
Bioengineers Simulate Human Metabolism
Some bioengineers at UCSD are building a model to simulate parts of human metabolism .
Bioengineering researchers at UC San Diego have painstakingly assembled a virtual human metabolic network that will give researchers a new way to hunt for better treatments for hundreds of human metabolic disorders , from diabetes to high levels of cholesterol in the blood .
This first - of - its - kind metabolic network builds on the sequencing of the human genome and contains more than 3,300 known human biochemical transformations that have been documented during 50 years of research worldwide .
Note that these people are engineers , not scientists .
They are treating the human body as just another complex system to engineer .
They are using simulation just as engineers simulate airplanes , cars , and other systems designed by humans .
Their simulations are a prelude to efforts to re-engineer the human body .
Simulations allow more rapid testing of much larger combinations of conditions .
For human bodies simulations will allow testing of drugs and other treatments without need for the huge sums of money used in real human trials and also without the need to wait for lots of real wall clock time to go by .
Plus , simulations can check out dangerous scenarios that would be far too risky to try with real humans .
An increasing portion of all biomedical research and development will take place in simulations .
The cost of computing will continue to decline as the software becomes more complex and the data from real lab experiments feed in to make the models increasingly more realistic .
The simulation can predict the behavior of actual human cells .
In a report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) made available on the journal 's website on Jan. 29 , the UCSD researchers led by Bernhard Ø Palsson , a professor of bioengineering in the Jacobs School of Engineering , unveiled the BiGG ( biochemically , genetically , and genomically structured ) database as the end product of this phase of the research project .
Each person 's metabolism , which represents the conversion of food sources into energy and the assembly of molecules , is determined by genetics , environment , and nutrition .
In a demonstration of the power and flexibility of the BiGG database , the UCSD researchers conducted 288 simulations , including the synthesis of testosterone and estrogen , as well as the metabolism of dietary fat .
In every case , the behavior of the model matched the published performance of human cells in defined conditions .
This simulation is limited to known interactions and transformations done by cellular components .
As more interactions become discovered and characterized these additional pieces of the puzzle can get added to existing simulations such as this one at UCSD .
Fortunately , biochips which measure proteins and genes keep getting more powerful .

The illustrious history of the yellow legal pad .
By Suzanne Snider
ON A MONDAY AFTERNOON LAST SUMMER in the town of Hastings , Minn. , David Norman Wigen parked his white pickup truck near the intersection of Fourth and Vermillion Streets , walked into the Wells Fargo branch there , and attempted to stage a heist .
The 49 - year - old construction worker handed a bank teller a curt , crumpled note : " Money now , do not make me hurt someone ! "
The teller handed him $ 260 .
Wigen fled with the money and within the next five hours bought some methamphetamine , confessed his crime to his sister , and was arrested by an off - duty police officer .
Other than its clumsiness , Wigen 's failed robbery is remarkable for one detail : the medium he selected to convey his instructions to the teller .
His note had been scrawled in pencil on a sheet from a yellow legal pad .
Once used only by law students and lawyers , the yellow legal pad is now employed to a degree unrivaled in stationery .
" End career as a fighter , " President Richard Nixon wrote on a legal pad in August 1974 .
Five days later , on the top of another one , he scratched , " Resignation Speech . "
Jeff
Tweedy , front man for the rock band Wilco , writes his songs on a legal pad .
Jim Harrison , the laureate of the untamed heart , wrote Legends of the Fall on legal pads ; Elmore Leonard writes his crime novels on them .
Nonfiction criminals , it appears , are fond of them , too .
How did they get so popular ?
And how so yellow ?
RECENTLY , MIKE WYSZYNSKI , THE PLANT MANAGER of American Pad & Paper Company 's factory in Holyoke , Mass. , walked between piles of paper stacked over four feet high .
He stopped by several large rolls of yellow paper standing on their ends .
A workhorse of a machine was busy feeding a swath of yellow paper from one of these rolls , mechanically ruling the paper with calibrated pins dipped in blue ink .
The oversize page would ultimately be made into 25 5 - inch - by - 8 - inch tablets , known in the industry as " Junior " legal pads .
AMPAD ( as the company is known ) manufactures legal pads under its own name , but it also makes pads that are later stamped with other brand names , like Staples and Wal - Mart .
AMPAD maintains four factories in different locations , but the Holyoke facility was its first , and it is the site where the first legal pad was ruled , cut , and stitched .
( This historical distinction was apparently not enough to save the plant , however : AMPAD will close the Holyoke facility within the year and open one in Matamoros , Mexico . )
In 1888 , Thomas W. Holley , a 24 - year - old paper mill worker in Holyoke , had an idea for how to use the paper scraps , known as sortings , discarded by the mill .
Sortings were anything trimmed away as scrap or considered of lesser quality than the writing paper eventually packaged and sold .
Holley 's notion was to bind the scraps into pads that could be sold at a cut rate .
Convinced he had a winning idea , he founded his own company to collect the sortings from local mills ( Holyoke was then the papermaking capital of the world ) and began churning out bargain - price pads .
The legal pad 's margins , also called down lines , are drawn 1.25 inches from the left edge of the page .
( This is the only requirement for a pad to qualify as a legal pad , though the iconic version has yellow paper , blue lines , and a red gummed top . )
Holley added the ruling that defined the legal pad in the early 1900s at the request of a local judge who was looking for space to comment on his own notes .
That , at least , is the story AMPAD tells .
Holley never filed a patent for his invention ; no other company in the legal pad market has ever come forward with a competing claim .
Like many origin myths , AMPAD 's answers some essential questions but leaves others unresolved .
It does n't , for instance , explain the emergence of yellow as the standard legal pad color .
Holley is thought to have created white pads , not yellow ones .
Yellow paper is about 10 to 20 percent more expensive than white paper , due to the cost of dye and the additional cleanup the dyeing process necessitates , an extravagance the thrifty Holley would likely have dismissed .
EXPLAINING THE ORIGINS OF THE YELLOW LEGAL PAD is as difficult as explaining consumers ' attraction to it .
But the attraction does seem to be there :
The yellow - to - white sales ratio can be as high as 2 to 1 , as it is at University Stationery in New York City , near New York University and The New School University .
Some believe that writing on a yellow pad is easier to read than writing on a white pad .
But Israel Abramov , a professor of psychology at Brooklyn College and a specialist in color vision , dismisses the theory .
Readability , he says , is more a matter of contrast how the color of the ink interacts with the color of the paper than of the paper color alone .
The highest contrast scenario is black ink on white paper , though Abramov concedes that in specific conditions , yellow paper might be preferable in terms of readability .
" If the light is too intense , the paper can be glaring , and yellow cuts down the glare , " he said .
Abramov prefers a psychological to a physiological explanation for yellow 's predominance .
" White paper that sits around starts to look yellow and old , " he said .
" I heard of one professor who used yellow paper for his lecture notes because he did n't want his students to know how old the notes were . "
Legal pad enthusiasts do seem to have a psychological connection to their writing tablets .
Philip Moustakis , a mid-level associate at the New York firm of Curtis , Mallet - Prevost , Colt & Mosle , uses one legal pad per case , and prefers yellow over white pads and a faint , as opposed to a dark , rule .
" The darker lines intrude upon my thinking they 're yelling back at you , " he explained .
" You want a more subtle line . "
Moustakis is a connoisseur .
Firms that are big enough to order their pads in significant bulk qualify to have their firm name stamped on the pads ' binding .
( At AMPAD , a law firm must order a minimum of 790 pads to qualify for the stamped insignia . )
Moustakis collects the blank pads of competing firms .
( His collection , once larger , is now down to two pristine pads ; he does n't just collect them , he uses them . )
He said he picks them up at conferences with other law firms , and at other events where large stacks are left lying around .
Iris Harris , the assistant director of purchasing at Mayer , Brown , Rowe & Maw , says that her firm no longer leaves stacks of pads lying around on conference tables .
On average , her firm consumes 1,200 legal - size legal pads , 12,000 letter - size legal pads , and 4,200 Junior - size legal pads a year .
Her firm switched from yellow to white pads four years ago .
" Yellow was n't recyclable , " she said .
Today , the standard pad at Mayer , Brown is a white legal pad , with a blue chipboard binding and silver stamp bearing the firm 's name .
And the pads are letter - size , not legal - size .
The legal - size legal pad has been under attack since as early as 1982 , when then Chief Justice Warren Burger banished legal - size documents from federal courts .
One informal survey estimated Burger 's move saved almost $ 16 million through more efficient use of storage space .
Several states followed the federal government 's lead ; in Florida , a group appeared called " Eliminate Legal Files , " or ELF .
The movement reveals perhaps the strangest element of the legal pad 's popularity : Despite their loyalty to the pad , its enthusiasts seem never to be quite satisfied with its constitution and are forever seeking the modification that will perfect it .
One law professor likes his margin on the right ; another prefers a margin 4 to 6 inches from the left side of the page .
Jonathan
Dee is a novelist who has written the first drafts of four novels on legal pads .
He said that he dreams of a 14 - inch pad that has the spiral binding of an 11 - inch variation .
" There 's something about the inventiveness of the first draft that requires I go fast , " Dee said .
" The quiet of this arrangement is very important . "

His note had been scrawled in pencil on a sheet from a yellow legal pad .
Once used only by law students and lawyers , the yellow legal pad is now employed to a degree unrivaled in stationery .
" End career as a fighter , " President Richard Nixon wrote on a legal pad in August 1974 .
Five days later , on the top of another one , he scratched , " Resignation Speech . "
Jeff
Tweedy , front man for the rock band Wilco , writes his songs on a legal pad .
Jim Harrison , the laureate of the untamed heart , wroteon legal pads ; Elmore Leonard writes his crime novels on them .
Nonfiction criminals , it appears , are fond of them , too .
How did they get so popular ?
And how so yellow ?
RECENTLY , MIKE WYSZYNSKI , THE PLANT MANAGER of American Pad & Paper Company 's factory in Holyoke , Mass. , walked between piles of paper stacked over four feet high .
He stopped by several large rolls of yellow paper standing on their ends .
A workhorse of a machine was busy feeding a swath of yellow paper from one of these rolls , mechanically ruling the paper with calibrated pins dipped in blue ink .
The oversize page would ultimately be made into 25 5 - inch - by - 8 - inch tablets , known in the industry as " Junior " legal pads .
AMPAD ( as the company is known ) manufactures legal pads under its own name , but it also makes pads that are later stamped with other brand names , like Staples and Wal - Mart .
AMPAD maintains four factories in different locations , but the Holyoke facility was its first , and it is the site where the first legal pad was ruled , cut , and stitched .
( This historical distinction was apparently not enough to save the plant , however : AMPAD will close the Holyoke facility within the year and open one in Matamoros , Mexico . )
In 1888 , Thomas W. Holley , a 24 - year - old paper mill worker in Holyoke , had an idea for how to use the paper scraps , known as sortings , discarded by the mill .
Sortings were anything trimmed away as scrap or considered of lesser quality than the writing paper eventually packaged and sold .
Holley 's notion was to bind the scraps into pads that could be sold at a cut rate .
Convinced he had a winning idea , he founded his own company to collect the sortings from local mills ( Holyoke was then the papermaking capital of the world ) and began churning out bargain - price pads .
The legal pad 's margins , also called down lines , are drawn 1.25 inches from the left edge of the page .
( This is the only requirement for a pad to qualify as a legal pad , though the iconic version has yellow paper , blue lines , and a red gummed top . )
Holley added the ruling that defined the legal pad in the early 1900s at the request of a local judge who was looking for space to comment on his own notes .
That , at least , is the story AMPAD tells .
Holley never filed a patent for his invention ; no other company in the legal pad market has ever come forward with a competing claim .
Like many origin myths , AMPAD 's answers some essential questions but leaves others unresolved .
It does n't , for instance , explain the emergence of yellow as the standard legal pad color .
Holley is thought to have created white pads , not yellow ones .
Yellow paper is about 10 to 20 percent more expensive than white paper , due to the cost of dye and the additional cleanup the dyeing process necessitates , an extravagance the thrifty Holley would likely have dismissed .
EXPLAINING THE ORIGINS OF THE YELLOW LEGAL PAD is as difficult as explaining consumers ' attraction to it .
But the attraction does seem to be there :
The yellow - to - white sales ratio can be as high as 2 to 1 , as it is at University Stationery in New York City , near New York University and The New School University .
Some believe that writing on a yellow pad is easier to read than writing on a white pad .
But Israel Abramov , a professor of psychology at Brooklyn College and a specialist in color vision , dismisses the theory .
Readability , he says , is more a matter of contrast how the color of the ink interacts with the color of the paper than of the paper color alone .
The highest contrast scenario is black ink on white paper , though Abramov concedes that in specific conditions , yellow paper might be preferable in terms of readability .
" If the light is too intense , the paper can be glaring , and yellow cuts down the glare , " he said .
Abramov prefers a psychological to a physiological explanation for yellow 's predominance .
" White paper that sits around starts to look yellow and old , " he said .
" I heard of one professor who used yellow paper for his lecture notes because he did n't want his students to know how old the notes were .
" Legal pad enthusiasts do seem to have a psychological connection to their writing tablets .
Philip Moustakis , a mid-level associate at the New York firm of Curtis , Mallet - Prevost , Colt & Mosle , uses one legal pad per case , and prefers yellow over white pads and a faint , as opposed to a dark , rule .
" The darker lines intrude upon my thinking they 're yelling back at you , " he explained .
" You want a more subtle line .
" Moustakis is a connoisseur .
Firms that are big enough to order their pads in significant bulk qualify to have their firm name stamped on the pads ' binding .
( At AMPAD , a law firm must order a minimum of 790 pads to qualify for the stamped insignia . )
Moustakis collects the blank pads of competing firms .
( His collection , once larger , is now down to two pristine pads ; he does n't just collect them , he uses them . )
He said he picks them up at conferences with other law firms , and at other events where large stacks are left lying around .
Iris Harris , the assistant director of purchasing at Mayer , Brown , Rowe & Maw , says that her firm no longer leaves stacks of pads lying around on conference tables .
On average , her firm consumes 1,200 legal - size legal pads , 12,000 letter - size legal pads , and 4,200 Junior - size legal pads a year .
Her firm switched from yellow to white pads four years ago .
" Yellow was n't recyclable , " she said .
Today , the standard pad at Mayer , Brown is a white legal pad , with a blue chipboard binding and silver stamp bearing the firm 's name .
And the pads are letter - size , not legal - size .
The legal - size legal pad has been under attack since as early as 1982 , when then Chief Justice Warren Burger banished legal - size documents from federal courts .
One informal survey estimated Burger 's move saved almost $ 16 million through more efficient use of storage space .
Several states followed the federal government 's lead ; in Florida , a group appeared called " Eliminate Legal Files , " or ELF .
The movement reveals perhaps the strangest element of the legal pad 's popularity : Despite their loyalty to the pad , its enthusiasts seem never to be quite satisfied with its constitution and are forever seeking the modification that will perfect it .
One law professor likes his margin on the right ; another prefers a margin 4 to 6 inches from the left side of the page .
Jonathan
Dee is a novelist who has written the first drafts of four novels on legal pads .
He said that he dreams of a 14 - inch pad that has the spiral binding of an 11 - inch variation .
" There 's something about the inventiveness of the first draft that requires I go fast , " Dee said .
" The quiet of this arrangement is very important . "
At UNESCO 's glamorous Cold War spy-thriller headquarters in Paris , Koïchiro Matsuura , the Japanese diplomat running the organization , is pushing to protect and promote the diversity of cultural expressions .
Yep , he 's trying to keep English from muting out every other language , and that 's certainly nothing new .
But unlike others , Matsuura comes off like an airline executive talking about routes , planes , hubs , spokes and flow .
That 's because culture flows .
There are two basic route models in the aviation business .
Airlines either fly point to point or hub and spoke .
Point - to - point flights move from one city to another , while hub - and - spoke transit goes through connections via the airline 's base city .
Now , let 's contemplate that in relation to cultural flows .
With books , films and the internet , which kind of world do we live in , point to point or hub and spoke ?
If culture were an airline model , in other words , would Poles be able to fly to Tokyo without having to transfer at LAX ?
One of the articles to emerge from the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization conference was , " Cultural Diversity ?
A Pipe Dream . "
In it , Rüdiger Wischenbart noted some shocking facts about the current realities behind book translation .
Worldwide , he said , between 50 percent and 60 percent of all translations of books originate from English originals .
It 's sometimes higher : 70 percent of all books translated into Serbian , for instance , have English originals .
In return , only 3 percent to 6 percent of all worldwide book translations are from foreign languages into English .
English speakers , it seems , are talking a lot but listening very little .
If this were the airline industry , we'd be talking about the kind of world where you can't fly from Moscow to Berlin without changing in London .
Non-Anglo cultures are also listening less and less to each other , more and more to us .
" In 2005 , " Wischenbart reported , " a mere 9.4 percent of all translations into German came from French originals ....
Yet , this still brings French comfortably to second place in the overall translation statistics in Germany , as compared to 2.7 percent for Italian ( number 3 ) , or Dutch ( 2.5 percent , number 4 ) or Spanish ( 2.3 percent , number 5 ) .
Sixty - two percent of all translations were of English originals .
All other languages and cultural in - roads seem like peanuts in comparison , and no politically well - intentioned process will ever mend this imbalance ....
Centrifugal forces are working against globalization , resulting in culturally fragmented islands and regions , with few cohesive lines in between . "
The " pipe dream " that Wischenbart describes is UNESCO 's point - to - point vision of global cultural flow from any point to any other .
The world we live in today , though , is still a hub - and - spoke world .
If it 's clear in the book world , it 's even clearer in the film world .
The U.S. studios ' share of the box office in Europe grew from 30 percent in 1950 to more than 80 percent by 1990 , with 70 percent of that dominated by just six companies – Disney , Viacom , Sony , Fox , AOL Time Warner and Universal .
European movies , in contrast , ca n't achieve more than 5 percent of U.S. market share .
American studios remake the most successful European movies for the U.S. market .
An interesting table shows the box - office share of domestic films in various countries around the world .
Only in the United States and India do a significant number of people go to movies made in their own countries .
( Granted , last year Japanese moviegoers pulled off a surprise coup – Japanese films achieved a majority box office share , 53.2 percent , for the first time in two decades . )
What about the internet ?
Well , English is unsurprisingly the dominant language , with 29.5 percent of all users communicating in it .
Chinese is next , with about half the number of English users ( 159 million Chinese to 329 million English users ) .
But Chinese is coming up fast , with more than twice the growth rate of English online .
If it overtakes , does that make English a point - to - point language , or does Chinese just become the new hub , with all the spokes ( at least the Asian ones ) leading toward it ?
Earlier this month , UNESCO 's International Programme for the Development of Communication approved a grant of $ 15,000 for the reinforcement of a community multimedia center serving the marginalized weavers of Madhya Pradesh , India .
You'd have to be a grinch to begrudge this kind of corrective gesture , no matter how small .
But perhaps economic vitality – consider the examples of Bollywood , Japan 's film industry and the booming Chinese internet – is ultimately what will usher in a point - to - point world .
Oh , and machine translation that really works .
Maybe UNESCO could give $ 15,000 – or even more ! – to the marginalized and struggling translation weavers at Google .

With George Tenet 's new book coming out tomorrow , Condoleezza Rice was in full damage - control mode today , appearing on three Sunday talk shows to explain away the former DCI 's claim that Rice did n't take seriously his urgent warnings about the al - Qaeda threat in the months before 9/11 .
When confronted with a clip from tonight 's " 60 Minutes " where Tenet claims he suggested taking offensive action against UBL in Afghanistan before the attacks , Condi seems surprised by the notion that the Bush administration should have done something about terrorism before 9/11 .
Download Download
TENET : We need to consider immediate action inside Afghanistan now .
We need to move to the offensive .
PELLEY ( voice - over ) :
In his book , Tenet says that even though he told Rice an attack on Americans was imminent , she took his request to launch preemptive action in Afghanistan and delegated it to third tier officials .
SCHIEFFER : So , what he is saying is that you just sort of brushed him off . [...]
Well , why would he say something like that ?
RICE : Well , I do n’t know .
I do n’t know what we were supposed to preemptively strike in Afghanistan .
Perhaps somebody can ask that .
Apparently responding to the Cole bombing -- after it was traced back to bin Laden -- was n't on the Bush administration 's radar .
Then again , it seems the Bushies did n't take seriously Tenet 's Aug 6 PDB that warned about imminent al - Qaeda attacks either .
But can you really blame them ?
The PDB only warned of potential attacks in the United States ( possibly NYC ) using hijacked airplanes .
That kind of vague intelligence is hard to work with .
( A plea bargain for the Bushies and transcript below the fold ... )
I 'll tell ya what , Bushies : I 'm willing to put this all behind me if you promise to actually go after bin Laden now .
Instead of quoting his propaganda in an effort to scare us , and allowing our good friend Musharraf to harbor him , why do n't you actually , ya know , capture or kill him like you promised ?
Just a thought ...
Transript via TP :
Bush administration officials acknowledged Friday that they had yet to compile evidence strong enough to back up publicly their claims that Iran is fomenting violence against U.S. troops in Iraq .
Administration officials have long complained that Iran was supplying Shiite Muslim militants with lethal explosives and other materiel used to kill U.S. military personnel .
But despite several pledges to make the evidence public , the administration has twice postponed the release -- most recently , a briefing by military officials scheduled for last Tuesday in Baghdad .
“ The truth is , quite frankly , we thought the briefing overstated , and we sent it back to get it narrowed and focused on the facts , ” national security advisor Stephen J. Hadley said Friday .
The acknowledgment comes amid shifting administration messages on Iran .
After several weeks of saber rattling that included a stiff warning by President Bush and the dispatch of two aircraft carrier strike groups to the Persian Gulf , near Iran , the administration has insisted in recent days that it does not want to escalate tensions or to invade Iran .

Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates seemed to concede Friday that U.S. officials can’t say for sure whether the Iranian government is involved in assisting the attacks on U.S. personnel in Iraq .
“ I do n’t know that we know the answer to that question , ” Gates said .
Earlier this week , U.S. officials acknowledged that they were uncertain about the strength of their evidence and were reluctant to issue potentially questionable data in the wake of the intelligence failures and erroneous assessments that preceded the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq .
In particular , officials worried about a repetition of former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell ’s February 2003 U.N. appearance to present the U.S. case against Iraq .
In that speech , Powell cited evidence that was later discredited .

In rejecting the case compiled against Iran , senior U.S. officials , including Hadley , Gates and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , confirmed Friday that they were concerned about possible inaccuracies .
“ I and Secretary Rice and the national security advisor want to make sure that the briefing that is provided is absolutely accurate and is dominated by facts -- serial numbers , technology and so on , ” Gates told reporters at the Pentagon .
Another reason for the delay , as is often the case when releasing intelligence , was that officials were concerned about inadvertently helping adversaries identify the agents or sources that provided the intelligence , Hadley said .
Hadley also said that the administration sought to delay the release of evidence until after a key intelligence report on Iraq was unveiled , so that Americans could place the evidence in the context of the broader conflict .
Advertisement
That report , called a National Intelligence Estimate , was issued Friday , concluding that Iraq was deteriorating and faces a bleak future that U.S. efforts may do little to avert .
However , the report tends to downplay the role of Iran and Syria , another target of U.S. criticism , in fomenting sectarian violence , while acknowledging that Iranian involvement “ intensifies ” the conflict .
“ The involvement of these outside actors is not likely to be a major driver of violence or the prospects for stability because of the self - sustaining character of Iraq ’s internal sectarian dynamics , ” says the report , compiled by experts from the nation ’s 16 intelligence agencies .
Few doubt that Iran is working to increase its influence inside Iraq , but many of its beneficiaries have been political groups that also are allied with the United States .

So far , the U.S. government has provided scant evidence that the government of Iran is directly supporting militant Shiite groups .
U.S. military leaders in Iraq have said they have evidence that Iran is behind the supply network of explosives .
Military officials have blamed Iran for the increasing casualties caused by the use of “ shaped charge ” explosive devices that can penetrate armored vehicles .
“ What we are trying to do is ... counter what the Iranians are doing to our soldiers , their involvement in activities , particularly these explosively formed projectiles that are killing our troops , and we are trying to get them to stop their nuclear enrichment , ” Gates said .
U.S. officials detained five Iranians in a raid in the northern Iraqi city of Irbil last month , accusing them of planning attacks on Americans .
Advertisement
Gates also acknowledged Friday that there was “ a lot of speculation ” about involvement by Iranians in the abduction and killings of five U.S. servicemen in Karbala last month .
But he refused to say whether an investigation had turned up any evidence that Iranians took part .
“ I would just tell you flatly that the investigation is still going on , and the information that I ’ve seen is ambiguous , ” Gates said .
“ It ’s not clear yet . ”
In a major speech on Iraq last month , Bush accused Iran of “ providing material support for attacks on American troops ” and vowed to “ seek out and destroy ” weapon transport networks .
Since then , Air Force officials have said they are planning new missions that could include flights along the Iran - Iraq border aimed at disrupting weapons shipments .

Iranian officials challenged the Americans to produce evidence of their charges , and Zalmay Khalilzad , the U.S. ambassador to Iraq , pledged last week to do so .
The increasingly harsh words from the Bush administration stoked fears of a possible U.S. attack on Iran .
In recent days , the White House and top U.S. officials have sought to counter the concern .
Gates became the latest administration official to offer such reassurances .
“ The president has made clear , the secretary of State has made clear , I ’ve made clear ... we are not planning for a war with Iran , ” Gates said Friday .

Times staff writer Julian E. Barnes in Washington contributed to this report .
The Hidden Persuaders , a best selling book from the 1950s by journalist Vance Packard , popularized the idea that our beliefs and desires were being consciously manipulated by advertising agencies and the media .
Having become a meme , everyone now agrees that itâ€™s part of modern life and much more so now that it was fifty years ago .
Itâ€™s a depressing idea , though , which no one really likes , except when the techniques have to be used to promote oneâ€™s own ends .
The evolution of the Web , and of social media in particular , is thought to offer an antidote to the hidden persuaders .
If all of us are empowered to develop and publish content , then maybe the crowds , in their wisdom , can filter out the hype and marketing and identify the authentic content .
Well , human ingenuity knows no bound .
Yesterday ’s WSJ has a feature article , The Wizards of Buzz ( no subscription required ) , on social bookmarking sites like Digg and del.icio.us along with a podcast interview with one of the reporters , John Jurgensen .
“ A new generation of hidden influencers is taking root online , fueled by a growing love affair among Web sites with letting users vote on their favorite submissions .
These sites are the next wave in the social - networking craze — popularized by MySpace and Facebook .
Digg is one of the most prominent of these sites , which are variously labeled social bookmarking or social news .
Others include Reddit.com ( recently purchased by CondÃ© Nast ) , Del.icio.us ( bought by Yahoo ) , Newsvine.com and StumbleUpon.com .
Netscape relaunched last June with a similar format . ”
What makes the article interesting is that it is more than just an overview piece ; some real investigation was done .
“ To find the key influencers , The Wall Street Journal analyzed more than 25,000 submissions across six major sites .
With the help of Dapper , a company that designs software to track information published on the Web , this analysis sifted through snapshots of the sites ’ home pages every 30 minutes over three weeks .
The data included which users posted the submissions and the number of votes each received from fellow users .
We then contacted scores of individual users to find which ones are tracked by the wider community . ”
Revelations that social bookmarking and tagging sites are subject to corruption and collusion not new , if course .
See Gaming Digg : the KoolAidGuy saga ( December 2005 ) and Is Digg being subverted by some sort of spamming ?
( April 2006 ) , for examples .
But it ’s always good to have some careful studies .
Here ’s what the WSJ reported :
“ Though it can take hundreds or thousands of votes to make it onto the hot list at these sites , the Journal ’s analysis found that a substantial number of submissions originated with a handful of users .
At Digg , which has 900,000 registered users , 30 people were responsible for submitting one - third of postings on the home page . ”
Of course , what makes the article fun to read is that it profiles twenty of the “ hidden influencers ” it found , including this young man .
“ On Reddit , one of the most influential users is 12 - year - old Adam Fuhrer .
At his desktop computer in his parents ’ home in the quiet northern Toronto suburb of Thornhill , Mr. Fuhrer monitors more than 100 Web sites looking for news on criminal justice , software releases — and the Toronto Maple Leafs , his favorite hockey team .
When Microsoft launched its Vista operating system this year , he submitted stories that discussed its security flaws and price tag , which attracted approving votes from more than 500 users . ”
Reading the capsule descriptions of the twenty influencers profiled , I can see why my own occasional efforts to shamelessly promote our research group on Digg have been complete failures .
Most of the profiled influencers spend several hours every day looking for content to push .
The interview was conducted in Afghanistan nearly three weeks ago
Bin Laden was moved to " a safe place " when the US assault on the Tora Bora mountains began in late 2001 , the Hezb - e - Islami leader told Pakistani TV .
Mr Hekmatyar said Ayman al - Zawahiri , al - Qaeda 's second - in - command , was also taken to the undisclosed location .
The rare interview was broadcast on Thursday by the private Geo TV network .
The authenticity of the interview could not be independently confirmed , but interviewer Saleem Safi told Reuters news agency it was conducted in Afghanistan nearly three weeks ago .
Mr Hekmatyar , who served as Afghan prime minister in the early 1990s and was in exile in Iran in 2001 , was speaking in Pashto .
He said that when US troops surrounded the cave complex at Tora Bora , his followers decided to help the al - Qaeda leaders , as they had helped the mujahideen defeat the Soviet troops .
" We helped them get out of the caves and led them to a safe place , " he said .
Only fragments of the interview were audible under a voiceover translated into Urdu , Pakistan 's main language .
Although US forces have been unable to locate the two al - Qaeda leaders since the 11 September , 2001 attacks , they are believed to have come closest to trapping Bin Laden after he retreated to a complex of caves in the mountainous Tora Bora region near the Pakistani border in 2001 .

I Do Models
From Sam F ...
It was 1992 and I was fresh out of school trying to get a job .
My Political Science degree was n't doing anything for me , so I decided to try out a new field : information technology .
I eventually landed an interview that went surprisingly well until we got to the technical part ...
Interviewer : So , would you consider yourself to be technically proficient ?
Sam :
Well , I enjoyed putting models together when I was little .
Needless to say , I never got the job .
Almost fifteen years later , though , I 'd be able to answer it differently :
For the past dozen or so years I 've been in various stages of technical positions from network management to database administration to project management to application development .
I still like to put models together , too !
Interview By Proxy
From Stephan ...
After digging through a pile of resumes for a junior developer position , I settled on a few for an in - person interview .
When the day came around for one particular candidate 's interview , the receptionist told me that there were two people in the waiting room wanting to see me .
By all accounts , a husband and wife .
That was a bit confusing , but I called them into a meeting room and had the following conversation ...
Stephan :
So what is it that I can do for you ?
Man :
Yes , we have come for the interview .
Stephan : Interview ?
For the programming position ?
Man :
Yes , we come to do interview for our son Rajib .
Stephan : Excuse me ?
You 're here on his behalf ?
Man :
Yes , we do interview .
He 's very good boy and he do good job to you .
Woman : Yes , very good boy .
Stephan : Ummm ... err ... I normally talk to candidates directly ...
Man :
Yes , we here for him .
You interview with us .
I was n't really sure what to do , so I did the interview .
I asked all the technical questions I had and I 'm happy to report that not only were they answered very well , but Rajib was apparently more than willing to work long hours , be a team player , and contribute a lot .
After all , his father told me so .
But unfortunately for Rajib , an * actual * candidate turned up and secured the position .
The PROBOL Expert
From Jeff L ...
To help with client customization , my company developed a proprietary language called PROBOL .
A major downside to this is that it 's almost impossible to find programmers that are willing to spend most of their day developing in it .
Because of that , I always made it a point to bring it up early on in the interview so that we did n't waste eachother 's time .
One enthusiastic candidate waited for me to finish my disclaimer on the language , then immediately said , " Wow , that should be fun .
I just finished a book on PROBOL last week ! "
Never mind that he might not have been lying outright , but might instead have been confusing the language with either COBOL or PROLOG .
Back then , the hiring pool was pretty big .
" NEXT ! "
The Quintessential Übergeek
From Rob ...
After four grueling interviews ( HR , the CFO , the Development VP , and the Product Manager ) , I was told that I would wrap up the day with Leonard , the company 's resident " technical guru . "
The HR manager warned me that " Leonard " can be a little difficult at times , " but assured me that I 'd do " just fine . "
Not knowing exactly what to expect , I was ushered in to a conference room and left to await Leonard .
A short while later , in walked the quintessential übergeek : hair sprouted wildly from everywhere ( head , face , arms ) , overweight , filthy khakis , a shirt that was probably bright white when Jimmy Carter was president , and the obligatory sandals .
I felt relieved : finally , someone I could relate to .
Leonard spent the first thirty minutes talking -- without a break -- about all of the incredibly detailed nuances of database query optimization .
I could have easily walked out , grabbed a bite to eat , and returned without him ever knowing : he was practically oblivious to me .
After he finished a diatribe on poorly designed hash - bucket join algorithms , he finally said : " oh yeah , I 'm supposed to evaluate you technically . "
He spent the next five minutes asking one of the most ridiculous questions I 've ever heard .
It was something about replication parameters for a slave database server .
Fortunately , he was so excited with his brainteaser that he immediately launched into a ten - minute answer .
After that , he stood up , thanked me for coming , and walked out the door .
Throughout the entire interview , I said a total of maybe six words .
I waited for a couple of minutes and nothing happened .
I finally left the conference room and strolled down the hall , eventually finding my way back at the reception area .
Freaked out by all of this , I just bolted , never to hear back from them again .
I was happy with that .
coming from presidential critics right now , is the mixture of signals from the activist media regarding the Military Commissions Act signed by Bush last Tuesday .
Friday night , on Bill Maher 's Real Time , Maher indicated that , as the result of the so - called " Detainee " bill ( aka the Military Commissions Act ) passed by Congress on September 28th , we could all get tossed into prison indefinitely without recourse according to the whim of the President .
Maher panelist Representative Barney Frank seemingly seconded Maher 's opinion .
A September 30th New York Times article quoted Bruce Ackerman , a professor of law and political science at Yale , as saying that the bill " allows the administration to declare even a U.S. citizen an unlawful combatant subject to indefinite detention .
" An All Things Considered piece on NPR broadcast on September 29th by Ari Shapiro , titled , " Bill Lets U.S. Citizens Be Held as Enemy Combatants , " attempts to parse the distinctions between the treatment of non-citizens and citizens who are declared " enemy combatants . "
Bradford Berenson , a former White House lawyer for the current President Bush , is quoted as saying , " U.S. citizens can be detained as enemy combatants if they take up arms on the side of al - Qaida .
But they get some extra judicial protections in that case . "
Shapiro comments ,
" The legislation that Congress passed does not say enemy combatants are people who ' take up arms on the side of al - Qaida . '
The bill instead refers to people who provide ' material support ' to the enemy .
The language of the bill says that is the standard for both citizens and non-citizens .
"
In a September 29th discussion on Amy Goodman 's popular lefty broadcast show , Democracy Now , Michael Ratner , President of the Center for Constitutional Rights , said , " what it gives him [ the President ] is the power ... to detain any person anywhere in the world , citizen or non-citizen , whether living in the United States or anywhere else .
I mean , what kind of authority is that ?
No checks and balances .
Nothing . "
But Ratner does acknowledge , " Now , if you 're a citizen , you still get your right of habeas corpus .
" Over on the right , on Instapundit , Glenn Reynolds reassured that , " I 've seen some people calling this an abolition of habeas corpus , but as I understand it , habeas is suspended only with regard to non-citizens .
This removes a key danger of abuse , since the potential politically - motivated abuses that are most worrisome involve U.S. citizens , not aliens .
" Reynolds also pointed to a piece by Jack Balkin on Balkinization , that analyzes what aspects of the bill apply to US citizens .
Balkin , according to Reynolds , shows that , " the habeas - stripping procedures only apply to aliens , but other provisions regarding unlawful combatants may apply to U.S. citizens .
" Drifting further from the mainstream , on October 4th on the Information Clearing House site , Chris Floyd wrote , " It was a dark hour indeed last Thursday when the United States Senate voted to end the constitutional republic and transform the country into a Leader - State , giving the president and his agents the power to capture , torture and imprison forever anyone — American citizens included — whom they arbitrarily decide is an 'enemy combatant . '" Given the confusion regarding the direct legal impact of this bill on US citizens , I contacted Caroline Fredrickson , the Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office , to get her take on the bill .
Although Fredrickson dispels some of the more alarmist views regarding this legislation , I would hesitate to say that I found Ms. Fredrickson 's responses reassuring .
Even before the Bush administration began gnawing on the carcass of our constitutional liberties , the ACLU said this about a 1996 anti-terrorism bill passed by President Clinton .
" With the stroke of a pen , President Clinton today crippled the century old authority of the federal courts to enforce the Bill of Rights , " the ACLU said in a statement .
At that point , banks were authorized to freeze assets of American citizens and organizations suspected of being agents of a declared terrorist group .
Citizens , even then , apparently had no recourse to challenge that designation .
Since then , of course , from the 2001 Patriot Act to this so - called " Torture Bill , " the hits have just kept coming .
The new wrinkle seems to be legalizing anything the Administration does after the fact .
I do n't know about you , but I demand a sweet deal like that for myself .
There is some hope that the next president may not want all that power .
Of the potential presidential candidates currently in the US Senate , Democrats Bayh , Biden , Clinton , Feingold , Kerry , and Obama all voted against the bill .
Republican John McCain voted in favor of it .
Power , however , tends to do strange things to people ( particularly people named Clinton ) , so I would n't place much faith in a change of administrations .
RU SIRIUS : While most of the news coverage of the recent " Detainee " bill focused on its impact on torture and on the detention of non-citizens , very little has been said about those things that apply to US citizens .
As I read it US citizens can be held indefinitely without any recourse .
RU : The definition of " unlawful enemy combatant " is applied to those who have " purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States . "
By my reading , this could be used against dissidents and whistleblowers .
For instance , it could have been used against the New York Times for their revelations about the administration 's global financial surveillance program .
( See NY Times apology )
Would you agree ?
RU : According to one report I 've seen , " the bill criminalizes any challenge to the legislation 's legality by the Supreme Court or any United States court . "
Is this true and can they get away with this ?
RU : Most citizens may assume that the government only uses the Homeland Security apparatus and the various anti-terrorist laws against terrorism suspects .
Can you counter this assumption , and can you name one or two particularly egregious cases ?
RU : Have we lost habeas corpus at other times in U.S. history ?
RU : In 1996 , the ACLU said Clinton 's anti-terrorism bill " crippled the Bill of Rights . "
How much worse has it gotten under Bush ?
RU : What can you , or we , do about it ?
The capuchins appear to use noise to ward off potential predators
A scientist has observed capuchin monkeys banging stones together , apparently as a signalling device to ward off potential predators .
The researcher says the animals appear to be learning this skill from each other - and even teaching incomers to the group how it should be done .
The research is reported in the scientific journal Folia Primatologica .
Dr Antonio Moura from the University of Cambridge , UK carried out his work in the Serra da Capivara National Park , in the Piaui state of north - east Brazil .
Hard alerts
The use of stone technology in foraging for food is well known in non-human primates ; monkeys will use rocks to crack open nuts .
Stone - banging could be a social tradition in the population studied
Antonio Moura
Dr Moura describes how the monkeys , as he approached several groups of them , would first search for a suitable loose stone , then hit it on a rock surface several times in an aggressive manner .
Only as they became more used to his visits over time did the stone - banging decrease .
Noisy lessons
The scientist said he saw adults and juveniles hitting the stones together without paying him any attention at all - suggesting that the younger monkeys were learning the skill from their elders .
What is more , captive monkeys released into the area to join the study animals appeared to learn to bang stones as well .
" Although banging objects is an innate behaviour in capuchin monkeys ( Cebus apella libidinosus ) , in all wild groups observed so far it has been observed only in a foraging context , " Dr Moura said .
" Stone - banging is a novel behavioural variant that is most likely learned socially .
The absence of this display in other populations of capuchins , which have access to stones , suggests that stone - banging could be a social tradition in the population studied . "
What ?
Joseph Goebbels was n't available ?
A rather large brouhaha is brewing over the Nevada Democratic party 's decision to have the conservative TV network , FOX News , host the first Democratic presidential primary debate this coming August .
A lot of folks are a bit concerned as to why any Democratic would choose the official propaganda organ of the Republican party to host their debate .
I believe the Nevada party is arguing , interestingly , that this is a chance for FOX 's audience to get to see the Democratic candidates unvarnished and unedited - i.e. , FOX wo n't be able to negatively spin their appearances the way FOX usually does .
But someone in the blogosphere today , I can't remember who , responded :
And just who in FOX 's audience will be voting for the Democratic candidate ?
Now , I think that overestimates FOX 's hold on its audience .
Like the religious right , FOX has a lot of followers , but not all of FOX 's followers are far - right GOP nutjobs .
A lot of them are , but many , I suspect , are simply Republicans who like to watch Republican TV the same way we like to read liberal blogs .
That does n't mean that some of those Republicans are n't centrists who might be Perot voters , soccer moms ( and grandmoms ) and more .
Still , FOX ?
We could n't come up with any better network - uh - like all of them ?
And in any case , I 'm not sure we want to be sending any viewers to FOX .
Their influence , like the influence of their GOP enablers , is , I think , waning .
And , as Bowers notes :
Further , how much of the debate will Fox cut off entirely in order to have their in - house pundits offer negative commentary while the Democratic candidates are still speaking ?
Four years ago , in typically unfiltered fashion , Fox cut away from the Democratic debate they hosted a couple of minutes before it ended , in order to give arch - conservative William Bennett the first shot at post - debate spin .
That is not an insignificant point .
The entire audience will be stuck , momentarily , watching FOX 's hacks spin the debate against every candidate .
I think we can do better .
Anyway , this is gearing up into quite a battle , with blogpac launching a petition drive , and MoveOn getting involved as well .
Markos has much more on this , including links to a number of other sites ' analyzing the issue .

My roundup of the funniest extensions
Yesterday I decided to undertake an experiment .
My favourite browser , Firefox , allows its users to add extensions .
Currently 1102 extensions are available at Mozilla update .
I decided to install 100 of the most popular extensions at the same time , trying to avoid those that duplicated others functionality .
Cruelly , the hundredth was the XPI delay remover .
This scrollable screenshot below shows the result .
( View in own page )
It was really extraordinarily stable .
The work of hundreds of programmers who had no idea their code would be used together , coexisting happily in the browser .
Here is what I got when I right - clicked :
Overall I was very impressed .
The browser was a little slow on my machine ( which does n’t have impressive specs ) but there were no crashes except when installing the extensions .
The main problem I had was that the statusbar became so wide that on some websites I had to expand the browser window onto my second monitor !
I discovered a number of extensions that I would not otherwise have known about and strongly recommend a trawl through at least the first hundred .
_________________________
Update : ( 28 Feb ) Statistics
It takes around seven seconds to start up .
It freezes for at least one second between pages ( I guess a lot is hanging on the onLoad . )
It has not yet crashed , half hour or so I ’ve browsed with it , since all the extensions have been installed ( for some reason it did crash immediately after installing them , before restarting . )

My roundup of the funniest extensions
When a video clip goes " viral , " spreading across the Web at lightning speed , it can help rocket its creators to stardom .
Alas , the clip can also generate work for corporate lawyers .
As anyone with an Internet connection and a love of cupcakes can tell you , " Lazy Sunday " is a tongue - in - cheek rap video starring Chris Parnell and Andy Samberg of " Saturday Night Live . "
NBC first broadcast the video , a two - and - a - half - minute paean to New York 's Magnolia Bakery , Google Maps and C. S. Lewis , on Dec. 17 .
Fans immediately began putting copies of the video online .
On one free video - sharing site , YouTube ( www.youtube.com), it was watched five million times in a few days .
NBC soon made the video available as a free download from the Apple iTunes Music Store .
Julie Supan , senior director of marketing for YouTube , said she contacted NBC Universal about working out a deal to feature NBC clips , including " Lazy Sunday , " on the site .
NBC Universal responded early this month with a notice asking YouTube to remove about 500 clips of NBC material from its site or face legal action under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
YouTube complied last week .
" Lazy Sunday " is still available for free viewing on NBC's Web site , and costs $ 1.99 on iTunes .
'( Lisp Notes ( OS X Intel ) )
This document attempts to get you up and running with a Free Lisp environment quickly and with little fuss .
Following the instructions here will get you the Lisp environment I currenly have setup at this writing .
If you have n't already seen it , you should also have a look at my Lisp Development page to see what you can expect .
I have n't touched the page in a while , but it is still relevant .
At this time I am running OS X 10.4.9 on a 17 " MacBook Pro .
If you are running a PowerPC Mac , then you should look at my no longer maintained PowerPC page which describes the Lisp environment I had setup on my PowerBook G4 .
The Apple Developer Tools
The OS X 10.4 ( Tiger ) install CDs include Xcode , the Apple developer tools I am talking about in this section .
I am currently using Xcode 2.4.1 which can be downloaded from the Apple Developer Web Site : http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/
The Apple Developer Tools are required if you wish to compile Emacs for yourself .
Apple does not install the Developer Tools by default , so you should install them from the media that came with your Mac .
Even if you do n't plan to compile Emacs or any of the Lisp compilers for yourself , I highly recommend that you install the software anyway .
You will need it for SLIME which is best retreived via CVS anyway .
Also the developer tools include documentation on OS X .
MacPorts
A bunch of Unix software has been ported to OS X 10.4 Tiger .
My favorite source for such software is MacPorts .
I installed the aspell spell checker for Emacs from there as well as CLisp , a Common Lisp implementation .
I did not setup CLisp with Emacs + SLIME .
I am including CLisp on my system simply for completeness .
It runs from the command line and using MacPorts is a very simple way to install it .
However , using MacPorts goes beyond the current scope of this page , so I will say no more about it .
GNU Emacs
In order to do Lisp development , you need a good editor .
For Lisp , there is no better editor than Emacs .
You will also want an IDE ( Integrated Development Environment ) .
That is provided with the SLIME package that I will discuss below .
There are at least three ways to get a suitable Emacs installed .
I can only vouch for the first method because that is what I used .
Compile Emacs yourself from CVS .
This is really easy to do .
Download the Apple Carbon Emacs package .
This is even easier to do .
Download Aquamacs .
Aquamacs is customized to fit in better with the OS X look and feel .
This too is easy .
I am using a very recent CVS version of Emacs from GNU .
It is built to use Apple 's Carbon API and can be launched from the dock .
The CVS version of Emacs is under constant development which means you could check out a broken version .
I 've not had too many problems with it though .
I keep a ~/usr / src / Emacs21_For_Mac_OS_X directory for Emacs .
In that directory I have a build - emacs file and an install - emacs file .
Checking out Emacs is as simple enough :
$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sv.gnu.org :/sources/emacs login $ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sv.gnu.org :/sources/emacs co emacs
Just hit enter at the password prompt .
If you have problems , try ' unset CVS_RSH ' .
My build - emacs script is simple enough :
cd emacs make clean ./ configure --with-carbon -- without-x -- prefix= /usr / local make bootstrap cd ..
install - emacs .
You will want to run this as " sudo sh install - emacs " .
To do this you will naturally have to enable root user in System Preferences and run visudo as root to add your account name .
cd emacs make install echo echo echo " Copying Emacs.app to / Applications " echo echo cd / Applications rm -rf Emacs.app ( cd / Users / david/usr/src/Emacs21_For_Mac_OS_X/emacs/mac ; tar cf - Emacs.app ) | tar xvf - chown root : admin Emacs.app echo echo " done "
I run the scripts in the usual fashion :
$ sh build - emacs $ sudo sh install - emacs
I have dragged Emacs over to the dock and launch it from there .
SLIME
SLIME stands for Superior Lisp Interaction Mode ( Extended ) .
It is an Emacs Lisp package that improves on the Emacs Lisp mode .
CLiki , a valuable Lisp resource , talks about SLIME here .
To get SLIME from CVS :
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@common-lisp.net :/ project/slime/cvsroot co slime
SLIME is under constant development .
It used to be that running the CVS HEAD version was for the more adventurous hacker .
Now that is not so much the case .
In fact , for SBCL use , you want to have both SBCL and SLIME from the same time period because SBCL developers still make changes to the protocol that SLIME uses to talk to SBCL .
I 've also seen updates to the OpenMCL backend in CVS .
If SLIME is giving you trouble , the first thing to do is make sure you have the latest CVS version .
My ~/.emacs file contains the necessary settings for SLIME to work with both OpenMCL and SBCL .
I 've also got some other customizations to make Lisp editing easier .
I 'm bound to make changes over time .
This is the version of my .emacs as of 2007 - 05 - 11 .

I can't promise any of the above will work for you .
But it does work for me .
You will also have to make the appropriate path adjustments if you do things differently .
Rather than just trying to copy and paste the file , just grab a copy from here .
The CVS Emacs distribution does not include color - theme.el .
I got that from :
http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki?ColorTheme
Some Emacs bundlers include it with their bundle .
BTW , the Emacs Wiki page is probably worth bookmarking .
Paredit is available from here .
The Common Lisp HyperSpec
The HyperSpec is a valuable reference to the ANSI Common Lisp language .
SLIME ( and ILISP if you choose to go that way ) are able to reference the HyperSpec from inside Emacs for you .
You just need to download the HyperSpec and tell Emacs where to find it .
You can obtain the HyperSpec here : ftp://ftp.lispworks.com/pub/software_tools/reference/HyperSpec-7-0.tar.gz
Now You Need Lisp
SBCL
SBCL is probably the most popular free Lisp in current use .
If you decide you need help with it and you know how to use IRC , you can easily get help from the #lisp channel on irc.freenode .
net .
There are actual SBCL maintainers there .
Just be sure to use Google and the documentation to exhaust all avenues of finding out how to do something first .
FAQs are going to show up somewhere with answers and you do n't need to make noise on #lisp for most things .
However , if it is evident that you have tried , the people on #lisp can be most helpful .
The quick way to get SBCL installed on your Mac is to go here and follow the instructions .
This will get you up and running with SBCL in minutes ( depending on your Internet connection speed ) .
If you have no interest in building SBCL yourself , then skip all the way down to OpenMCL and make sure you have the paths in your .emacs set correctly for where you installed SBCL ( default is /usr / local ) .
Building SBCL with SBCL is very easy to do .
I use this method to keep up with the monthly patch releases .
I got SBCL from CVS initially with the following CVS commands run from ~/usr / src :
$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@sbcl.cvs.sourceforge.net :/cvsroot/sbcl login $ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@sbcl.cvs.sourceforge.net :/cvsroot/sbcl co sbcl
Just hit enter when prompted for the password .
Once you have SBCL , you can update it from CVS with ' cvs up - dAP ' in the sbcl directory .
There are a couple things you need to do for SBCL to work .
The instructions are in the INSTALL file .
You have to set an environment variable called SBCL_HOME to point to where the sbcl .
core file gets installed .
You also need to increase the stack size available with ulimit .
I have the following lines in my ~/. profile to make SBCL work :
# the following is needed for SBCL ulimit -s 8192 export SBCL_HOME=/ Users/ david/usr/lib/sbcl/
I 've also written my own very simple install script called my - install.sh :
#!/bin/bash unset SBCL_HOME export INSTALL_ROOT=/Users/david/usr ; sh install.sh ; export SBCL_HOME=/Users/david/usr/lib/sbcl/ unset INSTALL_ROOT
Do n't forget to make my - install.sh executable with the ' chmod +x my- install.sh ' command .
Building SBCL is then just a matter of performing the following steps :
$ cd ~/usr/src/sbcl $ ./make.sh $ ./my-install.sh
OpenMCL
OpenMCL is a great way to go if you have the Intel Core 2 Duo or other 64 bit processor on your Mac .
Although still experimental , version 1.1 - pre-yyyymmdd snapshots are working 64 bit Lisps for your Mac .
No 32 bit version of OpenMCL is available for the Intel .
To get OpenMCL , go here and follow the directions .
My .emacs file assumes that the openmcl 64 script is in ~ /usr / bin and that the ccl directory has been properly set up .
You can find that in this section of the script :
if [ - z " $ CCL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY " ] ; then CCL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY=~/usr/src/OpenMCL/ccl
fi
That Should Do It !
いまどきのデスクトップ処理系
いまどきのデスクトップは色々モダンになっている.
ただモダン化は API の裏側で進んでいるため , あまり興味を持たれていないらしい .
一見いろいろウォッチしていそうな知り合いと話していてわかった.
利用者視点の話題では , いまどきのデスクトップというとたとえばウィンドウが
ヘナヘナ揺れるといったアイ・キャンディばかりが連想される.
でもそのアイ・キャンディに至るにはきっと山ほど苦労があったはず.
そのへんをちょっとねぎらってみたい.
念頭にあるのは Windows Vista , Mac OSX , XGL あたり .
まず共通の階層化されたアーキテクチャを想定し , ケーススタディを交えつつその層を下から上へ順にたどっていきます.
復習 : デスクトップ処理系の階層構 造
そもそもデスクトップの中味はどんな構成をとっているのか.
ざっと眺めておこう .
典型的なデスクトップ処理系のアーキテクチャはだいたいこんなかんじになる : ( 名前や構成にはバリエーションがある . 自分の使ってるのは違う! という人は大目に見てください. )
階層構造になっていると主張しているつもりです.
一番下のレイヤは Graphics Device Driver .... なのはまあ割と当たり前だよね .
何かしらハードウェアを抽象化する手段がないと困ってしまう.
WDDM は Windows のドライバモデル .
ビデオカードの薄い抽象という意味で DirectX や OpenGL もここに置いた .
次に低位な層は Window Management .
アプリケーションからの描画要求を整理し , ウィンドウの上下関係管理やクリッピングを行う.
ウィンドウのサイズや位置の変更もこのへんだと思っていい.
描画だけでなく , キーボードやマウスといった対話装置のイベント配信もする.
X だと X server , Mac OS だと Quartz Extreme ( Quartz Compositor ) が この層にあたる .
Window Management の上に Drawing のレイヤがある .
この層はウィンドウへの描画機能を提供する.
直線 , 曲線 , 円 , ビットマップの貼りつけなど .
性能の都合でドライバを直接利用することもあるため.
ちょっと下にはみ出す図にした .
Win32 の GDI , Mac OS の Quartz , freedesktop の cairo あたりがこれにあたる .
一番上の層が Toolkit .
GUI のウィジェットを用意する .
Drawing の描画機能を使ってボタンやリストやテキストボックスなど描いたり , システムからの各種イベントに反応したりする .
gtk+ , Qt , Cocoa あたり .
素朴な時代はレイヤ間の癒着が強かった .
Toolkit の一部とし て Drawing 機能が提供されていたり , Window Management の拡張として Toolkit が作られていたりした .
こうした役割分担や階層化はモダンになるに従って進んだ.
復習を済ませたところで , モダン化のトレンドを下の層から見ていこう .
グラフィクス資源の仮想化
画面に絵を描こうと思ったとき , 計算機は最終的にフレームバッファを操作する.
フレームバッファはピクセルをあらわす一続きのメモリ領域で , そのメモリの内容が定期的にディスプレイへ反映される.
個々のアプリケーションは , このフレームバッファを更新することでウィンドウの中味を描く.
ただアプリケーションは同時に複数動き , そのウィンドウも重なりあっている. あるアプリケーションがうっかり他のウィンドウの中味を上書きしないよう
ウィンドウのクリッピングを行うのは Window Management の役割だ .
( Drawing は Window Management 層に描画可能な範囲を問合せ , その範囲だけを描画するわけ . )
ウィンドウのサイズが変わったり上にあったウィンドウがどかされたりすると , サイズの変わったウィンドウや下にあったウィンドウをフレームバッファに描き直す必要がある.
Window Management 層は , その書き直し要求をイベントとしてアプリケーションに伝える .
アプリケーションはイベントに応じて自分のウィンドウを描き直す.
描き直し処理などを行う関数をイベントハンドラという. win32 の WindowProc が代表例 .
ふつうイベントハンドラは書き直しだけでなく入力装置からのイベントにも処理する.
またアプリケーションのメインループが
API で直接イベントをとりだすシステムもある .
古典的な Window Management はこんな風に行われている .
思いきって単純化すると , 古典的なシステムにおけるウィンドウとは
クリッピング領域とイベントハンドラの対だと言える.
見え隠れするたびにウィンドウを描き直すのは苦労が多い.
性能上の問題もある .
内容を書き終える前に画面が更新されてしまうと , 描画途中の半端な状態がユーザに見えてしまう.
要するにチラつく .
このチラつきをふせぐため , アプリケーション・プログラマはふつう主記憶上に自分のウィンドウの中味と同じ内容の 画像を確保する . そしてこれに描画を行う. この画像をよくオフスクリーンと呼ぶ.
そういうアプリケーションでは , 再描画の要求が来てもイチから文字や画像を書き直すかわりに
オフスクリーン画像の中味を画面にコピーする.
画像のコピーだけなら一連の描画処理よりずっと速い.
だからオフスクリーンを使うと画面のチラつきをふせぐことができる.
プログラムも楽になる .
ただ , この方法は性能面に限界がある .
主記憶上のオフスクリーンはすべて CPU を使って描画する必要がある .
グラフィクス・カード ( GPU ) の高速描画機能は利用できない .
いまどきのオシャレ GUI をつくるには , グラデーションや半透明 , アニメーションといった 負荷の大きな描画も遠慮なく使いたい .
しかし派手になるほど描画は遅くなる.
無駄に遅いなどと馬鹿にされるのは悔しい.
( twm + vi の人とかに. ) また , 主記憶上にあるオフスクリーンをビデオメモリ( VRAM ) のフレームバッファに 転送するのはそれなりに時間がかかる .
これも性能の足をひきずる .
そこで , モダンな Window Managemt 層は アプリケーションのオフスクリーンを VRAM 上に置くことにした .
今やオフスクリーンはテクスチャと同じ扱いになる.
DirectX や OpenGL でじゃんじゃか絵を描けばいい . 同じ VRAM 同士だからフレームバッファへのコピーも速い. 一件落着 .
ただし , 単純に VRAM に置くだけでは問題が残る .
VRAM が足りなくなったらどうしよう .
すべてのアプリケーションがウィンドウを置くには , とても広い VRAM が必要だ .
運が悪いと VRAM が足りなくなる .
ウィンドウサイズを変えた瞬間におこる VRAM 不足を想像してみよう .
事態はなかなか複雑なのがわかってくる.
この問題を解決するため , モダンな環境では VRAM が " 仮想化 " された .
要するに仮想記憶の VRAM 版ができた .
メモリ不足になると , 処理系は優先度の低いオフスクリーンを 主記憶に " ページアウト " する. 必要に応じて " ページイン " もおこる .
( 主記憶が足りなくなったら更にディスクへ追い出される. 気の毒に... )
Windows Vista や最近の Mac OS はグラフィクスドライバにこの仕組みを要求している .
今までのアプリケーションがオーバーレイみたいな仕組みでがんばっていた部分を
処理系が肩代りしてくれるようになったというわけ.
この方法が現実的になったのは VRAM の容量が十分大きくなったからだろう. たとえば 4MB の VRAM を仮想化してもきっとスラッシングがひどくて使いものにならない.
主記憶版の仮想記憶と同じ .
今時のハイエンドなカードには , 下手すると主記憶と同じくらいの VRAM が載っている .
3D をやらないと使い道がないよなーと思っていたけれど , あれば使うもんだね .
ところで , 仮想化されたのはオフスクリーン/テクスチャ
( OpenGL では " フレームバッファオブジェクト " と呼ぶ ) だけではない .
VRAM 上の資源はくまなく仮想化の対象になるらしい. また Microsoft の文書によると Vista ではグラフィクスコマンドの実行をタイムスライスする機構もあるという.
再入可能なマルチタスクってやつね.
言ってみれば VRAM と GPU の世界にも OS が進出してきたということかもしれない .
余談 : 素朴な時代の仮想グラフィク ス
ひろく仮想化というと , 実際のハードウェアの上に仮想的な環境を( いくつも) 作る技術を指す.
ユーザは仮想環境を独占して使える.
Java の仮想マシンや Xen のような仮想化技術はその典型 .
DirectX や OpenGL はある種の仮想化グラフィクスハードウェアと考えることができる .
グラフィクスのハードウェアはひとつしかないのに , 複数のグラフィクス・アプリケーションが同時にそれを使うことができる.
今ではあたりまえの話だけれど , 初期のグラフィクス・ハードウェアでは 3D グラフィクスを使う際に単一のアプリケーションがハードウェアを独占していた.
フルスクリーンでしか 3D 機能を利用できないビデオカードがあったのを 覚えている人もいるとおもう. あんなかんじ .
そのころ , 高価なグラフィクス・ハードウェアでは 複数の 3D アプリケーションが同時に動きはじめていたらしい .
Mark J. Kilgard ( GLUT の人ですね ) らによる 96 年の記事 " System Support for OpenGL Direct Rendering " にその様子が示されている .
これを読むと , 単一のグラフィクス・パイプラインを複数のアプリケーションで共用するのが大変な仕事だとわかる.
コマンド列の排他制御や直列化 , 複数ウィンドウのクリッピング...
OS でいう再入可能化やメモリ保護相当の仕組みを , グラフィクスのドライバは各自がんばって実装してきたけだ .
OS の支援があ る( だろう ) とはいえ , なかなか難儀な話だとおもう .
モダンなデスクトップ処理系の登場でグラフィクス資源はほぼ完全に仮想化された.
先の記事では今に至る進化の発端を垣間みることができる.
余談おわり .
トップレベル・ウィンドウの合成
ここまでの説明には色々端折ってきたことがある.
たとえば , ウィンドウとオフスクリーンの関係について.
この節ではそのへんを少し詳しく補足する.
伝統的なウィンドウ・システムの多くは Toolkit と Window Management が密着している .
実は大半のウィジェットそれぞれがウィンドウなのだ.
ボタン , テキストボックス , リスト , ツールバー ...
こうしたウィジェットひとつひとつが独立したウィンドウを持っている.
前の節で , ウィンドウは VRAM 上にオフスクリーンを持つと説明した .
ウィジェットがすべてウィンドウなら , その細かなウィンドウすべてがオフスクリーンを持つのだろうか.
そうではない .
実際にはトップレベルのウィンドウだけが
VRAM のオフスクリーンを確保する .
トップレベルのウィンドウというのは背後に他のアプリか背景しかないようなウィンドウのこと.
他のウィンドウ(子ウィンドウ)やウィジェットがどう実現されているかは処理系により異なるけれど , とりあえずこれまでのシステムと同じと思っておけばいい.
モダンな Window Management は二種類のウィンドウを管理する .
オフスクリーンを持つトップレベル・ウィンドウと , トップレベル・ウィンドウに所属する子ウィンドウ.
子ウィンドウの描画先はトップレベル・ウィンドウのオフスクリーンになる.
このように , 典型的な処理系はトップレベル・ウィンドウだけが実体を持つ.
トップレベル・ウィンドウだけに VRAM を割り当てるのは現実的な妥協だろう.
すべてのウィンドウに VRAM を割り振ってしまうのはさすがに容量が厳しそうだけれど , この方法ならそこまで VRAM を使うことなしにチラつきはおおかた回避できる.
トップレベル・ウィンドウのオフスクリーンをフレームバッファ上に合成する処理を , 一般にウィンドウの合 成( Composition ) という. オフスクリーンが VRAM にあるおかげでこの合成処理には派手な効果を演出できる.
オフスクリーンをテクスチャとして扱い , テクスチャつきのメッシュ( ポリゴン ) をウィンドウとして描画する.
派手な効果はその際に利用する 3DAPI の恩恵だと言える .
OSX での Expose , Vista の Flip3d などはその典型 .
GLX のウィンドウ・マネージャである Compiz はもっと隅々まで細かな効果を適用している .
( 暇なひとは Youtube で動画を探してみてください . )
いまどきの描画機 能
階層をひとつ上にすすもう .
ウィンドウの内容を実際に描くのは Drawing の仕事だ .
今時の Drawing については以前書いたものがあるから , 詳しい話は省略 . ( " ハードウェア化を目指すデスクトップ・グラフィクス " を参照ください . )
かわりに要点だけまとめておく .
デスクトップの描画はグラデーションやアルファブレンディングなどの高機能な描画操作を 必要とするようになった. これらの描画操作は負荷が高い.
そこで一部のモダンな処理系は描画を高速化するために 3D グラフィクスのハードウェア支援を使うようになった.
そうした処理系は 2D のデスクトップを描くのに 3D 用 API を用いる . まとめおわり .
ケーススタディ : XGL と cairo / glitz
ここらへんで具体例を眺めてみたい .
最近のオープンソースな人達の間では
XGL が流行っているようなので , こいつの資料を読んでみよう .
( 実際に試そうとしたら , 私の VAIO Note Z では動かなかった .
そもそも素の X すらよくフリーズする .
Web によるとハズレのモデルみたい . 悲しい...)
XGL は描画部分に OpenGL を使った X Server の実装だ .
トップレベル・ウィンドウに VRAM のオフスクリーン ( Framebuffer Object , FBO ) を割り当てる .
各種図形描画は OpenGL の API を通じて行われる .
似たような実装に AIGLX というのもある .
XGL は Window Manager の compiz と一緒に使われることが多い .
compiz は通常の Window Management を補助する以外に , XGL と連携して各種の画面効果を実現する .
( 実物の動画は gigazine の記事 などを参照 . )
XGL は速いんだろうか ?
実際に動かしている人は教えてください.
理屈の上では , OpenGL の恩恵でこれまでよりは速くなるだろう . 一方で X のボトルネックは Client - Server モデルのようにも思える .
Xlib への呼び出しはすべて X protocol として直列化され X Server に送られる .
ここが遅いんじゃないの ?
このオーバーヘッドを避けるため , X 上の OpenGL ( GLX , not XGL ) は Direct Rendering という機構を用意している .
これを使うと X protocol をバイパスして直接 OpenGL の機能にアクセスすることができる .
( 逆にいうと , 標準の状態で は OpenGL の API も X protocol 内に直列化される .
これを indirect rendering と呼ぶ .
遅そうだ ....)
XGL は描画が X protocol で抽象化されるのを期待しているため , Direct Rendering した OpenGL をうまく扱えない .
XGL はオフスクリーンの FBO に絵を描いてほしいのに , Direct Rendering のアプリケーションは画面に直接描画をしてしまうからだ .
結果としてウィンドウの合成がうまくいかず , 件のアプリケーションは画面にぽっかり穴をあけてしまう.
これを回避するためにはアプリケーションの描画を
FBO にリダイレクトする必要がある .
今のところそうした実装はされていないらしい.
アプリケーション用の OpenGL をフックするんだろうか , メモリ空間は誰のをつかうんだろうかなど , ちょっと想像するだけでも苦労は多そうに見える.
さて , 多く人の は OpenGL アプリケーションなんて使わない .
だからこの問題はささいなことかもしれない.
とはいえ例外もある .
そのひとつが gtk+ や Mozila に採用され た Drawing 層のライブラリである cairo だ. cairo はバックエンドに glitz を選択した場合 OpenGL を使う. すると先の件で困る .
つまり Drawing と Window Management でそれぞれ OpenGL を使ったために ある種の衝突がおきてしまう .
( それで困ったという人がいないところを見ると , glitz バックエンドはさほど使われていないのかもね. ) また Java2D の実装にも試験的な OpenGL バックエンドがある .
これもデフォルトでは無効化さている .
この問題も将来なんらかの方法で解決されるとは思う.
個人的には OpenGL の Direct Rendering を使いつつ XGL のオフスクリー ン( FBO ) へ描画してほしい .
そうすると cairo を使ったアプリケーションは モダンな Window Management の恩恵をうけ , かつ X protocol をバイパスすることができる .
そうなると X Window System の長年の懸念である性能問題が一気に片付くかもしれない .
XGL も glitz も同じ人物 , Novell の David Reveman によって実装されている .
私は glitz が捨てられないか気が気でない .
うまくやってほしいと思う . 他力本願でごめんなさい...
( Novell が雇ってくれたらがんば る :D )
いまどきの Toolkit : ウェブの台頭
ようやく一番上の層 , Toolkit まで辿りついた .
長くてすんません .
今時の Toolkit は二つの面で進歩している .
下位レイヤに近い実装と , アプリケーション寄りの設計だ .
実装の話はわかりやすい. モダンな Drawing を使ったおかげで高速綺麗になりましたというのが基本.
たとえば , 最近の gtk + は描画エンジンに cairo を利用している .
Seth Nickell のページ や GNOME の紹介 にある スクリーンショットをみるとその恩恵がわかる .
Vista も OSX も似たような画質を実現している .
設計に目をやると事態はもう少し複雑になる. まず , よく知られ た Toolkit のうち いまどきの設計と言えるのは Windows の WPF しかない .
Mac OSX の Cocoa も UNIX の gtk+ や
Qt も割と古参 .
モダンという感じからは遠い . ( だから悪いってわけではないけれど. あと Cocoa はだいぶがんばってる . )
WPF のどのへんがモダンかというと , まずマークアップ主導であること .
そして柔軟なレイアウト機構を持つこと.
あとは仮想マシンを一級市民として扱っていること.
要するに XAML で .NET なのってすごいよねという話 .
他にもメディアとの統合だとか強力なプロパティ・モデルだとか
色々特徴はあるんだけれど , 話の都合で上の三点に焦点を絞る.
他のプラットホームにはなぜいまいちモダンな
Toolkit が登場しないかというと , いまどきの新しいアプリケーションはみなウェブに移動してしまったからだろう.
そしてウェブ・アプリケーションの実行環境であるブラウザは 先に挙げたモダンな Toolkit の条件を満たしている .
HTML でマークアップして CSS でレイアウトして Javascript が VM だ. ( VM な実装じゃない処理系があるののは御愛嬌. )
Flash を組み合わせるとメディアもなんとか使える .
モダンなデスクトップ・アプリケーションとウェブ・アプリケーションの
アーキテクチャは近づきつつある.
ウェブの技術はモダンだけれど , モダンなものが必ずしも使いやすいとは限らない.
プログラマの視点から見て JavaScript が C++ より優れているか , HTML+CSS や XUL が
Qt より優れているか .
あまり自明でない .
ユーザから見ても , ウェブ・アプリケーション が win32 アプリケーションより 使いやすいかは怪しい .
一方で , はっきりと次世代を謳っている WPF がウェブの技術から影響を受けているのは明らかだ .
C# はさておき XAML は明らかに better HTML +CSS を目標の一つとして作られている .
未来はこっち .
Microsoft はそう判断した .
だから MFC も ATL も WinForms も捨てて XAML を選んだのだ .
( 最近は HTML+CSS に浮気気味だけれど路線に大差はない. )
一旦ウェブ・アプリケーションに目をやる .
ウェブの開発者は JavaScript や HTML を直接相手にしているわけではない .
実際はサーバサイドのフレームワークに乗って仕事をすることが多いだろう.
だからモダンな Toolkit としてウェブを議論する時は ウェブ・アプリケーションのフレームワークまで視野に入れた方がいい. 特に MVC の V と C に注目したい .
モダンな Toolkit の候補としては ウィジェットやコンポーネントのメタファを持つフレームワークを挙げることができる .
Java では Tapestry , JSF , WebObjects や GWT .
MS 製では ASP.NET といったところ .
Adobe Flex も方向は同じ .
昔ながらのフレームワークは文字列として HTML を出力する テンプレートのメタファを採用している .
これをデスクトップの Toolkit と呼ぶのは苦しい .
私の知る限り , よく知られた LL のフレームワーク に Toolkit 指向のものは見当たらない .
テンプレート指向が支配的に見える .
LL はもともと文字列処理を得意としており , その点でテンプレートの方が相性がいいのかもしれない .
モダンなものが使いやすいとは限らない.
( このへんはよくしらないので名誉毀損だったらごめんなさい. 識者の意見もとむ. )
いまどきな Toolkit の証 : レイアウトとマークアッ プ
Windows 上で動く .NET アプリケーションでの Toolkit と Mozilla で動く ウェブ・アプリケーションの Toolkit を並べて図にしてみた .
一番右は昔ながらの GNOME アプリのつもり .
Toolkit の内部は図の左にあるような階層構造として理解できる.
絵を描く機能 ( Drawing ) を使ってボタンとかを作り ( Widget ) , それをうまい具合に並べられるようにする ( Layout ) .
ウィジェットの位置や種類は XML みたいなテキストで決めて ( Markup ) , バックエンドと繋ぐのは約束事 ( Framework ) に従う .
実際は Layout と Widgets はこんなに綺麗にわかれないし , Markup を組合せ て Widget を作るようなこともできる .
この図は Toolkit 層の役割分担をおおざっぱに説明しているだけだと思ってほしい .
このうち Toolkit のモダン化に大きな役割を果たしたのは 柔軟なレイアウト機構とマークアップだろう .
このふたつによってアプリケーションの RAD 性が大きく高まった .
まず柔軟なレイアウト機構 .
HTML を考えればわかるとおり , マークアップ内で上から並べていけば何かが適当に表示される.
位置を制御したくなったら相対位置指定や float を指定していけばいい .
画面のサイズやテキスト量の変化にもつよい.
このモデルだとキッチリとした固定的なレイアウトは苦手だけれど , 世の中の多くの人は適当で楽なレイアウトを好んだのだろう.
あとはテキストを使ったマークアップ .
これの有難味はわかりにくいけれど , おそらく二種類ある .
一つ目は生成/パースしやすいテキストであること.
このおかげで商用ツールを買わないプログラマやデザイナにも
エディタとブラウザ再読み込みを使った poorman's RAD が可能になったし , サードパーティのツール屋やフレームワーク書きに参入の余地ができた .
二つ目はより宣言的であること .
マークアップなら宣言的になるということはないけれど , もともと HTML が文章+装飾という宣言的な性質を持っていたおかげで , 世間はマークアップをつかい宣言的に画面を作る便利さに気付くことができた.
この宣言的な性質のおかげでバックエンドとの切り離しが楽になり , UI の多様化が進んだ .
( バックエンドとの切り離しが楽になったのは他の理由もあるだろう.
たとえば Web の対話性が比較的プアでも許容されたとか . )
こうした特徴を生かしつつ他の欠点をとりのぞくために ,
Web 開発者はフレームワークを , Microsoft は WPF を開発した .
私はそんな風に解釈している. 結果論だけどね .
ケーススタディ : Windows Presentation Foundation
...といのうのを書こうとしたけど実は詳しくない自分に気がつき , そそくさと MSDN を読んだ .
( その後すぐに挫けた . ) 以下はざっくり付け焼刃です .
Windows Presentation Foundation ( WPF ) は MS 謹製の対話的アプリケーション用フレームワークだ .
かつては Avalon というコードネームで呼ばれ , Windows Vista の目玉のひとつだった .
いまは名前をかえて .NET 3.0 の一部になり , ふつうに XP でも動くらしい .
アーキテクチャの構成図は MSDN の記事 " WPF Architecture " に載っている .
WPF のプログラミングモデル は Web とよく似ている .
XAML というマークアップで UI を書き , イベントハンドラのコード を C# などで追加していく .
HTML で UI を書き JavaScript でイベントハンドラを書くようなもの .
コードは XAML のファイルに埋めこむことも , 別ファイルに分離することもできる .
WPF では Visual というモジュール が Drawing 層を担当する .
Visual は描画データをあらわすツリー構造 ( Visual Tree ) を持っている .
これまで説明してきた Drawing 層より担当範囲が広い .
3DCG の言葉をつかうなら , Visual Tree は一種のシーングラフだ .
そして Visual は retained mode のグラフィクス API だと言える .
( データ構造を保持... retain ...しているから retained mode なわけ. )
描画のプリミティブとして多角形や画像の貼り付け , ほかにビデオや 3D など各種のメディアをサポートする .
HTML との類比でいくと Visual Tree は DOM に相当しそうだが , 少し違う .
Visual Tree は論理的な意味を持っていない .
描画に特化している .
無理矢理 HTML で考えるなら div と span と table / tr / td しかないようなかんじ .
よりアプリケーション寄りな意味構造 , HTML でいう < h1 > や < p > や < em > などの文書マークアップや リストやボタンといった各種 GUI 部品は , Visual Tree と別のツリー構造をつくる .
それを Element Tree と呼ぶ. この Element Tree が XAML の DOM だ. 各要素は自分がどのような Visual Tree ( の部分木 ) を作るか知っている .
WPF の処理系は Element Tree から Visual Tree を作り , それを描画する .
プログラマはもっぱら Element
Tree を操作して UI をつくる .
Element
Tree の要素名は対応する .NET のクラスを持つ .
たとえば < Button > 要素は System .
Windows .
Controls .
Button クラスに対応する .
またユーザはフレームワークに従い独自の
Element Tree 要素を定義できる .
たとえば天気予報ウィジェット WeatherForecast クラスを定義し , XAML 内で < WeatherForecast > 要素として利用することができる.
要するにアプリケーション寄りの語彙が拡張可能になっている.
WPF はこのように描画用のデータ構造とアプリケーション寄りなデータ構造を分離している.
すこし HTML と比べてみよう .
HTML でのミタメと論理構造の分離は CSS を使って行われている .
ただ CSS はちょっとプアだ .
色と位置と大きさくらいしか調整できない. コー ド( JavaScript ) との関係もはっきりしない .
たとえば CSS と HTML だけで ツリー・コントロールをつくるのはしんどいだろう .
世のウェブ・フレームワークは独自に Element
Tree 相当の仕組みをつくることで 似たようなことをしている .
開発者が専用のマークアップを書くとフレームワークがそれを
HTML に展開する .
専用マークアップが Element Tree ( XAML ) , HTML が Visual
Tree に対応する .
JSF なんかはこの発想が露骨でわかりやすい .
ウェブ・フレームワークは , ロジック( サーバサイドのコード ) と 論理マークアップの対応づけが難しい .
ブラウザが解釈するのは HTML であり , 元のマークアップは失われている .
だからたとえばフレーワークでツリー・コントロールを用意しても , " 子を開く " 操作に対応するイベントハンドラをサーバサイドで呼び出すのは大変だ.
フレームワーク作者はそれぞれに工夫をしている.
でも元々それを考慮した枠組みの上で仕事をする方が楽なのは確かだろう.
さて , 描画の仕組みにも目を向けてみよう .
前のほうで二種類のウィンドウ階層 ( トップレベル・ウィンドウと子ウィンドウ ) の話をした.
トップレベル・ウィンドウの子はこれまで通りの仕組みで動いているといったけれど , WPF の場合は違う .
Visual Tree がこの子ウィンドウに相当する .
描画の際 , WPF のランタイムは Visual Tree を深さ優先でたどり , その順に各ノードを描画する .
基本は上書き. この " 出てきた順に上書き " モデルを Painter 's algorithm と 呼ぶ .
Painter 's algorithm は PDF などの描画モデルとおなじもの .
従来のモデルではウィンドウ・システムがクリッピング領域を管理し , 必要な領域だけを描こうとがんばってきた. それと比べるとけっこうおおざっぱだ.
もちろん実際は描画範囲の最小化や描画コマンドのキャッシュといった高速化をするわけだけれど , " 見えるところだけ描く " モデルとの違いは大きい .
オブジェクトの数が多い時や半透明のオブジェクトには
Painter 's algorithm が向いている .
また VRAM の向こうに色々置くとなるとチマチマした細工はバンド幅を浪費し , かえって性能を落とすのかもしれない .
Toolkit としての WFP はこのような特徴を持つ .
標準のコントロールが豊富 だとかメディアの扱いが楽といった物量系の利点を別にしても なかなか優れた作りなのがわかるとおもう .
登場しなかったも の
だいたい書きたいことは書いて気がすみました.
ただデスクトップ処理系を議論する上で重要な話題をいくつか欠いているので , その点( 欠いているという事実 ) を補足. まずイベントモデル .
ユーザ操作の結果がどのようにアプリケーションへ通知され , プログラマはそれをいかに扱えばいいのか. これは Toolkit とセットで話せばわかりやすいんだろうけれど大変なのでパス.
おなじくデータ連結もパス .
バックエンドのデータをどう UI につなぐかという話ね .
アプリケーション間通信 . クリップボードとか . よくわからないのでパス . そのうち OLE とかをちゃんと勉強しないといかんのかもしらん... テキスト処理 .
国際化されたテキストのレイアウトとか , ラップとか .
ぜんぜん知らないのでパス . LG3D .
Sun の Java 製次世代 3D デスクトップ環境 .
比較の対象としては面白いけれど流行らなそうなのでパス.
実際にアプリケーションを作る時はこういう機構のお世話になる.
今回は力尽きずに書き終えるのを目標にし , 画面に絵をだす話にしぼりました .
でもしばらくデスクトップはいいや . ( 一行もコード書いてないけど ... )
まとめ
いまどきのデスクトップ処理系はこんなかんじにモダンですよ
トップレベルウィンドウのオフスクリーンが VRAM 上に確保される .
おかげでちらつかない .
そのためにビデオカードの資源が仮想化された.
描画はビデオカードから 3D 描画機能の恩恵を得ている .
いまどきはみん な Web だけど , Microsoft は Web っぽい自分世界でがんばってていいね .

追記 : libglade など
コメント欄でおしえてもらいました .
libglade は gtk+ 用の RAD ツール glade から 出力された XML を実行時に解釈するライブラリらしい .
上のほうにある GNOME アプリケーションの図の " missing " な部分にくるものとのこと .
私の中では glade というと C のコードを吐く one - way RAD ツールだと思っていたけれど , こんなのがあるんですね .
先のページには C と python の binding が紹介されている .
直接 libglade は使っていないかもしれないけれど , Mono の Glade # も実行時構築の系統だ .
これは他の言語の binding より一歩先を行っており , コードと GUI を結びつけるのに文字列ではなくプロパティ名をつかう .
プロパティにアノテーションをつけておくと , 処理系がそこにウィジェットのインスタンスを注入してくれるわけ.
つまり GUI の Dependency Injection .
かっこいい . ( この screencast をみると雰囲気が伝わるかも . )
残念なことに Mono はいくぶん風向きがわるい．以前 osnews.com に
" On Politics , GNOME , and Mono " という記事があった .
要するに GNOME には( おそらく ) 政治的な事情で Mono が入ってない .
ひどいよ. という話 . この議論がどう決着したのか私は知らない.
たださすがの凄腕ハッカー達も
C 言語と sed と awk だけで生きてくのは辛いだろうし , そろそろモダンな高級言語に移行していいとは思う .
python の gtk+ binding はけっこう良くできているけれど , C から以降するなら型付けの強 い C# の方が馴染みはよさそうだ .
個人的には CLR のつかう .dll や .exe などの win32 風拡張子が アレルギー反応の原因じゃないかという気がしている .
このへんを . so にするだけで流行らないかなあ .
楽観的すぎかしら ...
このほか , モダンと主張しているマークアップは既存の GUI リソース類と同じという指摘があった .
たしかにそうだなあ .
私が HTML を便利だと感じるのはなぜだろうと考えてみる .
たとえば win32 のリソースはテキストだけれど , 手でいじるのはしんどい .
レイアウトが割と固定的だからかもしれない.
手で編集してボタンを増やすと既存のボタンなどと重なってしまったりする.
HTML だと勝手にずれてくれる .
マークアップはフロー型のレイアウトとセットになると便利さを増すのかもしれない.
そのほかにも detail matters な部分がありそうだけれど 私は GUI プログラミングは経験が浅いので , 普段から GUI を作っている人の意見を聞きたいところです .
追記 1 - 2
Mac OS
X について 指摘をいただきました .
ありがとうございます .
OS X について事実誤認がありますね。 Quartz は単なる描画ライブラリではありません。 Quartz は最初の図での 「 Window Management 」 と 「 Drawing 」 にまたがって存在します。 一応階層があって 、Quartz 2D が 2D 系の描画系全般 、Quartz Compositor が ウインドウシステム機能を提供してます。
だそうです . 本文中の " Quartz " となっている部分を " Quartz 2D " に , " Quartz Extreme " となっている部分を " Quartz Compositor " に 読みかえるとだいたい辻褄があうかも .
本文の修正は図を直す必要がありしんどいんで勘弁を...

" It was one of the most poorly executed events I 've seen Microsoft do in years . "
These were the words industry analyst , Rob Enderle , used to describe Tuesday 's presentation by Microsoft executives , including Bill Gates , in an interview with PC World .
According to the PC World article , and various other media reports , the presentation for unveiling Microsoft 's new Live Software strategy to the media , held in San Francisco , was one filled with logistical and technical errors , seemed " hurried " to some and ran long over the scheduled time .
" It was Ray Ozziea 's ( CTO ) coming out party and it was n't a good one , " Enderle said .
One of the goals of the presentation was to share the company 's vision .
But early media reports coming from the few people who attended the event have been less than glowing .
Now , four days after the event , many in the media ( and blogosphere ) are still unclear just what exactly is " revolutionary " about Microsoft 's new Live strategy and what it all means .
If industry pundits do n't fully get it , what hope do mere customers and investors have ?
But my aim is not to discuss Microsoft 's strategy but to focus on this particular presentation .
Rule No. 1 : Know your message inside out ( and backwards )
Leaders use speaking opportunities to communicate their vision in a crystal clear fashion ( otherwise , what 's the point of getting on stage ? ) .
It appears this recent presentation by Bill Gates , in the end , left things quite unclear , at least in the minds of many who attended the event .
Bill Gates and Steve Jobs
I am not attempting to be glib or sarcastic ( really ) , but perhaps Bill Gates and company should look to Steve Jobs and Apple for more than just technical inspiration .
Bill could learn a lot about " presenting different " from observing Jobs ' artful presentations .
Sure , not everyone will agree with Jobs ' observations , conclusions , and projections after his presentations , but at least people are not left scratching their heads in befuddlement .
Jobs ' presentations generate a lot of positive buzz and always release yet another wave of viral communication about the presentation 's content .
This happens in part because the contents are easily grasped and remembered by both the media , and regular customers and fans .
You can't " spread the word " if you do n't get what the word was .
With Jobs ' public presentations there is both a verbal and visual clarity .
This is what great leaders do .
Ben McConnell and Jackie Huba , authors of Creating Customer Evangelists make a good observation about Jobs :
" Jobs does just what a leader is supposed to do : Provide a vision of where the company ship is headed and make sure everyone understands it . "
Bill Gates is a very smart man .
He can surely do better than his last presentation .
Rule No. 2 : Remove barriers to effective communication
Aside from appearing not to have a clear message ( or at least being guilty of trying to cram too much into a two - hour presentation ) , it looks like Gates and his staff did what many millions of other PowerPoint users do daily — they used PowerPoint in a way that did not help their message .
In fact , their PowerPoint visuals probably hurt their message .
If the visuals did not help , then they quite possibly got in the way of Gates making a meaningful , personal connection with the ninety or so people in the room .
To be fair , I was not at the presentation , so it is possible that the presenters did an amazing , inspiring job in spite of their bulletpoints an clip art .
But judging from the many previous executive presentations currently available on the Microsoft website , along with the early media reports by those in attendance , it is doubtful .
Design matters , visuals matter ... it ALL matters !
Here 's the deal :
It all matters .
If you are going to get up in front of a lot of people and say that the design of your strategy matters , that the design of your integrated software matters , then at the very least the visuals you use — right here and right now , at this moment in time with this particular audience — also need to be the result of incredible design , not hurried decoration .
Let 's examine a few of the slides used by Gates in the " Live " presentation Tuesday .
To see even more slides , take a look at the many photos on Niall Kennedy 's flickr site ( brace yourself Beyond Bullet Points fans :
Bill Gates explains the big picture ( but can he explain that picture behind him ? ) .
" ... this slide really pulls it all together " Bill Gates said of the slide above .
You decide .
You can see Bill Gates spend 60 seconds explaining this slide on " The Microsoft Platform " as well as observe him go through each bullet point on his other wordy slides on the cnet.com website .
To get a non-biased point of view on the visuals , I asked my friend , Atsuko Ito , a graphic designer who works with some of the worlds top global brands in Japan to comment on these slides .
Here 's what she said .
" Wow , where to begin ?
Generally , and from a pure visual point of view , in both of these slides ( above ) there is ( 1 ) too much information in one slide .
This is typical in Japan too .
But people can't read and listen at the same time , so that is a problem .
( 2 ) The Clipart looks cheap .
Soulless .
( 3 ) The choice of colors are not the best .
I ’m personally not comfortable with it .
Maybe because the colors do n’t represent lifestyle or work style so well .
It looks very cold .
It makes life and work seem so depressing ...
How about the slide with the clouds ?
" For the ' The Live Era ' slide , ( 1 ) communication priority is weak .
Not sure what he wants to communicate the most .
( 2 ) Gradation is overused .
Even the text has gradation !
Especially when used on text , it makes it hard to read .
( 3 ) Overall impression is " clutter . "
One possible reason is using an image on the background .
It is OK to use an image ( in this case the cloud image ) , as long as the images that go on top of it are kept simple .
In this case , they are n’t .
Actually , the whole Gestalt is bad .
It is a little ugly and confusing .
Sorry . "
There are many more visual problems with the slides as well , problems we have discussed on the site before .
Let me just touch on just one more .
Do n't rain on my parade
Concerning the " Microsoft ' Live ' Platform " slide , it is important to note that not all people will view the use of clouds in a positive light .
Just think of the many ways we use " cloud (y ) " to convey negative images or feelings in the English vernacular .
For example , " Never a cloudy day " is used in many songs to convey love , good times , a bright future and so on .
The phrase " ... clouds up ahead " implies danger or difficulties in future .
Now it is true that a few fluffy cumulus clouds can represent a fine sunny day and convey other positive associations .
But the slide Bill uses has enough cloud formations to make an experienced sailor give the order to batten down the hatches .
Bill has some real cumulonimbus - looking clouds underneath his title , a sure sign that bad weather is ahead ?
There is even " digital rain " being released from one low cloud , showering " experiences " down ( and up according to the double arrow ) onto other software and " other devices , " like an ancient iMac .
It may seem like a small thing , but you have to be careful with the implied messages sometimes hidden within images .
This is especially true across cultures .
Slides matter , because it all matters .
Well - designed visuals wo n't save a weak message , but poorly designed visuals will necessarily detract from — or even completely undermine — an otherwise strong verbal message .

In this month ’s edition of Reason , Matt Welch takes a look at the record and political philosophy of John McCain and finds a man we should be afraid of :
Reading McCainâ€™s four best - selling books is a revelatory experience .
Not since Teddy Roosevelt has a leading presidential contender committed so many words to print about his philosophies of life and governance before seeking the Oval Office .
All of McCainâ€™s charming strengths and alarming foibles are there , hiding in plain sight , often unintentionally .
McCain on the page is reflexively self - effacing ( â€ œI have spent much of my life choosing my own attitude , often carelessly , often for no better reason than to indulge a conceit , â€  he writes in the second paragraph of Faith of My Fathers ) , consciously reverent of his heroes ( Why Courage Matters and Character Is Destiny are basically collections of hagiographic mini- profiles threaded with a few self - help bromides ) , and refreshingly authentic - sounding ( for a politician , anyway ) .
He has a tendency to write passages that would fit perfectly in a 12 - step recovery guide , especially Steps 1 ( admitting the problem ) and 2 ( investing faith in a â€œPower greater than ourselvesâ€ ) .
There isnâ€™t any evidence that McCain himself has gone through the 12 steps , but his father was a member of Alcoholics Anonymous , his second wife received treatment in 1994 for her five - year addiction to pain medication , and he has spent a life surrounded by substance abusers .
â€ œI have learned the truth , â€  he writes in Faith of My Fathers .
â€ œThere are greater pursuits than self - seeking .
â€ ¦Glory belongs to the act of being constant to something greater than yourself .â€ 
That â€ œsomethingâ€ is the â€œlast , best hope of humanity , â€ the â€œadvocate for all who believed in the Rights of Man , â€  the â€œcity on a hillâ€ once dreamed by Puritan pilgrim John Winthrop ( whom McCain celebrates in Character Is Destiny ) .
Any thing or person perceived as tarnishing that cityâ€™s luster has a sworn enemy in the Arizona senator .
â€ œOur greatness , â€  he writes in Worth the Fighting For , â€œdepends upon our patriotism , and our patriotism is hardly encouraged when we cannot take pride in the highest public institutions , institutions that should transcend all sectarian , regional , and commercial conflicts to fortify the publicâ€™s allegiance to the national community.â€ 
From this belief , Welch points out , comes McCain ’s positions on issues ranging from campaign finance reform to the War on Drugs .
And through it all there is the idea that the individual should put their desires second , and the needs of the state first :
If youâ€™re beginning to detect a rigid sense of citizenship and a skeptical attitude toward individual choice , you are beginning to understand what kind of president John McCain actually would make , in contrast with the straight - talking maverick that journalists love to quote but rarely examine in depth .
For years McCain has warned that a draft will be necessary if we donâ€™t boost military pay , and he has long agitated for mandatory national service .
â€ œThose who claim their liberty but not their duty to the civilization that ensures it live a half - life , indulging their self - interest at the cost of their self - respect , â€  he wrote in The Washington Monthly in 2001 .
â€ œSacrifice for a cause greater than self - interest , however , and you invest your life with the eminence of that cause .
Americans did not fight and win World War II as discrete individuals.â€ 
McCain ’s Presidential hero is not Ronald Reagan , who recognized America ’s legacy of individual liberty , but Teddy Roosevelt :
â€ œIn the Roosevelt code , the authentic meaning of freedom gave equal respect to self - interest and common purpose , to rights and duties , â€ McCain writes .
â€ œAnd it absolutely required that every loyal citizen take risks for the countryâ€™s sake .
â€ ¦
His insistence that every citizen owed primary allegiance to American ideals , and to the symbols , habits , and consciousness of American citizenship , was as right then as it is now.â€ 
Like Roosevelt , it is clear that McCain sees national duty as more important than individual liberty .
A President who believes this is capable of almost anything .
Giuliani to Paul : ' Take back ' 9/11 comments WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Why did terrorists attack the U.S. on 9/11 ?
According to Texas Congressman Ron Paul , " They attack us because we 've been over there .
We 've been bombing Iraq for 10 years .
We 've been in the Middle East . "
Restrained , but clearly angry , former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani jumped in , calling Paul 's statement " extraordinary . "
" As someone who lived through the attack of September 11 -- that we invited the attack because we were attacking Iraq -- I do n't think I 've ever heard that before , and I 've heard some pretty absurd explanations for September 11th , " he said .
Giuliani's fiery response prompted applause and the following demand from the former mayor : " I would ask the congressman to withdraw that comment and tell us that he did n't really mean that . "
In response , Paul stood by his comments and said that " if we think that we can do what we want around the world and not incite hatred , then we have a problem ...
They come and they attack us because we 're over there . "

Google has filed its Form 10 - K for the fiscal year ending 2006 , and there are some interesting tidbits in there .
First off , the company 's good financial performance over the past several years going from revenues of $ 439.5 million in 2002 to $ 10.6 billion in 2006 has resulted in a massive war chest .
Google 's cash and short - term investments amounted to over $ 11.2 billion at the end of 2006 .
That 's a 433 percent increase from 2004 's $ 2.1 billion , and there is little to indicate that the growth party will end any time soon .
Advertising continues to be the engine pulling Google 's money train , accounting for 99 percent of its revenues .
60 percent of ad revenues come from Google 's own web sites , while the bulk of the rest comes from Google Network web sites .
The remaining 1 percent comes from licensing deals .
Traffic acquisition costs are about 31.5 percent of its advertising revenues .
The rest of Google 's revenues come primarily from licensing web search technology .
Google Checkout appears to be a loss leader for the time being , as merchants using it are not charged for sales up to ten times they amount they spend on AdWords each month .
Starting in 2008 , the company will begin charging 2 percent plus 20 ¢ per transaction in excess of the current AdWords spend multiple .
Google 's cost of sales for 2006 was 8 percent .
By way of comparison , Microsoft cost of sales stood at 22 percent for fiscal year 2006 , Yahoo at 20 percent , and Apple at 13 percent .
That shows that Google is extremely good at keeping sales - related costs down and that the company 's business operations are humming along rather efficiently .
R&D spending is up to $ 1.2 billion for 2006 , over double 2005 's $ 599.5 million figure .
At $ 11.2 billion , Google 's cash on hand is comparable to Apple 's $ 10.1 billion ( from its Form 10 - K for fiscal year 2006 , which ended on September 30 , 2006 ) .
It pales in comparison , however , to Microsoft 's $ 34.1 billion ( down from $ 60.5 billion in 2004 ) .
Yahoo , Google 's chief competitor in search , has a relatively paltry $ 1.6 billion in the bank .
Data source : company 10 - K forms ; Yahoo Finance
If you 've got a big war chest , one use for it is acquisitions , and Google has been very aggressive in that area .
It is proving itself willing to spend large amounts on goodwill , which accounts for intangible assets like brand name , reputation , employee morale , and other factors that play into a company 's performance .
Google 's acquisition of YouTube was valued at $ 1.19 billion ( only $ 21.2 million of which was cash ) and of that , $ 1.13 billion was goodwill and only $ 24 million was for patents and developed technology .
Having a war chest of $ 11.2 billion gives Google freedom to continue making strategic acquisitions , even overpaying if necessary .
It also enables the company to take a longer - term view with its products and acquisitions , putting it in a position to push new services out the door now and figure out how to make money off them later .
It 's an enviable position to be in , but did anyone expect Google to build such a war chest from advertising ?
Wearing scrubs and slouching in their chairs , the emergency room staff members , assembled for a patient - safety seminar , largely ignored the hospital ’s chief executive while she made her opening remarks .
They talked on their cellphones and got up to freshen their coffee or snag another danish .
But the room became still and silent when an airline pilot who used to fly F - 14 Tomcats for the Navy took the lectern .
Handsome , upright and meticulously dressed , the pilot began by recounting how in 1977 , a series of human errors caused two Boeing 747s to collide on a foggy runway in the Canary Islands , killing 583 people .
Riveted , a surgeon gripped his pen with both hands as if he might break it , an anesthetist stopped maniacally chewing his gum , and a wide - eyed nurse bit her lip .
An attention grabber , yes , but what does an airplane crash have to do with patient safety ?
A growing number of health care providers are trying to learn from aviation accidents and , more specifically , from what the airlines have done to prevent them .
In the last five years , several major hospitals have hired professional pilots to train their critical - care staff members on how to apply aviation safety principles to their work .
They learn standard cockpit procedures like communication protocols , checklists and crew briefings to improve patient care , if not save patients ’ lives .
Though health care experts disagree on how to incorporate aviation - based safety measures , few argue about the parallels between the two industries or the value of borrowing the best practices .
Why Do You Work So Hard ? /
Is it maybe time to quit your safe job and follow your path and infuriate the establishment ?
T here remains this enormous and wicked sociocultural myth .
It is this : Hard work is all there is .
Work hard and the world respects you .
Work hard and you can have anything you want .
Work really extra super hard and do nothing else but work and ignore your family and spend 14 hours a day at the office and make 300 grand a year that you never have time to spend , sublimate your soul to the corporate machine and enjoy a profound drinking problem and sporadic impotence and a nice 8 BR mini-mansion you never spend any time in , and you and your shiny BMW 740 i will get into heaven .
This is the American Puritan work ethos , still alive and screaming and sucking the world dry .
Work is the answer .
Work is also the question .
Work is the one thing really worth doing and if you 're not working you 're either a slacker or a leech , unless you 're a victim of BushCo 's budget - reamed America and you 've been laid off , and therefore it 's OK because that means you 're out there every day pounding the pavement looking for work and honing your resume and if you 're not , well , what the hell is wrong with you ?
Call it " the cafe question . "
Any given weekday you can stroll by any given coffee shop in the city and see dozens of people milling about , casually sipping and eating and reading and it's freakin ' noon on a Tuesday and you 're like , wait , do n't these people work ?
Do n't they have jobs ?
They can't all be students and trust - fund babies and cocktail waitresses and drummers in struggling rock bands who live at home with their moms .
Of course , they 're not .
Not all of them , anyway .
Some are creative types .
Some are corporate rejects .
Some are recovering cube slaves now dedicated full time to working on their paintings .
Some are world travelers who left their well - paying gigs months ago to cruise around Vietnam on a motorcycle before returning to start an import - export business in rare hookahs .
And we look at them and go , What is wrong with these people ?
It 's a bitter duality :
We scowl at those who decide to chuck it all and who choose to explore something radical and new and independent , something more attuned with their passions , even as we secretly envy them and even as our inner voices scream and applaud and throw confetti .
Our culture allows almost no room for creative breaks .
There is little tolerance for seeking out a different kind of " work " that does n't somehow involve cubicles and widening butts and sour middle managers monitoring your e-mail and checking your Web site logs to see if you 've wasted a precious 37 seconds of company time browsing blowfish.com or reading up on the gay marriage apocalypse .
We are at once infuriated by and enamored with the idea that some people can just up and quit their jobs or take a leave of absence or take out a loan to go back to school , how they can give up certain " mandatory " lifestyle accoutrements in order to dive back into some seemingly random creative / emotional / spiritual endeavor that has nothing to do with paying taxes or the buying of products or the boosting of the GNP .
It just seems so ... un-American .
But it is so , so needed .
Case in point No. 1 : I have this sister .
She is deep in medical school right now , studying to be a naturopathic doctor at Bastyr University just outside Seattle , the toughest school of its kind in the nation , and the most difficult to get into , especially if you 've had no formal medical training beforehand , as my sister had n't .
She got in .
She bucked all expectation and thwarted the temptation to quit and take a well - paying corporate job and she endured the incredibly brutal first year and rose to the top of her class .
Oh and by the way , she did it all when she was over 40 .
With almost no money .
While going through an ugly , debt - ridden divorce .
Oh you 're so lucky that you have the means to do that , we think .
I 'd love to do that but I can't because I have too many a ) bills b) babies c ) doubts , we insist .
We always think such lives are for others and never for ourselves , something people with huge chunks of cash reserves or huge hunks of time or huge gobs of wildly ambitious talent can do .
It is never for us .
And truly , this mind - set is the national plague , a fate worse than death .
And while it must be acknowledged that there are plenty who are in such dire financial or emotional circumstances that they simply cannot bring change , no matter how much they might wish it , you still always gotta ask :
How much is legit , and how much is an excuse born of fear ?
The powers that be absolutely rely on our lethargy , our rampant doubts , the attitude that says that it 's just too difficult or too impracticable to break away .
After all , to quit a bland but stable job , to follow your own path implies breaking the rules and asking hard questions and dissing the status quo .
And they absolutely cannot have that .
Case in point No. 2 : I have a young and rather brilliant S.O. , a specialist in goddesses and mystics and world religions , who is right now working on a book , a raw funky spirituality " anti- guide " for younger women .
She took a six - month leave of absence from a very decent , reliable , friendly administrative job so as to focus on the creation of this project .
And while she has no trust fund , she does have the " luxury " of small parental loans to help her through , though it hardly matters :
Giving up her respectable gig was insanely stressful and wracked with doubt .
Leave a honest job ?
Give up paid health care ?
Have no reliable source of income for months on end ?
Trade calm stability for risk and random chance ?
No way , most people say .
And of course , it was the absolute best choice she could 've made .
Time instantly became more fluid and meaningful .
Mental clutter vanished .
Possibility grinned .
Case in point No. 3 : Not long ago , the CEO of one of the largest and most powerful international real estate firms in the nation quit his job .
Stepped down .
Not , as you might imagine , for retirement and not to play more golf and not to travel the world staying only in Four Seasons suites , but to work on rebuilding his relationship with his estranged wife .
My insider source tells me it was one of the most touching , and unexpected , and incredibly rare corporate memos they had ever seen .
No one -- I mean no one in this culture is supposed to quit a job like that just for , what again ?
Love ?
Relationship ?
It 's simply not done .
But of course , it absolutely should be .
We are designed , weaned , trained from Day 1 to be productive members of society .
And we are heavily guilted into believing that must involve some sort of droning repetitive pod-like dress - coded work for a larger corporate cause , a consumerist mechanism , a nice happy conglomerate .
But the truth is , God , the divine true spirit loves nothing more than to see you unhinge and take risk and invite regular , messy , dangerous upheaval .
This is exactly the energy that thwarts the demons of stagnation and conservative rot and violent sanctimonious bloody Mel Gibson -y religion , one that would have all our work be aimed at continuously patching up our incessant potholes of ugly congenital guilt , as opposed to contributing to the ongoing orgiastic evolution of spirit .
It is not for everyone .
It implies incredibly difficult choices and arranging your life in certain ways and giving up certain luxuries and many , many people seemed locked down and immovable and all done with exploring new options in life , far too deeply entrenched in debts and family obligations and work to ever see such unique light again .
Maybe you know such people .
Maybe you are such people .
But then again , maybe not .
This is the other huge truism we so easily forget :
There is always room .
There are always choices we can begin to make , changes we can begin to invite , rules we can work to upset , angles of penetration we can try to explore .
And if that 's not worth trying , well , what is ?
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Popular online social network MySpace said on Tuesday it has identified , removed and blocked “ a few thousand ” user profiles of convicted sex offenders , as part of a program to protect its young members from adult predators .
A screen grab of MySpace.com .
Popular online social network MySpace says it has identified , removed and blocked " a few thousand " user profiles of convicted sex offenders among its 175 million profiles on its service as part a previously announced program to protect its youth members from adult predators .
REUTERS/www.myspace.com
The action comes a day after eight U.S. attorneys general demanded that the News Corp. - owned company hand over offenders ’ names and addresses , and delete their profiles from among MySpace ’s 175 million user base .
“ We ’ve made it clear we have a zero tolerance policy against convicted sex offenders , ” MySpace Chief Security Officer Hemanshu Nigam said in a phone interview on Tuesday .
“ We ’ve said numerous times that the goal was to delete them . ”
Nigam said he was puzzled over the law enforcement authorities ’ actions on Monday , which he said would require MySpace to break the law .
“ While numerous Attorneys General have asked us to turn the names of the sexual predators over to them , we are , unfortunately , prohibited by federal and state laws from doing so , ” Nigam said in a statement .
The AGs ’ demands preceded a hearing on Tuesday for the “ Protect Children from Sexual Predators Act ” in North Carolina , a bill backed by North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper that requires online services such as MySpace to check the ages of members .
Cooper is one of the eight AGs pushing MySpace to disclose the information .
The company said it was prohibited by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 , which protects a user ’s electronic communication against government surveillance without a court order .
MySpace has come under attack over the past year after some of its young members fell prey to adult predators posing as minors .
The families of several teenage girls sexually assaulted by MySpace members sued the service in January for failing to safeguard its young members .
MySpace and background verification company Sentinel Tech Holdings Corp. said late last year they planned to develop the first U.S. national database of convicted sex offenders to make it easier to keep track of predators .
The company also vowed to give free access of the database to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children , a group which helps law enforcement in their investigations .
Convicted sex offenders are required by law to register their contact information with local authorities .
But the information is only available in regional databases and has never been available on a national scale .
There are about 600,000 registered convicted offenders in the U.S .
One part of the new technology was made available on May 2 to MySpace , which began cross referencing its user profiles against the new database , Nigam said .
The profiles of suspected offenders were then manually checked by a MySpace staff member before users were removed and blocked from the service , Nigam said .
U.S. lawmakers in January proposed requiring sex offenders to register valid e-mail and instant messaging addresses with law enforcement authorities to better protect kids using sites like MySpace .
“ We are doing everything short of breaking the law to ensure that the information about these predators gets to the proper authorities , ” Nigam said .
“ MySpace stresses that it does want to work with the Attorneys General to find a way to make sure the information gets into the right hands . ”
Nigam said the company is still working on a more efficient system to provide updates of information on offenders deleted from the site to the missing kids group .
A Personal Perspective on the Responsibilities of a Cancer - surviving Software Developer
My family has a genetic predisposition towards cancers of all sorts .
My father died of cancer in 1975 .
At home , of course , we talked about what was going on in some detail .
However , my father did not feel able to inform his employers of his condition , and I would not be surprised if only one or two close friends at work were aware of it .
My brother Bobby died of cancer in 1997 , and not a lot had changed .
Bobby was fearful of his employer knowing the details of his illness and so the succession plans that would have made things easier for both of them were not in place .
As a result , neither my brother nor his employer was properly prepared for his death .
I was first diagnosed with cancer in 1998 .
Luckily for me , we had just entered the new era of cancer survivorship , officially ushered in by Lance Armstrong .
Lance was a testicular cancer survivor .
Having been diagnosed in 1996 , he not only recovered but returned to racing and scored the first of his seven Tour de France victories in 1999 .
By the time I was diagnosed with primary liver cancer ( which is now considered cured , as I will define “ cured ” below ) in 1998 , Lance was on the comeback trail and to people like me ( cancer survivor and cyclist ) , he was already a hero .
Thanks to the inspirational example of people like Lance , and to advancements in the medical treatment of many types of cancer , many people now feel able to deal with cancer more openly .
Following my recent diagnosis with Mucinous Adenocarcinoma , not only do I keep my clients informed of my condition , I also post my daily struggles with cancer survival on my blog ( editor ’s note : archive link ) .
My honesty has probably cost me a client or two , but this is more than compensated for by the feeling of trust and comfort I have with the clients I retain .
Employee vs. Consultant
If you find yourself in a similar situation and decide to “ come out ” , the issues you face will be somewhat different depending on whether you are an employee or a consultant .
I have been a full time consultant since 2001 , and was a 4 - day a week employee and part time consultant for many years before that .
In my case , I have multiple clients , and had to worry only if all my clients decided not to continue to work with me .
As an employee , the issues are really all tied to your employer .
What sort of relationship do you have with your employer ?
Is it a friendly relationship ?
Do you have a warm - and - fuzzy feeling about how they might react ?
Is there any law that might require you to let your employer know about your illness ?
For instance , in the United States , there is a law ( The “ Americans with Disabilities ” Act ) that provides some protection , and also stipulates some special treatment for folks with disabilities ( and cancer could be considered a disability for this law ) .
To get the benefits of the law , you likely have to be completely open about your condition .
Characterizing Your Cancer
For purposes of this discussion , we can place cancers into one of three broad categories :
Curable / Cured
A number of cancers can be considered curable .
Many early breast cancers , early colon cancers and early prostate cancers can be cured , often with surgery alone , sometimes with surgery and other treatments .
My liver cancer was considered cured in 1998 when the entire cancer was determined to be primary from the liver ( meaning that the cancer originated in the liver and did not spread beyond the liver ) , and the tumor was completely removed .
If your cancer is cured , you can simply go on with your life , although some cancers are only considered cured after a number of years of “ clean ” reports .
My liver cancer was considered cured immediately after surgery , since the surgeon was certain all traces of cancer were removed ; Lance Armstrong ’s testicular cancer was considered cured only after 5 years of clean scans .
Cancer as a curable disease may be a new concept to your boss or clients and they may require some education on this point .
One of my clients had a relative who had died of a colon cancer that spread to the liver , and he found it difficult to regard as curable my totally different primary liver cancer .
I was able to convince him through education , and to this day he is a good , reliable client .
Once you are cured , I believe there is no requirement that you tell future employers or clients about your prior illness , unless the follow - up treatment will require cooperation from the new employer or client .
Treatable
A large number of cancers are not , strictly speaking , curable .
For instance , my recently diagnosed mucinous adenocarcinoma is not considered curable .
However , treatment for such cancers can often lead to it becoming more of a chronic disease .
Through various internet groups , set up for people who have mucus - creating tumors , I know of people who have survived as few as 2 - 3 years , or as long as 10 years .
It is difficult to predict the exact length of time you might have , if diagnosed with a treatable cancer .
However , in the case of my disease , even 2 years can be a long time .
Nevertheless , it is unlikely that most folks can simply curl up in their rooms for two or more years without some form of employment .
Not Curable / Not Treatable
If your doctors tell you that there is no cure for the disease , and there is no reasonable treatment for the disease , or if given an explanation of all that is involved with treatment , you decide the possible gain is not worth the likely cost ( both physically , emotionally and financially ) , then the cancer can be considered incurable .
In this case , read the next paragraph , and then go and spend time with your family .
One advantage we computer people have is that we should be able to use our computer skills to keep up - to - date on the latest advancements in treatment for our disease .
For instance , the rare cancer , Gastro Intestinal Stromal Tumor ( GIST ) was once considered a largely untreatable and incurable disease .
In about 2002 , Gleevec appeared on the market as a treatment for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia ( CML ) .
Shortly after the medication was introduced , it was discovered that Gleevec could also be used to treat GIST tumors .
Keeping abreast of developments in the treatment of our disease is the one thing that we , as computer people , can and should do .
There are several useful sites in this regard , as well as groups where you can find information and support .
For example :
Around the Office
There are a number of things that I have found helpful in my dealings with coworkers and clients .
First things first : if a coworker has a “ need to know ” about your health situation , let him or her know one time in fairly general terms what you are going through .
Then , wait for your coworkers to come back to you if they have more questions .
If they have more questions , then answer them at whatever level you are comfortable .
You will discover that some people are very uncomfortable about cancer , and will never speak of it again .
Try not to make discussion of your treatment something that comes up every day .
Unless you want to be known as “ cancer guy ( or gal ) ” , let others lead any further discussion of what is going on with your care .
Next thing is this : cancer treatments can change the way your body looks , whether that be loss of hair , weight loss or gain .
Depending upon the workplace , coming in bald after a chemo treatment might or might not be considered appropriate and acceptable .
If it is not acceptable in your workplace , most insurance will pay for at least a part of the cost of a hairpiece .
Get a good quality hairpiece !
You are worth it , and looking good can help restore your morale and confidence .
Many hospitals also have a “ Looking Good , Feeling Better ” program that can help women with makeup tips as well , which can minimize the effect of loss of hair .
If you lose or gain a lot of weight , make sure you buy clothes that fit !
I made the mistake of thinking that my weight would come back , and so wore clothes that made me look like a rag picker .
A client who had been working with me throughout my liver cancer , without a word of concern , got very nervous when I lost a lot of weight and showed up in clothes that were way too big .
In fact , on this occasion , the weight loss had been caused by a surgery that did not involve any active cancer ( though it was to prevent a possible future disease ) .
I have learned my lesson and , recently , when my cancer treatment caused me to lose weight I immediately went out and purchased new clothes that fit me correctly .
When the same client saw me , he commented that I “ looked great ” , even though I had lost about 10 pounds .
That was money well spent .
Part of the reason I lost so much weight after my precautionary surgery was that I felt so great afterwards that I started exercising , walking and riding my bicycle .
When I rode a 2 - day , 170 - mile bike ride for a charity , I made sure all my clients knew I was doing the ride , and made a point of letting them know that I finished it .
Nothing helps someone accept a cancer survivor more than realizing that the cancer survivor is in better shape than they are !
The Responsibility of a Software Developer
My surviving brother , Tommy , is a unionized worker who delivers muffins .
As Tommy explains it , he goes into a store , removes the old , stale muffins , and puts in new , fresh muffins .
Were Tommy to become ill and die , it is not likely that a new delivery person would require more than a week or two to get completely up to date on how his route works .
As such , any responsibility that Tommy might have to his employer , in making sure they understood his condition and the possible future outcome of the disease , is minimal .
Most software developers are different .
While there may be no legal responsibility to make our employers or clients aware of possible longer term health problems , I believe there is a moral responsibility to ensure that , whatever happens to us , our employers or clients are protected and able to continue functioning .
Years ago , wherever I worked , I had a cartoon that hung in my office .
It was from an early source code control company , and it showed a woman with two small children at a graveside .
A man in a suit walks up , and the caption says , “ Do you recall him ever mentioning Source Code ? ”
These days , that is less funny for me than it is poignant .
Even when I got the “ all clear ” on my first liver cancer , I nonetheless tried to ensure that all clients had the source code that they should have , and I tried to ensure that , where possible , internal support staff were up - to - date on the status of all existing work .
More recently , I have made it my habit to deliver new software with the source code , and to assign the client the rights to that source code .
Specifically , as a software developer who has been diagnosed with a serious illness , what should you do ?
I recommend the following :
Make certain that source code is where it should be .
If that means that the client should have it , make sure they do .
If that means that it should be checked into the employer ’s source code control system , make sure you do .
.
If that means that the client should have it , make sure they do .
If that means that it should be checked into the employer ’s source code control system , make sure you do .
Clearly document anything “ strange ” in the source code you deliver .
When I am coding , and I do something in the source code that is either very clever ( perhaps too clever ) or potentially confusing , I place a comment in the code that will encourage me to return to the code to address the issue .
In Visual Studio , placing a TODO comment is a great way of tracking such sections of code .
Whether you clearly comment the code , or ( better yet ) clean up the code , you should make sure that another developer can understand it .

This is a time when you might want to take a young developer under your wing .
Whatever happens to your health – win , lose or draw – what better legacy is there than to have brought up a new developer .

This is a time when you might want to take a young developer under your wing .
Whatever happens to your health – win , lose or draw – what better legacy is there than to have brought up a new developer .
Consider moving to a different job , especially if your illness is not curable .
If , as a consultant , you are acting as primary developer on systems for small clients who have no internal support , then you might want to reconsider .
If , as an employee , you are the only one with your job title or specific responsibility , then at the very least you should have a succession plan in place .
It is also possible that you can use different talents or skills to find an alternative position within the organization .
For instance , if you have skill and an interest in writing , then a job in the documentation department might allow you to take a step back from software development , while continuing to leverage your knowledge of that software .
In general , the rule for anyone with a serious illness ( especially if that illness is not likely to be curable ) is this :
Make sure you are not indispensable !
Early in a career , making yourself indispensable might be a good thing .
Being the hero , pulling all - nighters to do what needs to be done , might be a good way to boost your profile within the organization .
However , a cancer survivor , especially one whose cancer may not be cured , needs to take a different view .
Summing Up
While this topic might be considered somewhat of a downer , I think that many of the ideas presented here should be considered by software developers regardless of whether they have a serious illness .
Might the guy in the next cubicle walk out in front of a bus ?
Might the gal across the hall have a massive stroke and become unavailable for weeks at a time ?
Of course .
As software developers , we need to recognize the special relationship we have with employers and clients , and to make certain that we have dotted all the i’s and crossed all of the t’s .
We should ensure that , no matter what happens , we have taken care of our responsibilities such that , in the event of our departure , our clients and employers can continue to function normally .

Troubleshooting
Q . My download is very slow
A . The torrent has n't got very many peers at the moment , so download rates are limited .
If you can download with a standalone torrent client with properly forwarded ports that would probably increase the download speed - if you do please seed for as long as possible .
Q. I installed ubuntu , but how do I use it
A. Reboot the computer , and as it's starting up you 'll be presented with a menu - select Ubuntu from that menu and press enter .
Q. The installer freezes at the splash screen .
A . Try another option in the 2nd boot menu ( GRUB menu ) .
To see the menu you may have to keep tapping the escape key after selecting " Ubuntu " from the first menu .
Q . When booting , I get this error : Error 17 : File not found
A . Try defragmenting your hard drive
Q . The bootloader does n't show up at all , and it boots straight into windows
A. Make sure C:\boot.ini has a " timeout " value higher than 0 , and that this is the last line : C:\grldr= " Ubuntu "
Q. I can't find the Boot.ini file
A. Right - click My Computer , and then click Properties , then go to the Advanced tab , click Settings under Startup and Recovery , then Under System Startup , click Edit .
Q. I can't login to Ubuntu with the username I specified in the installer .
A . At the moment , the username is " ubuntu " , and the password is " ubuntu " , regardless of what you selected during installation
Q. I 'm getting gdm and xserver errors
A. Ctrl - Alt - F1 , log in , and run : sudo dpkg - reconfigure xserver - xorg , then reboot
Q . My network does n't work
A. Open a terminal , and run : sudo dpkg - reconfigure dhcp3- client , then reboot
Q. How can I remove ubuntu when I no longer want it
A. Start the computer into Windows , and then go into " Add / Remove Programs " in " Control Panel " .
Select " Ubuntu Linux " and press remove .
REMEMBER that this removes Ubuntu and any programs or documents you installed inside Ubuntu .
Q. Can I install if my computer is running Windows Vista ?
A . Only if you 're dual - booting with Windows XP ; boot XP , install in XP , then select Windows XP in the Vista bootloader , then select Ubuntu .
Users running just Vista , and not dual - booting with Windows XP will have to wait until GRLDR supports the Vista bootloader .
Q. My Windows partition is not the first partition on my first hard drive .
Will this work ?
A. Not for now .
Support will hopefully soon be available .

Bugs
Report bugs here
Does not use a bug tracker
Does not support Vista ( which does not use boot.ini )
However , users dual - booting with Windows XP can work around this by chainloading NTLDR , and booting Ubuntu from there
I know the feature has n't been completed yet - but should n't it pick up the time zone from Windows ?
Does not work with Windows 98 .
We do n't plan on supporting any pre-NT systems , because GRLDR needs NTLDR , which is present only in NT - based systems , and FAT32 has a 4GB file size limitation , which will severely restrict the size of the root disk image

BBC News , Norway
Environmentalists and fishermen in northern Norway are warning of a Russian invasion of alien crustaceans which are threatening to ruin the local sea fauna .
They say the giant red king crab is spreading with alarming speed from Russian waters along the Norwegian coast , destroying everything in its wake .
The crab has few natural enemies , and is considered to be an omnivore , digesting everything from cod larvae to other crabs .
But it is also a sought - after delicacy .
Lars Petter
Oeye takes gourmet tourists on fjord crab safaris near the border with Russia , high up in Norway 's Arctic north .
We may be in for a nasty surprise when research has concluded on their impact on the ecosystem
Rasmus Hansson ,
WWF Norway
Here , crabs are picked off the sea floor by divers .
Mr Oeye says the fjord is crawling with them .
" It is not abnormal that you might see 10,000 crabs together .
It might look scary , because people do n't know that this is the way king crabs behave .
" I started to dive in 1987 .
At that time we had found the first crabs in these waters , but we never saw king crabs in shallow depths or in diving depths at that moment . "
Fishing quotas
The red king crab is native only to the north Pacific around the Kamchatka peninsula and neighbouring Alaskan waters .
Soviet scientists introduced the species to the Russian Barents Sea near the border with Norway in 1960 .
They wanted to increase the yield from local fisheries .
Norwegian fishermen want increased quotas on the giant crabs
Since then , millions of crabs have spread west .
Environmentalists like WWF Norway 's Rasmus Hansson say they must be stopped .
" They do n't belong here .
The biodiversity convention states specifically that introduced species is one of the four most important factors for species extermination in the world .
" With the king crabs , we know that they are an enormous crab , today it 's about 20 million of them in the Barents Sea .
Twenty years ago there were zero . "
Mr Hansson says the present annual fishing quota of 300,000 crabs must be increased .
Local fishermen agree - too many king crabs ruin their nets .
Big money
They also know a large king crab quota means big money .
Neighbouring Russian king crab fishermen have a quota 10 times that of their Norwegian colleagues .
It is an invasive species , and of course we do n't know enough ... but it 's not like they 're really destroying the bottom of the sea
Lars Petter Oeye ,
Crab safari organiser
They can afford to keep their fishing fleet in excellent shape between seasons in an expensive Norwegian wharf .
The Norwegian government is considering increasing the quota for Norwegian fishermen to reflect this reality , and to control the spread of the crab .
Mr Hansson sees no need to wait .
" These animals eat things .
They obviously make a difference down at the bottom of the sea , " he said .
" We still do n't quite know what , but we may be in for a nasty surprise when research has concluded on their impact on the ecosystem . "
Mr Oeye agrees more king crabs should be caught , but thinks the crab threat is sometimes exaggerated .
" Of course we should say it is an invasive species , and of course we do n't know enough .
But it 's not like they 're really destroying the bottom of the sea . "
If the government does increase quotas and makes more of the red king crabs available , it would probably please both fishermen , environmentalists and seafood lovers .
When I go on holiday I always take my laptop .
What kind of geek would n’t ?
Wireless internet access is widespread in airports around the world , and you can even get ( patchy ) wireless internet while you fly .
Most hotel chains also offer either Ethernet or wireless internet in your hotel room , so when you arrive you can still get your fix of constant news and email .
The problem is most beaches do n’t have any wireless internet access .
Now why would this matter you may ask ?
Well , I spend a lot of my time indoors , which means that after several months of all - day work and long nights browsing and gaming I look like a ghost .
Whether you like it or not , everyone requires some rays .
So , before you book your next trip , plan to travel to a beach where you can get online wirelessly .
1. Clearwater Beach , FL : This popular Floridian beach boasts great WiFi coverage from multiple suppliers .
So between relaxing in the sun and swimming in the crystal clear Gulf waters you can browse the web , email friends or even do some work .
2. Brighton Beach , UK :
This lively seaside resort has been a firm favourite with dance music fans from all over the UK for many years .
Brighton is famous for it ’s crazy nightlife , which starts early and finishes late .
Brighton also has a great selection of boutique shops and when the weather is nice , the beach is packed with sunworshippers .
The beach is also blanketed with WiFi , allowing you to email photos from the night before .
You should have no problem finding free wireless internet access once off the beach , there are lots of open hotspots throughout the resort .
3. Patong Beach , Thailand : Patong is a beach in Phuket that is popular destination with the backpacking jet - set who travel to Thailand for the year round sun , vibrant culture and delectable food .
Now you ’ve got another reason to come here ; the ability to relax on the beach while browsing your favourite websites .
4. Sunset State Beach , CA : Looking for a bit more action instead of just baking in the sun ?
Then Sunset State Beach is for you .
It has a huge range of activities available from fishing and horse riding to hiking and surfing .
What ’s more , you can get wireless internet access to keep in touch with your friends and family .
5. Hermosa Beach , CA : Hermosa is a happening beach with some classic Californian surfing mixed with a hip laid back atmosphere .
The Hermosa area is packed full with restaurants , especially around the Pier Avenue area .
On top of this there is plenty of accommodation at affordable prices .
You can roam the streets and the beachfront connected wirelessly to the web via 802.11g , accessible through AT&T and iPass .
6. Cannes , France :
This upmarket destination on the southern French coast , famed for the annual film festival , has 3 beaches that offer wireless internet action as well as typical beach activities and services .
Plage L’evasion , Plage L’ondine and Plage Royale are all covered by at least 1 wireless provider .
If you are feeling lazy , you could theoretically order your mozzarella and vine tomato salad online and arrange delivery to your sun bed !
7. Naples , Italy : The Italian beach of Stabilimento Balneare Bagno Elena in Naples has a long a illustrious history .
Its long golden sands have attracted hundreds of thousands of tourists over the years and now they have another reason to travel , local authorities have blanketed the beach in a wireless network .
Now you can bask in the sun and soak up some microwaves .
8. Buenos Aires , Argentina : Famed for a cosmopolitan , fast - paced lifestyle , Buenos Aires known as the southern hemisphere ’s Paris .
If you are heading off to visit the Argentinian capital soon make sure to fit in some time on one of the many beaches lining the city shores , several of which have free and open WiFi internet access .
That ’s if you can bring yourself to lift a laptop after all the partying !
9. Waikiki Beach , Hawaii :
If you are planning a long haul trip , then Hawaii might should have crossed your mind .
If the white sands , clear warm water , year round sunshine and all - pervading beach lifestyle does n’t whet your appetite then WiFi access on Waikiki Beach should .
I ’m not sure if I could think of a better location to do a spot of emailing !
10 . Lake Ontario , Canada :
It might not have the sizzling temperatures of other beaches on this list but it does have a wireless network dating back to 2003 .
It also has fantastic fishing , sailing , cycling , hiking and plenty more to keep you active when you get bored surfing the net .
If you visit in the winter , browsing the internet and building up your bookmarks might be the only thing you can do !
Ben announced Nimbus which has been something he has wanted for Swing for a long time ….
a cross platform look and feel that Swing developers could be proud of .
Instead of playing catch up with native land , trying to munge the pixels to make them work , and always being ALMOST there , imagine if there was an innovative look and feel that worked the same everywhere .
That is the aim of Nimbus .

Story Highlights • Experts paint bleak picture of Iraq if U.S. troops fully withdraw
• Among potential scenarios : al Qaeda terror hub and larger regional conflict
• CNN analyst : " Saudi Arabia will not allow increasing Iranian dominance "
• U.S. general says early pullout would cause " huge vacuum "
Adjust font size :
( CNN ) -- Pulling U.S. forces from Iraq could trigger catastrophe , CNN analysts and other observers warn , affecting not just Iraq but its neighbors in the Middle East , with far - reaching global implications .
Sectarian violence could erupt on a scale never seen before in Iraq if coalition troops leave before Iraq 's security forces are ready .
Supporters of al Qaeda could develop an international hub of terror from which to threaten the West .
And the likely civil war could draw countries like Turkey , Saudi Arabia and Iran into a broader conflict .
President Bush vetoed a war spending bill Tuesday precisely because the Democrat - led Congress required the first U.S. combat troops to be withdrawn by October 1 with a goal of a complete pullout six months later .
Bush said such a deadline would be irresponsible and both sides are now working on new proposals -- which may have no pullout dates .
A rapid withdrawal of all U.S. troops would hurt America 's image and hand al Qaeda and other terror groups a propaganda victory that the United States is only a " paper tiger , " CNN terrorism analyst Peter Bergen said .
( Send us your reaction )
" It would also play into their strategy , which is to create a mini-state somewhere in the Middle East where they can reorganize along the lines of what they did in Afghanistan in the late ' 90s , " Bergen told CNN.com .
It was in Afghanistan where Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda allied with the Taliban , and were allowed to run terror bases and plan the September 11 , 2001 attacks against the United States .
Bergen says it is imperative that the United States not let that happen in Iraq .
" What we must prevent is central / western Iraq [ from ] becoming a Sunni militant state that threatens our interests directly as an international terror hub , " he said .
Don Shepperd , a retired Air Force major - general and military analyst for CNN , agreed that Sunni Muslim fighters who support al Qaeda would seek an enclave inside a lawless Iraq likely riven along sectarian lines into Shiite , Sunni and Kurdish regions .
There would be " increasing attempts by terrorists to establish a training sanctuary in Iraq , " Shepperd said .
That 's one of the reasons why a fast withdrawal will not happen , whatever the politicians say , the analysts predict .
( Watch why a radical Shiite cleric wants U.S. troops out )
" Everyone wants the troops home -- the Iraqis , the U.S. , the world -- but no one wants a precipitous withdrawal that produces a civil war , a bloodbath , nor a wider war in an unstable Mideast , " Shepperd said , adding that the image of the United States was important too .
" And we do not want a U.S that is perceived as having been badly defeated in the global war on terror or as an unreliable future ally or coalition partner . "
Shepperd , a veteran fighter pilot of the Vietnam War , has served as a CNN analyst of the Iraq war since it began .
Bergen was one of the first Western journalists to ever meet with bin Laden , and is considered a leading authority on al Qaeda .
Shepperd : Oil sector could suffer
Shepperd said Iraq 's neighbors would be drawn into the all - out civil war likely if U.S. forces left too quickly .
Iran could move in to further strengthen its influence in southern Iraq ; Turkey likely would move against the Kurds in the north ; and Saudi Arabia would be inclined to take action to protect Sunnis in western Iraq , he said .
The oil sector could also get hit hard , with Iran potentially mining the Persian Gulf and attempting to close the Straits of Hormuz , putting a stranglehold on oil flow , Shepperd says .
" Oil prices would skyrocket , " he said -- perhaps soaring from current prices of about $ 60 a barrel to more than $ 100 a barrel , with consequent rises at the gas pump .
And that could bring further trouble , Shepperd added .
" Saudi Arabia will not allow increasing Iranian dominance to endanger its regime and oil economy . "
On top of that , Iran could speed up its nuclear ambitions , causing a " daunting and depressing scenario " of a nuclear arms race in the Middle East with Saudi Arabia , Syria , Egypt and Turkey trying to get a nuclear bomb , Shepperd says .
Observers such as Jon Alterman , director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , say a wider Mideast conflict could be avoided .
But Alterman also fears that an Iraq left without U.S. support could turn into a center for international terrorism and a proxy battlefield for regional powers like Iran , Syria and Saudi Arabia .
" All the surrounding countries would think their interests are much better maintained not by directly sending troops but by continuing to send money and weapons to the people fighting that war , " he said .
" In my judgment , it would take decades for such an insurgency to quiet down . "
There are 120,000 Iraq soldiers now classified as trained by the U.S. military in Iraq , along with 135,000 police force members .
But the head of the Iraqi ground forces , Gen. Ali Ghiran - Majeed , recently told CNN that some of his soldiers do n't even get paid , and that on any given day one quarter of the force is on vacation .
For U.S. troops on the ground , the idea of withdrawal is vexing .
" I think it would cause a huge vacuum that the enemies of Iraq -- enemies of the government -- would take advantage of , " said U.S. Brig .
Gen. Dana Pittard , the commander of the Iraq Assistance Group .
Staff Sgt. Matthew St. Pierre is one U.S. soldier who 's come to the conclusion the United States cannot win the war , but he says he also fears the consequences of withdrawal .
" We are the buffer right now and when we pull out , the people who support us are going to feel the wrath , and the people who are against us ... they 're going to ultimately win .
And I think that 's unfortunate , " he said .
That is a prognosis that concerns many , though Shepperd sees a viable solution for Iraq , albeit one with a U.S. presence there for years to come .
" Done properly we should be in Iraq for years , not in a combat [ role ] , but an embedded advisory role , " he said .
CNN Correspondent Hugh Riminton in Baghdad and CNN.com Producer Wayne Drash in Atlanta contributed to this story .
Dear Steve Jobs ,
We would like to thank you for your public statements about Digital Restrictions Management ( DRM ) , and your pledge to drop DRM from iTunes if the four major record labels --- EMI , Warner , Universal and Sony - -- let you .
As you know , the Free Software Foundation 's campaign against DRM , DefectiveByDesign.org , has specifically targeted Apple since it launched in May 2006 .
As activists against DRM , we have supported these high - profile protests outside Apple stores in the US and in the UK because , as the largest purveyor of DRMed music , Apple carries a large part of the responsibility for the situation in which consumers now find themselves .
But Apple is under pressure not just from anti-DRM activists and from a consumer boycott of DRM , but also from consumer rights regulators in Europe who have declared iTunes 's DRM ( FairPlay ) illegal .
In Norway regulators have given you until October 1 , 2007 to open up iTunes or be forced to close down under penalty of daily fines .
Similar moves are being made by consumer regulators across Europe .
To many observers your blog pledge looks like a way to reduce pressure on Apple from these regulators , and head off calls from the industry to license FairPLay to other distributors .
It has been three weeks now since you published your pledge to drop DRM , and there have been many responses from commentators who have outlined actions you could take to back up your words .
The fact that you have not taken any action leads us to ask the question :
How genuine is your pledge ?
We have identified three ways you could show your sincerity about DRM .
Taking action on any one of these fronts would be a powerful demonstration that you mean business .
1 ) Drop DRM on iTunes for independent artists
Many independent artists and labels distribute their music through iTunes and many wish to do so without DRM , but you wo n't let them .
You could show good faith immediately by dropping DRM for those artists and labels .
This will make it clear which artists are actually locked to one of the four big labels , allowing your customers to avoid those labels and the burden of DRM .
Independent artists , who respect the desire of the fan to be free from DRM restrictions , will receive more support .
You can set the ethical example and be the first " major " to drop DRM , by freeing independent artists .
You have the direct power to do this .
2 ) Drop DRM on iTunes for Disney movies and video
In your blog post you say , " [ The ] alternative is to abolish DRMs entirely .
Imagine a world where every online store sells DRM - free music encoded in open licensable formats . "
That is a powerful image , and one that we and the free software movement share with you .
But why is your imagination limited to a world without DRM on music ?
You do n't once mention movies or video .
We understand that Apple is busy signing contracts with movie studios and TV networks to allow Apple to sell video and movies to iPod users .
These videos are delivered with DRM .
The arguments that you make in your blog apply equally to movies as they do to music .
In 2006 you sold Pixar to Disney , and in the process became the largest single shareholder in Disney and joined the board of directors .
Disney was the first to agree to distribute its movies through iTunes .
Disney is a major movie distributor but not a major music publisher .
You can set the example in the arena of video and movies .
Disney can be the first " major " to drop DRM .
You have the direct power to do this .
3 ) Take a public stand against DRM and legislation mandating DRM by funding a campaign to repeal the Digital Millenium Copyright Act's ( DMCA ) prohibitions .
In your blog you say that we could " ... abolish DRMs completely " , and that Apple would " embrace it in a heartbeat " .
These words are very close to calling for DRM to be eliminated .
We encourage you to make such a statement explicitly .
This is an important action because of the legislative threats we face .
Senator Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) , in this congressional session , has reintroduced the Platform Equality and Remedies for Rights Holders in Music Act ( PERFORM Act ) .
The Act would require webcasters who stream in MP3 ( or other non -DRM formats ) to impose DRM .
This would include the radio stations currently available through iTunes , which currently rely on MP3 streams .
The impact of DRM and the DMCA will have chilling effects on our freedom of speech .
In a world where our radio shows , TV shows , news , and political coverage , come laden with DRM --- because digital TV , digital radio and webstreaming have been mandated to use DRM --- we will have lost the legal right to make commentary using source materials .
Free speech through parody and quotation will have disappeared .
As someone who has imposed a DRM scheme on millions of people and made millions of dollars doing so , it is time for you to take a stand against DRM as unethical and as a threat to our freedoms .
You can set the example by calling for the elimination of DRM and by funding a campaign to repeal the DMCA 's prohibition on devices that overcome DRM .
You have the direct power to do this .
While we welcome your pledge to drop DRM , action has yet to follow .
Some changes you discuss will require the cooperation of other people in the media industry , but the three areas that we have outlined here do not .
You have the full power to allow independent artists to sell their music on iTunes without DRM , to remove DRM from Disney videos and movies , and to fund a campaign to repeal the DMCA 's prohibition on devices that overcome DRM .
We , the undersigned , call upon you to take action now .
Yours Truly ,

Dutch police have arrested three people for building a worldwide zombie network of more than 100,000 PCs used to launch internet attacks on companies and to hack into bank and Paypal accounts .
The main suspect , a 19 year - old man , and his alleged accomplices , a 22 year - old and a 27 year - old , were collared in raids on their homes .
Police seized " several computers , documents , a bank account , bare cash and a sports car " .
More arrests are expected .
The compromised PCs were hacked using a trojan horse , called W 32 .
Toxbot , according to the police , who say that " some thousands " of the victims were based in the Netherlands .
Investigators have identified at least one distributed denial of service ( DDoS ) attack , targeting an unnamed American company , emanating from the zombie botnet .
DDoS attacks are often used by extortionists to unleash a barrage of computer - generated request to victim websites to cripple their operations .
Online gambling firms and web retailers are typical victims .
The suspects are also thought to have hacked into a " large number of PayPal and eBay accounts , enabling them to order several goods over the internet , without actually paying for them " .
The gang controlling the zombie botnet played cat and mouse with the anti-virus vendors , Dutch police say : " The Toxbot registers all keyboard actions of the infected computers and sends this information to the cyber - criminals .
Anti-virus software has been available for some time .
The hackers , however , frequently revised the virus , in a catch up game with the anti virus producers " .
The botnet has now been dismantled , courtesy of GOVCERT.NL , the Computer Emergency Response Team of the Dutch government , in tandem with XS4 All Internet and other unidentified providers . ®
The date for the auction of more than 40 images of the great man , with his paunch , five o'clock shadow and luxuriant eyebrows , could not have been chosen better .
During the 1790s , Fox resisted twin attacks on individual liberty and the independence of Parliament which are eerily similar in motive and pretext to the ones we face today .
Initially , Fox 's campaign seemed hopeless .
Following the execution of Louis XVI , William Pitt the Younger introduced a number of emergency measures including sedition laws and the suspension of habeas corpus .
Fox opposed them , arguing that the terror in France did not pose a real threat and that Pitt and the king were using it to limit the freedom of the individual and Parliament .
It was a power grab by the executive , exactly as we see happening today .
He told the Commons : ' All the true constitutional watchfulness of England was dead to the only real danger ... we are come to the moment when the question is , whether we shall give to the king , that is the executive government , complete power over our thoughts . '
Fox was defeated by 290 - 50 and lost subsequent votes , but he kept the flame of liberty alive while most of the political establishment were busy giving in to Pitt and their own hysteria .
That moment Fox talked about is with us again .
There are many dedicated libertarians in Parliament , but the majority of MPs seem content to go along with the government , as though this loss of liberty and standards was a natural outcome of technology and modern life .
Instead of standing up for the people 's interest , MPs are now aping the contempt shown by the executive .
Nowhere is this better seen than in the support for David Maclean 's private member 's bill to exempt MPs and the Lords from the Freedom of Information Act .
If passed , it will allow MPs to keep their expenses and correspondence with ministries secret .
This maggot of a bill has crept on to the floor of the chamber while the front benches have looked the other way .
It was heroically talked out once by MPs like Mark Fisher , Norman Baker , David Winnick and Richard Shepherd , all decent men who work tirelessly in Parliament and without much thanks .
But despite their efforts , the bill returns with reinforcements of the living dead on 18 May .
David Maclean is a former Conservative chief whip who likes to be known as a straight - talking guy .
But he has hardly said a word to the media about his bill .
Why ?
Because it is indefensible .
The hypocrisy of pretending the measure is to protect constituents ' confidentiality does not seem to bother David Cameron .
Last week , I asked his office if this was an indication of the party 's respect for public accountability and was met with silence .
Little wonder that the Guardian 's recent poll showed that support for both the major parties has dropped and that one in three voters plans to take their votes elsewhere at the local elections .
Voters have picked up a vibration from the Conservatives that once in office they would have no more respect for the people than the Labour front bench .
Just as Margaret Thatcher influenced Labour in the Eighties and Nineties , so Labour now skews the standards of the new , open - collared Tories .
This may explain Cameron 's failure to make that great speech about Labour 's attack on individual liberty and rights .
David Davies , Dominic Grieve , Malcolm Rifkind and Ken Clarke have all had a creditable go , but the leader has danced round the open goal smiling , tying his boot laces and remarking on the weather .
Why does he hesitate ?
The analysis has been done , the bills are on the statute book for all to see .
For the voters next Thursday , here are some of the liberties and rights you 've lost or are in the process of losing :
Your communications are no longer private .
Under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act , 500,000 emails and pieces of mail are intercepted every year .
Your home is no longer your castle .
A report by the Centre for Policy Studies reveals that the state and its agencies now have 266 powers to enter your home without a warrant .
Labour has done more than any other government in the last 50 years to extend these powers .
A new act will mean that bailiffs may enter your home to collect traffic penalties and eventually to make good the vast number of fines imposed on those who refuse to bow to the ID card bill .
You may not demonstrate within a kilometre of Parliament Square without first asking a policeman 's permission , not even with a blank placard or a quote from George Orwell
Terror legislation means that suspects may be held for up to 28 days without charge .
This is punishment without a normal court deciding that the law is broken .
Control orders have the same result .
Foreign suspects may not instruct their own legal representatives or learn of the evidence against them .
You are about to surrender your privacy forever .
The ID card bill will set up databases to record all your important transactions and allow scores of government agencies to monitor your life without your knowledge .
Journeys by road are being recorded by ANPR cameras and the information kept for two years .
Defendants ' rights are being reduced by the day .
Hearsay evidence is allowed in Asbo cases .
The proposed serious crime prevention orders will also make hearsay evidence admissible and give courts almost unlimited powers to impose conditions on a person before he or she has been found guilty by normal court proceedings .
Trial by jury is suspended when there is a risk of jury - tampering or in complicated fraud cases where the jury is held to be too stupid to decide whether someone is telling the truth .
The Carter reforms on legal aid result in pressure to plead guilty .
Labour has introduced some 3,000 new offences .
Under the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act , if arrested , you are now required to be photographed and provide a DNA sample and fingerprints .
These are kept by the state regardless of whether charges are brought or not .
I could go on about the 33,000 people being stopped and searched under terror laws each year and how these laws are being used to pursue ordinary criminal matters , about the use of public order laws to police people 's opinions , but I am conscious that I have written about these things before .
Still , it 's no small matter that due process , privacy , legal safeguards , the freedom to demonstrate , to write and move about without being observed or obstructed by the state are all under attack .
There is far too little anger about all this .
Few grasp that in this moment of unusual self - obsession and fear , there is a takeover in progress .
We are reaching a point where democracy and liberty can no longer be said to be the loose synonyms they once were .
To reverse that process , we should use our votes on Thursday and , with something of Fox 's passion , tell politicians and the executive that we know what they have been up to .

Sounds like that clip I posted yesterday was some of the stronger material , god help us :
This show was meant to be a conservative version of “ The Daily Show . ”
It is a botch .
“ The 1/2 Hour News Hour ” does not comment on what is happening ; it simply takes swipes at people .
These people include Howard Dean , Hillary Clinton , Dennis Kucinich , Barack Obama and Ed Begley Jr. Other joke topics are the ACLU , Time magazine , children ’s books and global warming .
Laughter , of an awfully canned variety , greets all the gags .
Nothing happening on screen justifies these outbursts .
Hey , I ’m all for a good dig at the high and the mighty .
But these satirists fall short of hitting their targets with wit , timeliness or punch …
Fox News Channel will offer a second episode at 10 p.m. March 4 .
If we ’re lucky , we ’ll never hear of this dreadful show again .
History of Sex and Sexuality from 1484 - 1555
About the history of sex and sexuality from 1484 to 1555 including trivia about syphilis , the sistine chapel and more .
UNCENSORED HIGHLIGHTS IN THE HISTORY OF SEX 1484 Pope Innocent VIII was elected .
He was nicknamed " the Honest " because he was the first pope to acknowledge his illegitimate children publicly .
1492 Syphilis made its premier appearance in the Old World .
While some physicians theorize that Columbus carried the disease back from America , others have suggested that venereal organisms had long been in Europe but in a far less potent form .
In any event , an epidemic swept Europe beginning in the mid-1490s , sparked by the French assault on Naples .
Thousands of warring French and Neapolitan troops were stricken with what became widely known as the French disease , to the chagrin of the French monarch , Charles VIII , and the troops ensured its spread elsewhere upon disengaging from battle and returning home .
The scourge hit Germany in the summer of 1495 , Holland and England by 1496 , India and the Middle East by 1498 , and China by 1505 .
In 1500 Cesare Borgia was stricken with genital ulcers .
In the early 1500s the Italian poet Girolamo Fracastoro introduced the word syphilis in his epic poem " Syphilis , or The French Disease , " and the German Ulrich von Hutten dedicated a graphically detailed account of his own syphilitic deterioration to a Roman Catholic cardinal .
1529 During Cardinal Wolsey 's trial for treason , he was accused of giving Henry VIII syphilis by persistently whispering in the king 's ear .
1532 After nearly five years of obstinately rejecting King Henry VIII 's advances , Anne Boleyn finally allowed him to seduce her .
He had already had an affair with her sister Mary and - it was strongly rumored - one with her mother .
He certainly liked the family ; his fifth wife was Anne 's cousin .
1535 An ecclesiastical tribunal in Toledo , Spain , found a Catholic priest named Valdelamar guilty of rape , blasphemy , consorting with prostitutes , and extorting the favors of a young woman in exchange for absolution and sentenced him to a mere 30 - day house arrest and a fine of two ducats .
Such leniency for debauching clerics was said to be commonplace in the early 16th century .
1542 Andrew Boorde , in his A Dyetary of Health . . . the boke for a good husbande to lerne , solemnly warned that eating lettuce killed sexual desire : " Lettyse doth extynct veneryous actes . "
He offered an antidote , saying that figs " stere a man to veneryous actes , for they doth urge and increase the sede of generacyon . "
Boorde later became Bishop of Chichester , where , probably due to eating too many figs , he was publicly defrocked for keeping three prostitutes in his chambers .
1546 Martin Luther died .
According to his Table Talk , " women ought to stay at home ; the way they were created indicates this , for they have broad hips and a wide fundament to sit upon to keep house and bear and raise children . "
1552 Sir Walter Raleigh was born .
Long after , while he was having dinner with his son-also named Walter - and a few friends , the younger Walter drunkenly revealed that he had that morning visited a whore , who had kicked him out , saying , " Your father lay with me but an hower ago . "
Sir Walter promptly boxed his son's ears .
1555 Pope Paul IV ordered the removal of Michelangelo 's paintings from the Sistine Chapel on the grounds that they were obscene .
After a storm of protest , a compromise was agreed upon and the pope ordered the naked figures ( including all the angels and the Virgin Mary ) in The Last Judgment to have clothes painted on them .
Michelangelo's pupil Daniele da Volterra executed the task and afterwards was commonly known as " the Breeches Maker . "
At the end of an average eight - hour workday , the fingers have walked 16 miles over the keys and have expended energy equal to the lifting of 1 1 /4 tons .

And that ’s just for a piddly eight hour workday !
What about developers who go home and write more code for fun ?
Around three years ago I wrote a post titled The Real Pain of Software Development Part 1 in which I talked about my experience with Repetitive Stress Injury ( RSI ) .
Because of the pain of typing at that time , I never really got around to writing part 2 until now .
So why am I bringing up this subject after all these years ?
Yesterday , I was reminded again about just how important developers need to take ergonomics in their daily work life .
As I wrote in that post , years ago , I suffered from a lot of pain when writing code .
I started going to Physical and Occupational therapy which helped immensely .
During that time I went out and bought the best chair I could find , despite the high cost .
( Note that the best chair for me might not be the best chair for you due to differences in body types .
Jeff Atwood mentions the Steel Case Leapas his favorite in a post that highlights the importance of a good chair to a developer ’s productivity . )
Along with the chair , I bought a good keyboard , a keyboard tray with an articulating arm , and a trackball and made sure it was configured in a way that was comfortable for me and ergonomically sound .
And over time , I got better .
In fact , I got much better .
At that point I vowed to never to skimp on the tools I needed as a developer .
As Jeff points out in his Programmer ’s Bill of Rights ,
It ’s unbelievable to me that a company would pay a developer $ 60 - $ 100 k in salary , yet cripple him or her with terrible working conditions and crusty hand - me - down hardware .
This makes no business sense whatsoever .
And yet I see it all the time .
It ’s shocking how many companies still do n’t provide software developers with the essential things they need to succeed .
I realized that not every company will follow through on this reasonable advice , so I took it upon myself to make sure I have what I need personally .
In the past several years , I ’ve worked alot more from home due to my open source contributions .
In the past two years , I worked full time from home .
I made sure that I had the best quality setup for me possible .
Better than any other employer ever provided .
To the items I mentioned before , I added two very bright and sharp LCD monitors which reduce eye strain .
This setup is finely tuned for me and the way I work .
Which brings me back to yesterday .
It was my first day of work at my new company and naturally , the workstation has not had the opportunity to be configured by me , through no fault of my employer .
My requests for a new keyboard , trackball , and keyboard tray were all approved .
I plan to bring in my own chair because I have two Neutral Posture chairs at home .
I do n’t screw around with my equipment any more .
Unfortunately , after just one day I am having trouble sleeping due to pain in my hand and back .
Shoot , I need to get up in three hours !
Yeah , I know what you are thinking .
What a freaking wuss !
But no amount of macho posturing changes the fact that some people , for better or worse , are more prone to these type of injuries than others .
I wish I could remember his name , but there ’s a very famous software developer world renowned who cannot type for himself .
He has others type for him .
I ’m sure someone will remind me .
What my Occupational therapist taught me is that my recovery is based on a delicate balance .
Upsetting that balance can bring back a lot of pain .
In my case , I will never fully be free from pain while working .
But through therapy , I learned techniques to reduce the pain as well as deal with it better .
As fortune would have it , this was around the time I received a private office , so it was less of a spectacle when I would get on the floor with a foam roller and do my stretches every couple of hours .
The pain had gotten so bad , there were days I could barely type a line of code , instead finding ways to be productive without coding .
I started to wonder about my future , or lack thereof , as a software developer .
My recovery allowed me to not only work through a normal day productively , but actually start putting in extra coding effort in the evenings as I started to contribute to RSS Bandit and eventually start the Subtext Project .
I became even more productive than before , working day and night at the computer .
A stark contrast to when I could barely type a single method of code .
I could never have started Subtext if it were n’t for the therapy .
For that , I am eternally grateful to the occupational / physical therapists at UCLA medical center .
So if you experience a lot of pain while developing , do n’t be a hero .
Be smart about it and seek information and help .
The pain could be the thing holding you back from your potential .

If these Bushco fascists are spying on political figures overseas to this extent , .. just imagine what they are doing to eavesdrop , .. wire tap , .. and blackmail their political opponents here in the good old USA .
Parabolic antennas , .. eavesdropping microphones , .. GPS in cell phones , .. NSA , .. records of , .. land phones , .. cells , .. computers , .. ingoing / outgoing communication traffic .
Same with media reporters communications traffic .
These fascists have no respect for privacy , .. ethics or rule of law .
These Rethuglicans do n't just have the fix on the voting machines , .. they have the make on the Democratic Party candidates , .. no wonder they win election all the time , .. they have unethically stolen them each and every instance .
They may well be spying on their political opponents as they plan and battle for winning an election right here at home .

It 's getting soooo obvious , that people like this are murdered , and did not die naturally .
I know about 2 people my entire life who died unexpectedly before their time , that 's like several decades .
Then , you see about 10 Enron - related people die in a year , and then things like this article , it 's easy to put 2 and 2 together , we 're not idiots .
It 's just that the MSM does n't ( purposely ) link these things together .
How many people , your ENTIRE life , do you know that committed suicide ?
How many people your ENTIRE life do you personally know , who jumped off a bridge ?

Just hope
Mike is save where he is .
These people will stop at NOTHING .
They pretended that the UK bombing plot was to cause " unimaginable " death , but that is nothing compared to the false flag attack they will pull off if they feel they need it to hold power .
The only question is when they feel they are losing their grip .
Will it be when their theft of the 2006 election does n't go as smoothly as scripted , and millions of Americans actually DO forgo the new episode of LOST to take to the streets on November 8 ?
Or will they just use that as an opportunity to put some of their most vocal and active enemies into camps ?
Maybe they will wait until October of 2008 and use it to " cement " their control of government once and for all .
All we have to fear is the Republicans , the DINOs , and the corporate cabal that controls them all .

I was trying to click on the link Ericsson 's official response from the article , and oddly , the entire site is down .
The google " cache " of the site 's homepage did n't want to load either .
Built - in spyware really bothers me .
This is a good example of why it should not be in the phones .
Ericsson thought they had a handle on it , but someone was able to exploit it for so long undetected .
Whose to say the phones themselves can't be exploited as bugs , when no calls are even being made .
It seems that there is no safe and secure means of communication anymore .
Even US mail can be opened routinely by Dept. of homeland security .

Joseph Thankyou for posting this .
I have sent out copies of the print version via email along with copies of Brads and WP 's articles .
If we all send these articles to a few people the information may start to get out .
Use the send page by email function in IE .

Freedom is under assualt everywhere .
Whistleblowers ( against the gov't ) are especially vulnerable .
Even potential whistleblowers should watch out .
The US gov't is about to step it up .
They already detain protestors in cages , pressure Amazon ( and Wikipedia ) to drop books like " America Deceived " , and start illegal wars based on lies .
Soon , another 9/11 will occur ( nukes ? ) and the frightened masses will beg for the ' safety ' of One World Gov't .

President Eisenhower DIRECTLY warned the American people in his farewell address to the nation that the number one single greatest threat to our republic is from within , from the military industrial complex .
. . ( Read President Eisenhower 's last address ! )
Both Presidents Eishenhower and Kennedy were determined to dismantle and wipe out the CIA and their black ops criminal syndicate .
President Kennedy removed the most senior conspirators from their positions --- a few months later , they assassinated our President before the whole world .
On November 22 , 1963 , the legitiate federal government of the United States of America was overthrown in this coup .
Unfortunately , people are so indoctrinated and brainwashed into the Hegalian dialectic paradigm they have created over the last 50 years that people do n't recognize that ALL MAJOR POLITICAL PARTIES ARE CONTROLLED AND ARE SUBSERVIENT TO THE NEW WORLD FOURTH REICH ORDER NAZI CABAL !!
Whether Republicans or Democrats " hold power " in Washington , or any of the political parties in Britain and around the world for that matter , THE NEW WORLD FOURTH REICH FASCIST SOCIALIST ORDER ADVANCES !
From Communist China to America , the ultra- powerful wealthy elite control and manipulate all the chess pieces to manipulate the masses .
9/11 --- the Nazis murdered over 3,000 Americans !
They murdered 168 people , including many children in a daycare center when they blew up the Murrah building ( including the torture and execution murder of Sheriff deputy Tyweaky months later ) .
The massive NAZI getapo assault on the Branch Davidians ' home with automatic weapons and military incendiary grenades .
PAY ATTENTION TO THE PROPAGANDA AND DISINFORMATION " CHATTER " COMING FROM THE NAZI PROPAGANDA MACHINE ---
They are laying the groundwork to execute an even bigger " 9/11 " style assault against the American people .
KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN AND YOUR CAMERAS AND VIDEO CAMERAS CAPTURING ANYTHING REMOTELY SUSPICIOUS , PARTICULARLY AROUND POPULATION CENTERS ---
These murderous thugs follow the same spirit and occultic death cult mindset that consumed Lenin , Stalin , Hitler , Mousolini , Mao , and the most prominent British and American wealthy eltitists .
They laid the foundation and initiated both world wars I and II , and have provoked and prolonged most of the world 's wars and conflicts throughout the world , including Korea , Vietnam , the establishment of communist tyranny as well as nationalistic fascist SOCIALISM .
Learn the real facts of history , and you will understand just how dangerous an enemy the world is facing .
The evil of communism and European fascism ( which arose out of Britain , Germany and America ) did not die with the death of the Darwinian Marxist communist and nationalist Darwinian Marxist fascist socialist thugs --- the poisonous mindset and worldview is even stronger now that before - only now they have the most dangerous technology ever imagined to use against humanity to destroy it .

There is only ONE way to stop the tyranny that now threatens every American ---
1. Remove EVERY INCUMBANT FROM OFFICE
2 . Have every state in the union recall their congressmen and senators back to remain in their respective states and conduct business under the auspices and review of their state legislature and governor .
3 VOTE IN ONLY TRULY INDEPENDENT CITIZEN CANDIDATES WHO ARE UNAFFILIATED WITH EITHER THE REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRATIC PARTIES .
4. Restore the rule of constitutional Law over all government throughout the US .
5. Initiate full public investigations into all government activities over the last 60 years , particularly any agency that engaged in espionage , spying and black ops as well as private businesses such as the IRS and the criminal syndicate , the Federal Reserve that has bankrupted the American Republic and turned the wealthiest nation into an impoverished debtor nation unable to recover from it 's insurmountable mountain of exponentially increasing debt .
6. Prosecute ALL individuals who engaged in or are continuing to engage in criminal , seditionist and treasoous activities or who has aided in or engaged in sedition and treason to overthrow the Constitutional republic of the United States , including impeachment and removal from office or the bench , PARTICULARLY THOSE INVOLVED IN THE CONSPIRACY TO FORM THE SOVIET - STYLE " NORTH AMERICAN UNION " ( the notorious attempt to overthrow the US , Canada and Mexico and impose an unelected and unaccountable New World Fourth Reich fascist Order dictatorship over all three nations .
The sovereign people of all three nations must rise up to thwart this threat to their respective nations before the NAZIs secure their grip over the nations with their fast emerging total surveillance fascist police state .

At least on the account of the Greek Vodafone scandal , this guy makes some serious mistakes , where he states : " This is , by any measure , a troubling admission — especially since Ericsson manufactures many mobile phones used in the United States .
Vodafone insists they were never informed of this " feature " in Ericsson phones , ... " .
EVERYBODY PANIC !
BULL !
It is not about ( Sony ) Ericsson phones , there never was " a feature " in Ericsson 's phones , it is the Ericsson telephony infrastructure in the mobile operator 's hubs that was infected with bugging software .
Moreover he mis-spells " Vodafone " on every occasion .
When he says at the end " Are Ericsson cell phones the only ones with the built - in spy technology ?

The top US commander in Iraq admitted yesterday that the conflict would " get harder before it gets easier " , providing further ammunition for Democrats determined to face down George Bush in their constitutional clash over the Iraq war .
Hours before the Senate passed legislation ordering troops to start leaving Iraq by October , General David Petraeus said the conflict was " the most complex and challenging I have ever seen " .
Gen Petraeus , who was put in charge of the Baghdad troop " surge " to pacify the Iraqi capital , warned of the enormous commitment and sacrifice facing the US in Iraq .
His downbeat assessment , in contrast with Mr Bush 's optimistic statements , stiffened the resolve of Democrats in Congress pushing for an early withdrawal of US troops .
Yesterday the Senate followed the House of Representatives in backing legislation that calls for most US troops to be out by spring 2008 .
The bill is expected to land on Mr Bush 's table on Tuesday , the fourth anniversary of the speech in which he prematurely declared an end to hostilities .
Under the legislation billions of dollars of military funding will be withheld unless Mr Bush sets in motion the withdrawal timetable .
The White House , which has described the bill as a timetable for surrender , reiterated yesterday that Mr Bush would veto it .
As the Democrats do not have the two - thirds majority needed to overturn the veto , a stand - off is inevitable .
Democratic members of Congress claim the " surge " is doomed to failure , a scepticism shared by some Republicans .
Gen Petraeus returned to Washington this week to brief the president and members of Congress .
Although he agreed with Mr Bush that there had been some improvements in the two months since the arrival of US reinforcements , he also stressed that the achievements " have not come without sacrifice " .
He noted the increasing use of car bombs and suicide attacks has " led to greater US losses " and Iraqi military casualties .
Suicide bombers claimed the lives of nine US paratroopers this week , while last week witnessed the deadliest single suicide bombing in Baghdad , when 140 died in a market attack .
Asked how long the US would have to remain in Iraq , he said he could not anticipate what the level " might be some years down the road " .
Nancy Pelosi , the Democratic House speaker , said : " The sacrifices borne by our troops and their families demand more than the blank cheques the president is asking for , for a war without end . "
In reality , the Democrats will not choke off funds to US troops in the field .
But they will try to force Mr Bush to compromise .
One route being discussed by Democrats would be to set benchmarks for the Iraqi government to tackle sectarian violence ; failure to act fast enough would trigger withdrawal .
One step the Democrats are insisting upon would be for the Shia -led Iraqi government to agree a fair formula for sharing oil revenues with other groups .

Erlang ships with a quite nice Erlang mode for Emacs .
Editing Erlang code is actually the only thing I ever use Emacs for .
Setting it up is only slightly painful .
For a default R11B - 3 installation your .emacs will look like this :
( setq load - path ( cons " /usr/local/lib/erlang/lib/tools -2.5.3/emacs " load - path ) ) ( setq erlang - root - dir " /usr/local/lib/erlang " ) ( setq exec - path ( cons " /usr/local/lib/erlang / bin " exec - path ) ) ( require ' erlang - start ) ( defvar inferior - erlang - prompt - timeout t )
The first set of expressions sets up Emacs to find erlang.el and the path to your Erlang installation .
The second expression tells the emacs mode not to wait for an Erlang prompt .
This is my only annoyance with the mode .
Without this defvar , when you send a command from Emacs to Erlang it 'll hang for 60 seconds ( or until you hit Ctrl - G ) if there was any IO since the last prompt ( e.g. an error_logger report or an io : format call ) .
The caveat with this setting is that the first command you issue ( the one that causes the inferior shell to get started ) will get sent before Erlang is started and get lost .
Issuing the first command twice is a small price to pay in this case , because the lock - up is annoying as all hell when you 're in the middle of the compile / play cycle .
Using the Erlang mode is pretty straightforward .
Tab does the right thing for indentation and is a good way to check to see if your code makes sense syntactically .
If it does n't indent to the right place , you probably screwed up .
The electric stuff like comma and semicolon are great and save you a good deal of typing .
The only command I really use is C-c C-k which compiles and reloads the current module into the running Erlang inferior shell .
It will start one if one is n't already running ( C - c C - z just starts the shell ) .
The other gripe I have is that when you get compiler errors sometimes clicking the line numbers takes you to the wrong line in the source file , but that 's a relatively minor annoyance for me .
Restarting seems to fix that ( until it breaks again ) and normally I 'm not fighting too many compiler errors :)
So why hang out here ?
For many reasons .
Because it amuses me to diss people 's little backwards - thinking ideas .
Because I 'm outraged that people waste others ' time with their stupid and provincial ideas .
Because I am furious that smug jerks exist who rationalize and excuse technically and socially obsolete ideas .
Because I think people who spend all their time in vague pronouncements and useless navel grazing deserve to be verbally punished for it .
And I 'm not adverse to administering the punishment .

Moved from RaisingSocialCosts cuz it is n't really on - topic .
Richard , you can't just reject ideas out of hand and just move on with SoapBoxing .
And you certainly can't reject them so viciously with low - ball rhetoric .
If you seriously think that people are Dictionary : deranged , how can you justify talking to them ?
Moreover , why would they respond to you ?
Really , please watch the manner in which you conduct yourself .
This is n't the best place for you to so forcefully platform your ideas about the social contract either because it is n't a political discussion forum .
( Recording them is another issue .
Contrast " SocialCapitalism " , which is remarkably less " in your face " than your writing . )
I definitely do n't appreciate the insulting tone you default to .
Do you notice anyone else here talking like that ?
Lurk before you leap , if you please .
But it certainly is ( for example ) a place to discuss how the social contract is constructed .
What events take place to build one , and how they shape the spaces in which we live and work .
The social contract is n't decided by those in power , but it is affected by them .
( cf. CollectiveIntelligence )
Perhaps you disagree that the social contract in Canada is more populist than corporatist , but that 's really just case history here .
Certainly I 'm an elite because I have traction here as the Editor .
This is the referent power I earn by managing this space and doing a good enough job that people are following the general groove that I set out last year .
I attempt to be less of a GodKing than you imply .
I think I do a good job at that .
But to reduce my elitishness , note that I have consciously not acquired the administer password for the site .
This challenge is what makes MeatballWiki fun for me in particular .
How do I keep this place on track with just my hands , heart , and mind alone ?
( By the way , have you ever managed before ? )
The answer includes such things as constructive engagement .
For instance , I 'm sitting here listening to you are n't I ?
And so is Alex , if you had noticed between cutting into him so harshly .
Play nice .
Get into the BarnRaising feeling here .
It 's fun .
( Why do n't you try some constructive engagement yourself ? )
By the way , we do n't live all that far away from each other , y'know .
-- SunirShah
I honestly do n't see what the subjects of RaisingSocialCosts and Property Damage have to do with Wiki .
( I also do n't see how they could fail to be political . )
Nor do I see any resemblance ( or even a semblance of resemblance ) between your position as editor of MeatballWiki and , say , the position of Prime Minister Of Canada .
Nor between you and JeanChretien ? or ConradBlack ?.
If there were such a connection then I do see that my discussing the legitimacy of different ways to attack the current political system would be deeply offensive to you , but I do n't see any connection .
If you 're fishing for reassurance that Meatball incorporates a high degree of egalitarianism and freedom , and that attacking or trashing it is low - ball and unacceptable then I 'm more than willing to say it .
Consider it said ! :-)
On the SocialContract as it relates to BarnRaising .
SocialContract theory is obsolete because it has been superceded by human rights theory .
The theory that practical social contracts are just and moral has been replaced with the theory that ideal social contracts are just and moral .
Again , I do not see how such a question has anything to do with Wiki or Meatball .
It does have a lot to do with politics because many people justify current economic , social and political arrangements by an appeal to social contract theory instead of human rights .
Again , I do not believe I am soapboxing , or if I am that what I am doing is out of bounds for this page .
From the title of this page and its initial content , I received the distinct impression the subject was political and moral / social .
I also agree I should n't have been as harsh on the subject as I have been .
If you believed that I was attacking Wikis , or Meatball or you personally then I admire your restraint .
-- RichardKulisz
I 'm basically just asking you to chill out .
But compliments are fun too . ;)
These topics are important to wikis and other online spaces because they occur on wikis and other online spaces .
Certainly PropertyDamage has occured to send a message .
Consider the highly politicized " reduction " of Wiki : RichardDrake in April 2000 to demonstrate how ludicrously annoying his little Wiki : WikiReductionist movement had become .
Similarly , I 've seen a wiki overrun by its membership in some bizarre RaisingSocialCosts failure .
Also , in some vague large picture scheme in my head , I see how they connect .
I 'll guess you 'll have to trust me on that .
I suppose it 's because part of MeatballWiki is a very off - the - cuff , practical online civics HOWTO .

PayPal Mobile soft launches
Mar 22 2006 - 12:06 PM
ET | SMS
PayPal has quietly launched a new mobile enabled version of its fund trading service ( we hinted it was coming last month ) .
Customers must first activate the mobile component of PayPal by heading online .
After that you 'll be able to send money and check your account status by texting 729725 ( PAYPAL ) .
Security is obviously an issue , but every transaction with PayPal Mobile requires a PIN that you set up when activating the mobile features .
PayPal will also come back and ask for confirmation via an automated call for each transaction .
During the sign up process PayPal will call the phone number you set up to make sure it 's you .
It 's automated and you need to input your PIN and if it matches what you put online your account will be activated .
There has been no official announcement yet and it appears things are still changing and slightly buggy ( we had to hunt around a bit to find the right place to sign up ) .
Currently the service is only for customers in the US , Canada or UK .
[ via PSFK ]
From the website :
PayPal mobile allows you to :
send payments receive notifications of the receipt of payments access account details carry out other payment related services as may be advised to you from time to time
Send a text message to PAYPAL ( 729725 ) with the desired amount and the phone number to send it to .

TOKYO , April 17  A group of Japanese researchers on Tuesday publicly challenged Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe ’s denials that Japan ’s military coerced women into sexual slavery during World War II , citing reports compiled by Allied investigators immediately after the war .
The reports , based partly on interrogations of Japanese prisoners , were originally submitted to the Tokyo war crimes trials , which ended in 1948 , as evidence of atrocities by Japan during its wartime expansion across Asia .
The reports include accounts of Japanese soldiers and sailors rounding up foreign women for use as sex slaves , euphemistically known here as comfort women .
Mr. Abe and other conservatives have repeatedly said there was no evidence that Japan ’s military had a direct hand in forcing women into sexual slavery .
Many Japanese conservatives have cited the lack of corroborating official documents to dismiss the testimony of former sex slaves , who started coming forward in the 1990s to tell their stories .
While the evidence presented Tuesday was not new , the group ’s members said they felt obliged to respond to Mr. Abe ’s denials .
The group ’s public rebuttal of Mr. Abe was a rare protest in a country where the prime minister ’s remarks had stirred little outcry .
The reaction has been much stronger in the rest of Asia , where memories of Japanese aggression remain raw , highlighting Tokyo ’s isolation on war history .

The ReactOS operating system has been in development for over eight years and aims to provide users with a fully functional and Windows - compatible distribution under the GPL license .
ReactOS comes with its own Windows 2003 - based kernel and system utilities and applications , resulting in an environment identical to Windows , both visually and internally .
More than just an alternative to Windows , ReactOS is a powerful platform for academia , allowing students to learn a variety of skills useful to software testing , development and management , as well as providing a rich and clean implementation of Windows NT , with a kernel compatible to published internals book on the subject .
This talk will introduce the ReactOS project , as well as the various software engineering challenges behind it .
The building platform and development philosophies and utilities will be shown , and attendees will grasp the vast amount of effort and organization that needs to go into building an operating system or any other similarly large project .
The speaker will gladly answer questions related to his background , experience and interests and information on joining the project , as well as any other related information .
Slides from the talk are available here .
Biography
Alex Ionescu is currently studying in Software Engineering at Concordia University in Montreal , Quebec and is a Microsoft Technical Student Ambassador .
He is the lead kernel developer of the ReactOS Project and project leader of TinyKRNL .
He regularly speaks at Linux and Open Source conferences around the world and will be a lecturer at the 8th International Free Software Forum in Brazil this April , as well as providing hands - on workshops and lectures on Windows NT internals and security to various companies .
WHILE driving through rural South Carolina recently , I was surprised to find that nearly every home I passed had a sign advertising some cottage industry .
Each offered a range of services from “ small welding projects ” to “ bikini waxes ” ( though no one I surveyed had ever patronised that particular business ) .
These businesses were not necessarily limited to modest homes ; it spanned a spectrum of income levels .
Cottage industry has traditionally been a building block of economic development .
In industrialised countries it was the first form of manufacturing and paved the way for the industrial revolution .
Home production has traditionally been common to low income , less skilled workers and its popularity counter cyclical .
When the economy provides less jobs workers become more likely to engage in home production .
In developed economies home production is generally inefficient .
Take the at home bikini waxer , whom I assume is female .
Performing bikini waxes from her home , on a back country road , limits the scale of her business .
If she set up a commercial shop in a central location she would attract more customers and have the space to employ others .
Working at home saves overhead , but limits the scope of her production ; the increased volume means commercial waxer will be able to charge less and serve more customers .
But does this hold in the internet era ?
For waxing , yes .
But for other home production businesses , not so much .
Through forums such as ebay , their client base has been extended to the global community .
It is still unclear what the impact of this will be on the labour market .
The number of workers who claimed to be engaging in home self employment , as of 2003 , still seemed to vary with the business cycle .
This may not reflect the scope of the industry , because many home entrepreneurs have their home business to supplement other income .
But it does seem to be the case that women and the elderly have become more likely to become self - employed .
It will be interesting to see what the impact on the labour market will be .
On the one hand cottage industry provides income to those who normally may not work such as retirees , and women engaged full time in child care .
It also encourages more entrepreneurial activity which can spur growth .
On the other hand , workers who forgo other employment opportunities will not receive the level of benefits they would get with a traditional employer ; and economically , their labour will not reap the productivity benefits of scale and network effects .
We Can Remember it for you Wholesale ... Pictures jog Your Memory .
This is the premise of Memory TV and also our new test variations .... good thing we 've filed the patents Scientists have found that Alzheimer 's sufferers who were given a " human black box " , have shown significant improvements in long - term memory .
The ' human black box ' called ' SenseCam ' is a square black camera 3in square and half an inch think , and is worn around the neck .
It has a series of sensors that trigger a fish - eye lens to take pictures in response to changes such as motion and light variation , gestures or heat from a person in front of the camera .
The research was conducted by Microsoft .
As part of the study it was found that a patient , who without the camera , had virtually no recall of events five days after they happen , was able to recall details of trips several months after viewing images taken by the device to trigger her own memories , the Telegraph reported .
The device takes up to 2,000 pictures per day , which are downloaded to a home computer , and can be viewed as a speeded up slideshow or one by one .
Microsoft is still testing prototypes .
The researchers claim that the miniature camera can enrich the lives of people with dementia and other memory problems .
SenseCam can also be used for tourism or as a personal digital diary .
Combined with other sensors such as a heart rate monitor , it could have other medical applications .
The findings were revealed at the British Psychological Society conference in New York .

While a lot of people are out to optimize their sites / blogs , most everyone seems to skip over CSS .
I have been spending some time looking at CSS Optimization tools today .
I wanted something free , online , and easy to use .
And of course , something that worked .
There are actually quite a few websites that fit the bill , and some of them are easier to use , produce more friendly code , and others are a bit harder to use , but can produce amazing results .
I tested the CSS Optimizer , Icey ’s CSS Compressor , Flumpcakes CSS Optimiser , and CleanCSS to see which one could compress some default CSS files from popular websites the best .
I chose six sites :
Digg.com – poster boy of web 2.0 , and a nice looking design to boot .
Slashdot – poster boy of ‘ yesterday ’ .
Moved into CSS relatively late , but still serving up a lot of pageviews .
Filmsy – a blog part of the BloggyNetwork , I think it has a very nice design
i Begin – nice local search engine I was using while in Toronto
Download.com – one of the most popular sites to go CSS
ESPN – a totally non-tech demographic , and also had a very publicized shift to CSS
CSS optimizers do a variety of voodoo magic to get the end result .
This includes merging similar classes , removing useless properties , removing whitespace , and so forth .
This can lead to code that is not very easily read by you or I , but for larger CSS files , it can condense the file size so much that it really makes a big difference in page loading times .
Many broadband users might not think this matters much , as most websites seem to load fast for them , but if each site you went to loaded even 10 % faster , think of all the time it could save you over the course of a week , a month or even a year .
The bandwidth savings for the website operator can also be immense .
I would recommend that you always keep a copy of your human readable CSS code so that if you ever need to make any changes it does not take you a long time to figure out what you need to change , and then you can re-optimize it .
The Results
I ran all these tests with the tools being on their default settings .
This might not have given them all equal footing , but I think it is how most of us will use them because we do n’t know what options to turn on or off , and some tools did not have specialty options that could be turned on or off .
Digg was our first guinea pig .
Before optimization Digg.com ’s main CSS file was 30.56 KB .

Second to last came Download.com .
The move to CSS - P made a lot of noise , and we thought it would be interesting to see what benefits a large company could get .

Last up came ESPN .
Alongwith Download.com , these two sites are the most mentioned when it comes to the viability of CSS on large - scale websites .
ESPN ’s CSS clocked in at 25.68 kb .

The clear winner here is Icey ’s CSS Compressor , blowing away the rest .
It even shows the compressed code with color coding , making it easier to see the changes they made and how its formatted .
It also makes it easier to read that the output of most other tools .
In second place seems to be CleanCSS which is based on csstidy 1.1 .
It also shows syntax highlighting which makes it easy to understand .
They also list the changes they made , and any errors they noticed .
In third comes CSS Optimizer which is one of the simplest of them all .
It does not have the bells and whistles of the previous two , but is much nicer looking than our last place entrant , Flumpcakes CSS Optimiser .
Flumpcakes has a few more options than CSS Optimiser , but it does not have the same simple look .
The results page in my personal opinion is ugly , and does not even tell the unit of measurement used for comparison .
Conclusions
CSS optimization is a very valid form of speeding up downloads without having to sacrifice much ( just legibility ) .
With the average dialup user downloading at 3 kb/s , savings of just 10 kb can mean the page loads a stunning 3 seconds faster .
And just imagine ESPN with savings of almost 18 kb .
Multiple by the large traffic the site gets , and those are some real solid promotion - worthy savings .
So while this may not be important whilst you use a broadband connection , just you wait until you go visit your grandparents .

The hoax of the doctrine of man-made global warming that is being foisted upon the world by decree , and the junk science that is manipulated to support it , represents a creeping fascism whose agenda to stifle open debate betrays the fact that climate change hysteria is a farce intended to crush freedoms and further centralize global power .
In an interview with a Czech newspaper , Vaclav Klaus , the President of the Czech Republic blamed the " whip of political correctness " for preventing more scientists and statesmen from going public with their skepticism on man-made global warming .
This is precisely what we have arrived at , in a bizarre vacuum of common sense and without any attribution , the establishment and the controlled left have managed to squash reasoned two - sided debate about global warming by coating their argument with the nebulous claim that expressing disagreement is somehow bigoted , backward and even racist .
The very fact that the man -made advocates have to introduce such a far distant concept as race into a debate about scientific climate change makes it self - evident that their argument is inherently weak and vulnerable .
In an article we published in November about global warming being primarily caused by the sun , we commented somewhat tongue in cheek that people who express doubts about global warming would soon be compared to holocaust deniers by the media and other self - appointed cultural kingpins who demand total adherence to orthodox religion style beliefs about climate change .
Here 's what we wrote :
The assertion that global warming is man made is so oppressively enforced upon popular opinion , especially in Europe , that expressing a scintilla of doubt is akin to holocaust denial in some cases .
Such is the insipid brainwashing that has taken place via television , newspapers and exalted talking heads - global warming skeptics are forced to wear the metaphoric yellow star and only discuss their doubts in hushed tones and conciliatory frameworks , or be cat - called , harangued and jeered by an army of do - gooders who righteously believe they are rescuing mother earth by recycling a wine bottle or putting their paper in a separate trash can .
It 's not longer a joke .
The Boston Globe 's Ellen Goodman wrote an op - ed last week denouncing anyone who dares dissent against the God - like authoritative status of the IPCC UN report on climate change .
I would like to say we 're at a point where global warming is impossible to deny .
Let 's just say that global warming deniers are now on a par with Holocaust deniers , though one denies the past and the other denies the present and future .
This assault betrays what 's at the heart of the global warming agenda - a cadre of control freaks who can't respond to the overwhelming evidence that the Sun and other long term natural cycles are responsible for climate change and thus have to resort to vile propagandistic personality attacks to sway the court of public opinion .
During a debate on the BBC's Question Time program , a panelist 's appeal for viewers to simply look at both sides of the argument and consider other causes besides the man -made explanation was met with boos and cat - calls from the audience and the speaker was shouted down .
It 's now treated as sacrilegious to even question the force fed dogma that leads the automatons to endlessly repeat what has been brainwashed into them by the establishment media like a broken record .
" We ca n't afford to have this debate , " they scream , arguing that the end is nigh and unbelievers need to be metaphorically burned at the stake of public opinion in the interests of human survival .
But for those with memories and the nerve to actually think for themselves , the climate doomsayers have been proven wrong throughout the decades .
In the late 60's and early 70's , the in -vogue hysteria about climate change and how it spelled the end for humanity as we know it revolved around the concept of global cooling .
Again , this arose out of a misunderstanding of long term temperature fluctuations and the fact that the earth was at the end of the cycle of the Little Ice Age .
Writer John Bender has done an excellent job of compiling quotes from environmental " authorities " of past decades who told us that the sky was falling yet have been completely discredited with hindsight .
Keep these dire proclamations in mind when you hear yet another " repeater " regurgitate the brainwashing that he or she has been indoctrinated with by the establishment .
The continued rapid cooling of the earth since WWII is in accord with the increase in global air pollution associated with industrialization , mechanization , urbanization and exploding population .

In the 1970s , the world will undergo famines .

In ten years all important animal life in the sea will be extinct .
Large areas of coastline will have to be evacuated because of the stench of dead fish .

Before 1985 , mankind will enter a genuine age of scarcity . . . in which the accessible supplies of many key minerals will be facing depletion -- Paul Ehrlich in ( 1976 )
This [ cooling ] trend will reduce agricultural productivity for the rest of the century -- Peter Gwynne , Newsweek 1976
There are ominous signs that the earth 's weather patterns have begun to change dramatically and that these changes may portend a drastic decline in food production - with serious political implications for just about every nation on earth .
The drop in food production could begin quite soon ...
The evidence in support of these predictions has now begun to accumulate so massively that meteorologist are hard - pressed to keep up with it .
-- Newsweek , April 28 , ( 1975 )
This cooling has already killed hundreds of thousands of people .
If it continues and no strong action is taken , it will cause world famine , world chaos and world war , and this could all come about before the year 2000 .
-- Lowell Ponte " The Cooling " , 1976
If present trends continue , the world will be about four degrees colder for the global mean temperature in 1990 , but eleven degrees colder by the year 2000 ... This is about twice what it would take to put us in an ice age .
-- Kenneth E.F .
Watt on air pollution and global cooling , Earth Day ( 1970 )
The IPCC is a political body , not a scientific organization , therefore its proclamation is purely intended at achieving a political agenda .
The document they released on February 2 that was devotedly afforded days of intense coverage by the compliant establishment media was a political manifesto based on a scientific undertaking that has not even been completed .
How empirical is a " scientific experiment " whose conclusions are announced before tests have even been completed ?
The document immediately states that the " scientific " research is being edited to conform to the already released political summary .
“ Changes ( other than grammatical or minor editorial changes ) made after acceptance by the Working Group or the Panel shall be those necessary to ensure consistency with the Summary for Policymakers or the Overview Chapter , ” states the brief .
The U.N. has confidently announced " case closed " on man-made global warming because they are editing their own uncompleted report to mirror their pre-conceived conclusion .
Hardly " independent " is it ?
The IPCC report was piggybacked onto a bandwagon of public relations stunts that had nothing to do with the evidence behind global warming but were enough to leave an impression in the mind of the casual viewer that the man-made explanation was a global consensus .
These included the Eiffel Tower 's lights being turned off for 5 minutes and a ludicrous incident in which British primate expert Jane Goodall imitated the wild call of a tropical chimpanzee .
Czech President Klaus stated , " Global warming is a false myth and every serious person and scientist says so .
It is not fair to refer to the U.N. panel .
IPCC is not a scientific institution : it 's a political body , a sort of non-government organization of green flavor .
It 's neither a forum of neutral scientists nor a balanced group of scientists .
These people are politicized scientists who arrive there with a one - sided opinion and a one - sided assignment . "
Man -made advocates go to great lengths to highlight the fact that transnational oil giants such as Exxon - Mobil offer thousands of dollars for reports aimed at disproving the UN theory , claiming this taints any opposing viewpoint as biased , and yet conveniently ignore the fact that it was the U.N. itself and Ted Turner , a man -made devotee and advocate of drastic population reduction to save the planet , who gifted the organization $ 1 Billion which in part funded the IPCC report .
Is that not biased ?
Is that not a example of scientists being lavishly bankrolled to produce evidence that fits a pre-conceived outcome ?
Is the fact that a carbon tax fueled by fear of climate change that will go directly to assorted U.N. agencies itself a commentary on the U.N. 's role on hyping man-made global warming ?
In addition , Greenpeace are recruiting " global warming field organizer 's " whose job it is to lobby members of Congress to push the agenda for man-made global warming .
So if you thought your donation was going to help save whales or protect the rainforest you 're sorely mistaken - it 's partly funding a PR assault that will eventually orbit right back to you in the form of a draconian carbon emissions tax that will do nothing to prevent global warming but will fill the pockets of global government and the U.N .
Not all scientists were prepared to sacrifice their impartiality to be in on the scam .
Dr. Chris Landsea resigned from the IPCC in his own words because , “ I personally cannot in good faith continue to contribute to a process that I view as both being motivated by pre-conceived agendas and being scientifically unsound . ”
Landsea is one of many climate experts , meteorologists , geologists and others who have braved the scorn of the flat - earthers to point out that man-made advocates have utilized myopic and blinkered scientific trickery to make their case .
Timothy Ball , Chairman of the Natural Resources Stewardship Project and former climatology professor at the University of Winnipeg , recently penned an outstanding piece in which he detailed how the illusion is being played out and how skeptics of the farce are increasingly being made pariahs simply for having an opposing view .
Ball puts it better than I ever could so I make no apologies for quoting his article at length .
Global Warming , as we think we know it , does n't exist .
And I am not the only one trying to make people open up their eyes and see the truth .
But few listen , despite the fact that I was one of the first Canadian Ph.Ds. in Climatology and I have an extensive background in climatology , especially the reconstruction of past climates and the impact of climate change on human history and the human condition .
Few listen , even though I have a Ph.D , ( Doctor of Science ) from the University of London , England and was a climatology professor at the University of Winnipeg .
For some reason ( actually for many ) , the World is not listening .
Here is why .
Believe it or not , Global Warming is not due to human contribution of Carbon Dioxide ( CO2 ) .
This in fact is the greatest deception in the history of science .
We are wasting time , energy and trillions of dollars while creating unnecessary fear and consternation over an issue with no scientific justification .
No sensible person seeks conflict , especially with governments , but if we do n't pursue the truth , we are lost as individuals and as a society .
That is why I insist on saying that there is no evidence that we are , or could ever cause global climate change .
And , recently , Yuri A. Izrael , Vice President of the United Nations sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) confirmed this statement .
So how has the world come to believe that something is wrong ?
Maybe for the same reason we believed , 30 years ago , that global cooling was the biggest threat : a matter of faith .
" It is a cold fact : the Global Cooling presents humankind with the most important social , political , and adaptive challenge we have had to deal with for ten thousand years .
Your stake in the decisions we make concerning it is of ultimate importance ; the survival of ourselves , our children , our species , " wrote Lowell Ponte in 1976 .
I was as opposed to the threats of impending doom global cooling engendered as I am to the threats made about Global Warming .
Let me stress I am not denying the phenomenon has occurred .
The world has warmed since 1680 , the nadir of a cool period called the Little Ice Age ( LIA ) that has generally continued to the present .
These climate changes are well within natural variability and explained quite easily by changes in the sun .
But there is nothing unusual going on .
Since I obtained my doctorate in climatology from the University of London , Queen Mary College , England my career has spanned two climate cycles .
Temperatures declined from 1940 to 1980 and in the early 1970 's global cooling became the consensus .
This proves that consensus is not a scientific fact .
By the 1990 's temperatures appeared to have reversed and Global Warming became the consensus .
It appears I 'll witness another cycle before retiring , as the major mechanisms and the global temperature trends now indicate a cooling .
No doubt passive acceptance yields less stress , fewer personal attacks and makes career progress easier .
What I have experienced in my personal life during the last years makes me understand why most people choose not to speak out ; job security and fear of reprisals .
Even in University , where free speech and challenge to prevailing wisdoms are supposedly encouraged , academics remain silent .
No one disagrees with the notion that global warming is occurring , but to discount the fact that it has anything to do with that giant flaming ball of fire in our sky that we can barely look at without being blinded is ignorance unparalleled .
How do we square the fact that almost every planet in our solar system is simultaneously undergoing temperature change and volatile weather patterns ?
Does this not suggest that global warming is a natural cycle as a result of the evolving nature of the sun and other celestial phenomena ?
Can Al Gore fill me in on this one ?
Mars , Pluto , Jupiter , Saturn , Triton and numerous other nooks and crannies throughout the solar system are experiencing warming trends and volatile weather patterns .
How many SUV's are there on Jupiter ?
The earth and its celestial counterparts are getting hotter because the Sun is burning more brightly than at any time in the past 1,000 years , according to a study undertaken by the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Gottingen , Germany .
In addition , cosmic rays from exploding stars have now been found to contribute substantially to cloud formation and the greenhouse effect as the London Times reported yesterday .
The simple fact is that throughout the ages the earth has swung wildly between a warm , wet , stable climate , to a cold , dry and windy one - long before the first fossil fuel was burned .
The changes we are now witnessing are a walk in the park compared to the battering that our rugged planet has taken in the past .
This is not a defense of the oil cartels or the Neo - Con wreckers , who would have every motivation to ignore global warming whether it is man-made or not .
Nor is it a blanket denial of the fact that the earth is getting very gradually hotter , but how do we reconcile global warming taking place at the farthest reaches of the solar system with the contention that it is caused by human activity ?
Have our exhaust fumes left earth 's atmosphere and slipped through a black hole to Triton ?
Countless other heroes of science have put their reputation and careers on the line in the name of truth to expose the man-made fraud and challenge the creeping fascism being engendered by means of using political correctness to hijack the debate .
They have bucked the orthodoxy and risked being stripped of their credentials , as the Weather Channel ’s most prominent climatologist would have it .
Here are several insightful statements from these brave individuals .
I have been in operational meteorology since 1978 , and I know dozens and dozens of broadcast meteorologists all over the country .
Our big job : look at a large volume of raw data and come up with a public weather forecast for the next seven days .
I do not know of a single TV meteorologist who buys into the man -made global warming hype .
I know there must be a few out there , but I ca n’t find them .
Billions of dollars of grant money is flowing into the pockets of those on the man -made global warming bandwagon .
No man -made global warming , the money dries up .
This is big money , make no mistake about it .
Always follow the money trail and it tells a story .
Even the lady at “ The Weather Channel ” probably gets paid good money for a prime time show on climate change .
No man -made global warming , no show , and no salary .
Nothing wrong with making money at all , but when money becomes the motivation for a scientific conclusion , then we have a problem .
For many , global warming is a big cash grab .
The climate of this planet has been changing since God put the planet here .
It will always change , and the warming in the last 10 years is not much difference than the warming we saw in the 1930s and other decades .
And , lets not forget we are at the end of the ice age in which ice covered most of North America and Northern Europe .

" It 's not 2,500 people offering their consensus , I participated in that .
Each person who is an author writes one or two pages in conjunction with someone else .
They travel around the world several times a year for several years to write it and the summary for policymakers has the input of about 13 of the scientists , but ultimately , it is written by representatives of governments , of environmental organizations like the Union of Concerned Scientists , and industrial organizations , each seeking their own benefit . "
MIT 's Professor of Atmospheric Science Dr. Richard Lindzen on the IPCC report .
" Climate keeps changing all the time .
The fact that climate changes is not in itself a threat . "
Dr. S. Fred Singer , Atmospheric Physicist at George Mason University .
Man -made global warming feeds into humanity 's arrogant self - importance in thinking that it has become the master and therefore the decider of the earth 's destiny .
On an individual level , it also helps a person stroke their ego and feel good about themselves for recycling a few beer cans or wine bottles in the belief that they 're saving the planet , and also gives them the excuse to exercise their judgment against anyone who does n't do likewise .
Fearmongering about an imminent climate doomsday also hogs news coverage and important environmental issues like GM food , mad scientist chimera cloning and the usurpation and abuse of corporations like Monsanto flies under the radar .
Global warming is cited as an excuse to meter out further control and surveillance over our daily lives , RFID chips on our trash cans , GPS satellite tracking and taxation by the mile , as well as a global tax at the gas pump .
The extremist wing of the environmentalist movement , characterized by people like Dr. Erik Pianka , advocate the mass culling of humanity via plagues and state sanctioned bio-terrorism , in order to " save " the earth from the disease of humanity .
Nazi - like genocidal population control measures and the environmental establishment have always held a close alliance .
The world is laboring under enforced adherence to a program of mass deception while scientists who attempt to blow the whistle on the fraud are silenced , tarred , ridiculed and fired .
The biased control freaks at the United Nations and their intellectually spayed cheerleaders , whose goal it is to use the hysteria of climate change to impose draconian control measures on society and centralize world power , have declared " case closed " on the man -made origins of global warming .
However , their foolish attempts to zealously mute mere expression of an opposing view betray the inherent flaws of their own mantra and will ultimately lead to its downfall .
Florentino Floro was appealing against a three - year inquiry which led to his removal due to incompetence and bias .
He told investigators three mystic dwarves - Armand , Luis and Angel - had helped him to carry out healing sessions during breaks in his chambers .
The court said psychic phenomena had no place in the judiciary .
The bench backed a medical finding that the judge was suffering from psychosis .
' Dwarf dalliance '
The Manila trial judge had asked the Supreme Court to dismiss the complaint and return him to the bench , after being sacked in April .
From obscurity , my name and the three mystic dwarves became immortal
Florentino Floro
" They should not have dismissed me for what I believed , " Mr Floro told reporters after filing his appeal in May .
The judge said he had made a covenant with his dwarf friends that he could write while in a trance and that he had been seen by several people in two places at the same time .
Judge Floro reportedly changed from blue court robes to black each Friday " to recharge his psychic powers " .
In a letter to the court he said : " From obscurity , my name and the three mystic dwarves became immortal . "
However , the Supreme Court said dalliance with dwarves would gradually erode the public 's acceptance of the judiciary as the guardian of the law , if not make it an object of ridicule .
Throughout most of history , humans lived in a state of extreme information poverty .
News traveled slowly , field to field , village to village .
Even with the printing press ’s advent , information spread at a snail ’s pace .
Few knew how to find printed materials , assuming that they even knew how to read .
Today , by contrast , we live in a world of unprecedented media abundance that once would have been the stuff of science - fiction novels .
We can increasingly obtain and consume whatever media we want , wherever and whenever we want : television , radio , newspapers , magazines , and the bewildering variety of material available on the Internet .
This media cornucopia is a wonderful development for a free society — or so you ’d think .
But today ’s media universe has fierce detractors , and nowhere more vehemently than on the left .
Their criticisms seem contradictory .
Some , such as Democratic congressman Dennis Kucinich , contend that real media choices , information sources included , remain scarce , hindering citizens from fully participating in a deliberative democracy .
Others argue that we have too many media choices , making it hard to share
common thoughts or feelings ; democracy , community itself , again loses out .
Both liberal views get the story disastrously wrong .
If either prevails , what ’s shaping up to be America ’s Golden Age of media could be over soon .
Back in 2003 , a somewhat free - market - minded Federal Communications Commission , chaired by Republican Michael Powell , proposed to revise the arcane policies governing media ownership , which , among other things , limit how many newspapers , television stations , or radio stations a single entity can own in each community .
“ Americans today have more media choices , more sources of news and information , and more varied entertainment programming available to them than ever before , ” the FCC observed .
Allowing slightly more cross-ownership , it reasoned , would simply clear out the regulatory deadwood that artificially limited the ability of older media operators ( broadcasters and newspapers ) to compete with all the new media alternatives .
Such a measure would do nothing to harm media multiplicity .
Despite the moderate nature of the FCC ’s proposal , all hell broke loose on the left , and things have n’t really died down since .
In congressional debates , Democratic lawmakers warned apocalyptically of the horrors that the FCC ’s proposed reform would unleash .
Representative Edward Markey of Massachusetts — mentioning Citizen Kane but clearly thinking of Rupert Murdoch , whose FOX News and other media outlets have won a big audience for conservative views — implied that a few all - powerful media tycoons could soon run the world .
California congresswoman Lynn Woolsey accused the FCC of trying to impose a centralized “ Saddam - style information
system in the United States . ”
Not to be outdone , New York ’s Maurice Hinchey saw the new rules as a GOP - led “ mind control ” project .
“ It ’s a
well - thought - out and planned effort to control the political process , ” he said .
“ It will wipe out our democracy . ” Then–Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean said that he ’d break
up Murdoch ’s media empire “ on ideological grounds . ”
The circus - like “ town hall meetings ” that followed proved even more overheated .
Pushed by Democratic FCC commissioners and organized by MoveOn.org , Free Press , and other leftist advocacy groups , these sessions gave anyone with a gripe against a media company a chance to vent .
Some grumbled that TV and radio featured too much religious programming ; others argued that there was n’t enough .
Everyone said that local radio broadcast nothing but garbage — but everyone defined garbage differently .
And many aired long lists of complaints about the multiple radio stations , television channels , and newspapers in their areas , only to conclude that their local media markets were insufficiently competitive !
The critics did agree on one thing : government had to take steps to reverse our current media predicament — whatever it was .
A variety of advocacy groups then took the FCC to court and got the Third Circuit Court of Appeals to put the whole media ownership revision on hold .
Most participants in the meetings fell into the scarcity - obsessed camp .
On the face of it , the scarcity critics have a tough case to make .
According to FCC data and various private reports , America boasts close to 14,000 radio stations today , double the number that existed in 1970 .
Satellite radio— an industry that did n’t even exist before 2001 — claimed roughly 13 million subscribers nationwide by 2007 .
Eighty - six percent of households subscribe to cable or satellite TV today , receiving an average of 102 channels of the more than 500 available to them .
There were 18,267 magazines produced in 2005 , up from 14,302 in 1993 .
The only declining media sector is the newspaper business , which has seen circulation erode for many years now .
But that ’s largely a result of the competition that it faces from other outlets .
Throw the Internet into the mix and you get dizzy .
The Internet Systems Consortium reports that the number of Internet host computers — computers or servers that allow people to post content on the Web — has grown from just 235 in 1982 to 1.3 million in 1993 to roughly 400 million in 2006 .
At the beginning of 2007 , the blog - tracking service Technorati counted over 66 million blogs , with more than 175,000 new ones created daily .
Bloggers update their sites “ to the tune of over 1.6 million posts per day , or over 18 updates a second , ” according to Technorati .
But the scarcity critics have a rejoinder : the apparent diversity is n’t real , because a handful of media barons — hell - bent on force - feeding us their politically reactionary pabulum and commercial messages — control most of it ( even before any FCC ownership rule changes ) .
“ You can literally say you actually have more voices , but they are the same voices increasingly , ” says New Yorker media writer Ken Auletta .
Even the Internet is n’t what it ’s cracked up to be .
The Consumer Federation of America ’s Mark Cooper , author of Media Ownership and Democracy in the Digital Information Age , lambastes the Internet for failing to serve “ the public interest , ” for being too commercial , for not helping local communities , for hurting deliberative democracy , and for failing to enhance citizens ’ ability “ to define themselves and their place in everyday life . ”
Who knew that the Internet was so harmful to modern society ?
>
It ’s all nonsense , starting with the notion that a tiny group has a stranglehold on the media .
A 2002 FCC survey of ten media markets — from the largest ( New York City ) to the smallest ( Altoona , Pennsylvania ) — showed that each had more outlets and owners in 2000 than in 1960 .
And the FCC counted all of a market ’s cable channels as a single outlet ( even though the
typical viewer would regard each channel as a distinct one ) and did n’t include national newspapers or Internet sites as media sources , so
the diversity picture was even brighter than it seemed .
Nor do Americans lack a rich variety of “ voices ” in the media .
Each new commercial media outlet must provide something at least slightly different from its rivals .
If every book , magazine , TV channel , radio program , and website really said the same thing , citizens would n’t bother consuming any more than one or two of them .
We simply would n’t have the media abundance that we enjoy today .
Becoming an informed citizen has never been easier .
You can get up in the morning and still read your ( probably liberal ) local paper and several national ones — say , the Wall Street Journal ( right - of - center editorial page ) and USA Today ( more or less centrist ) .
Walk to the newsstand and you ’ve got political magazines galore , from the Marxist New Left Review to the paleoconservative The American Conservative .
On cable and satellite television : CNN , MSNBC , CNBC , FOX News , PBS , local news , the big networks
( at least for now ) , the BBC , C - SPAN , community access shows — all offer
a wide variety
of news and information options , some around the clock .
Turn on
the car radio and Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity booms out at you from the right ; or maybe you can tune in to Sirius Left on satellite .
The Internet has done more to create the sort of media that scarcity critics claim to desire than any other technology .
Every man , woman , and child can have a “ newspaper ” or broadcast outlet today — it ’s called a website , blog , or podcast .
It ’s hard to imagine how the political blogosphere could be more diverse , ranging from the Daily Kos and the Huffington Post on the left
to National Review Online and Power Line on the right to Andrew Sullivan , Instapundit , and Buzz Machine somewhere in between .
A political junkie must hustle to keep up with what
RealClearPolitics posts on its site every day .
The same breathtaking abundance characterizes entertainment and lifestyle media , which now provide something for every interest under the sun .
Consider a truly eclectic person — a lesbian feminist African - American who likes to hunt on weekends and has a passion for country music .
Would the “ mainstream media ” of 25 years ago have represented any of her interests ?
Unlikely .
Today , though , this woman can program her TiVo to record her favorite shows on Black Entertainment Television , Logo ( a gay / lesbian - oriented cable channel ) , Oxygen ( female - targeted programming ) , the Outdoor Life Network , and Country Music Television .
“ We ’ve gone from a few programmers in New York and Los Angeles deciding what people will watch to the people themselves voting with their remote controls every night , really every minute , on what they want , ” says David Westin , president of ABC News .
And that ’s just television .
The liberal scarcity worrywarts thus ignore
a recent history of stunning technological innovation and marketplace evolution that has made us as information - rich as any society in history .
But this is where a second group of leftist media critics enters the picture .
What information consumes is rather obvious , ” Nobel Prize–winning economist and psychologist Herbert Simon remarked in 1971 : “ the attention of its recipients .
Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention , and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it . ”
Thirty - six years later , confronting a “ wealth of information ” that Simon could never have imagined , a growing group of left - wing critics warns about its destructive consequences .
The titles of recent books by Todd Gitlin and Barry Schwartz — Media Unlimited : How the Torrent of Images and Sounds Overwhelms Our Lives and The Paradox of Choice : Why More Is Less , respectively — capture the anxiety felt by these opponents of media multiplicity .
It ’s just too much .
Yet even if one concedes that the number of media choices can be daunting , notes Wired magazine editor Chris Anderson , the market is responding .
In his 2006 bestseller , The Long Tail , Anderson celebrates the explosion of information - sorting intermediaries and filtering tools that enable us to take full advantage of the media cornucopia .
Google , Netflix , Amazon.com , iTunes , or , for political information , Huffington Post and RealClearPolitics are just a few examples .
“ These technologies and services sift through a vast array of choices to present you with the ones that are most right for you , ” Anderson points out .
But according to one of the most influential abundance - is - bad media critics , liberal law professor Cass Sunstein , Anderson ’s filters only make things worse .
In his 2001 book Republic.com , Sunstein notes that the hyper-customization of specialized websites and online technologies
enables Americans to create a highly personalized information retrieval service — a “ Daily Me , ” he calls it , using a term coined by technology theorist Nicholas Negroponte .
But whereas Negroponte , like Anderson , welcomes the filtering
and specialization as a liberating break from
traditional , force - fed media , Sunstein believes that they cause extreme social fragmentation , isolation , and alienation , and could lead to
political extremism .
“ A system of limitless individual choices , with respect to communications , is not necessarily in the interest of citizenship and self - government , ” he writes .
Schwartz echoes the point , fearing the antisocial effects of media offering “ choice without boundaries . ”
“ In a decade or so , when [ TiVos ] are in everybody ’s home , it ’s a good bet that when folks gather around the watercooler to discuss the last night ’s big TV events , no two of them will have watched the same shows , ” he writes ruefully .
Similarly , Bill Carrick , a media advisor for former Democratic presidential candidate Richard Gephardt , complained a while back to the Washington Post that the rise of the Internet , cable , and other new media was making it hard for politicians to reach the masses with campaign messages .
“ The danger for democracy , ” he asserted , “ is that we ’re losing the universal campfire . ”
When Sunstein and other liberal information - overload critics bemoan the loss of a “ universal campfire ” or shared watercooler experiences , they ’re implicitly making the point that we were better off when just a few media outlets existed .
Some even openly wax nostalgic about a supposed Golden Age of newspapers , radio , and television , when apparently we were less distracted , better informed , and enjoyed a better sense of community .
This Norman Rockwell view is far more myth than reality .
Was American democracy really better off when William Randolph Hearst dominated the newspaper business , or when the Big Three television networks brought us the news at a set time each night ?
And was community really stronger when everyone talked about the same things around the nation ’s watercoolers every day , as opposed to different things ?
In truth , one can make a strong case that the new media — and the Internet , above all — are facilitating a more rigorous deliberative democracy and a richer sense of community .
“ In modern American political history , perhaps only the
coming of the television age has had as big an impact on our national elections as the Internet has , ” observes Raul Fernandez , chief executive
of the software firm ObjectVideo .
“ But the
effect of the Internet may be better for the long - term health of our democracy .
For while TV
emphasizes perception , control , and centralization , Internet - driven politics is about transparency , distribution of effort , and , most important , empowerment and participation — at whatever level of engagement the consumer wants . ”
As for community , “ the Digital Age has n’t
mechanized humanity and isolated people in a sterile world of
machines , ” believes Richard Saul Wurman , author of Information Anxiety .
The Internet , he points out , has
enabled people across the globe to band
together and communicate in ways previously unimaginable .
What unifies the two schools of leftist media criticism , beneath their apparent opposition , is pure elitism .
Media abundance ( which the scarcity critics must implausibly wave away as a mirage ) has meant more room for right - of - center viewpoints that , while popular with many Americans , the critics find completely unacceptable .
The fact that Bill O’Reilly gets better ratings than Bill Moyers perturbs them to no end .
It ’s just not fair !
Both liberal groups would love to put their thumbs on the scale and tilt the media in their preferred direction .
Scarcity - obsessed Dennis Kucinich has recently introduced plans in
Congress to revive the Fairness Doctrine , which once let government regulators police the
airwaves to ensure a balancing of viewpoints , however that ’s defined .
A new Fairness Doctrine would affect most directly opinion - based
talk radio , a medium that just happens to be dominated by conservatives .
If a station wanted
to run William Bennett ’s show under such
a regime , they might now have to broadcast
a left - wing alternative , too , even if it had poor
ratings , which generally has been the case
with liberal talk .
Sunstein also proposes a kind of speech redistributionism .
For the Internet , he suggests that regulators could impose “ electronic sidewalks ” on partisan websites ( the
National Rifle Association ’s , say ) , forcing them to link to opposing views .
The practical problems of implementing this program would be forbidding , even if it somehow proved constitutional .
How many links to opposing views would secure the government ’s approval ?
The FCC would need an army of media regulators ( much as China has today ) to monitor the millions of webpages , blogs , and social - networking sites and keep them in line .
That leftist media critics start sounding so authoritarian is no surprise .
In a media cornucopia , freedom of choice inevitably yields media inequality .
“ In systems where many people are free to choose between many options , a small subset of the whole will get a disproportionate amount of traffic ( or attention , or income ) , even if no members of
the system actively work towards such an
outcome , ” writes Clay Shirky of New York
University ’s Interactive Telecommunications
Program .
Overcoming that inequality would require a completely regulated media .
When Rush Limbaugh has more listeners than NPR , or Tom Clancy sells more books than Noam Chomsky , or Motor Trend gets more subscribers than Mother Jones , liberals want to convince us ( or themselves , perhaps ) that it ’s all because of some catastrophic market failure or a grand corporate conspiracy to dumb down the masses .
In reality , it ’s just the result of consumer choice .
All the opinions that the Left ’s media critics favor are now readily available to us via multiple platforms .
But that ’s not good enough , it seems : they wo n’t rest until all of us are watching , reading , and listening to the content that they prefer .
I hesitate to add to the proliferation of “ considered harmful ” essays , but this is an important point , and it needs a URL , if only to cut down on the amount of typing I have to do .
The Problem
Try the following code on an empty page , one without any JavaScript libraries added :
var associative_array = new Array ( ) ; associative_array [ " one " ] = " Lorem " ; associative_array [ " two " ] = " Ipsum " ; associative_array [ " three " ] = " dolor " ; for ( i in associative_array ) { alert ( i ) } ;
You ’ll get three sequential alert boxes : “ one ” ; “ two ” ; “ three . ”
This code has a predictable output and looks logically sound : you ’re declaring a new array , giving it three string keys , then iterating over them .
Now do this : replace “ Array ” with “ RegExp ” and run the code again .
As if by magic , this also works !
It ’s not the only one .
Try Boolean , or Date , or String , and you ’ll find they all work as well .
It works because all you ’re doing is setting properties on an object ( in JS , foo [ " bar " ] is the same as foo. bar ) , and a for .. in loop simply iterates over an object ’s properties .
All data types in JS are objects ( or have object representations ) , so all of them can have arbitrary properties set .
In JavaScript , one really ought to use Object for a set of key / value pairs .
But because Array works as demonstrated above , JavaScript arrays ( which are meant to be numeric ) are often used to hold key / value pairs .
This is bad practice .
Object should be used instead .
I ’m not trying to ridicule or scold .
This misconception is too common to attribute it to stupidity , and there are many legitimate reasons for the confusion .
But this is something that needs to be cleared up if JavaScript is ever to be used on a grand scale .
If you need further evidence that Array is not meant to be used this way , consider :
There is no way to specify string keys in an array constructor .
There is no way to specify string keys in an array literal .
Array . length does not count them as items .
In the above example , associative_array .
length will return 0 .
will return .
The page on Arrays in the Mozilla JavaScript reference makes no mention of this usage .
( Nor does the ECMAScript specification , by the way , but you ’ll have to do your own legwork to verify that , because I ’m not linking to page 88 of a kajillion ‐page PDF . )
The History
This confusion has several other contributing factors :
In PHP , a language that many JavaScript users are also familiar with , numeric arrays and associative arrays are treated more or less identically .
And since a set of key / value pairs goes by about eleven different names , depending on the language , this usage is quite often a result of unclear definitions of terms .
, a language that many JavaScript users are also familiar with , numeric arrays and associative arrays are treated more or less identically .
And since a set of key / value pairs goes by about eleven different names , depending on the language , this usage is quite often a result of unclear definitions of terms .
JavaScript is interpreted , not compiled , and many people have learned it by example .
Thus a third ‐party script that uses Array improperly might rub off on its users .
improperly might rub off on its users .
JavaScript started with no specification , then received a poor specification , and I know few people who spend their free time reading specifications .
Especially bad ones .
Because there is no formal construct for key / value pairs , JavaScript cannot distinguish between creating a hash and setting properties on an object .
As we ’ve demonstrated , any object can have arbitrary properties , and a for .. in loop simply iterates over each of these properties , so the code above is not explicitly incorrect .
loop simply iterates over each of these properties , so the code above is not explicitly incorrect .
The harmful side effects of using Array for key / value pairs are not experienced unless Array .
prototype is extended .
Since this is an underutilized feature of JavaScript , it has n’t been done on a large scale until rather recently .
Why Prototype “ breaks ” this usage
Concurrent with Prototype ‘s rise in popularity have been various blog posts complaining that the JavaScript framework “ breaks ” associative arrays — i.e.
Array s with string keys .
It “ breaks ” them because it adds a handful of useful methods for working with arrays to Array .
prototype , and these methods are also iterated over in a for .. in loop .
This means that when Prototype is included on a page the code above will loop 35 times instead of the original three .
Prototype also extends String with some methods for dealing with strings .
If you try to use String as an associative array , your code will loop 20 times instead of three .
I am aware of the mitigating factors — hell , I just enumerated them — but complaining that Prototype “ breaks ” your ability to use Array as a hash is like complaining that Prototype “ breaks ” your ability to use String as a hash .
It is not Prototype ’s fault that JavaScript does not deter this improper use , and it certainly does not mean that Prototype does not “ play well with others . ”
You are free to reject Prototype and keep using Array improperly , but then you give up your right to bitch and moan .
Actually , we ’ve been here before : before version 1.4 , Prototype added a couple methods onto Object .
prototype , meaning that Object could n’t even be used in the manner I describe , and a bunch of people rightly took Sam Stephenson to task for it .
Object . prototype is verboten .
Since version 1.4 , however , this is no longer an issue , and therefore there is no longer an excuse .
So I will say it again : Array is not meant to be used for key / value pairs .
Luckily , there is a dead ‐simple way to fix this .
In the above example , you need only change Array to Object .
( Or , if you ’re using literal syntax , change [ ] to {} . )
There .
Your wrong code is no longer wrong , and it took only a little more work than a simple find ‐and ‐replace .
There are plenty of JavaScript frameworks to choose from , and many of them are excellent .
I use Prototype because it works for me , and I do not take it personally when other people decide they do n’t like it .
But I believe Prototype deserves to be hated on its merits , dammit , not because it makes wrong code stop working — especially when the wrong code can be made right in ten seconds .

Pharmed food crop approved for growth despite controversy .
Rice modified to express proteins often found in breast milk will be planted in Kansas .

Rice modified to express proteins often found in breast milk will be planted in Kansas .
The go - ahead for the planting came on 16 May from the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) .
It 's certainly not the first crop designed to produce pharmaceutical proteins given the go - ahead in the United States or elsewhere ( see ' Turning plants into protein factories ' ) .
But this is among the first food crops containing genes that produce human proteins to gain approval for large - scale planting .
Many other pharmaceutical genetically - modified ( GM ) crops are grown indoors or in inedible plants such as tobacco .
The rice strains , made by Ventria Bioscience in Sacramento , California , produce lysozyme , lactoferrin and human serum albumin in their seeds .
All three are commonly found in breast milk .
Lysozyme and lactoferrin are proteins with antibacterial , viral and fungal properties , according to the company .
Ventria says that they aim to use the rice to create drinks that can combat diarrhoea , and dietary supplements to help reverse anaemia1 .
Diarrhoea , which often stems from gastrointestinal infection , is a major killer of children worldwide .
Many further regulatory hurdles involving other agencies would need to be passed before products made from this rice could be sold to consumers .
Public comment
The crop , which has been tested in Peru , was given preliminary approval in March , and the USDA then opened the proposal up for public comment .
Of the more than 20,000 comments they received , only 29 were positive , although many of the negative comments consisted of form letters .
ADVERTISEMENT
In the end , the USDA thought that the fears of many that the rice would escape into the environment or the food supply were not warranted , thanks to the many cautious procedures proposed by Ventria - including the fact that they plan to plant the test field more than 480 kilometres away from any commercial rice farms .
The permit states that any seeds eaten by animals or birds would pose them no significant risk .
It adds that the chance that a tornado or other extreme weather event might disperse the seed widely is low , but requires an emergency management plan to deal with this .
A 2005 report by the USDA 's Office of the Inspector General criticized the agency 's approval of GM crops as being too lax , but the agency says that it has improved the approval process since then and that it has always been more vigilant about crops that produce pharmaceuticals .
In 2006 , a fairly typical year , according to USDA public affairs specialist Rachel Iadicicco , the USDA received 14 requests for outdoor plantings of GM crops expressing pharmaceuticals or industrial compounds .
Of those fourteen , ten have been granted , three are pending and one was withdrawn .
Some of these resulted in plantings in 2006 , and some were planted this year .
The agency requires a new permit each year .

Cnet went too far in googling 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
Googling someone -- a prospective job candidate , a teenage crush , your son's soccer coach -- is a commonplace ritual of modern life .
But the search engine company evidently does n't appreciate a taste of its own medicine .
Google has blackballed online technology news service Cnet News.com for googling Eric Schmidt , CEO of the Mountain View company , and including some personal information about him in a story last month .
Google told a Cnet editor that it will not speak with Cnet reporters until August 2006 , according to Jai Singh , editor in chief of Cnet News.com in San Francisco .
" We published a story that recounted how we found information on the ( Google ) CEO in a public forum using their service , " Singh said .
" They had issue with the fact that they felt it was private information and our point is it was public information obtained through public channels using Google search . "
Google declined to comment .

Reporter Elinor Mills '
Cnet article made the point that Google , the search engine used by more than half of U.S. Internet users , has much potential for privacy invasion , particularly through data it collects that is not available to the public , such as logs of Google searches .
She illustrated the story with information that could readily be obtained by anyone with access to Google and the Internet : Schmidt 's net worth , home neighborhood , attendance at Burning Man and enthusiasm for amateur piloting .
" From what I understand , most of ( Google 's objection to the article ) had to do with the anecdotal lead we used to illustrate the point that information could be obtained rather easily using Google search , " Singh said .
Mark Glaser , a columnist with Online Journalism Review , run by the USC Annenberg School , said Google was overreacting .
" Google helps people search for this kind of information .
For them to be upset that someone would publicize it is a little bit strange .
It could end up backfiring on them because it gives more attention to the ( privacy ) problem , " he said .
An entire company shunning an entire media outlet is unusual , although isolated bans are not .
Athletes and movie stars are known for refusing to talk to reporters who have angered them .
During the height of the steroids scandal in March , Barry Bonds once refused to speak to the media while The Chronicle 's Giants beat reporter was present .
Companies sometimes pull advertisements to retaliate for media coverage they consider unfair .
In April , General Motors pulled all its ads in the Los Angeles Times over what it called " factual errors and misrepresentations , " a ban that the Wall Street Journal reported could have cost the newspaper about $ 10 million annually .
GM resumed advertising in the Los Angeles Times this month .
Media critic Ben Bagdikian said Google and other everyday digital technologies indeed raise privacy concerns , but he predicted that the ban against Cnet will not last .
" No one can force one party to speak to another party , " he wrote in an e- mail .
" My guess is that for business reasons , and to respond to unkind words directed at Google , it will be hard for Google not to reply , at which point the whole messy fight will make both parties look so ridiculous in public that the general public will get bored and both parties will suffer in their businesses . "
Original story on CNET :
news.com.com/Googles+balancing+act/2100-1032_3-5787483.html
IN 1998 , just after he won a share of the Nobel prize for physics , Robert Laughlin of Stanford University in California was asked how his discovery of " particles " with fractional charge , now called quasi- particles , would affect the lives of ordinary people .
" It probably wo n't , " he said , " unless people are concerned about how the universe works . "
Well , people were .
Xiao - Gang
Wen at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Michael Levin at Harvard University ran with Laughlin 's ideas and have come up with a prediction for a new state of matter , and even a tantalising picture of the nature of spacetime itself .
Levin presented their work at the Topological Quantum Computing conference at the University of California , Los Angeles , early this month .
The first hint that a new type of matter may exist came in 1983 .
" Twenty five years ago we thought we understood everything about how matter changes phase , " says Wen .
" Then along came an experiment that opened up a whole new world . "
In the experiment , electrons moving in the interface between two semiconductors behaved as though they were made up of particles with only a fraction of the electron 's charge .
This so - called fractional quantum hall effect ( FQHE ) suggested that electrons may not be elementary particles after all .
However , it soon became clear that electrons under certain conditions can congregate in a way that gives them the illusion of having fractional charge - an explanation that earned Laughlin , Horst Störmer and Daniel Tsui the Nobel prize ( New Scientist , 31 January 1998 , p 36 ) .
Wen suspected that the effect could be an example of a new type of matter .
Different phases of matter are characterised by the way their atoms are organised .
In a liquid , for instance , atoms are randomly distributed , whereas atoms in a solid are rigidly positioned in a lattice .
FQHE systems are different .
" If you take a snapshot of the position of electrons in an FQHE system they appear random and you think you have a liquid , " says Wen .
But step back , and you see that , unlike in a liquid , the electrons dance around each other in well - defined steps .
It is as if the electrons are entangled .
Today , physicists use the term to describe a property in quantum mechanics in which particles can be linked despite being separated by great distances .
Wen speculated that FQHE systems represented a state of matter in which entanglement was an intrinsic property , with particles tied to each other in a complicated manner across the entire material .
This led Wen and Levin to the idea that there may be a different way of thinking about matter .
What if electrons were not really elementary , but were formed at the ends of long " strings " of other , fundamental particles ?
They formulated a model in which such strings are free to move " like noodles in a soup " and weave together into huge " string - nets " .
The pair ran simulations to see if their string - nets could give rise to conventional particles and fractionally charged quasiparticles .
They did .
They also found something even more surprising .
As the net of strings vibrated , it produced a wave that behaved according to a very familiar set of laws - Maxwell 's equations , which describe the behaviour of light .
" A hundred and fifty years after Maxwell wrote them down , here they emerged by accident , " says Wen .
That was n't all .
They found that their model naturally gave rise to other elementary particles , such as quarks , which make up protons and neutrons , and the particles responsible for some of the fundamental forces , such as gluons and the W and Z bosons .
From this , the researchers made another leap .
Could the entire universe be modelled in a similar way ?
" Suddenly we realised , maybe the vacuum of our whole universe is a string - net liquid , " says Wen .
" It would provide a unified explanation of how both light and matter arise . "
So in their theory elementary particles are not the fundamental building blocks of matter .
Instead , they emerge from the deeper structure of the non-empty vacuum of space - time .
" Wen and Levin 's theory is really beautiful stuff , " says Michael Freedman , 1986 winner of the Fields medal , the highest prize in mathematics , and a quantum computing specialist at Microsoft Station Q at the University of California , Santa Barbara .
" I admire their approach , which is to be suspicious of anything - electrons , photons , Maxwell 's equations - that everyone else accepts as fundamental . "
Other theories that try to explain the same phenomena abound , of course ; Wen and Levin realise that the burden of proof is on them .
It may not be far off .
Their model predicts specific arrangements of atoms in the new state of matter , which they dub the " string - net liquid " , and Joel Helton 's group at MIT might have found it .
Helton was aware of Wen 's work and decided to look for such materials .
Trawling through geology journals , his team spotted a candidate - a dark green crystal that geologists stumbled across in the mountains of Chile in 1972 .
" The geologists named it after a mineralogist they really admired , Herbert Smith , labelled it and put it to one side , " says team member Young Lee .
" They did n't realise the potential herbertsmithite would have for physicists years later . "
Herbertsmithite is unusual because its electrons are arranged in a triangular lattice .
Normally , electrons prefer to line up so that their spins are in the opposite direction to that of their immediate neighbours , but in a triangle this is impossible - there will always be neighbouring electrons spinning in the same direction .
Wen and Levin 's model shows that such a system would be a string - net liquid .
Although herbertsmithite exists in nature , the mineral contains impurities that disrupt any string - net signatures , says Lee .
So Helton 's team made a pure sample in the lab .
" It was painstaking , " says Lee .
" It took us a full year to prepare it and another year to analyse it . "
The team measured the degree of magnetisation in the material , in response to an applied magnetic field .
If herbertsmithite behaves like ordinary matter , they argue , then below about 26 °C the spins of its electrons should stop fluctuating - a condition called magnetic order .
But the team found no such transition , even down to just a fraction above absolute zero .
They measured other properties , too , such as heat conduction .
In conventional solids , the relationship between their temperature and their ability to conduct heat changes below a certain temperature , because the structure of the material changes .
The team found no sign of such a transition in herbertsmithite , suggesting that , unlike other types of matter , its lowest energy state has no discernible order .
" We could have created something in the lab that nobody has seen before , " says Lee .
The team plans further tests to visualise the position of individual electrons , looking for long - range entanglement by firing neutrons at the crystal and observing how they scatter .
" We want to see the dynamics of the spin , " says Lee .
" If we tweak one [ electron ] , we can see how the others are affected . "
This intrigues Paul Fendley , a quantum computing specialist at the University of Virginia , Charlottesville ( see " Silicon for a quantum age " ) .
" It 's reasonable to hope that we are seeing something exotic here , " he says .
" People are getting very excited about this . "
Even if herbertsmithite is not a new state of matter , we should n't be surprised if one is found soon , as many teams are hunting for them , says Freedman .
He says people wrongly assume that particle accelerators are the only places where big discoveries about matter can be made .
" Accelerators are just recreating conditions after the big bang and repeating experiments that are old hat for the universe , " he says .
" But in labs people are creating [ conditions ] that are colder than anywhere that has ever existed in the universe .
We are bound to stumble on something the universe has never seen before . "

All famous adult film companies and Schecter have joined hands to launch first - ever commercially licensed graphic guitar series .
This is a great step in merging creativity with famous guitar series which are in demand in the market .
The concept behind vivid guitars is , they will be featuring images of vivid ’s adult film stars .
The prime models are Stefani Morgan Tempest and Brianna Banks .
Both these models are based on the Schecter Tempest series and have identical features , the only difference is that of the design based on photos of different artists .
Almost every person has an ideal artist .
Those artists are like god to them .
These vivid guitars are like an angel musical instrument for music and instrument lovers .
The guitars with graphics of favorite artists even give more motivation to play it , at times when someone does n’t feel motivated enough to work on the musical instrument .
A look and feel of something are always a motivational factor , in any field .
Moreover , the demand for vivid guitars arises when you get bored of watching the same guitar lying beside your bed .
Then it calls for a change definitely .
And this change is actually good and motivating .
The market for vivid guitars is quite wide and varied .
Awesome designs are available for guitars with any size , any shape , any style , or any finish .
Vivid guitars basically fall under the category of customized guitars .
People go for customizations according to their choice and preferences .
If we talk about some famous vivid guitar models in the market , Schecter Tempest ’s name would definitely come into the picture .
This model may be a limited run launched by Vivid production , but it is super clean .
It plays great and it is referred to as “ the lightweight screamer ” .
The look is quite cool and get the attention of many !
Design : –
If we talk about the design , famous vivid guitars like Stefani Morgan Tempest have a good - looking design which is quite impressive .
If we go into the details , it has tempest body design and maple neck .
The scale length goes up to 24.75 ’’.
Moreover , it has humbucker and 2 Schecter Alnico pickups , Tune - O - Matic bridge , 3 –way pickup switch , and two volume and one tone control with a push or pulls options .
The overall review of the design is quite satisfactory .
The reason for this is user - friendliness , the most important factor which makes the model quite unique and in demand .
But there may be one downside , that people may pay more attention to the guitar rather than the player ’s playing skills .
After all , the photo belongs to Brianna Banks Tempest .
The vivid guitars come in various variations in the market .
Some of the famous ones are Brianna Banks Tempest and Stefani Morgan Tempest .
Summary :
– Vivid guitars are an amazing category in the guitar world .
They provide an awesome look and feel to the users who love to have the image of their favorite artist imprinted on their guitar so that they are always motivated to play with their instrument .

RUSSIA is a strong , sovereign and prosperous country , surrounded by enemies and traitors who are bent on undermining its geopolitical power .
Upstarts such as Estonia and Poland are trying to spoil Russia 's far more important relationships with proper European countries , such as Germany or France .
The freshly - baked European Union ( EU ) members act on the instructions of America , a hypocritical and arrogant dictator of the world order , which pretends to be a democracy but in fact is closer to the Third Reich .
This , in short and perhaps a bit exaggerated , is the view of Europe from behind the Kremlin wall , intensified by the state media , and shared by many Russians .
And it is with this view in mind that Vladimir Putin , Russia 's president , greets Condoleezza Rice , America 's secretary of state , on Monday May 14th .
She , seven years ago , famously argued that Russia was a weak and incoherent country .
Russia 's sense of power has been enhanced over the weekend by Mr Putin 's brinkmanship in central Asia .
To the irritation of the White House , Russia has apparently persuaded Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to build a pipeline for the export of gas through , rather than around , Russia .
If it actually goes ahead this would spoil American plans for a trans - Caspian pipeline which is seen as crucial for diversifying sources of energy to Europe .
Russia 's rhetorical hostility towards America is reaching levels unseen since the cold war ended .
Indeed , even in the late Soviet period anti-American propaganda was less emotional and certainly less sincere than it is today .
The question now is whether the noisy words will be translated into action .
That may become a bit clearer at the end of Ms Rice 's two - day long visit to Moscow .
There is a fundamental difference in how Russia and America see each other .
To Russia , America is more a domestic concern than a foreign one .
Russia 's sense of self - esteem has long been inseparable from its relationship with America .
A confrontation with the world 's most powerful country restores to Russians a sense of purpose and urgency which had been lost in the post - Soviet years .
“ America is a crucial part of Russian life and its self - consciousness .
America consolidates Russia 's elite and prolongs their existence , ” says Lilia Shevtsova of the Carnegie Moscow Centre .
America has no such obsession with Russia .
Russia is an important consideration in the country 's foreign policy — no more and no less .
In the words of one Russianist in Washington , DC , it is not Russian - American relations that shape world affairs , but world affairs that shape Russian - America relations .
Russia matters to America mainly as a factor in other important policy areas such as Iran and Kosovo .
As a veto - wielding member of the UN Security Council , Russia has the ability and , perhaps , the inclination to block important international decisions .
One immediate concern is Russia 's position on the independence of Kosovo .
Russia vocally opposes a plan by Martti Ahtisaari , a former Finnish president , that would see Kosovo become independent under EU supervision .
Russia 's sympathies for Serbia , which opposes independence for Kosovo , could be enough to produce a veto from Moscow .
So Ms Rice is trying , during this trip , to persuade Mr Putin that Russia should merely abstain on the Kosovo resolution when it comes before the UN .
The danger of Russia blocking the UN resolution is that it would make Kosovo 's move to independence more fraught .
It would also help bring to the fore the fact that the EU is divided over Kosovo .
For some time Russia has been trying to split the new and old members of the union .
The latest arguments in Brussels suggest that it might be succeeding .
Tension is high ahead of the Russia - EU bi-annual summit which starts on Friday May 18th .
For example Lithuania , which is fed up with Russian bullying and the blockage of an oil refinery , proposes to block wide - ranging negotiations with the Kremlin , to the infuriation of Germany which holds the EU 's rotating presidency .
Lithuania argues it is meaningless to talk about close ties with Russia and the EU must not hide behind diplomatic niceties .
That suggests a rancorous summit is on the cards .
The prospect for Mr Putin 's meeting with Ms Rice does not appear to be much better .

First of all , let me say that I loved writing this .
See , when I was in college , I would walk by the Quad and see a poster for some new book - exchange service literally every week .
“ SCREW THE BOOKSTORE !!! ” it would say .
“ TRADE YOUR USED BOOKS WITH THIS NEW SERVICE ! ”
The idea is that bookstores charge too much , so why not give the power back to the students and let them trade books at the end of the quarter ?
Perhaps one reason could be that this is one of the worst business ideas on Earth–yet it persists in thousands of colleges with many students pursuing the same dismal goal .
Why ?
Because it ’s a stupid frat - boy business idea .
A stupid frat - boy business idea is an idea that sounds attractive on the surface , but ignores the graveyard of failures before it .
It ’s usually hatched when a few guys get together , drink a lot , and end up talking about stuff that “ should ” exist .
Sometimes the discussion gets entrepreneurial and they talk about a few ideas , which one of the guys will pursue the next day ( when everyone else forgets about it ) .
“ No !
Do n’t do it ! ” I want to say .
Do something else , but not that .
It was a stupid frat - boy business idea .
But I can’t , because this frat boy probably is n’t reading my blog ( also , he is imaginary ) .
Now , a quick caveat : I totally admire people who take ideas and do something with them .
It does n’t matter if you make money or not for your first project ; the biggest problem with doing anything entrepreneurial is getting started .
I ’ve written about this before .
But frat - boy business ideas are expressly started to make money –they ’re portrayed as “ companies ” –and they ignore the fact that these ideas hardly ever succeed .
If you ’re going to do something cool , why pick something that dooms yourself to failure ?
Here are the worst stupid frat - boy business ideas :
Book exchanges .
Without fail , college students love to complain about textbook prices .
Also without fail , some joker on every campus in America will start a book - exchange service this week .
Saving money and screwing the bookstore sounds nice , except for a few problems :
Book exchanges are worthless unless there are a lot of people on it ; this chicken - and - egg problem is really hard .
Developing a website for this is n’t trivial .
And although the creators love to proclaim this a “ company ” instead of just a project , they usually forget to create a way to make money .
Finally , one minor point : NO BOOK EXCHANGE HAS EVER REALLY SUCCEEDED .
I HATE TO CRUSH DREAMS BUT PLEASE FORGET ABOUT THIS .

T - shirt companies .
We all love to think that our clever ideas will be so loved that thousands of people will buy t- shirts with them , but there are already millions of clever shirts out there .
Seriously , search for funny t- shirts .
Having started a t - shirt company myself ( Bittershirts.com ) , I feel entitled to spend a little time on this .
When I started mine , it was for one reason :
To put some funny shirts out there and build my personal brand .
2 out of my 3 shirts were failures , but the 3rd one took off almost exclusively due to luck .
THERE IS NO MONEY IN T -SHIRTS .
It ’s a hopeless business with no margins and horrible inventory problems .
“ But BustedTees does it ! ” you might say .
Yeah , and I beat my friend Doug in H - O - R - S - E five years ago .
That does n’t mean I can be Michael Jordan .

Coffee shops / restaurants .
Although few college students actually open coffee shops , many of the people who do are suffering from the same stupid frat - boy business syndrome .
It goes something like this : “ Oh , a coffee shop !
How cute !
We can make a cute little place where people come and drink espresso every day ! ”
I would be more than a little hesitant to invest in a business based on cutey feelings –especially one with high fixed costs , labor costs , and customers who ( 1 ) wo n’t switch from their regular place and ( 2 ) if they do , they ’ll sit at a table the entire day .
Also , see one man ’s story of how opening a coffee shop ruined his life .
Basically , this coffee example consists of any business idea that centers around a romantic idea ( independent bookstore , bed and breakfast , etc ) .

Anything that is “ the Netflix of ___ , ” “ Flickr + ___ , ” or “ Facebook + ___. ” These companies had wild success , and now there are 50 million copycat companies .
You are one of them .
Also , maybe we ’re just not ready for ideas like “ the Netflix of furniture ! ” and “ Flickr + Tic - tac - toe . ”

Ideas that compete on price .
I was worried about putting this one down until I heard a friend of a friend say he was going to start a service to compete with Wal - mart on price .
WAL - MART , THE WORLD ’S MOST TECHNICALLY ADVANCED COMPANY IN LOGISTICS AND PRICING .
Anyway , listen up :
It seems like competing on price would be a good thing , until you realize that when you lower the price , you usually make less money .
People are completely willing to spend more for other things like design ( Target ) , service ( Ritz - Carlton ) , hot people ( Hooters ) , etc .
Do n’t compete on price .
Once you factor in things like time and gas costs , it ’s very hard to compete against the scale of bigger stores .
Also , you ’ll get the worst clients –the ones you ’ll have to pry money from –frustrating you with your low cash flow .

Discount cards .
College students love to try connecting local merchants to their campus , negotiating deals , figuring out how to print a real laminated card , setting up a website , and more .
They just forget one thing : customers .
Hardly anybody buys these things , whether they save money or not .
“ But mine is the best because … ” frat - boy creators say .
Well , do they own a discount card ?

Yet another social network .
After Facebook took off , you could stand in line at any Silicon Valley McDonald ’s and hear 15 people talking about starting their own social networks .
“ It ’s different because … _____ ” they would say .
AND YET , THEY’RE NO DIFFERENT !
The chicken - and - egg problem is pronounced here , with fickle users who go from one site to another like roving vikings .
( Remember , just a few years ago we all thought that everyone would be on Friendster forever . )
Also , it ’s not popular until it ’s popular .
In other words , early growth does n’t mean much for later growth , and there ’s a lot of luck involved .
Will there ever be another social network ?
Of course .
But the chances any individual one will take off are infinitesimally small .
Just ask yourself :
Would you use another social network ?

Anything where you plan to make your money exclusively from ads .
If your business consists of doing something and making money off ads , do some research and you ’ll discover that for most situations , ads do n’t pay very much .
Really .
The point is n’t to mock these ideas .
Well , yeah it is .
If you ’re going to do something entrepreneurial , DO IT !!
Do n’t let some guy ’s blog post stop you .
But do n’t waste your own time .
Learn from ideas that have failed and will continue to fail .
Of course there will be exceptions , but you should try to get every edge to succeed you can .
And if that means taking a few minutes to research your idea before you start , good .
And do n’t ever , ever start a book - exchange company .

A CANCER victim claims he will die because his sister will not donate her bone marrow .
Leukaemia sufferer Simon Pretty , 46 , has a rare tissue type and doctors believe sibling Helen , 43 , is the only person in the world who is a perfect match .
But she refuses to have the vital operation and the chances of finding another donor are slim - which means the dad - of - three could die within months .
His partner Jacqueline Fenton now fears she will be left to bring up their children Rebecca , eight , Jack , six , and Benjamin , three , on her own .
Simon , who is having chemotherapy , said : " We found a prayer in Rebecca 's coat which said , ' Please do n't let my daddy die from cancer . '
That brought tears to my eyes .
" When people hear about what has happened they are lost for words , " said the human resources manager from Mobberley , Cheshire .
In July 2004 , he was diagnosed with the rare cancer acute promyelocytic leukaemia .
Simon , who admits he was never close to his sister , claims she agreed to help but then changed her mind .
Doctors only gave him a 45 per cent chance of surviving the first stage of chemotherapy at the Christie Hospital in Manchester .
Then , in January , Simon returned home and broke down over the cure that was being denied him .
In desperation , Jacqueline visited Helen at her home hoping she could convince her .
But the mother - of - two again refused to have the op , claiming : " I am putting my family first . "
Jacqueline revealed : " I said , ' Do n't you care if your brother dies ? '
She said , ' It 's very sad ' . "
She launched herself at Helen .
The pair scuffled on the doorstep and Jacqueline was arrested .
No further action was taken but Helen 's solicitor instructed Jacqueline to stay away .
Helen , who runs a private education business in Wilmslow , Cheshire , refused to comment .
Bone marrow cells can be extracted from a hole drilled in the pelvic bone , an operation done under general anaesthetic .
A less invasive technique involves injecting a growth hormone to stimulate cell movement in the blood before harvesting cells .
Golden Arches Wants ' McJob ' Removed McDonald 's Targets the English McLanguage
The word has only been in the English language for two decades , but the hamburger chain McDonald 's would like to see the word " McJob " McEliminated from the dictionary -- the fast food firm is not lovin ' the OED 's definition .
I went away on a family vacation at the first part of this week and just got back last night .
During that time , I completely missed the whole Reddit scandal .
It seems like the guys at Reddit ended up choosing to rewrite Reddit in Python because Lisp just was n't working for them .
To some , this seems to be a slap in the face of Lisp .
However , if you look at spez 's blog entry , you can see that the rationale for choosing Python was pretty sane .
In particular , this paragraph was interesting ( also quoted by John at Lemonodor ) :
Emacs and SLIME are a killer combination , but I develop on a Mac , and reddit.com is a FreeBSD box .
On my Mac , my choices of threaded Lisp implementations was limited to OpenMCL , and in FreeBSD it 's CMUCL .
Because of the low - level socket and threading code we had to write , reddit would not run on my Mac , and I was always tethered to our FreeBSD development server .
Not being able to program offline is a pain .
In a comment on Lemonodor , Steve Huffman said :
The biggest trouble that plagued us was that we could never quite get Lisp reddit stable enough to sleep at night .
There were weird threading issues that would bring the site to its knees a couple times a day and required constant monitoring .
Now , here 's where the Lisp psychosis comes in .
Rather than suggesting that the guys at Reddit were dopes , or that they did n't try hard enough , or that they should have done such and such a workaround , blah , blah , I wish Lispers would step up and internalize that the Reddit experience was a great case study and that the community should work to solve the issues it raised .
These guys did not have a bad Lisp experience .
In fact , they are quite complimentary of Lisp .
For example :
Lisp is an amazing language .
After spending the entire summer working entirely in Lisp , it 's nearly impossible to work in another language and not say to myself , " If only this were Lisp ... "
Lisp has many goodies that make programming in it a joy : the REPL , macros and the lack of syntax are some .
I wo n't go into the details , but rest assured , it 's cool .
People become Lisp zealots for a reason .
So here 's what I took away from the Reddit feedback :
Lisp is a great language .
Keep this point in mind .
The Reddit developers gave Lisp compliments ; they did n't ' diss it .
Lisp has a balkanized feature set .
Some ( necessary ! ) things to build modern applications are not cross-platform .
When you have to work on multiple machines and environments , which is more and more the norm these days , there are no open source implementations of Lisp that run across the dominant environments without differences .
( CLISP comes the closest , but you may or may not be able to tolerate its GPL license terms . )
Because these features are not standardized , you 're left writing compatibility layers if you want things to work across platforms .
In particular , networking and threading are problem areas .
Lisp libraries are scant .
This is a well known problem in the Lisp community .
The standard , basically valid , response is " Jump in and help us write some more libraries . "
( Kudos to Kenny Tilton for driving this line hard .
He 's right , but there 's also a bit more to it than that . )
The library problems are compounded by the balkanization of feature set .
In some cases you can find something that sort of works , but it may work on another implementation , not yours .
If it has any dependencies on the problem areas of threads and networking , you 've got a long road of tweaking ahead to get it to work .
This time is better spent getting on with your real task .
Edi Weitz ( yet again ) wins the Lisp Superhero award for creating the best libraries out there , bar none .
Seriously , if anybody aspires to create libraries that are well - used , go take some cues from Edi .
His code is always high quality , his APIs and implementations are always complete , he 's absolutely responsive to problem reports , he provides great documentation , and he often tests his code across multiple implementations , trying to make them as cross- platform as possible .
In short , you could n't expect better service and support from a commercial vendor , and Edi releases his code as open source .
Okay , all that said , what 's the constructive response here ?
My suggestions are :
First , stop grumbling and suggesting workarounds to the Reddit folks .
They did the Lisp community a great service by documenting their experiences .
Rather than harrassing them , sit down and talk with them to get more info .
Next , focus on the foundational balkanization problems .
In my opinion , the biggest issues with Lisp are the lack of standard ( defacto or otherwise ) networking and threading APIs .
If those were in place , it would be a lot easier to get libraries that worked all over the place .
Would this solve everything ?
No , but it would go a long way and would enable lots of other innovation on top of that foundation instead of having everybody spending time creating compatibility libraries and generally re-inventing the wheel .
Work on getting a good cross-platform , open source Lisp implementation with a liberal license .
Like I said previously , I really like CLISP , and I use it for developing on Windows , but the license is not suitable for all code since it all - but - forces your code to be released as GPL .
I 'd really love to see SBCL or CMUCL ported to Windows , with the full set of functionality .
I 'd also love to see SBCL 's baseline functionality present on all platforms ( currently threading only works on Linux , for instance , not BSD ) .
By the way , this is no knock on any other Lisp implementation .
I just happen to use SBCL on Linux and think it rocks .
If OpenMCL can make the jump off of Mac onto other platforms , that would be great .
Or maybe GCL can do the job .
I do n't know the exact route , but the fact is the lack of a baseline functionality across all platforms is hurting us .
Can I do all the above ?
Nope .
I 've tried grokking the internals of SBCL and I 'm only qualified to kibitz around the margins .
I stand in awe of guys like William , Christophe , Dan , Nikodemus , Gabor , Juho , Alexey , and many others ( Update : I added to this list twice already because I felt so bad for leaving out somebody 's name -- sorry William and Nikodemus .
If you 're a significant SBCL contributor -- or even and insignificant one -- believe me when I say I stand in awe of you too ;-) .
I do try to help out SBCL by reducing the friction for newbies to get started with Lisp , compiling the RPM binaries that are available on SourceForge and maintaining the FedoraLisp.org
Yum repository .
That said , I 'm going to start working on the networking API issues .
You 'll see a document from me posted over the next couple of weeks .
It 's been in process for a few months , but I finally got a hankering to finish it with this Reddit bru - ha - ha .
If you 're interested in networking APIs and have a desire to help in such an endeavor , please drop me a line ( dave at findinglisp ) .
I 'd love to spread the work around .
If somebody else wants to grab the threading stuff by the throat that would be great .
Above all , stay productive .
Use the Reddit feedback to motivate you to make Lisp better .
Whatever you do , stop suggesting workarounds to the Reddit guys or making them feel bad for the choices they made .
They seem like smart guys , so let 's assume that they did what they did knowing all the options ( they do have Paul Graham on the board , so I 'm guessing that they talked about this before they did the rewrite ) .
They have moved on and our job is to make any such workaround unnecessary for the next crew that tries to use Lisp .
And before anybody says it , yes I know that the commercial Lisp vendors have solved some of these problems .
I have discussed before some of my thoughts about the various license terms the vendors use .
It is n't that those terms are bad in the abstract , they just do n't allow those implementations to solve the problem I 'm interested in .
In short , I think it would help drive Lisp adoption if a common , cross- platform , free , open source version existed , in the same way that GCC has helped democratize programming in C .
The next - best alternative would be a $ 99 " Turbo Lisp " environment ala Borland 's language products in the 1980s / 1990s .
Perhaps the Lispworks guys will offer such a thing ( hint , hint ;-) .
Instead of paying good cash for cd cases , which eventually break and end up in a landfill , how about creating your own , unique folded - paper cd cases that are biodegradable and take up a fraction of the space ?
Related Video :
The Props :
8 ½ " by 11 " paper
a cd
a computer ( optional )
labels ( optional )
The Procedure :
1. Center a cd , which you ’ll be using as a guide , at the top of a sheet of paper , as shown .
2 . Fold in sides of paper to sides of cd .
3 . Center cd at the middle of the folded paper .
4 . Fold bottom up .
5 . Fold the horizontal creases , which I ’ve identified in red , to sides as indicated by arrows , so the creases are even with sides of original folded sides .
( I ’ve identified the creases in question with dashed lines for illustration . )
6 . You 'll have a box - shape sticking up toward you after making the folds in step 5 .
Just fold this flap down flat as shown below .
7 . Tuck the " ears " that are sticking out to the sides in between the original side folds and the fold created in step 4 .
8 . Slip cd into front pocket and fold down top half of paper .
9 . Dog -ear the top two corners of the top half of paper .
10 .
Slip top half of paper into pocket .
The original is pretty generic , but to give your cd holder some pizzazz as well as a personal touch , print labels and photos on the front center of paper .
Print the name of that book you wrote or are working on .
Any paper , of course , will do including postal wrap , grocery bags or something of the decorative variety .
A sheet of heavier - weight wrapping paper with a printed label makes a great way to store and share holiday pictures .

For many web developers , myself included , the most intimidating part of the design process is getting started .
Imagine for a moment that you ’re sitting at your desk with nothing other than a cup of coffee and the business card of a potential client who needs a basic corporate web site .
Usually , a business card speaks volumes about a company ’s identity , and could be used as design inspiration .
Unfortunately , that ’s not the case with the card for Smith Services in Figure 1.1 .
It ’s black and white , all text , no character , blah .
Talk about a blank canvas !
So , where do you go from here ?
You need a plan … and you need to contact Mr. Smith .
With some critical input from the client about what his company actually does , and by gathering information about the content you have to work with , you ’ll be able to come up with a successful layout and design .

Anyone , no matter what level of artistic talent he or she has , can come up with a design that works well and looks good–all it takes is a little experience and a working knowledge of some basic layout principles .
The book from which this article is excerpted , The Principles of Beautiful Web Design , covers each of these principles in turn , showing even the least design - oriented of us how to create beautiful , elegant , functional designs — see the Table of Contents for details .
You can download this article — Chapter 1 of the book — in PDF format to read offline .
So let ’s get started with the basics and before long you ’ll have the foundation necessary to design gallery - quality web sites .
The Design Process
In a web programming book I read recently , the author introduced a fictional scenario to explain why readers needed to design a page layout and create a style sheet for the example application .
He basically said that the company web designer was off getting inspiration from somewhere and would n’t be back until later in the year .
It sounded as if he was implying that designers are prone to flake out and go on vision quests for months at a time , but I ’m going to assume the author made that comment in an endearing way , and introduce the same scenario .
Here are the hypothetical details of this scenario : Jim Smith of Smith Services needs a web site .
We have his business card and he ’s eager to get started .
Unfortunately , the designer is out of town … wait , that ’s not a good excuse .
Let ’s say he was injured during a freak dairy cow stampede while attending the South by South West Interactive ( SXSWi ) festival in Austin , Texas .
Yeah , that ’s believable .
Anyway , he ’s out for a few months , and you ’re on your own .
So where do you start ?
The actual process of developing an entire site or web application includes a lot of steps , but the process of creating a design comp boils down to only two tasks : discovery and implementation .
Discovery
The discovery component of the design process is about meeting the clients and discovering what they do .
This may not feel like a “ designy : task , but gathering information about who your clients are and how they run their business is the only way you ’ll be able to come up with an appropriate and effective design .
Before you schedule your first meeting with your clients , take a few minutes to figure out what they do and how they do it .
If they ’ve asked you to design a web site for them , they may not currently have one , but Google them anyway .
If you ca n’t find any information about their business specifically , try to learn a little more about their industry before the first meeting .
Whenever possible , the first meeting with a client should be an actual person - to - person meeting .
Sometimes , distance will dictate that the initial meeting will occur over the phone , but if the client is in town , schedule a time to meet .
Keep in mind that this meeting is n’t about impressing the client , selling yourself , or selling a web site .
The initial client meeting is about communication .
Try to listen more than you speak , and bring a pad of paper on which you can make notes .
Do not bring a laptop .
Computers have screens , and people tend to stare at them .
If the client is n’t staring at the screen the whole time , you will be as you write your notes .
If you must drag some technology into the meeting , bring a voice recorder .
In my experience , though , a pad of paper is less threatening to the often not - so - tech - savvy client .
Here are a few of the questions I like to ask in initial client meetings even if I ’ve already answered them myself via a search engine :
What does the company do ?
What is your role in the company ?
Does the company have an existing logo or brand ?
What is your goal in developing a web site ?
What information do you wish to provide online ?
Who comprises your target audience ?
Do its members share any common demographics , like age , sex , or a physical location ?
Who are your competitors and do they have web sites ?
Sometimes I start off with more questions than those listed here–use your imagination and try to come up with some creative queries that will really give you more insight into the client organization .
If you ’re a programmer , avoid the tech jargon .
If you ’re a designer , avoid talking specifically about design .
Sure , that may be all you ’re thinking about , but semantic markup , fluid and fixed layouts , and color schemes will likely mean very little to the client .
Worse still , these types of conversations can bring misguided design opinions your way even before you get a chance to start thinking about the design yourself .
Implementation
The next step in the design process is to take what you ’ve learned from the client and use it to create a design .
Regardless of the project , try not to get caught up in the technology associated with building web sites–at least not at first .
At this point , it should n’t matter whether the site is going to comprise straight HTML , a template for a content management system , or a Ruby on Rails application ; the bottom line is that we have an interface to design and a blank sheet of paper .
“ Paper ? ”
That ’s right , paper .
Did you really think I was going to let you get back to your precious computer right after the client meeting was over ?
No way .
Here ’s why : it ’s easy to lose focus on the design if you start thinking about the layout in front of a computer .
If you start out on paper , you can ignore the technical limitations of browsers and CSS , and focus on how you want the final product to look .
Now you might think that all good designers carry around fancy hardbound sketch books in which they use expensive markers and paint to design masterpiece renderings of web page layouts .
For me , the equivalent is a 79 - cent spiral - bound notebook and any writing instrument I can find on my desk that still works .
I start out by sketching a few possible layouts .
After a few of these sketches , I decide on one I like , jump into Photoshop , and use the rectangle tool to block out the areas I ’ve marked down on my paper .
Once I ’ve defined my layout , I experiment with foreground and background colors until I have a solid color scheme .
I continue twiddling the Photoshop knobs and pushing around pixels until , finally , I have a comp to show the client .
Simple , right ?
Okay , perhaps I skipped a few steps in that brief description .
Honestly , though , when people ask me how I do what I do , they usually get a similar explanation .
The truth is that there are bundles of now - subconscious information from my past experience and those old college design and art classes that have helped me to define my own design process .
Learning how to design is like learning how to program .
Some people have a bit of a knack for it , but anyone can learn .
Just as there is good code and ugly code , there is good design and ugly design .
Learning some of the principles and conventions that are associated with design will help you to understand the difference between the good and the ugly , and help you toward establishing your own design process .
Defining Good Design
There are two main standpoints from which most people determine whether a web site design is “ good ” or “ bad . ”
There ’s a strict usability standpoint , which focuses on functionality , the effective presentation of information , and efficiency .
Then there ’s the purely aesthetic perspective , which is all about presentation , hot animations , and sexy graphics .
Some designers get caught up in the aesthetics and graphics and forget about the user , and some usability gurus get lost in their user testing and forget about visual appeal .
In order to reach people and retain their interest , it ’s essential to maximize both .
The most important thing to keep in mind is that design is about communication .
If you create a web site that works and presents information well , but looks ugly or does n’t fit with the client ’s brand , no one will want to use it .
Similarly , if you make a beautiful web site that is n’t usable and accessible , people may not be able to use it .
Indeed , the elements and functionality of a finished web site design should work as a single cohesive unit , so that :
Users are pleased by the design but drawn to the content
One of the biggest concerns among usability professionals is the time it takes users to scan the page for the information they want , be it a piece of content , a link to another page , or a form field .
The design should not be a hindrance ; it should act as a conduit between the user and the information .
John Oxton ’s Bus Full of Hippies template ( pictured in Figure 1.2 ) is a great example of a design that ’s both beautiful and usable .
The colorful graphics grow around the blocks of content , leading the eye back to the information without interfering with the pages ’ readability or organization .
Figure 1.2 : The Bus Full of Hippies template
Users can move about easily via intuitive navigation
We ’ll talk more about the placement of navigation later , but the main navigation block itself should be clearly visible on the page , and each link should have a descriptive title .
A navigation structure that not only changes appearance on mouse hover , but also indicates the active page or section , as does the menu shown in Figure 1.3 , helps users recognize where they are , and how to get where they want to go .
Figure 1.3 : A navigation menu from Iconfactory ‘s Halloween 2006 theme
Secondary navigation , search fields , and outgoing links should not be dominant features of the page .
If we make these items easy to find , and separate them visually from the content , we allow users to focus on the information , though they ’ll know where to look when they ’re ready to move on to other content .
Users recognize each page as belonging to the site
Even if there ’s a dramatic difference between the layout of the homepage and the rest of the site , a cohesive theme or style should exist across all the pages of a site to help hold the design together .
Take a look at the screenshots of Steve Smith ’s Ordered List in Figure 1.4 .
Although the content blocks on these pages are divided differently , there are several visual indicators that let users know that these are pages from the same site .
Much of this unity is due to the repetition of the identity and navigation blocks .
The consistent use of a very limited color palette ( black , white , green , and cyan ) also helps to unify the pages .
Figure 1.4 : Pages from Ordered List
Web Page Anatomy
Figure 1.5 : The anatomy of a web page
Even from a non-designer ’s standpoint , defining a design that satisfies all of the requirements I outlined above is a simple task .
It ’s similar to making a phrase on your refrigerator with magnetic poetry words .
Although there are millions of ways to arrange the words , only a few arrangements make any sense .
The magnetic poetry words are like the components , or blocks , of the web page .
Although the number of these necessary blocks depends on the size and subject of the site , most web sites have the following components , as shown in Figure 1.5 .
Containing Block
Every web page has a container .
This could be in the form of the page ’s body tag , an all - containing div tag , or ( and I really do n’t want to say this , but ) a table .
Without some sort of container , we would have no place to put the contents of our page .
The elements would drift beyond the bounds of our browser window and off into empty space .
The width of the container can be liquid , meaning it expands to fill the width of the browser window ; or fixed , so that the content is the same width no matter what size the window is .
Logo
When designers refer to an identity , they ’re referring to the logo and colors that exist across a company ’s various forms of marketing , such as business cards , letterhead , brochures , and so on .
The identity block that appears on the web site should contain the company ’s logo or name , and sit at the top of each page of the web site .
The identity block increases brand recognition and lets users know that the pages they ’re viewing are part of a single site .
Navigation
It ’s essential that the site ’s navigation system is easy to find and use .
Users expect to see navigation right at the top of the page .
Whether you plan to use vertical menus down the side of the page , or a horizontal menu along the page ’s top , the navigation should be as close to the top of the layout as possible .
At the very least , all main navigation items should appear “ above the fold . ”
Content
Content is king .
A typical web site visitor will enter and leave a web site in a matter of seconds .
If visitors ca n’t find what they ’re looking for , they will undoubtedly close the browser or move on to another site .
It ’s important to keep the main content block as the focal point of a design so that precious seconds are n’t wasted as visitors scan the page for the information they need .
Footer
Located at the bottom of the page , the footer usually contains copyright , contact , and legal information , as well as a few links to the main sections of the site .
By separating the end content from the bottom of the browser window , the footer should indicate to users that they ’re at the bottom of the page .
Whitespace
The graphic design term whitespace ( or negative space ) literally refers to any area of a page that ’s not covered by type or illustrations .
While many novice web designers ( and most clients ) feel a need to fill every inch of a web page with photos , text , tables , and data , having empty space on a page is every bit as important as having content .
Without carefully planned whitespace , a design will feel closed in , like a crowded room .
Whitespace helps a design to “ breathe ” by guiding the user ’s eye around a page , but also helps to create balance and unity –two important concepts that we ’ll discuss in more detail later in this chapter .
At this point , we ’ve had our initial meeting with Mr. Smith , our theoretical client , and it was very helpful .
He explained very thoroughly what he does and what he wants the site to achieve .
Even though we do n’t have actual content yet , we can use the standard blocks of web page anatomy to start developing a layout .
Although other site - specific blocks are worked into the designs of many web site layouts , the web page anatomy works to summarize the most common blocks .
Now that we have this information , how can we use it to create a foundational layout for Smith ’s Services ?
It ’s time for some grid theory .
Grid Theory
When most people think about grids , they think about engineering and architecture .
However , the grid is an essential tool for graphic design as well .
Using a grid is not just about making things be square and line up : it ’s about proportion as well .
That ’s where the “ theory ” comes into grid theory .
Many art historians credit Dutch painter Piet Mondrian as the father of graphic design for his sophisticated use of grids .
Yet classical grid theory has influenced successful artistic efforts for thousands of years .
The concept of dividing the elements of a composition extends back to the mathematical ideas established by Pythagoras and his followers , who defined numbers as ratios rather than single units .
The Pythagoreans observed a mathematical pattern that occurred so often in nature that they believed it to be divinely inspired .
They referred to this pattern as the golden ratio or divine proportion .
The basic idea is illustrated in Figure 1.6 .
A line can be bisected using the golden ratio by dividing its length by 1.62 .
This magical 1.62 number is really 1.6180339 …
It ’s an irrational number that ’s usually represented as Φ ( pronounced phi ) .
Explaining the math used to come up with this number is a bit too involved for this discussion , and is n’t really going to help you become a better designer , so I ’ll spare you the details .
Besides , my math is a little rusty .
Figure 1.6 : The golden ratio
So just what does this ratio have to do with graphic design ?
In general , compositions divided by lines that are proportionate to the golden ratio are considered to be aesthetically pleasing .
The artists of the Renaissance used divine proportion to design their paintings , sculpture , and architecture , just as designers today often employ this ratio when creating page layouts , posters , and brochures .
Rather than relying on artistic notion , divine proportion gives us logical guidelines for producing appealing layouts .
The Rule of Thirds
A simplified version of the golden ratio is the rule of thirds , or in the native accent of one of my graphic design professors , “ rule of turds . ”
A line bisected by the golden ratio is divided into two sections , one of which is approximately twice the size of the other .
Dividing a composition into thirds is an easy way to apply divine proportion without getting out your calculator .
To start the pencil - and - paper version of your layout , draw a rectangle .
The vertical and horizontal dimensions do n’t really matter , but try to keep straight lines and 90 - degree angles .
Now , divide your rectangle horizontally and vertically by thirds .
As I said before , do n’t start thinking about technology yet .
Next , divide the top third of your layout into thirds again .
Finally , divide each of your columns in half to create a little more of a grid .
You should have a square on your paper that looks similar to the rule of thirds grid in the final diagram of Figure 1.7 .
Go ahead and repeat the above steps so that you have a few rule of thirds grids in which to try different layout options .
With this simple gridwork in place , we can begin to lay out our elements .
The large , main rectangle represents the container that we talked about in the section called “ Web Page Anatomy . ”
When using this method of layout design , I like to place the biggest block first .
Usually , that block represents the content .
In my first rule - of - thirds grid , I place the content block within the two - thirds of the layout at the lower right .
Next , I place my navigation block in the middle third of the left - hand column .
I place the text part of the identity block over the left side of the content , and the image part of the identity over the menu .
Finally , I squash the copyright block below the content , in the right - hand column of the grid .
The result is the top - left of the four possible layout arrangements shown in Figure 1.8 .
Figure 1.8 : Four layouts in grids that follow the rule of thirds
As you experiment with different arrangements , use the lines that create the three main columns as alignment guides for the identity , navigation , content , and footer blocks .
It ’s very tempting to arrange all your elements along one particular line , but try not to let this happen–it ’s not very interesting visually .
Instead , consider pushing part of the block over that line , as I did with the identity block in the examples in Figure 1.8 .
Another tendency for non-designers working on layouts is to center - align everything on a page .
The grid system prevents us from doing that , but there is a reason why we tend to want to center everything .
That reason is a desire for balance .
Balance
In a figurative sense , the concept of visual balance is similar to that of physical balance illustrated by a seesaw .
Just as physical objects have weight , so do the elements of a layout .
If the elements on either side of a layout are of equal weight , they balance one another .
There are two main forms of visual balance : symmetrical and asymmetrical .
Symmetrical Balance
Symmetrical balance , or formal balance , occurs when the elements of a composition are the same on either side of an axis line .
The digital painting Contemplation by David Lanham , shown in Figure 1.9 , is a great example of this concept .
Notice how the male and female figures in this painting are almost the same in position and proportion .
Even the shaded background boxes are mirror images of one another .
Figure 1.9 : Symmetrical balance –Contemplation by David Lanham
Although it may not be practical for all designs and clients , this type of symmetry –called horizontal symmetry –can be applied to web site layouts by centering content or balancing it between columns .
The Grow Collective web site is an example of such symmetry .
Notice on the page shown in Figure 1.10 that the content areas graduate from a single column at the very top of the page , to two columns , to three columns at the bottom of the window ; yet the layout still maintains its symmetrical balance .
Most of the rest of the site ’s content is divided into symmetrical columns as well .
Figure 1.10 : Grow Collective web page
The two other forms of symmetrical balance are less common in web site design , due to the nature of the medium .
However , they ’re commonly exhibited in logo and print design .
These are :
bilateral symmetry , which exists when a composition is balanced on more than one axis
radial symmetry , which occurs when elements are equally spaced around a central point
Asymmetrical Balance
Asymmetrical balance , or informal balance , is a little more abstract , and generally more visually interesting , than symmetrical balance .
Rather than having mirror images on either side of the layout , asymmetrical balance involves objects of differing size , shape , tone , or placement .
These objects are arranged so that , despite their differences , they equalize the weight of the page .
If you have a large object on one side of a page , and you partner it with several smaller items on the other side , the composition can still feel balanced .
The concert poster by my friend Jeremy Darty presented in Figure 1.11 is a fine example of asymmetrical balance .
The visual weight of the large pink flamingo on the left is balanced by the combined weight of the smaller flamingos and small text blocks on the right - hand side of the layout .
Notice also Jeremy ’s use of the rule of thirds .
The blue cloud behind the Pop Sucks title takes up one - third of the vertical space and spans two - thirds of the horizontal .
Take a look at the photo of the three stones in Figure 1.12 .
It may not be a particularly exciting picture , but as far as balance goes , it rocks !
If you were to use a piece of paper to cover any one of the three stones below , the entire photograph would feel unbalanced and unfinished .
This is generally the way balance works .
It ’s as if the entire composition is in a picture frame hanging by a single nail on the wall .
It does n’t take much weight on one side or the other to shift the entire picture off balance .
Unlike symmetrical balance , asymmetrical balance is very versatile , and as such , it ’s used much more often on the web .
If you take a look at most two - column web site layouts , you ’ll notice that the larger column is often very light in color–a tactic that creates a good contrast for the text and the main content .
The diminutive navigational column is often darker , has some sort of border , or is made to stand out in some other way , in order to create balance within the layout .
John Hicks ’s site , Hicksdesign , which is shown in Figure 1.13 , is an excellent example of asymmetrical balance .
The heavy brown sidebar , which contains the logo and main navigation for the site , stays fixed on the right - hand side of the layout even when the content scrolls .
This ever - present element provides interest and balance to the rest of the content on the page .
Figure 1.13 : Hicksdesign–an example of asymmetrical balance
Many principles are at work in the design of John Hicks ’s site –this design is n’t just about asymmetrical balance .
The site has great harmony , which comes from the repeated , brightly colored bullets , similarly colored headers , and consistent typefaces .
Part of that harmony arises from the fact that the site meets the principles of unity .
Unity
Design theory describes unity as referring to the way in which the different elements of a composition interact with one another .
A unified layout is one that works as a whole rather than being identified as separate pieces .
Take the monkeys in Figure 1.14 , for example .
Their similar colors and shapes mean that they can easily be recognized as forming a group , rather than merely being four monkeys .
Although it ’s not such an issue these days , unity is one of the many reasons why web designers have always despised HTML frames .
It ’s important that unity exists not only within each element of a web page , but across the entire web page – the page itself must work as a unit .
We can use a couple of approaches to achieve unity in a layout ( aside from avoiding frames ) : proximity and repetition .
Proximity
Proximity is an obvious , but often overlooked way to make a group of objects feel like a single unit .
Placing objects close together within a layout creates a focal point toward which the eye will gravitate .
Take a look at the digital painting in Figure 1.15 .
While composed of a seemingly random assortment of strokes , the five strokes that are the closest together appear to form a unified object .
Figure 1.15 : Creating a group using proximity
We practice the concept of proximity on the Web when we start setting margins and padding for elements .
For instance , when I define the CSS style rules for most sites , I usually change the default margin that exists between common HTML elements such as headings ( h1 , h2 , h3 … ) , paragraphs , blockquotes , and even images .
By altering these values , I can cause more or less space to appear between elements , thereby creating groups .
If you look at the two columns of text in Figure 1.16 , you ’ll notice that they look very similar .
The only difference is in the placement of the headings .
In the column on the left , the word “ Unkgnome ” is equi-distant from the top and bottom paragraphs .
This results in a heading that looks more like a separator than a heading for the next paragraph .
In the second column , the “ Gnomenclature ” heading is placed closer to the paragraph that follows it .
In accordance with the rules of proximity , this heading appears to belong to that block of text .
Figure 1.16 : Proximity between headers and content
Repetition
A gaggle of geese , a school of fish , a pride of lions .
Any time you bring a set of like items together , they form a group .
In the same way , repetition of colors , shapes , textures , or similar objects helps to tie a web page design together so that it feels like a cohesive unit .
The example in Figure 1.17 illustrates repetition .
Even though there are other similar strokes around , the nine red strokes on the left - hand side appear to be a unified group because they repeat a shape , color , and texture .
The strokes to the right of this group have no repeated pattern , so they appear isolated even though there are other shapes nearby .
Figure 1.17 : Creating a group using repetition
Whether you notice it or not , repetition is often used in web site designs to unify elements of the layout .
A good example of this concept at work among unmodified HTML elements is the bulleted list .
The bullet that precedes each list item is a visual indicator that the bullet items are parts of a whole .
Repeated patterns and textures can also help to unify a design .
Take a look at the screenshot of Left Justified , the personal site of Australian designer Andrew Krespanis .
This layout contains many eye - catching elements , but the repeated use of the red wood texture in the header , menu , and page borders literally hold this design together .
Figure 1.18 : Left Justified homepage
Emphasis
Closely related to the idea of unity is the concept of emphasis or dominance .
Rather than focusing on getting the various elements of a design to fit together , emphasis is about making a particular element draw the viewer ’s attention .
When you design a web page layout , often you ’ll identify an item in the content , or the layout itself , that you want to stand out .
Perhaps it ’s a button you want users to press , or an error message that you want them to read .
One method of achieving such emphasis is by making that element into a focal point .
A focal point is anything on a page that draws the viewer ’s eye , rather than just feeling like part of the page as a whole or blending in with its surroundings .
As with unity , there are a few tried and true methods of achieving a focal point .
Placement
Although the constraints of practical web design do not often allow for it , the direct center of a composition is the point at which users look first , and is always the strongest location for producing emphasis .
The further from the center an element is , the less likely it is to be noticed first ; for an example of this , see Figure 1.19 .
Figure 1.19 : Continuance and placement –creating emphasis
Continuance
The idea behind continuance is that when our eyes start moving in one direction , they tend to continue along that path until a more dominant feature comes along .
Figure 1.19 demonstrates this effect .
Even though the bottom splotch is bigger and tends to catch your eye first , your brain ca n’t help but go “ Hey , looky there , an arrow ! ”
You ’ll soon find yourself staring at the smaller object .
Continuance is also one of the most common methods that web designers use to unify a layout .
By default , the left edge of headings , copy , and images placed on a web page form a vertical line down the left side of a page before any styling is applied .
A simple way to expand on this concept is to use the rule of thirds to line up other page elements along the lines of your grid .
Isolation
In the same way that proximity helps us create unity in a design , isolation promotes emphasis .
An item that stands out from its surroundings will tend to demand attention .
Even though he ’s sad to not be with his buddies on the other page , the isolated monkey in Figure 1.20 stands out as a focal point on the page .
Contrast
Contrast is defined as the juxtaposition of dissimilar graphic elements , and is the most common method used to create emphasis in a layout .
The concept is simple : the greater the difference between a graphic element and its surroundings , the more that element will stand out .
Contrast can be created using differences in color ( which I ’ll discuss in more detail in Chapter 2 ) , size , and shape .
Take a look at Figure 1.21 .
Figure 1.21 : Woot–using orange for contrast
The site is Woot , an ecommerce web site that sells just one item per day .
When you look at this layout , what ’s the first thing that grabs your attention ?
My guess is it ’s probably the product they ’re selling .
Products at Woot change daily , though , so what grabs your eye after that ?
For me , it ’s the I want one !
button .
Although the same colors are used elsewhere in the design , the oval shape is n’t .
When set against an area of white space , the button has both contrast and isolation working to emphasize it .
The owners of Woot really want you to click that button .
Proportion
One interesting way of creating emphasis in a composition is through the use of proportion .
Proportion is a principle of design that has to do with differences in the scale of objects .
If we place an object in an environment that ’s of larger or smaller scale than the object itself , that object will appear larger or smaller than it does in real life .
This difference in proportion draws viewers ’ attention to the object , as it seems out of place in that context .
In Figure 1.22 , I ’ve taken my monkey and superimposed him over the skyline of Manhattan to prove my point .
Between the sharp contrast in color , and the difference in proportion , your brain immediately says , “ Hey , something ’s not right here , ” and you ’re left staring at the monkey until you force yourself to look away .
Figure 1.22 : Proportion–a monkey in Manhattan
This principle works for miniaturization as well .
If you take a look at my personal web site , Jasongraphix , pictured in Figure 1.23 , one of the first things you might notice on the page is the mini-me leaning against my artwork just under the logo .
As with the I want one !
button on Woot , this little guy stands out because of contrast and isolation , but also because of the eye - catching use of proportion .
Figure 1.23 : Jasongraphix–my personal site , featuring mini-me !
A few standard HTML tags and CSS properties have been designed to take advantage of the preceding theories to create emphasis in a web page even without customization .
For isolation of content consider the blockquote element .
This element indents the left - and right - hand side of any text placed within it , purposely breaking the continuation lines of the page content and drawing attention to itself .
For positioning , consider the position property in CSS .
By absolutely positioning an object with CSS , you take it out of the flow of its containing block , so you can place it strategically to draw attention .
And when you think about contrast , think about the blink tag .
Just kidding !
Do n’t ever think about the blink tag .
Yes , it creates contrast … over and over and over again .
Please do n’t use it .
Do n’t get any ideas about using a marquee tag either .
Design is just as much about what we leave out as it is about what we put in .
Next , we ’ll look at some well - tested examples of designs from which you can work .
Bread - and - butter Layouts
Most of what we ’ve talked about thus far has been design theory .
Theory ’s good , but it can only take us so far toward understanding why some ideas work–and others do n’t–in a web site ’s design .
In my opinion , examples and practice are much more valuable .
Most academic graphic design programs include a curriculum that ’s rich in art history and fine art .
These classes provide a great foundation for an understanding of graphic design from an art perspective , but they do little to prepare you for the specific challenges you encounter when you take your designs to the Web .
Pablo Picasso once said , “ I am always doing that which I can not do , in order that I may learn how to do it . ”
While I like to take that approach when designing a new web site , it ’s important first to know what you can do .
When you look out across the Internet , you can see that the possibilities for layout really are endless .
But , as I said before , only a few of those possibilities make good design sense .
That ’s why we see certain configurations of identity , navigation , and content over and over again .
In this section , we ’ll talk about a few of the most common layouts , and explore some of their advantages and disadvantages .
Left - column Navigation
Regardless of whether we ’re talking about liquid or fixed - width layout design , the left - column navigation format is the de facto standard .
The ThinkGeek site , pictured in Figure 1.24 , is a classic example of this configuration .
Many sites that fit into this mold do n’t necessarily use the left column as the main navigation block –sometimes you ’ll see the navigation along the top of the page–but they still divide the layout below the header into a narrow ( one - third or less ) left column and a wide right column .
It ’s a status quo , like a security blanket , or that comfortable shirt with holes in the armpits that you wear once a week even though it drives your spouse crazy .
For those reasons , a layout featuring left - column navigation is a safe choice for any project .
Figure 1.24 : Left- column navigation at ThinkGeek
The downside to sites that use left - column navigation is that they can lack creativity .
They ’ve been done so many times , and in so many ways , that they tend to look the same .
That ’s not to say you should n’t use a left - column navigation layout .
I ’d guess that 75 % of the sites I ’ve designed have been based on the left - column navigation model , but I try to do something different when I can .
Speaking of different , how about picking that left column up and sticking it on the other side of the content ?
Then you ’d have a right - column navigation layout .
Right - column Navigation
Although it ’s difficult to find sites like Audi’s ( depicted in Figure 1.25 ) that place the main site navigation along the right - hand side of the layout , it ’s quite easy to find sites that use a right - hand column for sub-navigation , advertising , or sub-content .
Since , in western cultures , our eyes scan from left to right , this allows the page ’s main content to be the first thing viewers see .
Figure 1.25 : Right - column navigation on Audi‘s web site
I ’m not sure why there are n’t more sites that make use of the right column .
The studies I ’ve seen tend to swing both ways in regards to the usability and practicality of right - hand menus .
In my own experience , my cursor tends to hover on the right side of the browser window anyway–so I can be closer to the scrollbar .
Ultimately , this is a judgement call that ’s really about the needs of your clients and how they want people to perceive their online presence .
Left - column navigation is familiar and more standard , but that ’s not always the number one priority in designing a new site .
One thing ’s for sure , though : if you want your design to be different from the average web site , but you still want users to be able to find your navigation , you should give a right - column layout a try .
Three - column Navigation
The typical three - column layout has a wide center column flanked by two diminutive navigational columns .
The Apple Store web site shown in Figure 1.26 is an example of this common web page layout staple .
Although three columns may be necessary on pages that have a ton of navigation , short bits of content , or advertising to display , it ’s important to remember that whitespace is essential if we are to keep a layout from appearing cluttered .
Fortunately at the Apple Store , the three columns only exist on the homepage , and the center column has some whitespace that helps to promote eye movement .

Getting Inspired
Just because the left - , right - , and three - column layout configurations are the bread and butter of most web page designs does n’t mean you have to be confined to these layouts .
A plethora–yes , a plethora–of design showcase and gallery sites have been created to feature new and innovative ideas that might help you think outside the box , including the following ( just to name a few ) :
CSS Zen Garden at http://www.csszengarden.com/
—
This site is the original showcase of fresh ideas for CSS .
Even if you do n’t intend to design a CSS Zen Garden template , it ’s a great source of inspiration .
CSS Beauty at http://www.cssbeauty.com/
— CSS Beauty is both a gallery of well - designed CSS web sites and a portal to the CSS design community .
Stylegala Gallery at http://www.stylegala.com/archive/
— Stylegala is a great source of information about web design and standards , but the gallery features only the best - of - the - best new CSS designs .
CSS Vault at http://cssvault.com/
—
The CSS Vault ’s gallery archive goes back to November 2003 , so it ’s not only a great source of inspiration , but a historical repository of great CSS design .
Design Interact Site of the Week at http://www.designinteract.com/sow/ —
Just for good measure , here ’s one gallery that does n’t concentrate on CSS - based designs .
Design Interact is the multimedia- and technology - focused spin-off of Communication Arts , a leading trade journal for visual communication and graphic design .
Design Interact has been highlighting ( and archiving ) a new and unique web site every week since January 1998 .
Using a Morgue File
I know what you ’re thinking : “ Great , I ’ve got a bunch of galleries to look at , now what ? ”
One of the most useful “ tings ” my first graphic design professor taught me was to create a morgue file whenever I worked on a large project .
The concept is pretty simple : if you ’re doing an illustration or marketing project that involves trains , you clip out and print up anything you can find that might give you inspiration and keep it all in a folder .
It helps with your current project , and should you ever need to do another project involving trains , you ’ll have lots of inspiration on hand .
The morgue file idea kind of slipped my mind until a few years ago when I was working on a web site layout .
I found myself looking for a similar layout to the one I wanted to create–in particular , I wanted to see how other designers handled the background textures for such a design .
That was when I decided to start my digital morgue file .
I started taking screenshots of sites I saw in some of the galleries listed above , and sorted them into folders with names such as “ leftnav , ” “ rightnav , ” “ 3 column , ” and “ oddball . ”
Having a repository of web site designs that I can look at any time has been a handy resource on countless occasions when I ’ve been looking for inspiration .
Fresh Trends
If you ’re feeling so overwhelmed by the above resources that you ca n’t even contemplate starting a morgue file for inspiration , just take a few minutes to browse through those sites .
Look past the colors and textures to the boxes that make up the layout , and try to identify common ideas and design trends .
By doing this , I ’ve started to notice a few trends that seem to be emerging in web site layouts .
Expansive Footer Navigation
If you scroll to the bottoms of pages on many of the most recently redesigned sites , you ’re likely to see an interesting new trend .
Rather than using the footer for main links and a copyright notice , many sites are expanding this neglected piece of page real estate to include contact information , expanded site navigation , and extra content such as blogrolls , linkrolls , Flickr badges , and so on .
Although putting a site ’s main navigational element at the bottom of the page is n’t a good idea , the concept of including “ bonus ” navigation and content in that space has taken off lately .
As Figure 1.27 shows , JeffCroft.com is just one of the sites trying this approach .

Three Columns with Content First
The majority of fresh three - column site designs that have been produced lately have put the content first .
By first , I mean they ’re locating the content on the far left of the display .
As you can see in Figure 1.28 , this approach produces a very modern and professional look for Vivabit .
Figure 1.28 : Putting content first at Vivabit.com
Although this is n’t really a new idea , it ’s been picking up a lot of steam lately in both liquid - and fixed - width site designs .
The majority of three - column layouts usually switch to a two - column structure outside the homepage .
By placing the content on the left , the transition from three columns to two is more natural , as the content column can simply expand , rather than having to relocate completely .
For example , if you visit any of the other main pages of the Vivabit site , the width of the content area seems simply to expand up and to the right when you navigate from the homepage into the site .

Resizing : Fixed Width vs. Liquid Width
Back when we were drawing layout blocks with pencil and paper , I explained that the first page element we had to think about was the containing block , and whether or not it would expand to fill the page .
This decision is one that has plagued web designers for hundreds , if not thousands of years–all the way back to the days when we used tables and spacer.gif files to layout web page content .
Okay , maybe that was n’t actually thousands of years ago , but this is a long - standing debate nonetheless .
In fact , the fixed - versus - liquid debate caused quite a bit of commotion back in December 2003 when two very influential designers , Douglas Bowman of Stopdesign and Dan Cedarholm of SimpleBits , simultaneously switched from liquid- to fixed - width layouts .
This caused instant and unwarranted panic among the design and web standards community , whose members feared that this move marked the death of liquid layouts .
Since then , most designers have established their own opinions in regard to the fixed - versus - liquid debate .
The decision to use one type of layout over the other should really be determined by the target audience and the accessibility goals of each individual web site .
The pros and cons of each layout type are fairly well - defined , as Table 1.1 illustrates .
Table 1.1 : Fixed - vs. liquid - width layouts –the pros and cons
With these pros and cons in mind , I ’ve designed more fixed - width layouts than liquid .
I like having control over how the content will display , and working with the background space .
On the flip side , I sometimes enjoy the challenges that liquid layouts bring to the table .
But , regardless of personal preferences , it ’s important to put the needs of your client first .
If you ’re deciding on the width of a fixed - width layout , you have to think about the audience for which you ’re designing , and create a layout that meets the needs of those users .
An Alternative : Variable Fixed - width Layout
The somewhat ironic term variable fixed - width layout was coined by Richard Rutter in an article that he wrote to catalog his findings about this new trend .
It ’s an excellent discussion of the topic that provides some great examples .
The homepage of Simon Collison ’s Colly Logic exhibits the best implementation I ’ve seen of this new trend .
When you expand your browser window from 800 pixels to 1024 pixels in width , the right - hand column splits into a third column .
Figure 1.29 shows how it works .
Figure 1.29 : Viewing Colly Logic at 800 and 1024 pixel widths
Colly Logic acts as an intermediary between fixed - and liquid - width design .
A handful of designers have been toying with this idea ; CSS Beauty , one of the CSS gallery sites I mentioned earlier , takes a variable fixed - width approach to displaying features and advertising content .
Screen Resolution
In comparison to the fixed - versus - liquid debate , the arguments about designing for particular screen resolutions are much more tame .
When designers say that a site is designed , or optimized , for a particular screen resolution , they ’re actually talking about the resolution of the viewer ’s monitor .
The debate has centered around whether or not we should design sites in such a way that people using a monitor resolution of 800Ã — 600 pixels could see the entire width of the content area with their browsers in full - screen mode .
Given that we must account for sidebars and browser borders , this approach would see us design a content area that ’s approximately ( or that could be resized to approximately ) 750 pixels wide .
As of July , 2006 , W3Schools ’ screen resolution statistics showed that the number of W3Schools users who set their screen resolutions to 800Ã — 600 pixels had dropped , but not to the point that it could be safely ignored–see Figure 1.30 .
At the time , this resolution still accounted for 17 % of users , but that number had dropped by 3 - 5 % every six months for the previous two years .
Does this mean that as soon as those displays set to 800Ã — 600 have been replaced , we can all start to design sites that are 1024 pixels wide ?
Hardly .
Even if everyone was using a resolution of 1024Ã — 768 pixels or more , not everyone will use your site with the browser window maximized .
Figure 1.30 : W3Schools ’ screen resolution statistics
Although statistics like those provided by W3Schools help to give us reason to design for higher resolutions , the most important factor in web design is the end user .
If the web site you ’re building is for web professionals and people who are likely to use the latest computer equipment and high resolutions , it may be safe to push the design envelope and create designs that are wider than 800 pixels .
The goal , though , is to prevent users from needing to scroll from left to right in order to read content .
So , even if you decide to design beyond the 800 - pixel standard , do not alienate the few 800Ã — 600 users you have by forcing them constantly to scroll from left to right and back again just to read your site ’s content .
You ’ll only make them sea-sick !
The August 2005 redesign of design web site A List Apart provides a great example of how a design that ’s wider than 800 pixels can remain accessible to users with 800Ã — 600 - pixel displays .
Even though a horizontal scrollbar displays on the site at an 800Ã — 600 resolution , you can see all of the real content without scrolling .
At 1024Ã — 768 pixels , the horizontal scrollbar disappears , and another column becomes visible on the right , displaying search functionality , topic links , and advertising .
This extra column adds functionality and structure to the design of the site , but does n’t always need to be visible .
Application : Florida Country Tile
As I explained briefly in the section called “ The Design Process , ” much of what I do when I design a new web site or print item is subconscious .
I can usually tell you on a choice - by - choice basis why I made specific decisions , but it does n’t come naturally to verbalize the procedures I follow .
So , for me to explain how I applied graphic design principles to create a layout for a new web site , for example , is a little difficult unless I have an example to help me break the process into steps .
Enter : Florida Country
Tile , a real company and a real client .
Florida Country
Tile is a small , Florida - based tile and stone installation company whose owners have agreed to let me use the web site design project on which I worked with them as an example here .
Currently , the company does n’t have an online presence ; the only real identity collateral it has is the logo you see on the business card in Figure 1.31 .
Figure 1.31 : The business card of “ Ed ” from Florida Country Tile
I ’ve altered the company contact information on the business card above , but that ’s all–other than that , this card is identical to the cards the business uses .
As you can tell , this scenario is n’t all that different from the one I introduced at the beginning of this chapter : the organization has n’t established a very strong visual identity .
Usually , clients have specific ideas about what the site should look like .
Depending on the client , these preconceptions can either help or hinder the design process–more often , the latter .
However , on this project , I ’ve been given free rein to make all design decisions , and I plan to design the site using the principles we ’ll cover in each chapter of this book .
Hopefully , “ Ed the Client ” will be happy with the results , and “ You the Reader ” will get a clearer picture of the design process I described so vaguely earlier in this chapter .
Getting Started
To start out , I arrange a meeting with the client to discuss his needs and desires for the web site .
Unfortunately , I ’m in South Carolina and Ed ’s in Florida , so the meeting has to take place over the phone .
Even though I already know this client very well and can answer many of my own questions about his business , I call him anyway .
In contrast to the approach I use on most client projects , I ’ll communicate with Ed about each component of the web site I ’m building ; I ’ll do so toward the end of each chapter of this book .
Since this chapter is all about layout , I have three key questions to ask him :
How much content do you want to provide on the web site ?
What kinds of content do you want to provide on the web site ?
Is the logo on the business card used consistently across all collateral to brand your company ?
I want to get an idea of how many pages I ’ll be working with , so that I can anticipate how large my main navigation menu will be .
Before I call Ed , I jot down a list of the pages I ’d expect on a small web site : Home , About , and Contact .
After thinking about the tile industry a bit more , and looking at other tile web sites , I decide to add Gallery , Services , and Estimate Request pages .
When I speak with Ed , he ’s pleased with this list of pages , but he wants to know if he could add another page or two in the future .
I assure him that I ’ll work some flexibility into the layout to accommodate the possibility of extra pages , and explain that he can also include subpages within each of these main sections .
I also explain that the reason I want to know about the company ’s logo is that the current rectangular tile pattern background limits the design possibilities that are available to us .
He understands this , and says that the company shirts use a simplified pattern , shown in Figure 1.32 , and use only the words “ Country Tile . ”
He suggests I use that style of logo if I think it will work better .
The conversation is helpful .
I obtain the information I need about the content , and it looks like I ’ve got a little flexibility with the logo presentation .
With a navigation list of only six to eight pages , I could use a side navigation bar , but I have plenty of room to place the navigation along the top of the page .
In fact , that sounds pretty good to me .
I think it ’s time to move on to a grid .
Figure 1.32 : Embroidered Country Tile logo
Rather than sticking to my wide - ruled 79 Â ¢ spiral notebook , I pull a piece of blank paper out of my printer tray and draw out four 3Ã — 3 grids .
I ’m not sure exactly how I want to present the logo .
That does n’t matter at this point , though–I ’m just trying to decide how to configure my blocks .
After all that talk about how right - column layouts do n’t get a lot of use , I ’m thinking about having a multi- purpose sidebar on the right - hand side of the display .
I can see us using this area for content on some pages , for a gallery or featured item on the homepage , and possibly as a subnavigation section on the Services page .
I can use the emphasis properties we talked about earlier to make the content section stand out , but I ’ll keep in mind our discussion of unity to make sure that this sub-column fits into the overall page design .

Parallax ’s Basic Stamp is the mainstay for hobbyists wanting to add intelligence to everyday devices .
A new system called Arduino provides the benefits of the Basic Stamp at a greatly reduced cost , increased speed , and is entirely open - source .
A Little Background
Tiny computers surround your life .
In your coffee maker , remote control , vacuum cleaner , telephone , and clock radio , these little computers ( aka microcontrollers ) are getting smarter and cheaper and becoming more pervasive every day .
They can be had for less than a dollar .
And you can program them as easy as you can write a web page .
To program microcontrollers in the old days ( i.e. a few decades ago ) , the requirements were an expensive development environment costing thousands of dollars and a professional electrical engineer .
In the early 1990s , Parallax had the idea of embedding a simple BASIC interpreter on a microcontroller , mounting it on an stamp - sized module , and providing lots of add - on devices , excellent documentation , and example circuits and code .
The friendly Basic Stamp created a whole new market of hobbyist - oriented microcontroller devices and the standard by which other such devices are judged .
The reasons why the Basic Stamp was a hit are obvious in retrospect .
BASIC is an easy computer language to pick up .
People without knowledge of computer programming can pick it up quickly .
Parallax ’s wonderful examples showed how with just a handful of extra parts and a few lines of code you could create all manner of smart objects .
In an afternoon you could create your own robots , games , data collectors and toys .
In the process you ’d learn about microcontroller techniques .
Basic Stamp Issues
The Basic Stamp does have a few downsides :
Expensive —
The Stamp itself is $ 50 and to program it you really need a development board for another $ 70 .
Even without the dev board , a $ 50 part makes you reluctant to use one for every room of the house , let alone for every appliance in your house .
Slow —
The Basic Stamp re-interprets your BASIC program each time it ’s run , placing a limit on the fastest it can do things .
Time - critical are beyond its capability .
Low Memory —
There ’s not much room in a Basic Stamp for anything but simple programs .
Closed —
If you want to modify the BASIC interpreter in the Stamp to add new commands or remove the ones you do n’t use , or even learn how it works , you ’re out of luck .
It ’s closed nature meant for the longest time only Windows PCs could program Basic Stamps .
Enter Arduino
Arduino solves most of the above issues with the Basic Stamp .
The most noticable is cost :
Getting to the “ Hello World ” of microcontroller projects , the blinking LED , on Arduino costs $ 32 compared to the $ 119 for a Basic Stamp .
This is perhaps a little unfair because the Basic Stamp board contains a full bread - boarding space .
A similar setup for Arduino would cost about $ 60 , still a 2 x savings ( and can made cheaper if you want ) .
A more telling cost comparison is the “ consumable ” cost .
If you accidentially blow out the chip on each board how much does it cost to replace it :
The standard Atmel AVR ATmega8 chip used on the Arduino board can be obtained for less than $ 4 .
The Basic Stamp must be obtained from Parallax and costs $ 50 .
This order - of - magnitude cost reduction opens up entirely new avenues for embedding intelligence .
Where before it would be economically infeasible to have a 100 - Basic Stamp project , with Arduino and an AVR programmer like the $ 34 AVR - ISP , you can program as many ATmega8 chips to work with Arduino as you like .
What is Arduino
Arduino is two things :
A software programming environment , with a GUI and style based off
of Processing , and a packaging of AVR GCC , AVR LIBC , and AVRlib .
In many ways the Arduino environment is like WinAVR , but cross-platform .
of Processing , and a packaging of AVR GCC , AVR LIBC , and AVRlib .
In many ways the Arduino environment is like WinAVR , but cross-platform .
A hardware board , based on an Atmel AVR processor , arranged in a standardized way .
Arduino is n’t restricted to just this board however , and many Arduino - compatible boards have been created
Like the Basic Stamp , Arduino solves in a simple , elegant way the usual difficult problems of microcontroller programming ( setting up a working board , talking to the board , making compilable code )
With a Arduino board , doing a blinky light “ hello world ” takes less than 5 minutes .
For example , below is the same functioning code for Basic Stamp and Arduino .
Basic Stamp Arduino '{ $ STAMP BS2} '{$ PBASIC 2.5} OUTPUT 14 DO HIGH 14 PAUSE 1000 LOW 14 PAUSE 1000 LOOP int led Pin = 13 ; void setup ( ) { pinMode ( led Pin , OUTPUT ) ; } void loop ( ) { digital Write ( ledPin , HIGH ) ; delay ( 1000 ) ; digitalWrite ( ledPin , LOW ) ; delay ( 1000 ) ; }
The differences are minimal .
However unlike the Basic Stamp , with Arduino you can use real GCC C code to implement your algorithms and access all the hardware of the AVR chip .

MetLife 's difficult ' opt out '
It 's bad enough that most companies place the burden on customers to " opt out " from having their personal info shared with corporate affiliates and marketers , rather than asking them in advance if such data sharing would be OK -- in other words , to " opt in . "
But when companies make the opt - out process much harder than it has to be , it suggests that they 're doing all they can to keep consumers from exercising their privacy rights .
That seems to be the case with MetLife , the leading U.S. life insurer , with total assets last year of $ 482 billion and 2005 revenue of nearly $ 45 billion .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
In privacy notices recently sent to its millions of customers , the company states that " you can tell us not to share your information with our affiliates so that they can market their products directly to you , or not to disclose your information to a third party in connection with a joint marketing arrangement . "
To do so , customers are instructed to call MetLife at ( 877 ) 638-7684 .
But this merely activates a recording that tells customers to instead go to MetLife 's Web site ( metlife.com / optout ) to access an " opt - out election form . "
That form must then be printed -- assuming you have both a computer and computer printer -- and filled out by hand .
Customers must specify that they do n't want their personal data shared with either MetLife 's corporate affiliates or marketing partners ( or both ) .
They must include their name , address , account number , birth date and the last four digits of their Social Security number .
And then , all these steps later , customers must mail the completed form to a post office box in Lexington , Ky. , ( even though MetLife 's headquarters is in New York ) .
By comparison , most other large companies permit customers to opt out either by phone or online .
Rival insurer State Farm , for example , allows customers to opt out from data sharing simply by calling ( 800 ) 865-6035 .
" I have n't heard of a company placing more obstacles in your way than this , " said Joe Ridout , a spokesman for San Francisco 's Consumer Action .
" This is more like a scavenger hunt than an opt - out provision . "
John Calagna , a MetLife spokesman , responded that the company sees nothing wrong with its opt - out procedure .
" We believe the procedure we have in place is the best way to do it , " he said .
Calagna noted that at the end of the phone recording , after customers are instructed to go online to obtain an opt - out form to mail in , an opportunity is provided to speak with a service rep " if you have other questions . "
" You can opt out with the service representative , " he said .
" You can do that . "
Then why does n't the recording say that ?
The only way customers would know that this choice exists is if they take the initiative in asking a service rep if it 's possible .
" This is something that we 're considering , " Calagna said .
" We 're looking to improve our procedures all the time . "
MetLife , as I 've written in the past , has an unusually assertive privacy policy , forgoing the usual declarations about how protecting customers ' privacy is their sole reason for living .
" We are allowed by law to use the information we have about you , and disclose it to our affiliates and others , for many purposes , " MetLife states in its privacy notice .
Those purposes include handing customers ' info to affiliates " so that they can offer their products and services directly to you . "
MetLife says it counts among its affiliates " life , car and home insurers , securities firms , broker - dealers , a bank , a legal plans company and financial advisors . "
It also says that " if we have joint marketing arrangements with other unaffiliated financial services companies , we may give them information about you so that we can offer products jointly or so they can offer products and services endorsed or sponsored by us to you . "
Calagna said no such joint marketing arrangements currently exist .
But the privacy notice leaves that option open .
So let 's say you actually take the time to read MetLife 's privacy notice and you then jump through the series of hoops required to opt out .
That 's the end of it , right ?
Wrong .
Below the opt - out election form that you found after making a call and then going online , MetLife makes this extraordinary admission :
" Even if you ' opt out , ' any MetLife company that is fortunate to have you as a customer may continue to send you offers and information about all of the products and services that the MetLife companies offer . "
Huh ?
What about that part of the opt - out form where you specifically tell the company that " I do not want my MetLife company to share information about me with other MetLife affiliates in order for the affiliates to market their products to me " ?
Gail Hillebrand , a staff attorney at Consumers Union in San Francisco , said MetLife is indulging in some pretty fancy linguistic gymnastics .
" They 're saying that you can opt out from us giving information to our affiliates , " she observed , " but you ca n't opt out from our acting on behalf of our affiliates .
It 's a very fine line . "
MetLife 's Calagna said the difference is that sales agents have a responsibility to help customers put together the best possible package of MetLife products and services .
" If the sales agent believes that there other things you might want to consider , he 'll let you know , " Calagna said .
" We 're in the business of providing options . "
Whether you want them or not .
The Pentagon's on a spending spree for vehicles that may help replace the venerable Humvee ( which has proved vulnerable to increasingly powerful improvised explosive devices ) .
The Army and Marine Corps had originally proposed buying 4,100 of the so - called Mine Resistant Ambush Protection Vehicles , or MRAP .
Now , according to news reports , this number is 6,600 and growing .
The new vehicles will sport improvements like a V - shaped hull , better armor , and improved chassis .
In the meantime , the two services are also planning a longer - term project to completely replace the Humvee with the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle .
Those new vehicles are supposed to be ready by 2012 , or possibly sooner .
Here 's the million dollar ( or multi- billion dollar ) question :
Who here in the DANGER ROOM thinks the military , after spending billions on a " stopgap " vehicle like the MRAP , is going to have the cash to buy a dream fleet of replacement vehicles ?

Online shopping is in , if not infancy , at least a toddler stage .
The advances that brought us here have made the process simpler and easier than ever , but some sites still have n't caught on .
Since I 've been doing an inordinate amount of online shopping recently ( thanks to the theft last weekend and my upcoming lengthy trip to China ) , I feel uniquely qualified to share a few e-commerce site design tips - 17 tips , actually .
Enjoy .

# 1 - Tell Me Where I Am
Whenever a user is navigating inside a store with more than 1 sub - level of navigation , it 's critical to show them where in the site structure they are .
This should be accomplished with headlines , sub-headers ( when necessary ) and breadcrumbs ( e.g. Home > Category > Sub-cat > Product ) .
# 2 - Let Me Remove Narrowing Options
When a user starts to " narrow " their navigation inside a particular category ( in this case by selecting the designer " Ted Baker " ) , it 's only right to allow them to remove those navigation selections rather than forcing the use of repetitive " back button " clicks .
# 3 - Allow Me to Sort Every Which Way
The standards are " Price - low to high , " " Price - high to low , " " Popularity , " aka " Best Selling , " " Featured , " " User Rating " ( or " Editor Rating " if you do n't have users rate products ) , and " New " or " Latest . "
You can eliminate " Featured " if you 've got nothing to push , but all the other sorting options must exist ( assuming it 's possible to do so ) .
# 4 - Show Me the Products
Unless you 've got more than 200 products total in a sub-category , it 's only right to offer the user the option of seeing every product on one page .
Broadband has rendered the load time argument nearly irrelevant and I personally ( along with Mystery Guest ) can't stand sites lacking the feature .
# 5 - Refining Options Bring Joy
If you can provide the user with a useful refinement option , you 've made their experience better .
In the instance of sizing , this is particularly important , as users loathe finding that " perfect " piece of apparel , only to discover you do n't carry it in their size .
# 6 - The More Specifics , the Better
Rule # 6 is so worthwhile , I 'm repeating it .
Actually , # 7 serves to illustrate a substantive difference between refining your browsing in a section ( as # 6 shows ) vs. navigating to a new sub-category .
Offering the latter as an option where relevant and valuable ( and when the number of items warrants it ) is a wise decision .
# 7 - Tell Me What it Costs & What I'm Saving
Some product category pages shows items without the detail users are craving .
It 's particularly important for discount sites ( anything off MSRP helps conversions ) to show pricing , but nearly every website can benefit from providing an extra bit of detail before the click to the product page .
Tell them materials , give a tiny description or list the sizes / colors / options you have in stock .
_

# 8 - Keep the Search Bar in Easy Reach
When a search has been performed , do n't just show the search and the results , do like the engines and make the search bar front and center , while maintaining the user 's query in the box for potential modification .
# 9 - Give Me Search Refinement Options
If you have an advanced searching system , or can allow users to select prices , options , colors , sizes , models , etc , do it .
Your bottom line will thank you - users often rate " search " as the most frustrating part of many e-commerce sites ( apologies for not having the study to cite here ) .
# 10 - Get as Close As You Can Get ( while staying relevant )
In the example above , eBay has done a masterful job showing which queries would have produced results .
This advanced technique should be a wake - up call to others .
_

# 11 - Share the Critical " Fit " Information
Many products are designed to " fit " certain criteria , whether it's a laptop ( in this case ) or a human body ( with clothes ) or another piece of equipment ( when compatibility matters ) .
In every instance of potential matches , show the critical information in the product details .
I can't tell you how many laptop bag sites I browsed before finding this one that actually showed which laptop sizes it was intended for .
# 12 - Tell Me If You 've Got It
There are still sites out there that let you click " add to cart " or even " checkout " before discovering the awful truth - no more of your SKU in stock .
It 's the kind of experience that will lead you to permanently switch e-tailers .
# 13 - You Can Never Have Too Many Photos
Since you do n't get to see the item in real life , photos , reviews , videos and even fancy , 3D interfaces ( where appropriate ) are invaluable to helping the user feel like they 've " experienced " the product prior to purchase .
One photo , from one angle , sent by the manufacturer to every online store does n't cut it .
Go above and beyond the call of visual duty and conversions will skyrocket - links might , too .
_
_
# 14 - Let Me See Delivery Options
There is a certain subset of users that has to see the delivery options before they start shopping .
Older generations often fit this stereotype , but those baby boomers still have a lot of online spending years to go , so do n't ignore them .
It 's best to make the link obvious in the permanent navigation ( it 's most customarily at the bottom of each page ) .
# 15 - If You Wo n't Send it To Me , Tell Me Who Will
In the example , Ted Baker is refusing to sell me the $ 200 dress shoes I want , but what 's worse is that he wo n't tell me who will ship them to his old colony .
I ended up finding them on Amazon.com , eventually , but Ted 's losing out on his commission with them by not providing the link ( and if I was n't so dedicated to the brand , he 'd probably lose the sale , too ) .
_

# 16 - Reassure Me With Email
I panicked earlier tonight when I realized the replacement laptop I ordered may not have been shipped quickly enough to arrive in time for my trip to China ( and no one wants to spend 28 hours on planes without a lappy ) .
Luckily , Dell 's order confirmation proved that I 'd chosen wisely .
Replicate this experience for your own customers , rather than leaving them in the dark ( or , worse , crowding up your customer service dept .
with e-mails that could have been answered in an automated fashion ) .
# 17 - Give All the Order Details ASAP
When you send out order confirmations , make sure to include all of the product details to re-assure the buyer that they 've selected properly .
If I accidentally ordered the size 9 instead of size 8 , I want to be able to fix it before the package arrives .
Hopefully , these techniques will find their way to your e-commerce sites , and when they do n't , you 'll grab the project manager and point them to this blog post .
Together , we 'll make the Internet an even better place to shop .

Presented at
Abstract
Full Paper
Slides from ICFP Presentation
Example Parsers
ArithRecurse.hs : Recursive descent parser described in Section 2.1 , for the trivial arithmetic expression language of Figure 1 .
ArithPackrat.hs : Equivalent packrat parser for the same trivial language , Section 2.4 .
ArithLeft.hs : Left recursion example for Section 3.1 , which extends the above packrat parser with properly left - associative subraction , division , and modulo operators .
ArithLex.hs : Integrated lexical analysis example for Section 3.2 , which extends the previous packrat parser with support for multiple - digit decimal literals and optional whitespace padding between literals , operators , and punctuation .
ArithMonad.hs : Example packrat parser , equivalent to ArithPackrat.hs , but using monadic combinators to express the parsing functions more succinctly and provide support for user - friendly error detection and reporting .
Discussed in Section 3.3 of the paper .
The following two library modules are required :
Pos.hs : Keeps track of line and column position while scanning input text .
Parse.hs : Monadic combinator library for packrat parsers , inspired by Daan Leijen 's Parsec library .
( Parsec was designed for traditional predictive parsers and mostly - predictive parsers with special - case backtracking . )

Software Wars A map depicting the epic struggle of Free and Open Source Software ( FOSS ) against the Empire of Microsoft .
`` What is it about this bike shed ? ''
Some of you have asked me .
It is a long story , or rather it is an old story , but it is quite short actually .
C. Northcote Parkinson wrote a book in the early 1960s , called ``Parkinson 's Law ' ' , which contains a lot of insight into the dynamics of management .
[ snip a bit of commentary on the book ]
In the specific example involving the bike shed , the other vital component is an atomic power - plant , I guess that illustrates the age of the book .
Parkinson shows how you can go into the board of directors and get approval for building a multi-million or even billion dollar atomic power plant , but if you want to build a bike shed you will be tangled up in endless discussions .
Parkinson explains that this is because an atomic plant is so vast , so expensive and so complicated that people cannot grasp it , and rather than try , they fall back on the assumption that somebody else checked all the details before it got this far .
Richard P. Feynmann gives a couple of interesting , and very much to the point , examples relating to Los Alamos in his books .
A bike shed on the other hand .
Anyone can build one of those over a weekend , and still have time to watch the game on TV .
So no matter how well prepared , no matter how reasonable you are with your proposal , somebody will seize the chance to show that he is doing his job , that he is paying attention , that he is here .
In Denmark we call it ``setting your fingerprint ' ' .
It is about personal pride and prestige , it is about being able to point somewhere and say ``There !
I did that .''
It is a strong trait in politicians , but present in most people given the chance .
Just think about footsteps in wet cement .
Tonight , Keith took on Newt Gingrich 's controversial remarks from earlier this week where he suggested we re-think free speech as we know it in order to effectively combat the threat of terrorism .
Needless to say , Keith -- like any true American -- took offense to this and did n't hold back .

Olbermann : " What a dark place your world must be , Mr Gingrich .
Where the way to save America is to destroy America .
I will awaken every day of my life thankful I am not with you in that dark place .
And I will awaken every day of my life thankful that you are entitled to tell me about it .
And that you are entitled to show me what an evil idea lurks there and what a cynical mind .
And that you entitled to do all that thanks to the very freedoms you seek to suffocate . "
Transcripts below the fold
And finally tonight , as promised , a Special Comment about free speech , failed speakers , and the delusion of grandeur .
" This is a serious long term war , " the man at the podium cried , " and it will inevitably lead us to want to know what is said in every suspect place in the country . "
Some , in the audience , must have thought they were hearing an arsonist give the keynote address at a convention of firefighters .
This was the annual Loeb First Amendment Dinner in Manchester , New Hampshire -- a public cherishing of Freedom of Speech -- in the state with the two - fisted motto " Live Free Or Die . "
And the arsonist at the microphone , the former Speaker of the House , Newt Gingrich , was insisting that we must attach an " on-off button " to Free Speech .
He offered the time - tested excuse trotted out by our demagogues , since even before the Republic was founded : widespread death , of Americans , in America , possibly at the hands of Americans .
But updated , now , to include terrorists ... using the internet for recruitment ... end result , quote " losing a city . "
The Colonial English defended their repression with words like these .
And so did the Slave States .
And so did the policemen who shot strikers .
And so did Lindbergh 's America - First crowd .
And so did those who interned Japanese - Americans .
And so did those behind the Red Scare .
And so did Nixon 's Plumbers .
The genuine proportion of the threat is always irrelevant .
The fear the threat is exploited to create ... becomes the only reality .
" We will adopt rules of engagement that use every technology we can find , " Mr. Gingrich continued about terrorists formerly Communists formerly Hippies formerly Fifth Columnists formerly Anarchists formerly Redcoats .
" .... to break up their capacity to use the internet , to break up their capacity to use free speech . "
Mr. Gingrich , the British ' broke up our capacity to use free speech ' in the 1770's .
The pro-slavery leaders ' broke up our capacity to use free speech ' in the 1850's .
The FBI and CIA ' broke up our capacity to use free speech ' in the 1960's .
It is in those groups where you would have found your kindred spirits , Mr. Gingrich .
Those who had no faith in freedom , no faith in this country , and , ultimately , no faith even in the strength of their own ideas , to stand up on their own legs , without having the playing - field tilted entirely to their benefit .
" It will lead us to learn , " Gingrich continued , " how to close down every website that is dangerous , and it will lead us to a very severe approach to people who advocate the killing of Americans and advocate the use of nuclear and biological weapons . "
That we have always had ' a very severe approach ' to these people is insufficient for Mr. Gingrich 's ends .
He wants to somehow ban the idea .
Even though everyone who has ever protested a movie or a piece of music or a book has learned the same lesson :
Try to suppress it , and you only validate it .
Make it illegal , and you make it the subject of curiosity .
Say it can not be said - and it will instead be screamed .
---
And on top of the thundering danger in his eagerness to sell out freedom of speech , there is a sadder sound , still -- the tinny crash of a garbage can lid on a sidewalk .
Whatever dreams of internet - censorship float like a miasma in Mr. Gingrich 's personal swamp , whatever hopes he has of an Iron Firewall , the simple fact is -- technically , they wo n't work .
As of tomorrow they will have been defeated by ... a free computer download .
Mere hours after Gingrich 's speech in New Hampshire , the University of Toronto announced it had come up with a program called " Psiphon " to liberate those , in countries in which the internet is regulated ...
Places like China , and Irahn , where political ideas are so barren , and political leaders so desperate , that they put up computer firewalls to keep thought and freedom out .
The " Psiphon " device is a relay of sorts that can surreptitiously link a computer user in an imprisoned country to another in a free one .
The Chinese think the wall works , yet the ideas -- good ideas , bad ideas , indifferent ideas , pass through anyway .
The same way the Soviet Bloc , was defeated by the images of Western Material Bounty .
If your hopes of thought - control can be defeated , Mr. Gingrich , merely by one computer whiz staying up an extra half hour and devising a new " firewall hop , " what is all this apocalyptic hyperbole for ?
" I further think , " you said in Manchester , " We should propose a Geneva convention for fighting terrorism , which makes very clear that those who would fight outside the rules of law , those who would use weapons of mass destruction , and those who would target civilians are in fact subject to a totally different set of rules , that allow us , to protect civilization by defeating barbarism ... "
Well , Mr. Gingrich , what is more ' massively destructive ' than trying to get us , to give you our freedom ?
And what is someone seeking to hamstring the First Amendment doing , if not " fighting outside the rules of law " ?
And what is the suppression of knowledge and freedom , if not " barbarism " ?
The explanation , of course , is in one last quote from Mr. Gingrich from New Hampshire ... and another , from last week .
" I want to suggest to you , " he said about these internet restrictions , " that we right now should be impaneling people to look seriously at a level of supervision that we would never dream of if it were n't for the scale of the threat . "
And who should those " impaneled " people , be ?
Funny I should ask , is n't it , Mr. Gingrich ?
" I am not ' running ' for president , " you told a reporter from Fortune Magazine .
" I am seeking to create a movement to win the future by offering a series of solutions so compelling that if the American people say I have to be president , it will happen . "
---
Newt Gingrich sees , in terrorism , not something to be exterminated , but something to be exploited .
It 's his golden opportunity , is n't it ?
' Rallying a nation , ' you might say , ' to hysteria , to sweep us up into the White House with powers that will make Martial Law seem like anarchy . '
That 's from the original version of the movie " The Manchurian Candidate " - the chilling words of Angela Lansbury 's character , as she first promises to sell her country to the Chinese and Russians , then reveals she 'll double - cross them , and keep all the power herself , waving the flag every time she subjugates another freedom .
Within the frame of our experience as a free and freely argumentative people , it is almost impossible to conceive that there are those among us , who might approach the kind of animal - wildness of fiction like that -- those who would willingly transform our beloved country into something false and terrible .
Who among us can look to our own histories , or those of our ancestors who struggled to get here , or who struggled to get freedom after they were forced here , and not teer up when we reed Frederick Douglass 's words from a century - and - a - half ago : " Freedom must take the day " ?
And who among us can look to our collective history , and not see its turning points -- like the Civil War , like Watergate , like the Revolution itself -- in which the right idea defeated the wrong idea on the battlefield that is the marketplace of ideas ?
But apparently there are some of us who cannot see , that the only future for America is one that cherishes the freedoms won in the past , one in which we vanquish bad ideas with better ones , and in which we fight for liberty by having more liberty , not less .
" I am seeking to create a movement to win the future by offering a series of solutions so compelling that if the American people say I have to be president , it will happen . "
What a dark place your world must be , Mr. Gingrich , where the way to save America , is to destroy America .
I will awaken every day of my life thankful I am not with you in that dark place .
And I will awaken every day of my life thankful that you are entitled to tell me about it .
And that you are entitled to show me what an evil idea it represents -- and what a cynical mind .
And that you are entitled to do all that , thanks to the very freedoms , you seek to suffocate .

Dammbrüche in New Orleans Bush war gewarnt
Das " Katrina " - Desaster in New Orleans kam mit Ansage , auch der US - Präsident war gewarnt .
Vertrauliches Videomaterial zeigt jetzt , wie Bush in eindringlichen Appellen von Vertretern der Katastrophenschutzbehörde Fema über die drohende Gefahr unterrichtet wurde .
Example
This is about a kind of XSS security hole betterworld and I detected recently .
It 's described at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery
You have a webapp at yourdomain .
example .
Let 's say you have a profile settings site where you can set your realname , for example ( harmless example though ) .
The user is authenticated by a session cookie .
The form looks like this :
if ( $cgi->param ( ' submit.save_realname ' ) ) { my $ name = $ cgi -> param ( ' realname ' ) ; # do some checks on $ name $ user -> realname ( $ name ) ; $ user - > update ; } [ download ]
The code looks like :
Looks fine , does n't it ?
Missed something ?
The form - method is POST .
Why is it POST and why do n't you care in the script if it really was sent by POST ?
Consider some bad hacker creates a website on http://somewhere.example/bad.html:Now if you are logged in at your website ( have a cookie ) and somehow go to the bad website , your realname will be set automatically , and you canot do anything to prevent this .
You do n't even need Javascript .
An easy solution for this is to check for POST in your application .
if ( $ cgi->request_method ( ) eq ' post ' )
( Bad thing is , there are a lot of websites out there that do n't check , and while you can make your own applications safe , you can't do this for other sites you visit )
Still not safe ?
Use Tokens
< input type =" hidden " name= " t " value = " 123abc ... " >
Could n't browsers help me to surf more secure ?
Well , consider you have Javascript on .
The bad website could look like this :
Here checking for POST will not help you ( as a user ) .
The only thing that helps is to have Javascript off for unknown websites ( Site preferences in Opera , NoScript in FF ) .
And hope that the bad html - form is not on a website where you have Javascript on .
A lot of websites do this already ; create a token ( that expires like a session - id ) , and that must be a parameter in the form :
So every action of the script that changes data should require such a token .
That makes your script pretty safe .
Well , if the scripts are programmed badly , why should browser vendors care ?
Because they can .
In Opera you can say that you just want get cookies from the current site .
Unfortunatley Opera still sends cookies from domain A to an embedded image of domain B .
In Firefox you can say " Privacy - Cookies - from original site only " , which will prevent receiving and sending cookies .
But even the Firefox preference does not prevent doing a meta - refresh .
Also , there is no possibility to say " Warn me before a site does a form.submit ( ) to a different domain " .
All these things could be implemented .
So , while you can do some things to make your own scripts safe , do you also think , browsers should take care of these issues ?
Here is a posting on Bugzilla https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=375238 about this .
Update 2008 - 04 - 17 : In Opera 9.5 the option " only send cookies to the site I visit " works reliably .
In Firefox , the extension CookieSafe ( and the option original Only ) does n't work reliably .
So if you wanna be safe from CSRF , try Opera 9.5 .
But make sure you deactivate this option for OpenID sites .
Eddie Freeman lives with his wife Geraldine and their two children in the west of England .
In the winter of 1958 , when several weeks pregnant , Edd After taking just two pills , Mrs Freeman felt a tingling in her hands and
did n't take any more ie ’s mother was suffering from bronchitis .
This developed into pneumonia and a doctor was called .
The doctor prescribed her a sedative called Distaval , a trade name for a new drug : thalidomide .
After taking just two pills , Mrs Freeman felt a tingling in her hands and did n’t take any more .
Unbeknown to her , the safety of thalidomide was already being questioned .
It later became linked to the births of unusually high numbers of seriously malformed babies and , in the face of growing concern , thalidomide - based drugs were gradually withdrawn .
By then , however , over ten thousand children from more than forty different countries had been harmed .
Many died soon after birth , but today , in Britain alone , nearly five hundred people still live with the effects of the drug .

The disabling results of thalidomide included brain damage and deafness , but for the majority of children the effects were purely physical .
In most cases , the drug interfered with the development of a baby ’s limbs and , like Eddie , many were born with severely underdeveloped arms and legs .
As the scale of the tragedy emerged , it was recognised that the surviving children would , at least initially , need special care to help them cope with daily life .
Having sanctioned the use of thalidomide , the government wanted to be seen to be trying to repair the damage it had caused .
In this Utopian era , when technology was believed to provide the best solutions to all kinds of problems , artificial limbs were recommended .
Eddie 's last pair of artificial legs , c1969 .
Credit : Science Museum / Science & Society Picture Library
By necessity , the prostheses made for children affected by thalidomide were different from those in standard use .
Unlike the majority of amputees , most of the children lacked normal hip and shoulder joints .
This meant that conventional limb substitutes could not be adequately fitted .
So , when Eddie was just two years old , he was taken to the Limb Fitting Centre at Queen Mary ’s Hospital , Roehampton , in south west London , and fitted with the first in a series of experimental arm and leg prostheses .
Every child was assessed for his or her personal needs .
Each set of artificial limbs was created and , if necessary , modified on an individual case basis .
Eddie was initially fitted with a pair of legs ; the ar Cartoon by Eddie Freeman : “ … it was just like being a baby version of Robocop . ”
Credit : Eddie Freeman ms followed several months later .
The technology was itself evolving by trial and error and for the children , whose small bodies might be almost entirely encased within complex limb systems , the experience could at times be both physically and emotionally overwhelming .
The prostheses have since been viewed by some people as an attempt to ‘ normalise ’ what was perceived as abnormal .
If true , this was not very successful , as suggested by Eddie ’s satire on his appearance when wearing them .
Eddie has mixed views about the appliances .
While he discarded his gas - powered arms quite quickly , he wore his artificial legs for nearly a decade and , despite numerous falls , was reluctant to stop wearing them .
But a new level of freedom came when he first used a powered wheelchair a freedom that other technologies have further enhanced .
Since passing his driving test , his mobility has been greatly extended by a series of conventional road vehicles , specially adapted to allow Eddie to control them with his own , rather than artificial , limbs .
One of my repeated criticisms of the current US administration 1 is that it is dishonestly opposed to real alternatives to petroleum ( and fossil fuels in general ) , and acts to obstruct those alternatives outside the public eye rather than having a fair and public appraisal .
Some of this obstruction is more or less direct ( cancelling a domestic hybrid - car program set to deliver product in the 2007 timeframe and also suitable for PHEV modification , and replacing it with a program of dubious feasibility and a very long time horizon ) , but some of it is more subtle , taking the form of misdirection .
An ambiguous entry from Purdue
In this climate of disinformation comes a paper from Purdue , titled Sustainable fuel for the transportation sector .
The premise is rather simple : US production of biomass contains sufficient carbon to replace all our transportation fuel , but barely enough energy ; a lot of that energy and a great deal of the carbon ( roughly 2/3 ) is lost in the conversion to liquid fuels .
The Purdue researchers propose to supply additional energy to the conversion process via hydrogen , allowing all of the carbon to be turned into motor fuel ; they call this a Hybrid Hydrogen - CARbon process , or H 2 CAR .
They mention certain advantages for H 2 CAR , such as compatibility with the existing fuel - distribution infrastructure .
Presumably this will also save the Non-Negotiable American Way Of Life .
At a completely unaffordable price .
The cost of compatible renewability
In the H 2 CAR paper , figures such as 239 billion kg / year of hydrogen from 58,000 km2 of solar PV panels are tossed off rather casually .
These numbers bear deeper analysis than they receive .
For instance , 58,000 km2 of panels could be made by assembling an array of about 46 billion BP SX 170B PV panels ( at roughly 1.26 m² each ) .
At a future cost of $ 2 / W peak , this array would cost about $ 15.7 trillion ; today 's cost would be closer to $ 40 trillion .
Clearly we 're not going to do this .
Another example of the disconnect between the researchers and reality is their proposed quantity and method of hydrogen production .
Their most optimistic ( smallest ) quantity of hydrogen required is 239 billion kg / year ( see Table 1 ) , which they propose to produce from renewable electricity via electrolysis .
The quantity of electricity required ( at 100 % efficiency , no less ) is a staggering 9810 billion kWh / year2 ; this is nearly 2.5 times current annual US electric production .
( Worse than that , it 's roughly 6 - 10 times what it would take to power all ground transport directly with electricity3 . )
Even if produced from nuclear energy by a thermochemical process of 50 % efficiency , this rate of hydrogen production would require nuclear plants equivalent to more than 8 times today 's capacity4 .
This may be possible in the realm of physics and even engineering , but it 's very doubtful that a sane and sober nation would even look at it twice .
Guessing at an unstated agenda
At the very end , the authors toss out a bone : hybrids , and especially plug - in hybrids , can slash the required production of liquid fuels and all the upstream items with it .
This is a backhanded and very obscure way of acknowledging that the major problem to be overcome is not the essential energy requirements of ground transport , but the horrendously inefficient internal combustion engines we currently use for the job .
( In so doing , they proved that Al Gore 's much - ridiculed statement that the nation 's # 1 enemy is the internal combustion engine ... is absolutely correct . )
In short , they wrote a whole paper in order to address what they know is the wrong problem in a way which is far too expensive to be put into practice .
Why did n't they say so up front ?
I suppose it depends who is expected to grasp only the text , versus who is expected to read and understand the subtext .
One possibility is that it was written to please the administration .
A paper which is properly down on the non-solutions like hydrogen does n't fit with the priorities of the political minders of the scientific process ( e.g. NASA 's erstwhile editor and head - of - Minitrue - wannabe , George Deutch ) .
Had the researchers been working for e.g.
NASA , this could have helped their chances of getting published without having conclusions re-written .
However , as they are from Purdue and the NAS is n't a government organization , this seems unlikely .
Could it be intended to mis-direct the old - school proponents of renewables ?
If so , it does n't seem to be working .
Making hydrocarbons for the same old engines will still dirty the air and contaminate water .
The last possibility that occurs to me is that it was written to be gobbled up by the cornucopians and others on the political right .
A straightforward paper would n't have received anything like the attention this one is getting from them .
The surface conclusions are bait ; the numerical data within is the poison .
The numbers like 239 billion kg / yr say , in language too sophisticated to be seen on the political radar of the clueless , that the present course is untenable .
Having flown past their intellectual defenses and into the embrace of their prejudices , these inconvenient truths are utterly devastating to the cornucopian position .
Maybe , just maybe , this will help slay one more of the non-options so we can get on with the things that might actually work .
[ 1 ]
Some might consider this conspiracy - mongering , but in the light of the documented abuses and obsessive secrecy coming out even in the mainstream news media , the notion must be considered seriously .
Besides , it is relatively safe to assume that a politician is lying if his lips are moving .
( back )
[ 2 ] 2.39*1011 kg/yr * 500 mol/kg * 70600 cal / mol * 4.184 J/cal / 3.6*106 J/ kWh = 9810 billion kWh / year , assuming 100 % electrolyzer efficiency .
At the authors ' figure of 60 % , this rises to 16.3 trillion kWh / year .
( back )
[ 3 ]
As of 2003 , US energy consumption in road vehicles of all types was approximately 184 GW average , or 1610 billion kWh / year .
This is about 1/ 6 the raw electric requirement to produce hydrogen under the Purdue scenario , or about 1/10 of what 's required using 60 % - efficient electrolyzers .
( back )
[ 4 ] 9810 billion kWh / year * 2 / 8760 hr/yr = 2240 gigawatts thermal .
Current US nuclear capacity is around 270 gigawatts thermal .

The Who's Pete Townshend once penned the lyrics , " hope I die before I get old , " but as this video of The Zimmers ' version of " My Generation " shows , advanced age does not preclude rockingness .
The video 's description says the lead singer is 90 years young , with some members of the band having entered the triple - digit age bracket .

Legally - speaking , the business of killing even in war can be quite tricky .
Consider that the military now operates dozens of armed unmanned vehicles -- in the air , on land and in the water .
That number is expected to rise exponentially in the near future .
The Law of Armed Conflict dictates that unmanned systems cannot fire their weapons without a human operator in the loop .
As new generations of armed robots proliferate , the pressure will inevitably increase to automate the process of selecting -- and destroying -- targets .
Now comes the weird part .
A new legal interpretation has been proposed within the military to deal with the thorny issue of removing humans from the trigger - end of the killing process .
Here 's how it works : program all armed robotic vehicles to aim only at weapons , not humans .
For example , an autonomous vehicle spots an insurgent with an AK - 47 .
The robotic vehicle is authorized to destroy the AK - 47 .
If the human is killed in the process , that 's what 's called " collateral damage . "
This particular legal theory is the brainchild of John S. Canning , chief engineer at the Naval Surface Warfare Center .
His presentation on the subject can be downloaded here :

I have written about Canning 's proposal in Jane 's Defence Weekly .
For its part , legal representatives in the Office of the Secretary of Defense has disavowed any knowledge of or interest in Canning 's proposal .

And besides , the transcript was wrong
That 's not what I did n't say
HERE 's a verbatim extract from CNN 's transcript of Larry King Live with Barack Obama from March 19th :
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ) OBAMA : And if George Bush does n't listen , then we 're going to make him listen because it 's time for us to bring our young people home .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
GEORGE BUSH , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES :
It can be tempting to look at the challenges in Iraq and conclude our best option is to pack up and go home .
That may be satisfying in the short run , but I believe the consequences for American security would be devastating .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
KING : Senator Obama , you disagree with that .
He says it would be devastating to leave now .
You say no .
Why not ?
OBAMA : Well , first of all , I do n't know anybody who 's been talking about packing up and going home .
It 's only a fragment from a long show , and there was a commercial break in the way , but , you see what I mean ?
The internet definitely gives a platform for people who do n't know what they are talking about to make their opinion known .
Unfortunately systems that rely exlusively on popularity ( ahem digg , reddit ) tend to give these people their limelight simply because they make such loud statements .
In particular I 'm referring to this rant on the Joel On Software forums .
Overhyping a product is just as bad as slandering it with false information , so I 'm going to respond to this rant point by point , but I will apologize for my strident tone .
I have to admit , I 'm not really known for suffering fools gladly , and this guy really rubbed me the wrong way .
A little note before I get started .
I have been a professional database developer since 1993 , and I have worked with numerous enterprise level database systems and frameworks .
I have worked with Rails for about 15 months and I 'm now working on my fourth major project in Rails .
You can view my commentary with that perspective .
" 1. IT TAKES THE RELATIONAL OUT OF RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM " In this section the poster talks about how Rails is n't relational , and it just does n't grok relational databases .
His major point seems to be that Rails should be smart enough to look at your tables and infer the relationships based on the primary keys .
First of all it's not clear when he thinks Rails should do this , is that when he 's generating his models , or at runtime ?
Let 's just assume he's not stupidly asking for a runtime performance graveyard like that , and he just wants it to happen when he 's scaffolding out his models ( see sidenote on scaffolding ) .
The problem with that type of introspection is easy to see on simple inspection .
First , what if all of the tables you are joining to with your model do n't exist ?
Should it re-inspect every table in the database every time you create a model ?
What happens if your naming convention is n't exactly how rails expects it ( ie , some_descriptive_tag_table_name_id ) , the current system easily and expressively handles that situation .
What if you have some special select logic that you need to do on your finds ?
Again the current relationship handles it very nicely .
The current system has all the power and expressiveness you need to capture very complex relationships .
It seems like he 's really arguing that Rails should " just figure it out " , which to me is a dubious claim to begin with .
The ranter then mentions something about not being able to leave the table , and Rails has taken a latex glove to his database schema .
To be honest this entire section was very confusing and poorly worded , but he did make some relatively clear statements that were of course totally off base .
" There 's still no excuse .
Because Rails insists I name my foreign key columns table_id if I want to live the good life .
When I do so , I should n't have to declar has_many and belongs_to . " Um ... What ?
How about this : belongs_to :user , : foreign_key => " user " If you want to live the good life ?
What 's that about ?
Is someone going to throw you in the river if you do n't comply ?
Let me tell you something .
Rails is very tolerant , and very nicely handles situations where people do n't follow the standard .
Personally I can't stand pluralized table names or using id as the primary key for my tables .
So to live the good life do I have to do that ?
Hell no , I put these two settings in my environment.rb: ActiveRecord ::Base.primary_key_prefix_type = :table_name_with_underscoreActiveRecord::Base.pluralize_table_names
= falseat this point I now have the bliss of tablename_id as my primary keys , and I do n't have to mess with any of the pluralized table nonsense .
My model is named exactly the same as my table , so if I want an ORDER table I make an Order model , or if I do want to pluralize I name my table ORDERS and my model Orders .
The point for me is that I do n't have to worry about the pluralizer getting it right .
In the context of this article , the point is that Rails supports this choice all the way throughout the system .
Everywhere that it matters , the system just knows that I 've made this choice and everything still works as if I were a normal Rails citizen .
Pretty cool huh ?
Ok , next the ranter goes off and starts talking about popups .
To be honest , I have no clue what he was talking about here .
I do n't get too many popups at the command line , so I 'm at a complete loss as to how to respond here .
I 'm going to chalk those comments up to either drugs , or complete cluelessness on his part .
So basically this entire point was complete and utter nonsense .
This guy wants something that will go and do the work of figuring out what his foreign keys are for him .
How does that translate to a restriction of Rails ?
Seriously , this guy should learn how to use the relationships in rails before he starts ranting about how bad they suck .*** Scaffolding Sidenote *** Ok I have to admit that I hate scaffolding .
It was one of those things that got people interested in Rails , but in my world I never use scaffolding .
Occasionally , when I just need a bunch of skeleton files I 'll scaffold them out , but scaffolding is no more Rails programming than unlocking a car door is the essence of driving .
Real true Ruby on Rails programming has almost nothing to do with scaffolding .*** End Scaffodling Sidenote ***" 2. RAILS DOESN'T PLAY WELL .
WITH ANYONE .
NOT EVEN ITSELF . " " But do you remember that moment in the demo when the play turns ugly with a big ole error page ?
It 's when he tried to update his db schema or model or something .
It does n't work because he has to reboot the webserver before those changes take effect .
Which he says and moves on quickly .
" Seriously , wtf ?
Did this dude actually write some code in Rails or did he watch the demo and assume that 's how the system works ?
I 've been working on the same system now since october and I 've had to restart my web server less than 10 times .
In fact the only time I 've had to restart was when I changed the structure of things I had stored in session variables and I wanted to purge them .
I probably did n't even have to restart the server then , but I figured I 'd do it for good measure .
When it comes to typical active development though , if you are running in development mode , you just do n't have to restart that thing ....* ever *.
I add and remove tables , change the structure , add and remove models , change the assocations , etc , etc .
I never have to restart the server in those cases , with the one exception noted above .
Seriously this item makes me very seriously doubt the veracity of his claim that he has actually built an application in Rails .
Next he talks about how if you re-scaffold something it will overwrite your files .
Which is true , * if* , when you hit the part that says " overwrite files ( y / n / a ) ? " you hit a , or y repeatedly .
Now look , Rails does make database programming easier , but it does help if you can use a computer and you understand basic prompts like " hey , you have some crap here , do you want me to overwrite it ? " .
Once again we have a complete rant section that is n't based on the Restrictions of Rails , but on the ranters own incompetence .
" 3. YOU CAN'T READ THE FACKING MANUAL BECAUSE THERE IS NO FACKING MANUAL .
" Wow , seriously this is such a load of crap .
There are several good manuals written for Rails .
Which you can buy from Amazon .
The one written by the Pragmatic Programmers is $ 23 for a 450 page book .
Apparently the fact that the book is over 200 pages is a huge problem for this dude , my advice , read the first 200 pages .
In that time you 'll have read enough information to be significantly farther along than you are now .
He also bashes on the api.rubyonrails.com , which to me is one of the best aspects of the Rails documentation .
I do n't know of any other language that has such complete documentation online .
Certainly documentation is difficult .
It 's often times hard to know where to start , or where to look , but everytime I 've picked up a language , I head to the bookstore and buy a book that covers the topic I need to learn .
If you are completely against buying books , well the problem is n't with the language , it 's with your self imposed restrictions .
" 4. RAILS ATE MY DATA , OR AT LEAST STOOD IDLY BY WHILE MY DATA WAS EATEN " Again with the WTF ?
How is this even a rant about Rails ?
This guy is just boldly stating that he has no damn clue how to build software .
Seriously , Rails has this whole wonderful thing called validations .
If you want it to validate your data , you have to tell it to validate the data .
Programming languages and frameworks do n't write the software for you , they just expose features and functionality that allow you to easily write code .
He then complains because Rails knows the database is only 40 characters and it should have checked the data first .
The problem here is that most real database systems wo n't silently fail , so it 's a massive waste of CPU to do a check that is completely useless in most cases .
That 's why you have to explicitly tell Rails to do the check , because it tries not to uselessly waste CPU cycles .
Next .
" 5. THE FIRST RULE OF RAILS IS : DO NOT TALK ABOUT RAILS ' RULES ! " Every significant framework has rules , and lots of them .
He complains that none of these rules are out there for people to read .
As I said before , if he read the first 200 pages ( since that is his limit ) all of those rules would have been covered in great detail .
If you fail to do even the most basic research , he is right , those rules would be frustrating and irritating if you just kept tripping over them .
Again though , the stinging indictment is that he is lazy , not that the information is n't there , and there in abundance .
" 6 . THERE'S MORE THAN ONE PLACE TO SAY IT" He is apparentely talking about Engines here .
The last time I looked Engines were an add on to Rails , and they were n't part of the core system .
Regardless of that , Engines are a way to allow you to build components to re-use across projects .
Building systems that you expect to reuse does require a bit more effort than writing that code once , however again that is n't really a restriction of Rails , it 's an arbitrary requirement of an add - on libary to Rails .
This entire rant was misguided , and I did n't feel like he made any actual good points .
I am certainly not claiming that Rails is perfect , but if you want to fix something it definitely helps if you learn what you are talking about before you write up some long winded post exposing what an idiot you are .

If you were n’t so abrasive and rude , I would ’ve refunded your money – even though we are under * no* legal obligation to do so .
I am now marking your email address as spam and your communication will no longer get through .
If you do n’t want to use our service any more , please cancel your account .
I have taken this conversation completely out of context because context does n’t matter in customer service ( the bold bits are mine , too ) .
The only thing that matters is you keeping your cool , and this can frequently require having the patience of Job and less ego than a blade of grass .
The above conversation is not one I would consider a good example of conflict resolution on the part of the representative who sent it .
That was Ryan Carson of Dropsend , incidentally , and you can read the context on his blog post about it .
Ryan asked publicly how other folks would have answered .
Here is my response , and the rationale .
The initial stimulus :
Refund me the 5 dollars ASAP
This would set me looking in my transaction records , where I would find that the customer has just done an instantaneously upgrade / downgrade for a subscription service and been charged a pro-rated amount to the end of the month .
Here is my response .
Thank you for using Dropsend [ the name of the application at issue ] .
I received your message asking for a refund of $ 5 , and have instructed our credit card processor to refund you .
Is there anything else I can help you with ?
What did that cost me ?
$ 5 , thirty seconds of research time , and counting to five before allowing someone ’s lack of civility to ruffle me .
The $ 5 I will get back from this customer next month , and even if I do n’t its $ 5 and that is below my care threshold as a business owner ( or as anything , really ) .
The research time was a sunk cost the moment he said “ refund ” because I have to check that he is a customer to be physically able to process a payment .
The five seconds is the expensive bit for most people , because that requires suppressing your ego , and that can be irksome .
Regardless , this response a ) totally resolves the problem for the customer and b ) keeps them happy and ready to pay me next month .
As an actual bonus if the customer is having some support related issue they might email me back and allow me to fix it , improving the quality of my service for the thousands of customers I have who are not in on this email exchange .
If they do n’t mail me back , thats OK too —
I ’m doing things that matter for the business and not swapping a series of hostile emails with someone which will gain me nothing .
Oh , sure , you can go searching for a rationale on why allowing yourself an ego ( I ’m using this in the non-pejorative sense of the word ) is a good idea .
“ They ’ll walk all over me ” .
“ We have a policy against this . ” “ If I do it for him I ’ll have to do it for everybody ” .
Hogwash , irrelevent , and do n’t care .
The overwhelming majority of your customers in the software business will never ask for a refund or contact support ( I ’m talking about packaged software or services here which are substantially identical for all customers ) .
Suppose some fraction of your support requests walk over you — so what ?
Support requesters make up a tiny fraction of your turnover every month , and a tiny fraction times a tiny fraction equals a “ cost of doing business ” .
Your blood pressure is more important than that .1 % of customers who want to wheedle over $ 5 .
Another reason to kill this exchange after the first email is that it prevents escalation .
Escalation is what takes you from “ My , did n’t this chap ’s mother ever teach him manners ? ” to “ FINE !
I DIDN ’T WANT YOUR MONEY ANYWAY ! ”
Its easy to see it in hindsight but , in the heat of the moment , most people do n’t recognize they are doing it .
As a result , you want to practice what the IR / polisci buffs call a commitment strategy — basically , you decide beforehand that if someone has an issue you are going to be obsequious about it .
Obsequious .
What a lovely word — did you know that there are several ways to say it in Japanese and that not all of them are considered negative ?
I often wish English had a word for when you need to be a spineless craven lickspittle in a good way .
Learn from the Japanese , they have the “ I can put a polite reserved face on this for the sake of our continued relationship even though I ’m absolutely fuming on the inside ” down to an art form .
( That face is called tatemae , the feeling on the inside is called honne .
There , you learned your bit of linguistic trivia for the day . )
See , if you start escalating , you will allow yourself to be drawn into an argument with your customer .
You can win an argument with your boss .
You can win an argument with your wife .
You can even win an argument with God .
But you will never win an argument with your customer .
You might get the last word in , and puff out your chest , and then find that they cancel their subscription and / or chargeback you .
And in the pursuit of a lousy five stinking bucks you ’ve just lost a $ 50 revenue stream over the next year , which is almost pure profit because you are selling a software service which requires no marginal work , you ’ve risked getting bitten for $ 15 by Visa when they chargeback and having to waste an hour of your life repeating the argument to a series of bored Visa representatives who are all thinking “ Why did I sign up to do this job ?
Everyone acts like children ” ( you ’ll lose the chargeback , by the way ) , and worst of all you ’re stressed .
You might think you would be stressed if you suppressed your ego .
True , for the first two weeks or so .
After that it just becomes a habit .
You learn to mentally shut out the torrent of abuse in your ear and skip over the written invective , and when you get a word in edgewise say “ OK , what can I do to help ? ”
Trust me , I worked in a call center — if you learn how to do this , you can work in a call center for your entire life and not get tired .
If you do n’t , you will burn out in a matter of months .
Just pretend you ’re like that character from Firefly who , when faced with a stressful situation , repeats a mantra : “ I am a leaf on the wind .
Watch me soar . ”
And , well , ignore the fact that those were his last words .
Ah , the company has a policy against refunds .
Here is the great thing about running your own business : you are the boss .
If your company has a policy against refunds , you can break it at will .
Call it an exception , call it a special accomodation , call it a goodwill expenditure , call it whatever the heck you want — the policy is a few bits on a server somewhere .
If you refund this customer , who will fault you for it ?
Certainly not your boss — you are the boss !
And , as long as you ’re the boss , why do n’t you rewrite your policy against refunds saying that you ’ll gladly give out refunds .
Its the key to getting your fantastic customer service to scale .
This chap you ’re giving the refund to might tell a friend or write a blog post … of course , he ’ll probably tell no one .
However , a nice prominent guarantee like “ We ’ll refund your last payment anytime , for any reason . ” gets seen by every prospect who is worried “ Hmm , what if I ’m not happy ? ”
Even if you have some darn good reason to be a Scrooge in print in your policy , do n’t get trapped into the “ If I make an exception once I ’ll have to make an exception for everyone ” .
Says who ?
Your boss ?
You are the boss .
Boolean propositional logic ?
You ’re a businessman , not a computer programmer .
If the accomodation advances your business goals make it , end of discussion .
Your customers are an incestuous bunch but they mostly do n’t talk about how easy it is to screw you over ( mostly : in some markets they might .
I hope you ’re not doing business in those markets ) .
Instead , they typically talk in terms of ecstatic , happy , and furious .
If they never have a problem , they ’re happy .
If the last time they had a problem , you bent over backwards , they wo n’t think “ This guy is a pushover ! ” ( even though you are !
And good for you ! ) but they ’ll think “ Wow , the service here is amazing ! ”
And if you have a two year long relationship with a customer , without any previous bad incident , and then you send them one teensy - tinesy email saying “ I would have refunded your money , but decided to keep it .
Nyaa nyaa . ” , now they ’re furious .
And they will never ever again be anything but furious .

Remember the old myth that people only use 10 percent of their brains ?
Although a new study confirmed that bromide to be apocryphal , it did find that we may only use 20 percent of the nerve cells in our midbrain to form memories .
Researchers at the University of California , Los Angeles , and The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto monitored neurons in the lateral amygdalae ( two almond - shaped regions on either side of the midbrain associated with learning and memory ) of mice to see whether the presence of the CREB ( cAMP response element binding ) protein plays a key role in signaling brain cells to make memories .
CREB , a transcription factor that typically increases the production of other proteins in cells , is believed to be involved in memory formation in organisms from sea slugs to humans .
Scientists hope that their findings , reported in the current issue of Science , may help pave the way to new treatments for Alzheimer 's Disease .
Researchers injected a vector designed to return CREB production to normal in mice that had been genetically modified to underproduce the protein .
After being injected , these mice , who also were memory - impaired , performed as well as normal mice in memory tests .
During the trials , researchers played a sound and then shocked the animals ; when the sound was played again , normal mice and those with rescued CREB function froze — for a certain [ short ? ] period of time — a reaction typical of fear .
When the researchers later dissected the mice 's brains , they found that the fluorescent probes they had attached to the CREB vectors showed they had affected only about 20 percent of the neurons in the lateral amygdala .
" That surprised us .
We thought that we would have to affect a lot more neurons in order to see a big change in memory , " says study co-author Sheena Josselyn , a neurophysiologist at The Hospital for Sick Children .
" Not all [ neurons ] participate in every memory .
Maybe we 're biasing these neurons to participate in this memory and [ CREB is ] all you need '' to compel it . "
To determine if the CREB - producing cells were involved , the scientists then tried to follow the memory - making process by inserting a probe , which would give off a fluorescent tag if RNA from a gene known as Arc had recently been transcribed in brain cells .
Arc levels are normally low in a cell but increase considerably when neuronal activity has taken place .
The RNA is transcribed in the nucleus of a cell and then transported through the cell 's body to its dendrite , the projection of the neuron that receives information from other cells .
" Arc RNA provides a really good molecular marker of when this neuron was active , " says Josselyn .
She adds that if the team found RNA in the nucleus of neurons immediately after a training event , they knew cells had been active within the last five minutes ; if the probe was in the dendrite , they estimated activity had taken place 20 minutes earlier .
The team found CREB - enabled nuclei to be three times more likely to have the Arc signature in them than nuclei in CREB - impaired neurons .
The researchers also tested normal mice that were injected with a vector that would selectively decrease CREB function in some of their neurons .
After running the fear - training trials again , they noticed that the mice learned normally , suggesting that the neurons unaffected by the CREB - reducing vector were still producing enough CREB to make the memories .
The results : the memory trace , signified by Arc , showed that activity had taken place in 20 percent of neurons .
" We think that it 's really a competition , that neurons are really battling it out " amongst each other to be involved in the memory - making process , says Josselyn .
" It 's like grading on a curve the same number [ 20 percent ] of students are going to get As " — or in this case help make the memory .
It is the same percentage , but not the same neurons , however , that create each memory .
Also , researchers are not certain what causes naturally boost CREB function and , therefore , the likelihood of any particular neuron participating in making a memory .
But Josselyn speculates that the brain likely " differentiates different memories by having different neurons encode them . "
In the future , Josselyn says , this mechanism could be harnessed to produce a new treatment for Alzheimer 's disease .
" In time , we 're going to have some sort of neuron - replacement therapy for Alzheimer 's , " she says , conceding , " It 's a little sci - fi right now . "
But , if new neurons are inserted into a damaged brain , modulating CREB function could help bias the healing brain to use the functioning neurons and not its injured population .

Research Facilities
21 August 1945
Harry K. Daghlian Jr. was killed during the final stages of the Manhattan Project ( undertaken at Los Alamos , New Mexico to develop the first atomic bomb ) from a radiation burst released when a critical assembly of fissile material was accidentally brought together by hand .
This incident pre-dated remote - control assembly of such components , but the hazards of manual assembly were known at the time ( the accident occurred during a procedure known as " tickling the dragon 's tail " ) .
A similar incident , involving another fatality , occurred the following year ( see next entry ) , after which hand - maniuplations of critical assemblies was abandoned .
21 May 1946
A nuclear criticality accident occured at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in New Mexico when worker Louis Slotin accidentally dropped a screwdriver while sealing a core for a Mark 3 nuclear bomb .
Eight people were exposed to radiation , and Slotin died nine days later of acute radiation sickness .
29 November 1955
EBR ( Experimental Breeder Reactor ) I , located near Arco , Idaho , experienced a partial core meltdown .
EBR I , which commenced operating in 1951 and was decommissioned in 1964 , was the world 's first nuclear power plant .
2 July 1956
Nine persons were injured when two explosions destroyed a portion of Sylvania Electric Products ' Metallurgy Atomic Research Center in Bayside , Queens , New York .
1957
A radiation release at the the Keleket company resulted in a five - month decontamination at a cost of $ 250,000 .
A capsule of radium salt ( used for calibrating the radiation - measuring devices produced there ) burst , contaminating the building for a full five months .
30 December 1958
A chemical operator was exposed to a lethal dose of radiation following an incident involving the mixing of plutonium solutions , dying 35 hours later of severe radiation exposure .
26 July 1959
A clogged coolant channel resulted in damage to 30 % of the fuel elements at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory ( now known as the Boeing - Rocketdyne Nuclear Facility ) in the Simi Hills area of Ventura County , California .
Later discovery of the incident prompted a class - action suit by local residents , who successfully sued for $ 30 million over cancer and thyroid abnormalities contracted due to their proximity to the facility .
2 April 1962
An " unplanned nuclear excursion " occurred in a plutonium processing facility in Richland , Washington .
Several employees were hospitalized for observation following exposure to the resultant radiation , and radiation was detected in the surrounding atmosphere for sevearl days following the incident .
26 March 1963
A mechanical failure led to a nuclear leak and subsequent fire at an experimental facility in Livermore , California , resulting in serious damage to the shielded vault where the experiment was conducted .
5 October 1966
A sodium cooling system malfunction caused a partial core meltdown at Detroit Edison 's Enrico Fermi I demonstration breeder reactor near Detroit , Michigan .

The incident is documented in John Fuller 's We Almost Lost Detroit .
1974
Whistleblowers at the Isomedix company in New Jersey reported that radioactive water was flushed down toilets and had contaminated pipes leading to sewers .
The same year a worker received a dose of radiation considered lethal , but was saved by prompt hospital treatment .
1982
International Nutronics in Dover , New Jersey , which used radiation baths to purify gems , chemicals , food , and medical supplies , experienced an accident that completely contaminated the plant , forcing its closure .
A pump malfunctioned , siphoning water from the baths onto the floor ; the water eventually was drained into the sewer system of the heavily populated town of Dover .
The NRC was n't informed of the accident until ten months later – and then by a whistleblower , not the company .
In 1986 , the company and one of its top executives were convicted by a federal jury of conspiracy and fraud .
Radiation has been detected in the vicinity of the plant , but the NRC claims the levels " are n't hazardous . "
1986
The NRC revoked the license of a Radiation Technology , Inc. ( RTI ) plant in New Jersey for repeated worker safety violations .
RTI was cited 32 times for various violations , including throwing radioactive garbage out with the regular trash .
The most serious violation was bypassing a safety device to prevent people from entering the irradiation chamber during operation , resulting in a worker receiving a near - lethal dose of radiation .
ca. December 1991
One of four cold fusion cells in a Menlo Park , CA , laboratory exploded while being moved ; electrochemist Andrew Riley was killed and three others were injured .
The other three cells were buried on site , leading to rumors that a nuclear reaction had taken place .
A report concluded that it was a chemical explosion ; a mixture of oxygen and deuterium produced by electrolysis ignited when a catalyst was exposed .
The Electric Power Research Institute , which spent $ 2 million on the SRI cold fusion research , suspended support for the work pending the outcome of an investigation .
1996
Radioactive tritium and strontium ( the latter at up to 70 times the drinking water standard ) were found to have contaminated groundwater around Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton , NY during a routing shutdown .
The details are covered in a report by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission .
The facility was cited by the U.S. Department of Energy for multiple failures to comply with nuclear safety requirements on numerous subsequent occasions , including 7 June 1996 , 19 December 1997 and 19 April 1999
June 2013
A report was issued by the U.S. Department of Defense 's Defense Threat Reduction Agency detailing numerous problems that occurred at a nuclear plant used to generate electricity at the McMurdo , Antarctica base .
A total of 438 malfunctions were documented , including four reports of " Release of any radioactivity to the environment in excess of Title 10 , Code of Federal Regulations , Part 20 " , 11 reports of " se of radiation or radioactivity levels within the plant by more than a factor of 3 from normal operating conditions " and 123 reports of " Exposure to personnel greater than 0.350 rem ( 3.5 m Sv ) in seven consecutive days " .
Power Plants
24 July 1964

19 November 1971
The water storage space at the Northern States Power Company 's reactor in Monticello , Minnesota filled to capacity and spilled over , dumping about 50,000 gallons of radioactive waste water into the Mississippi River .
Some was taken into the St. Paul water system .
March 1972
Senator Mike Gravel of Alaska submitted to the Congressional Record facts surrounding a routine check in a nuclear power plant which indicated abnormal radioactivity in the building 's water system .
Radioactivity was confirmed in the plant drinking fountain .
Apparently there was an inappropriate cross-connection between a 3,000 gallon radioactive tank and the water system .
27 July 1972
Two workers at the Surry Unit 2 facility in Virginia were fatally scalded after a routine valve adjustment led to a steam release in a gap in a vent line .
[ See also 9 December 1986 ]
28 May 1974
The Atomic Energy Commission reported that 861 " abnormal events " had occurred in 1973 in the nation 's 42 operative nuclear power plants .
Twelve involved the release of radioactivity " above permissible levels . "
22 March 1975
A technician checking for air leaks with a lighted candle caused $ 100 million in damage when insulation caught fire at the Browns Ferry reactor near Decatur , Alabama .
The fire burned out electrical controls , lowering the cooling water to dangerous levels , before the plant could be shut down .
28 March 1979
A major accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant near Middletown , Pennsylvania .
At 4:00 a.m. a series of human and mechanical failures nearly triggered a nuclear disaster .
By 8:00 a.m. , after cooling water was lost and temperatures soared above 5,000 degrees , the top portion of the reactor 's 150 - ton core melted .
Contaminated coolant water escaped into a nearby building , releasing radioactive gasses , leading as many as 200,000 people to flee the region .
Despite claims by the nuclear industry that " no one died at Three Mile Island , " a study by Dr. Ernest J. Sternglass , professor of radiation physics at the University of Pittsburgh , showed that the accident led to a minimum of 430 infant deaths .
1981
The Critical Mass Energy Project of Public Citizen , Inc. reported that there were 4,060 mishaps and 140 serious events at nuclear power plants in 1981 , up from 3,804 mishaps and 104 serious events the previous year .
11 February 1981
An Auxiliary Unit Operator , working his first day on the new job without proper training , inadvertently opened a valve which led to the contamination of eight men by 110,000 gallons of radioactive coolant sprayed into the containment building of the Tennessee Valley Authority 's Sequoyah I plant in Tennessee .
July 1981
A flood of low - level radioactive wastewater in the sub - basement at Nine Mile Point 's Unit 1 ( in New York state ) caused approximately 150 55 - gallon drums of high - level waste to overturn , some of which released their highly radioactive contents .
Some 50,000 gallons of low - level radioactive water were subsequently dumped into Lake Ontario to make room for the cleanup .
The discharge was reported to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , but the sub - basement contamination was not .
A report leaked to the press 8 years later resulted in a study which found that high levels of radiation persisted in the still flooded facility .
1982
The Critical Mass Energy Project of Public Citizen , Inc. reported that 84,322 power plant workers were exposed to radiation in 1982 , up from 82,183 the previous year .
25 January 1982
A steam generator pipe broke at the Rochester Gas & Electric Company 's Ginna plant near Rochester , New York .
Fifteen thousand gallons of radioactive coolant spilled onto the plant floor , and small amounts of radioactive steam escaped into the air .
15 - 16 January 1983
Nearly 208,000 gallons of water with low - level radioactive contamination was accidentally dumped into the Tennesee River at the Browns Ferry power plant .
25 February 1983
A catastrophe at the Salem 1 reactor in New Jersey was averted by just 90 seconds when the plant was shut down manually , following the failure of automatic shutdown systems to act properly .
The same automatic systems had failed to respond in an incident three days before , and other problems plagued this plant as well , such as a 3,000 gallon leak of radioactive water in June 1981 at the Salem 2 reactor , a 23,000 gallon leak of " mildly " radioactive water ( which splashed onto 16 workers ) in February 1982 , and radioactive gas leaks in March 1981 and September 1982 from Salem 1 .
9 December 1986
A feedwater pipe ruptured at the Surry Unit 2 facility in Virginia , causing 8 workers to be scalded by a release of hot water and steam .
Four of the workers later died from their injuries .
In addition , water from the sprinkler systems caused a malfunction of the security system , preventing personnel from entering the facility .
This was the second time that an incident at the Surry 2 unit resulted in fatal injuries due to scalding [ see also 27 July 1972 ] .
1988
It was reported that there were 2,810 accidents in U.S. commercial nuclear power plants in 1987 , down slightly from the 2,836 accidents reported in 1986 , according to a report issued by the Critical Mass Energy Project of Public Citizen , Inc .
28 May 1993
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission released a warning to the operators of 34 nuclear reactors around the country that the instruments used to measure levels of water in the reactor could give false readings during routine shutdowns and fail to detect important leaks .
The problem was first bought to light by an engineer at Northeast Utilities in Connecticut who had been harassed for raising safety questions .
The flawed instruments at boiling - water reactors designed by General Electric utilize pipes which were prone to being blocked by gas bubbles ; a failure to detect falling water levels could have resulted , potentially leading to a meltdown .
15 February 2000
New York 's Indian Point II power plant vented a small amount of radioactive steam when a an aging steam generator ruptured .
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission initially reported that no radioactive material was released , but later changed their report to say that there was a leak , but not of a sufficient amount to threaten public safety .
6 March 2002
Workers discovered a foot - long cavity eaten into the reactor vessel head at the Davis - Besse nuclear plant in Ohio .
Borated water had corroded the metal to a 3/16 inch stainless steel liner which held back over 80,000 gallons of highly pressurized radioactive water .
In April 2005 the Nuclear Regulatory Commission proposed fining plant owner First Energy 5.4 million dollars for their failure to uncover the problem sooner ( similar problems plaguing other plants were already known within the industry ) , and also proposed banning System Engineer Andrew Siemaszko from working in the industry for five years due to his falsifying reactor vessel logs .
As of this writing the fine and suspension were under appeal .
November 2005
High tritium levels , the result of leaking pipes , were discovered to have contaminated groundwater immediately adjacent to the Braidwood Generating Station in Braceville , Illinois .
7 January 2010
Officials at the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power station in Vernon , Vermont notified the Vermont Department of Health that samples taken from a monitoring well in November 2009 contained radioactive tritium at levels 37 times the federal limit .
The source of the leak was traced the following month to a pair of badly corroded and leaking steam pipes , and a clogged floor drain ; a second leak was discovered and repaired four months later .
May 2011
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission commenced meetings to discuss problems at a nuclear reactor in Braidwood , Illinois .
Findings included the release of six million gallons of water containing radioactive tritium into the local aquifer , improper wiring of an alarm system intended to warn plant workers of problems , and a flaw in the plant 's backup water supply .
June 2011
An AP investigation revealed that three quarters of all nuclear plants in the U.S. were found to be leaking radioactive tritium .
Over half the plants studied had concentrations exceeding the federal drinking water standard , and while none had reached public drinking supplies , leaks at three plants had contaminated the drinking wells of nearby homes .
31 January 2012
A crack in a tube at the San Onofre plant in California led to a minor leak of radioactive steam .
Approximately 8.7 % of the tubes in a replacement steam generator experienced damage due to a design flaw .
The plant was permanently shuttered the following year .

28 July 1957
A C-124 Globemaster transporting three nuclear weapons and a nuclear capsule from Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to Europe experienced loss of power in two engines .
The crew jettisoned two of the weapons somewhere east of Rehobeth , Del. , and Cape May / Wildwood , New Jersey .
A search for the weapons was unsuccessful and it is a fair assumption that they still lie at the bottom of the ocean .
11 October 1957
A B -47 carrying a single nuclear weapon crashed shortly after takeoff from Homestead Air Force Base in Florida .
The weapon was partially destroyed in the ensuing fire , but the nuclear core was recovered intact .

5 February 1958
A B -47 carrying a Mark 15 , Mod 0 , nuclear bomb on a simulated combat mission from Homestead Air Force Base in Florida collided with an F - 86 near Savannah , Georgia .
After three unsuccessful attempts to land at Hunter Air Force Base in Georgia , the B - 47 crew jettisoned the nuclear bomb in the Atlantic Ocean off Savannah .
The Air Force conducted a nine - week search of a 3 - square - mile area in Wassaw Sound where the bomb was dropped , but declared on April 16 that the bomb was irretrievably lost .
More details can be read in this Wikipedia article .
11 March 1958
A B -47 on its way from Hunter Air Force Base in Georgia to an overseas base accidentally dropped an unarmed nuclear weapon into the garden of Walter Gregg and his family in Mars Bluff , South Carolina .
The conventional explosives detonated , destroying Gregg 's house and injuring six family members .
The blast resulted in the formation of a crater 50 - 70 feet wide and 25 - 30 feet deep .
Five other houses and a church were also damaged ; five months later the Air Force paid the Greggs $ 54,000 in compensation .
4 November 1958

Five crewmen parachuted to safety , while three others died when the aircraft exploded in mid-air .
The bombs jettisoned as the plane descended , one parachuting to earth intact , the other plunging deep into waterlogged farmland .
To this day , parts of the nuclear bomb remain embedded deep in the muck .
The area is off - limits , and is tested regularly for radiation releases .
More information can be found at the Broken Arrow : Goldsboro , NC site at www.ibiblio.org/bomb/.
14 March 1961
A B -52 on a training mission with two nuclear weapons aboard crashed in Yuba City , California following depressurization of the crew cabin .
The crew bailed out at 10,000 feet altitude , but the commander stayed aboard to steer the stricken bomber away from populated areas until the craft descended to 4,000 feet .
November 1963
A B52 carrying two hydrogen bombs crashed into a hillside approximately 20 miles from Cumberland , Maryland during a snowstorm .

Two hydrogen bombs ruptured , scattering radioactive particles over the fields of Palomares ; a third landed intact near the village of Palomares ; the fourth was lost at sea 12 miles off the coast of Palomares and required a search by thousands of men working for three months to recover it .
Approximately 1,400 tons of radioactive soil and vegetation were removed to the U.S. for burial at a nuclear waste dump in Aiken , S.C. The U.S. eventually settled claims by 522 Palomares residents at a cost of $ 600,000 , and gave the town the gift of a $ 200,000 desalinizing plant .
22 January 1968
A B -52 crashed 7 miles south of Thule Air Force Base in Greenland , scattering the radioactive fragments of three hydrogen bombs over the terrain and dropping one bomb into the sea after a fire broke out in the navigator 's compartment .
Contaminated ice and airplane debris were sent back to the U.S. , with the bomb fragments going back to the manufacturer in Amarillo , Texas .
The incident outraged the people of Denmark ( which owned Greenland at the time , and which prohibits nuclear weapons over its territory ) and led to massive anti-U.S. demonstrations .
Spring 1968
An unknown nuclear accident occurred involving a U.S. military craft at sea in or over the Atlantic Ocean .
As of 1980 the incident remained classified .
19 September 1980
An Air Force repairman doing routine maintenance in a Titan II ICBM silo in Damascus , Arkansas dropped a wrench socket , which rolled off a work platform and fell to the bottom of the silo .
The socket struck the missile , causing a leak from a pressurized fuel tank .
The missile complex and surrounding areas were evacuated .
Eight and a half hours later , the fuel vapors ignited , causing an explosion which killed an Air Force specialist and injured 21 others .
The explosion also blew off the 740 - ton reinforced concrete - and - steel silo door and catapulted the warhead 600 feet into the air .
The silo has since been filled in with gravel , and operations were transferred to a similar installation at Rock , Kansas .
The episode is described in detail in Eric Schlosser 's Command and Control : Nuclear Weapons , The Damascus Accident , and the Illusion of Safety .
2 November 1981
A fully - armed Poseidon missile was accidentally dropped 17 feet from a crane in Scotland during a transfer operation between a U.S. submarine and its mother ship .
Submarines and Ships
18 April 1959
An experimental sodium - cooled reactor utilized aboard the USS Seawolf , the U.S. 's second nuclear submarine , was scuttled in 9,000 feet of water off the Delaware / Maryland coast in a stainless steel containment vessel .
The reactor was plagued by persistent leaks in its steam system ( caused by the corrosive nature of the sodium ) and was later replaced with a more conventional model .
The reactor is estimated to have contained 33,000 curies of radioactivity and is likely the largest single radioactive object ever dumped deliberately into the ocean .
Subsequent attempts to locate the reactor proved to be futile .
October 1959
One man was killed and another three were seriously burned in the explosion and fire of a prototype reactor for the USS Triton at the Navy 's training center in West Milton , New York .
The Navy stated , " The explosion ... was completely unrelated to the reactor or any of its principal auxiliary systems , " but sources familiar with the operation claim that the high - pressure air flask which exploded was utilized to operate a critical back - up system in the event of a reactor emergency .
1961
The USS Theodore Roosvelt was contaminated when radioactive waste from its demineralization system , blew back onton the ship after an attempt to dispose of the material at sea .
This happened on other occasions as well with other ships ( for example , the USS Guardfish in 1975 ) .
10 April 1963
The nuclear submarine Thresher imploded during a test dive east of Boston , killing all 129 men aboard .
5 December 1965
{ This write - up is drawn from the US Nuclear Weapons Accidents page formerly located at www.cdi.org/Issues/NukeAccidents/accidents.htm}
An A - 4E Skyhawk strike aircraft carrying a nuclear weapon rolled off an elevator on the U.S. aircraft carrier Ticonderoga and fell into the sea .
Because the bomb was lost at a depth of approximately 16,000 feet , Pentagon officials feared that intense water pressure could have caused the B - 43 hydrogen bomb to explode .
It is still unknown whether an explosion did occur .
The pilot , aircraft , and weapon were lost .
The Pentagon claimed that the bomb was lost " 500 miles away from land . "
However , it was later revealed that the aircraft and nuclear weapon sank only miles from the Japanese island chain of Ryukyu .
Several factors contributed to the Pentagon 's secretiveness .
The USS Ticonderoga was returning from a mission off North Vietnam ; confirming that the carrier had nuclear weapons aboard would document their introduction into the Vietnam War .
Furthermore , Japan 's anti-nuclear law prohibited the introduction of atomic weapons into its territory , and U.S. military bases in Japan are not exempt from this law .
Thus , confirming that the USS Ticonderoga carried nuclear weapons would signify U.S. violation of its military agreements with Japan .
The carrier was headed to Yokosuka , Japan , and disclosure of the accident in the mid-1980s caused a strain in U.S. - Japanese relations .
1968
Radioactive coolant water may have been released by the USS Swordfish , which was moored at the time in Sasebo Harbor in Japan .
According to one source , the incident was alleged by activists but a nearby Japanese government vessel failed to detect any such radiation leak .
The purported incident was protested bitterly by the Japanese , with Premier Eisaku Sate warning that U.S. nuclear ships would no longer be allowed to call at Japanese ports unless their safety could be guaranteed .
22 May 1968
The U.S.S. Scorpion , a nuclear - powered attack submarine carrying two Mark 45 ASTOR torpedoes with nuclear warheads , sank mysteriously on this day .
It was eventually photographed lying on the bottom of the ocean , where all ninety - nine of its crew were lost .
Details of the accident remained classified until November 1993 , when a Navy report detailing the incident was made public .
The report suggested that a malfunction in one of Scorpion 's torpedoes could have caused the sinking , but evidence from subsequent dives to the location suggest that this was not the culprit .
14 January 1969
A series of explosions aboard the nuclear aircraft carrier Enterprise left 17 dead and 85 injured .
16 May 1969
The U.S.S. Guitarro , a $ 50 million nuclear submarine undergoing final fitting in San Francisco Bay , sank to the bottom as water poured into a forward compartment .
A House Armed Services subcommittee later found the Navy guilty of " inexcusable carelessness " in connection with the event .
12 December 1971
Five hundred gallons of radioactive coolant water spilled into the Thames River near New London , Connecticut as it was being transferred from the submarine Dace to the sub tender Fulton .
October - November 1975
The USS Proteus , a disabled submarine tender , discharged significant amounts of radioactive coolant water into Guam 's Apra Harbor .
A geiger counter check of the harbor water near two public beaches measured 100 millirems / hour , fifty times the allowable dose .
22 May 1978
Up to 500 gallons of radioactive water was released when a valve was mistakenly opened aboard the USS Puffer near Puget Sound in Washington .
November 1992
Due to a valve failure , the nuclear - powered USS Long Beach leaked 109 gallons of radioactive cooling water over a 44 - day period while docked at San Diego Naval Station .
An additional 50 gallons had leaked out there the previous April and May .
The San Diego Union reported that coolant had also been released at Pearl Harbor ( Hawaii ) and Indian Island ( Washington ) .
U.S. Navy officials insist that the level of radiation posed no threat , and that a " very small amount of valve leakage that is unavoidable and occurs on all ships is well understood , controlled and accounted for . "
Nuclear Bomb Tests and Testing Facilities - Other
5 September 1961
President Kennedy ordered the resumption of nuclear testing , " underground , with no fallout . "

1971
After experimenting with disposal of radioactive waste in salt , the Atomic Energy Commission announced that " Project Salt Vault " would solve the waste problem .
But when 180,000 gallons of contaminated water was pumped into a borehole ; it promptly and unexpectedly disappeared .
The project was abandoned two years later .
1972
The West Valley , NY fuel reprocessing plant was closed after 6 years in operation , leaving 600,000 gallons of high - level wastes buried in leaking tanks .
The site caused measurable contamination of Lakes Ontario and Erie .
December 1972
A major fire and two explosions occurred at a Pauling , New York plutonium fabrication plant .
An undetermined amount of radioactive plutonium was scattered inside and outside the plant , resulting in its permanent shutdown .
1979
The Critical Mass Energy Project ( part of Ralph Nader 's Public Citizen , Inc. ) tabulated 122 accidents involving the transport of nuclear material in 1979 , including 17 involving radioactive contamination .
16 July 1979
In the largest single release of radiation in U.S. history , a dam holding radioactive uranium mill tailings in Church Rock , New Mexico failed , sending an estimated 100 million gallons of radioactive liquids and 1,100 tons of solid waste as far as 50 miles downstream into neighboring Arizona .
August 1979
Highly enriched uranium was released from a top - secret nuclear fuel plant near Erwin , Tennessee .
About 1,000 people were contaminated with up to 5 times as much radiation as would normally be received in a year .
Between 1968 and 1983 the plant " lost " 234 pounds of highly enriched uranium , forcing the plant to be closed six times during that period .
January 1980
A 5.5 Richter earthquake at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , where large amounts of nuclear material are kept , caused a tritium leak .
21 September 1980
Two canisters containing radioactive materials fell off a truck on New Jersey 's Route 17 .
The driver , en route from Pennsylvania to Toronto , did not notice the missing cargo until he reached Albany , New York .
1983
The Department of Energy confirmed that 1,200 tons of mercury had been released over the years from the Y - 12 Nuclear Weapons Components Plant at Oak Ridge , Tennessee , the U.S. 's earliest nuclear weapons production plant .
In 1987 , the DOE also reported that PCBs , heavy metals , and radioactive substances were all present in the groundwater beneath Y - 12 .
Y - 12 and the nearby K - 25 and X - 10 plants were found to have contaminated the atmosphere , soil and streams in the area .
December 1984
The Fernald Uranium Plant , a 1,050 - acre uranium fuel production complex 20 miles northwest of Cincinnati , Ohio , was temporarily shut down after the Department of Energy disclosed that excessive amounts of radioactive materials had been released through ventilating systems .
Subsequent reports revealed that 230 tons of radioactive material had leaked into the Greater Miami River valley during the previous thirty years , 39 tons of uranium dust had been released into the atmosphere , 83 tons had been discharged into surface water , and 5,500 tons of radioactive and other hazardous substances had been released into pits and swamps where they seeped into the groundwater .
In addition , 337 tons of uranium hexafluoride was found to be missing , its whereabouts completely unknown .
In 1988 nearby residents sued and were granted a $ 73 million settlement by the government .
The plant was not permanently shut down until 1989 .
1986
A truck carrying low - level radioactive material swerved to avoid a farm vehicle , went off a bridge on Route 84 in Idaho , and dumped part of its cargo in the Snake River .
Officials reported the release of radioactivity .
6 January 1986
A container of highly toxic gas exploded at The Sequoyah Fuels Corp. uranium processing factory in Gore , Oklahoma , causing one worker to die ( when his lungs were destroyed ) and 130 others to seek medical treatment .
In response , the Government kept the plant closed for more than a year and fined owners Kerr - McGee $ 310,000 , citing poorly trained workers , poorly maintained equipment and a disregard for safety and the environment .
[ See also 24 November 1992 . ]
1988
The National Research Council panel released a report listing 30 " significant unreported incidents " at the Savannah River production plants over the previous 30 years .
As at Hanford , ground water contamination resulted from pushing production of radioactive materials past safe limits at this weapons complex .
In January 1989 , scientists discovered a fault running under the entire site through which contaminants reached the underground aquifer , a major source of drinking water for the southeast .
Turtles in nearby ponds were found to contain radioactive strontium of up to 1,000 times the normal background level .
6 June 1988
Radiation Sterilizers , Incorporated reported that a leak of Cesium - 137 had occurred at their Decatur , Georgia facility .
Seventy thousand medical supply containers and milk cartons were recalled as they had been exposed to radiation .
Ten employees were also exposed , three of whom " had enough on them that they contaminated other surfaces " including materials in their homes and cars , according to Jim Setser at the Georgia Department of Natural Resources .
October 1988
The Rocky Flats , Colorado plutonium bomb manufacturing site was partially closed after two employees and a Department of Energy inspector inhaled radioactive particles .
Subsequent investigations revealed safety violations ( including uncalibrated monitors and insufficient fire - response equipment ) and leaching of radioactive contaminants into the local groundwater .
24 November 1992
The Sequoyah Fuels Corp. uranium processing factory in Gore , Oklahoma closed after repeated citations by the Government for violations of nuclear safety and environmental rules .
It 's record during 22 years of operation included an accident in 1986 that killed one worker and injured dozens of others and the contamination of the Arkansas River and groundwater .
The Sequoyah Fuels plant , one of two privately - owned American factories that fabricated fuel rods and armor- piercing bullet shells , had been shut down a week before by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission when an accident resulted in the release of toxic gas .
Thirty - four people sought medical attention as a result of the accident .
The plant had also been shut down the year before when unusually high concentrations of uranium were detected in water in a nearby construction pit .
[ Also see 6 January 1986 for details of an additional incident . ]
A Government investigation revealed that the company had known for years that uranium was leaking into the ground at levels 35,000 times higher than Federal law allows ; Carol Couch , the plant 's environmental manager , was cited by the Government for obstructing the investigation and knowingly giving Federal agents false information .
31 March 1994
Fire at a nuclear research facility on Long Island , New York resulted in the nuclear contamination of three fire fighters , three reactor operators , and one technician .
Measurable amounts of radioactive substances were released into the immediate environment .
8 August 1999
The Washington Post reported that thousands of workers were unwittingly exposed to plutonium and other highly radioactive metals over a 23 - year period ( beginning in the mid-1950's ) at the Department of Energy 's Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Kentucky .
Workers , told they were handling Uranium ( rather than the far more toxic plutonium ) , inhaled radioactive dust while processing the materials as part of a government experiment to recycle used nuclear reactor fuel .
June 2000
U.S. Senator Mike DeWine ( R - OH ) led a field senate hearing regarding workers exposed to hazardous materials while working in the nation 's atomic plants .
At the hearing , which revealed information about potential on and off - site contamination at the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Piketon , Ohio , DeWine noted , " We know that as a result of Cold War efforts , the government , yes , our federal government , allowed thousands of workers at its facilities across the country to be exposed to poisonous materials , such as beryllium dust , plutonium , and silicon , without adequate protection . "
Testimony also indicated that the Piketon plant altered workers ' radiation dose readings and worked closely with medical professionals to fight worker 's compensation claims .
5 February 2014
A dump truck caught fire at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant outside Carlsbad , New Mexico ( a more serious accident would occur 9 days later - see following entry ) .
The event is details in the official report from the U.S. Department of Energy .
14 February 2014
A 55 - gallon drum of radioactive waste burst open at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant outside Carlsbad , New Mexico , leading to internal radiological contamination of 22 employees and forcing a temporary shutdown of the facility .
The incident occurred just 9 days after an accidental underground fire at the facility ( see previous entry ) .
The cause was determined to be a switch from from using clay kitty litter ( a standard usage in the industry ) to organic kitty litter , whose organic content interacted with the nuclear waste .
More than 500 additional drums packed with the wrong type of litter were sealed in heavier containers to prevent their bursting .
Numerous other safety issues were cited in the U.S. Department of Energy 's official reports ( Phase 1 and Phase 2 ) on the accident .
Hanford Site
30 August 1976
A chemical explosion at Hanford resulted in injury to one worker , including contamination with radioactive Americium 241 so severe that an onsite alpha survey meter registered off - scale measurements .
1986
After almost 40 years of cover-ups , the U.S. Government released 19,000 pages of previously classified documents which revealed that the Hanford site was responsible for the release of significant amounts of radioactive materials into the atmosphere and the adjacent Columbia River .
Between 1944 and 1966 , the eight reactors , a source of plutonium production for atomic weapons , discharged billions of gallons of liquids and billions of cubic meters of gases containing plutonium and other radioactive contaminants into the Columbia River , and the soil and air of the Columbia Basin .
Although detrimental effects were noticed as early as 1948 , all reports critical of the facilities remained classified .
By the summer of 1987 , the cost of cleaning up Hanford was estimated to be $ 48.5 billion .
The Technical Steering Panel of the government - sponsored Hanford Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project released the following statistics in July 1990 :
Of the 270,000 people living in the affected area , most received low doses of radiation from Iodine , but about 13,500 received a total dose some 1,300 times the annual amount of airborne radiation considered safe for civilians by the Department of Energy .
Approximately 1,200 children received doses far in excess of this number , and many more received additional doses from contaminants other than Iodine .
Recurring problems at the site have continued ; for example , on 5 November 2010 The Tri-City Herald reported on radioactive rabbits at the site straying " close enough to the site 's boundaries to potentially come in contact with the public " , prompting Washington State Department of Health workers to conduct a survey of contaminated droppings .
In addition , Washington Closure Hanford , a contractor cleaning up part of Hanford , has erected fences , removed vegetation , installed gravel and steel plates , and scented the perimeter with fox urine to deter contaminated animals from burrowing under border fences .
May 1997
A 40 gallon tank of toxic chemicals ( stored illegally at Handord ) exploded , causing the release of 20,000 - 30,000 gallons of plutonium - contaminated water .
A cover -up ensued , involving the contractors doing clean - up and the Department of Energy , who denied the release of radioactive materials .
They also told eight plant workers that tests indicated that they had n't been exposed to plutonium even though no such tests actually were conducted ( later testing revealed that in fact they had not been exposed ) .
Fluor Daniel Hanford Inc. , operator of the Hanford Site , was cited for violations of the Department of Energy 's nuclear safety rules and fined $ 140,625 .
Violations associated with the explosion included the contractor 's failure to assure that breathing devices operated effectively , failure to make timely notifications of the emergency , and failure to conduct proper radiological surveys of workers .
Other violations cited by the DOE included a number of events between November 1996 and June 1997 involving Fluor Daniel Hanford 's failure to assure adherence to PFP " criticality " safety procedures .
( " Criticality " features are defined as those features used " to assure safe handling of fissile materials and prevention of ... an unplanned and uncontrolled chain reaction that can release large amounts of radiation . " )
July 2000
Wildfires in the vicinity of the Hanford site hit the highly radioactive " B/ C " waste disposal trenches , raising airborne plutonium radiation levels in the nearby cities of Pasco and Richland to 1,000 above normal .
Wildfires also threatened the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and the DOE's Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory .
In the latter case , the fires closely approached large amounts of stored radioactive waste and forced the evacuation of 1,800 workers .
9 May 2013
Scientific American reported that 60 of 177 onsite underground tanks were found to be leaking .
Controversy surrounding the project , run by contractor Bechtel National , Inc. led to the resignment of Chief project engineer Gary Brunson , while whistleblower complaints ( alleging that safety concerns were suppressed by Bechtel ) were filed by Nuclear and Environmental Safety Manager Donna Busche and former Deputy Chief Process Engineer Walter Tamosaitis .
9 May 2017
A portion of a tunnel used to store highly radioactive chemical waste and irradiated equipment collapsed , resulting in temporary evacuation of the site .
8 June 2017
At least 11 workers tested positive for internal exposure to plutonium following demolition activities , and radioactive particles were found well beyond the demolition zones where they were supposed to be contained .
Department of Energy officials initially claimed that " workers were not at risk " , but investigative journalism revealed internal memos from the contractor detailing the exposure .
An evaluation report released by contractor CH2M Hill Plateau Remediation Co. in December 2017 identified failure of onsite air monitors and incorrect use of a " fixative " to contain radiation as contributors to the contamination .
Have Voters Started to Lie Less About Minority Candidates ?
Here ’s a really interesting article ( albeit a few months old ) from the Pew Research Center that concerns a point we ’ve touched on before : Minority political candidates tend to do better in pre-election polls than in the actual elections , suggesting that voters want to sound color - blind to pollsters but in fact carry a strong racial preference into the booth .
The article cites one of the elections that we wrote about in Freakonomics :
Also in 1989 , Democrat David Dinkins , an African American , won victory over Republican Rudy Giuliani in the race for mayor of New York by a slight two points , despite leading by 18 points in a poll conducted by the New York Observer a week before the election .
The news from the Pew Center , however , is that things may be changing , on two dimensions :
1. According to the polls cited by the article , the percentage of Americans who say they would vote for a black president is at or near historical highs ; and , more significantly :
2. Based on the 2006 midterm elections , the gap between a minority candidate ’s pre-election poll numbers and actual election numbers seems to have shrunk .
In other words , it seems that fewer people lie to pollsters — and , therefore , that black candidates have a better sense of where they truly stand than they did in the past .
This is all written , not surprisingly , in the context of Barack Obama ’s electability .
If the Pew article and supporting evidence are to be believed , then the story here is substantial :
If , for instance , at the end of this very long election cycle , the polls say that Barack Obama is favored by 53 % of voters , then he might actually receive 53 % of the vote .
( Hat tip : Maya Drucker )
Over the past two decades the research community has developed a body of knowledge concerning “ Lock - Free ” and “ Wait - Free ” algorithms and data structures .
These techniques allow concurrent update of shared data structures without resorting to critical sections protected by operating system managed locks .
A number of wait - free and lock free algorithms for simple data structures such as LIFO stacks and FIFO queues have been published .
Lock - free algorithms for more complex data structures such as priority queues , hash tables , sets , and red - black trees are also known .
Some of the most commonly stated benefits of lock - free synchronisation are :
Efficiency benefits compared to lock - based algorithms for some workloads , including potential scalability benefits on multiprocessor machines .
Support for concurrent update to shared data structures even when locks are n’t available ( e.g. in interrupt handlers etc . )
Avoidance of priority inversion in real - time systems .
A significant benefit of lock ( or wait ) - freedom for real - time systems is that by avoiding locks the potential for priority inversion is avoided .
Solutions for avoiding priority inversion usually involve special real - time process schedulers .
On platforms where a real - time scheduler is not present , lock - free data structures provide an opportunity to sidestep the hazards of interlocking with the scheduler .
With the exception of a uniprocessor implementation of a single - reader single - writer ring buffer FIFO , all the lock - free algorithms which I have encountered require the use of special atomic processor instructions such as CAS ( compare and swap ) or LL / SC ( load linked / store conditional ) .
Furthermore , the correct implementation of these algorithms also requires an understanding of the use of memory barriers to force the order of some memory reads and writes on multiprocessor systems .
This is because memory controllers may reorder reads and writes as observed by other processors on an multiprocessor system ( or by prehipherals on a uniprocessor system ) .
Lock free structures in computer music
One example of a context that can benefit from lock - free synchronisation is the desktop digital audio domain .
Commodity operating systems such as Microsoft Windows and Macintosh OS - X do not provide real - time schedulers , yet there is often a requirement for concurrent access to shared data structures accross separate threads maintaining a GUI , performing real - time audio rendering , and performing disk and network i/o .
Lock - free data structures are not unknown in the computer music world .
For example the venerable single - reader single - writer atomic ring buffer FIFO is found in many systems including PortAudio , PortMidi , and SuperCollider .
More complex data structures such as node - based lock free queues are found in MidiShare ( see also post to LAD ) .
JACK also cites some lock - free publications although it is not clear if it uses them .
Serpent uses lock - free data structures .
JSyn uses lock - free FIFOs and singly - linked - lists .
Ken Greenbaum informs me that the SGI AL implementation uses the single - reader , single - writer ring buffer algorithm , and successfully implements this on symmetric MP machines .
In search of an open source library
It would be useful to have a cross- platform library of lock - free primitives for implementing real - time applications on desktop operating systems .
Such a library would include implementations of queues and stacks , low level atomic update operations and memory barriers .
It may also be useful to include higher level infrastructure , such as a robust implementation of deferred C++ function calls ( for example see the single reader , single writer prototype code here ) .
The present author is seeking to find or develop a library released under a permissive open source license allowing use in closed - source applications .
These requirements can be summarised as follows :
Portability with support for ( at least ) the dominant desktop computing platforms ( i.e. PPC , x86 , Mac - OSX , Linux , Windows ) .
Implementation of common lock - free data structures such as LIFO stack and FIFO queue .
Licensed under a flexible license permitting use in both open - source and closed - source systems ( e.g. LGPL or BSD licensed )
Thus far a library which fulfills the above requirements has not been identified .
If you know of such a library , or are interested in contributing to the development of one , please let me know .
Existing source code and libraries .
The following is a list of open - source libraries which provide implementations of lock - free data structures .
If you know of one which is n’t listed here , please let me know .
Brief literature survey
This is not an exhaustive list , but the hope is that enough core articles are linked to give a good introduction to the field .
Most of the resources here can be turned up on google or citeseer with search terms such as “ lock free ” , “ lock - free ” , “ wait free ” , “ lock free queue ” , “ non-blocking ” , “ atomic fifo ” , etc .

The director of public prosecutions , Sir Ken Macdonald , put himself at odds with the home secretary and Downing Street last night by denying that Britain is caught up in a " war on terror " and calling for a " culture of legislative restraint " in passing laws to deal with terrorism .
Sir Ken warned of the pernicious risk that a " fear - driven and inappropriate " response to the threat could lead Britain to abandon respect for fair trials and the due process of law .
He acknowledged that the country faced a different and more dangerous threat than in the days of IRA terrorism and that it had " all the disturbing elements of a death cult psychology " .
But he said : " It is critical that we understand that this new form of terrorism carries another more subtle , perhaps equally pernicious , risk .
Because it might encourage a fear - driven and inappropriate response .
By that I mean it can tempt us to abandon our values .
I think it important to understand that this is one of its primary purposes . "
Sir Ken pointed to the rhetoric around the " war on terror " - which has been adopted by Tony Blair and ministers after being coined by George Bush - to illustrate the risks .
He said : " London is not a battlefield .
Those innocents who were murdered on July 7 2005 were not victims of war .
And the men who killed them were not , as in their vanity they claimed on their ludicrous videos , ' soldiers ' .
They were deluded , narcissistic inadequates .
They were criminals .
They were fantasists .
We need to be very clear about this .
On the streets of London , there is no such thing as a ' war on terror ' , just as there can be no such thing as a ' war on drugs ' .
" The fight against terrorism on the streets of Britain is not a war .
It is the prevention of crime , the enforcement of our laws and the winning of justice for those damaged by their infringement . "
Sir Ken , head of the Crown Prosecution Service , told members of the Criminal Bar Association it should be an article of faith that crimes of terrorism are dealt with by criminal justice and that a " culture of legislative restraint in the area of terrorist crime is central to the existence of an efficient and human rights compatible process " .
He said : " We would n't get far in promoting a civilising culture of respect for rights amongst and between citizens if we set about undermining fair trials in the simple pursuit of greater numbers of inevitably less safe convictions .
On the contrary , it is obvious that the process of winning convictions ought to be in keeping with a consensual rule of law and not detached from it .
Otherwise we sacrifice fundamental values critical to the maintenance of the rule of law - upon which everything else depends . "
His comments will be seen as a swipe against government legislation allowing the indefinite detention of suspected terrorists without trial , later held incompatible with human rights by the courts , and the replacement law that permits suspects to be placed under control orders instead of being brought to trial .
Sir Ken referred to the government 's opt - out from the European convention on human rights to pass the detention law - possible under the convention only if the " life of the nation " is threatened .
" Everyone here will come to their own conclusion about whether , in the striking Strasbourg phrase , the very ' life of the nation ' is presently endangered , " he said .
" And everyone here will equally understand the risk to our constitution if we decide that it is , when it is not . "
The criminal justice response to terrorism must be " proportionate and grounded in due process and the rule of law , " he said .
" We must protect ourselves from these atrocious crimes without abandoning our traditions of freedom . "
Why are More Boys than Girls Being Born ?
by www.SixWise.com
94,232 more boys than girls were born in 2002 .
This is the latest finding of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's ( CDC ) " Trend Analysis of the Sex Ratio at Birth in the United States , " which measured the sex ratio at birth for more than the past 60 years .
If that statistic surprised you , you 'll be even more surprised to learn that an average of 91,685 more male babies have been born each year than females from 1940 to 2002 .
That means a total of 5,776,130 more boys were born during that period .
Even though more boys are born , some say male births are actually decreasing .
The CDC pointed out a few other interesting findings on the ratio of boys to girls , too :
Older Moms and Teen Moms : Women in their 40s had the lowest ratio of boys to girls while late - teen moms had the highest .
Number of children :
The more children a woman has , the more likely she 'll have an equal number of girls and boys
Ethnicity : Chinese women had the highest ratio of boys to girls , followed by Filipino women , while American Indian moms had the lowest .
Other factors that may impact the ratio include older fathers , stress , environmental toxins and lower maternal weight , says the CDC .
During development , boys are more fragile than girls .
Although these statistics may seem alarming at first glance , they are well within the " normal " worldwide ratios , even at the extremes .
Globally , there are about 105 - 107 boys born for every 100 girls .
At the highest sex birth ratio in the United States , which occurred in 1946 , there were about 105.9 boys born per 100 girls ; and at the lowest sex birth ratio ( in 2001 ) , there were about 104.6 boys born per 100 girls .
There were 104.8 boys born in 2000 for every 100 girls .
For comparison , in China , where couples are only allowed to have one child , the gender balance has become alarmingly skewed and millions of men may be forced to remain bachelors because of the shortage of women .
" This is a seriously dangerous ratio , " said Ren Yuling , a delegate to the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Committee .
" The numbers mean that some people will never have their needs for a spouse met , so they move into dangerous territory . "
Just what is China 's sex birth ratio ?
In 2000 , there were 116.9 boys born for every 100 girls .
Why are more boys naturally born than girls ?
The New York Times offered some clues in an article called , " The Weaker Sex . "
Although more boys are born , it appears they may be more susceptible to a host of diseases , injuries and more , and soon women actually outnumber men .
Here are just a few of their findings :
Facts on Females Living Longer & Stronger
Male births slightly outnumber female births , but boys have a higher death rate if born premature : 22 percent compared with 15 percent for girls .
Overall , more newborn males die than females ( 5 to 4 ) .
Sudden infant death syndrome is one and a half times more common in boys than girls .
As teenagers , boys die at twice the rate of girls .
Men have fewer infection - fighting T - cells and are thought to have weaker immune systems than women .
By the age of 36 , women outnumber men .
Stroke , cancer , diabetes , heart disease and accidents -- all among the top causes of death - - kill men at a higher rate than women .
American men typically die almost six years before women do .
By the age of 100 , women outnumber men eight to one .
During fetal development " the male sex is clearly the more fragile one , " said Bruce B. Allan , an obstetrician - gynecologist in Calgary , Alberta Canada .
Between 1970 and 1990 , the proportion of male births decreased 1 percent .
The CDC study above does n't touch on another CDC finding , this one released in 2002 , that birth rates overall had hit an all - time low .
The birth rate fell to 13.9 per 1,000 persons in 2002 , down from 14.1 per 1,000 in 2001 .
This is a full 17 percent decrease in births from 1990 , when rates reached 16.7 per 1,000 people .
Take that finding , coupled with the fact that a study by Allan and his colleagues found that , from 1930 to 1990 , the male sex ratio had dropped by about 1 boy per 1,000 births .
Though older parents , fertility drugs and certain diseases have all been linked to an increasing proportion of female births , Michelle B. Gottlieb of the World Resources Institute ( WRI ) , says the findings " suggest that avoidable , [ likely ] environmental , factors may be playing a role . "
Pollutants that mimic human hormones , including dioxin have become ubiquitous in the environment and may be affecting births .
For instance , in 1976 , an industrial accident released high levels of dioxin into the environment near Seveso , Italy .
Of the nine couples who received the highest exposure , 12 daughters were born -- and no sons .
Among four couples who had lower blood levels of dioxin , " The male - female ratio approached normal , " said Larry L. Needham of the Atlanta CDC .
Devra Lee Davis , a program director at WRI believes that the declining male birth ratio " should be viewed as a sentinel health event , " an indicator that environmental hazards difficult to detect by other means do exist and should be dealt with .
But there are other theories too .
A study in the journal of the American Medical Association found that high exposures to certain pesticides could interfere with a father 's ability to produce sperm cells with Y chromosomes -- the kind needed for boys .
And , another study found that women who eat PCB - contaminated fish ( PCBs , or polychlorinated biphenyls , can mimic female sex hormones ) are less likely to give birth to boys .
The women who were exposed to the highest levels of PCBs ( just by eating contaminated fish ) had about 50 percent fewer boys compared with women who had been exposed to the lowest levels .
So even though over 94 , 000 more boys than girls are born in the United States each year , it seems it 's the boys we need to worry about -- in the two decades between 1970 and 1990 , the proportion of male births went down an entire 1 percent worldwide .

Where Have All the Boys Gone ?
Polluted Fish Reduce Male Birth Rate
Logs are external interfaces to software systems , and while normal external integration layer APIs are given much thought and care , logs are typically generated just by dumping ad - hoc messages , making them unnecessarily hard to use .
Following these few simple guidelines can make lives of both developers and support much easier in the long term .
Although agreeing on log files and formats should definitely not take as much time as designing functional APIs , thinking about logs up front can make a big difference once a system goes live .
The following questions are a good start :
What groups of people will use the logs and for what ?
What kind of information will they need in order to do their job ?
How will the logs be used ( will they be parsed , filtered , imported , read by a human , analysed by a report tool ) ?
How long should the logs be kept ?
Here are a few examples :
Administrators need to know about operational problems .
They will typically be checking the files once a day , possibly getting updates by mail .
Sometimes , urgent messages will need to be sent to administrators straight away , possibly to beepers , mobile phones or by e-mail .
Format of log messages for administrators does not need to be specially fixed or stable , but has to contain enough information to alert appropriate people .
Support staff should be able to diagnose recent problems - for example , they need audit information , SQL commands , and errors .
Support logs should typically be kept for a few days or weeks , since customers might report minor problems only if they persist for a few days .
Logs will typically be used from a file viewer either on the target system , or copied from the client to the support workstation ( sometimes sent by e-mail ) , so files have to be kept fairly small .
They also have to be in a format that is easy to parse , as support staff will often write ad - hoc scripts in awk or a similar tool to extract relevant data .
Supports also needs another log , much more detailed , for fire - fighting situations .
It should enable trouble - shooters to find out exactly what the system is doing at the moment .
This log type is typically not kept at all , and support staff should be able to turn it on or off on demand .
It will typically be used on - line with tail or some other tool , should be human readable and easy to filter ( hide unwanted messages ) .
Sometimes these messages are not even stored in files , but pushed out to an UDP / TCP port .
Customers are looking for marketing - related information such as business volume , origin of users etc .
They will typically use logs to produce reports , and delete / recycle the logs after the reports are produced .
These logs will typically be analysed on the host system , or copied to a report server and analysed there .
Typically , they will be parsed using a custom log analysis tool , or imported into the database .
Format of this file must be fairly stable , as clients or third - parties might develop scripts to perform the analysis .
Customers might also be looking for user action audit logs ( depending on the nature of the system ) , which will be archived and kept for a longer period ( sometimes years ) .
These logs will be used by customers to search for security or money related problems , typically by extracting entire user sessions , so they will primarily be parsed with awk , grep or a similar tool .
Format of this file must be fairly stable , as clients or third - parties might develop scripts to perform the analysis .
It should also be human - readable .
Developers will use logs for trouble - shooting and debugging on development systems , typically reading them in a text viewer or with more / tail .
For developers , logs have to be human readable and contain a lot of fine - grained tracing information , but will not be copied , analysed or parsed .
Log file anti-patterns
Here are a few common errors which make log files much harder to use :
Single message dump
Often , it is best to produce a separate log file for each user group , as they have different needs , and appropriate log files will have different ‘ expiry periods ’ .
Support logs might be kept for a week , marketing logs might be rotated every day , audit logs might be kept for years .
Keeping all these messages in a single file makes it impossible to archive only audit logs , and will typically make automated parsing much harder .
Logging incomplete data
Common examples are logging exceptions without stack traces or SQL commands without parameter values .
Logs must contain all the information that enables users to get their job done .
Think whether an error entry in the support log contains everything relevant for troubleshooting .
DIY separators
Using multiple separators or non-standard separators makes automated parsing very hard .
Common examples of this anti-pattern are using pipes , tildas , dashes , various brackets or combinations of those .
A script for parsing such files will be much more complex and much harder to write than a file with a a single entry separator , consistently used .
It ’s best to use standard commas or tabs - this makes parsing much easier , and a lot of existing tools can provide data extraction and filtering .
Inconsistent format for messages in a single file
Mixing formats for different types of messages in a single file makes it very hard to parse .
Files intended for automated filtering and parsing should have a consistent message format - if using the same format for two types of messages does not make sense , perhaps they belong in different files .
Multi-line entries
Single - line entries are much , much easier to parse , analyse , transform and load into a database .
Most multi-line entries can be transformed to a single - line by replacing CRLFs with blanks .
Multi-line entries could be allowed in urgent administrator messages or on - line trace log , but not for support logs which should be automatically filtered and parsed .
If you absolutely have to include multi-line entries , ensure that there is a separator line after each entry , and separators must be easy to find and filter .
An exception to the rule are audit logs which will only be used off - line to generate reports , but they must be structured properly ( i.e. XML ) .
Logging a single contextual message as multiple entries / lines
A common example is logging a SQL command and then logging parameter values as separate messages .
This might seem quite fine for a developer working in an isolated environment , but on a production server , due to several threads , such contextual groups might overlap , and parameters of one command might be logged after another command .
Again , a single log entry should contain all relevant information .
Audit logging after the action
A common example is logging a SQL command after the execution .
In case of an exception , the log entry might not be written , so the audit log will not provide relevant contextual information for the exception .
Audit log entries should be written before an action - not after .
A good log
On the end , a log file is useless if it ’s just a pile of messages , hard to read or parse .
Having a poor log file is better than not having one at all , but a good log system can save a lot of money and effort by making troubleshooting and support easier .
Here is a short list of guidelines to produce good logs :
As Lance Armstrong heads for a record seventh win in the Tour de France , Denis Campbell analyses the physical and emotional strengths that make him great
Soon after breakfast this morning , 161 of the world 's top cyclists will mount their machines at Lezat - sur - Leze in the Pyrenees and embark on one of the toughest stages of the world 's most gruelling sporting challenge , the Tour de France .
They will spend the best part of seven hours in the saddle and , in draining heat , tackle 205.5 km ( 128 miles ) of hills , passes and climbs of unremitting cruelty at speeds which average 28 - 30 m ph but sometimes reach 65 mph .
No wonder the riders describe the Tour as three weeks of torture .
Whatever their best efforts , by tonight one man - Lance Armstrong - will almost certainly still be in the lead .
Cycling 's icon and figurehead is chasing an astonishing seventh consecutive win in an event which requires superhuman qualities .
His tactics are simple : ' It 's attack until they crack , or I do , ' he says .
If he triumphs yet again when the Tour ends on the Champs - Elysees next Sunday , the American will have both rewritten the annals of sporting achievement and redefined the limits of human endeavour .
Unhappily for his rivals , the 33 - year - old Texan has more heart than them for the task ahead - quite literally .
' Genetically Lance is a freak , ' says his friend Tony Doyle , the British former pursuit cycling world champion .
' His heart and lungs are bigger than most people 's , and most other elite cyclists ' , so they make him more efficient as an athlete .
He also generates far less lactic acid than the others , and he recovers quicker - vital in a race where you push yourself to the limit day after day after day . '
Most usefully , though , Armstrong is a survivor .
' Although the Tour is excruciatingly painful , for Lance it is still not as tough a battle as when he overcame testicular cancer , ' explains Doyle .
' That means that he is mentally strong , very driven and has a lot higher pain threshold than the other guys because he 's beaten a life - threatening disease .
He can suffer that bit more . '
Cancer gave Armstrong the worst times of his life .
Hearing he had a 60 per chance of dying .
Having surgery to remove one testis .
Chemotherapy to fight tumours that had spread to his lungs and brain .
Five months in hospital as he defied doctors ' expectations .
But illness was also the making of him .
' In a strange way cancer did him a huge favour , ' says Daniel Coyle , author of the recent biography Lance Armstrong : Tour de Force .
' It removed 15 lbs of muscle and resculpted his body into the leaner shape .
Before then he had been too big and too muscular , especially in the upper body .
And it gave him the discipline that , allied to his talent , turned him into the sporting phenomenon he is today .
' He was already a world champion , but he had been an undisciplined kid : brash and uncontrollable .
After he was diagnosed with cancer , he began displaying discipline at the millimetre level . '
When the doctor told him his body was riddled with tumours , Armstrong took in the news for a couple of minutes and then said : ' Let 's get started .
Let 's kill this stuff . '
Coyle says : ' He adopted a very scientific approach to fighting the cancer . '
Out went coffee , red meat and dairy products .
' He went after the cancer in a very organised , methodical , aggressive way , and came away with an appreciation of what discipline could do for him .
He approaches cycling the same way .
He weighs his food to ensure he does not go above his optimum weight , and constantly monitors his bodyfat ratio .
' After cancer , he turned the Tour into a problem he wanted to solve , ' says Coyle .
' He pays attention to every last detail that contributes to the pursuit of excellence .
That 's what sets him apart , ' believes Dave Brailsford , the performance director at British Cycling .
' He is always looking to make a tiny improvement to his nutrition , his position on the bike , or the science of how he trains . '
Thus he avoids ice cream , in case it causes indigestion , or carbonated water , lest it induce diarrhoea , or chocolate mousse - excessive sweating - and does not shave his legs the night before racing , in case the minimal energy required to regrow the hair makes a difference .
He has two key numbers : 74 , his optimal weight in kilos , and 500 , which is his maximum sustainable power in watts .
If they are both right he will produce 6.7 watts per kilo .
If he does that , he will almost certainly win .
His key advantage is that he can sustain that power for an hour at a time , even up and down the Pyrenees .
Germany 's Jan Ullrich , his nearest rival , cannot quite match Armstrong 's consistency .
' He is not happy until he has found " the shit " - the coolest helmet , or fastest bike or best teammate .
He 's about trying to make himself into " the shit " , the thing nobody has seen before ' , says Coyle .
His eight teammates in the Discovery Channel team , and their 30 - strong back - up squad of specialists , all share one goal : for Armstrong to win .
His feats have inevitably prompted speculation thathis success might be down to performance - enhancing substances .
Allegations to that effect in a book last year have led to ongoing legal action .
Armstrong denies the accusations and has always tested negative .
Any conversation with one of cycling 's cognoscenti about what makes Armstrong so good comes back to his cancer and the tough childhood which forged his iron will .
He was born Lance Gunderson in Plano , Texas , in September 1971 , when his mother , Linda Mooneyham , was 17 .
Her marriage to his father , Eddie Gunderson , broke down when he was just three .
Armstrong has never spoken to , or about , his father since .
' Lance would undoubtedly not have turned out the way he has _ if I had stayed with his mother , ' Gunderson admitted recently .
' I would probably have ballsed the whole thing up . '
Armstrong was named after Lance Retzel of the Dallas Cowboys gridiron team ; his surname came from his mother 's second husband , Terry Armstrong , his ex-stepfather .
Times were hard for mother and son , financially and emotionally .
' When things got tough , I would always tell Lance that " this is n't a problem , this is an opportunity " , ' she has said .
' We were n't afraid of failing , only of giving up .
Losing is worthwhile if you learn something worthwhile from it .'
But losing is the last thing on Armstrong 's mind .
Next Sunday , come what may , he intends to retire - and wants to bow out on a high , as a champion and a history - maker .
His place in posterity assured , he plans to unwind , spend more time with the three children from his first marriage , start a new family with his girlfriend , the rock singer Sheryl Crow , and devote even more energy to his cancer charity .
An adviser to George W Bush on the President 's Cancer Panel , there is even talk of a career in politics , and following in Bush 's steps by running for governor of his home state .
Before then , though , there is one last week in the saddle - one final battle for the ultimate winner .
The Tour in figures
The Tour de France began in 1903 but was almost abandoned in 1904 because cheating was so common
There are 21 stages in 23 days over a total of 2,241 miles .
The longest is 239.5 km ( 150 miles )
Riders reach up to 70 mph .
At such speeds a burst tyre , skid or collision can be fatal
It is very demanding : 28 riders have dropped out already this year .
Belgium 's Georges Goffin began the race in 1909 , 1911 and 1922 but never lasted beyond day one
The Alpe d'Huez has 21 ' switchbacks ' , turns of at least 90 degrees
Riders often relieve themselves in the saddle to save time
Competitors consume up to 7,500 calories a day
Top riders earn about £ 1 m a year , though Armstrong makes around £ 10 m in race fees , prize money and sponsorship
Britain's Bradley Wiggins won a gold , silver and bronze at the 2004 Olympics but there are no Britons in the Tour de France
The worst - person citations eventually riled Mr. O’Reilly enough that he began a petition drive directed at Mr. Olbermann ( though he did not mention him by name ; he has apparently never mentioned Mr. Olbermann ’s name ) , suggesting that he be replaced by a long - ago MSNBC host , Phil Donahue .
Mr. Donahue ’s ratings , Mr. O’Reilly said in February , eclipsed anything MSNBC had achieved since .
By the next day , Mr. Olbermann was celebrating the petition and offering to sign it himself .
Now he gleefully notes that Mr. O’Reilly ( whose name he has no trouble uttering ) only helped his cause by taking the bait and responding to the gibes .
“ You do n’t punch down , ” Mr. Olbermann said .
“ If you ’re in my position , ” he added , referring to his initially microscopic ratings next to Mr. O’Reilly ’s , “ you punch upwards . ”
Every time Mr. O’Reilly took umbrage at the slams , it seemed to add a bounce to Mr. Olbermann ’s ratings — one reason , perhaps , that Mr. O’Reilly ’s reactions seem to have tailed off more recently .
Nobody at Fox News wants Mr. Olbermann to get any more of a draft from Mr. O’Reilly ’s popularity .
Mr. Olbermann thinks he knows one reason behind his gains .
He believes that Mr. O’Reilly ’s audience , which is still huge , is aging .
He noted that Mr. O’Reilly ’s total viewer ratings are basically flat , while his numbers in the younger audience group have been dropping — down about 15 percent for the last quarter .
“ There is no other conclusion to draw than he is not adding younger viewers , ” Mr. Olbermann said .
Of course , in terms of numbers of viewers in that younger age group , Mr. O’Reilly is still playing in another league , with about three times as many as Mr. Olbermann .
But that does represent a small slice of the total audience for Mr. O’Reilly .
MSNBC ’s research claims that the median age for Mr. O’Reilly ’s audience is 71 , while Mr. Olbermann ’s is 59 .
( Fox and CNN both report that the only figures they get for median age of shows with older audiences is “ 65 plus , ” and that Mr. O’Reilly ’s audience falls into that category . )
Lindsay Lohan has decided to enter the rehab because according to her she wants to protect her personal health .
Its been weeks since she was operated for the removal of her appendix .
Crispy wonton wrappers add cheerful crunch to an asian salad , but should n’t they be… more interesting ?
Presented here is the ideal upgrade .
No more must you clutter your salad with amorphous crispies or chow mein noodles to obtain the requisite crunch : Crane Croutons will be your piece de resistance .
Wonton dough is strong , flexible , and comes in a nearly square form .
If it is not square enough for your taste ( you perfectionist , you ! ) it can be easily edited to the correct shape with a pizza cutter .
We do not suggest using chinese style spring roll / egg roll wrappers .
They are somewhat foamy and do not hold their shape well , which makes them difficult to work with .
After we got excited about this idea , we checked to see if it had been done before .
( Yes , we know that most good ideas are rediscoveries . )
The Paper Discovery Center mentions an origami artist who has used wonton dough , but we ca n’t find substantial documentation of it anywhere .
We recommend making a crane with paper before you try with wonton wrappers .
There are many sets of origami instructions out there .
A couple of acceptable ones for cranes are here and here .
If you ’ve made cranes before , you can probably follow along here just fine .
A couple of things to keep in mind as you are folding :
If you fold paper back and forth enough times , it will break ; the same is true for wonton wrappers , only more so .
You can do a little bit of regluing with water , but do n’t rely too much on that .
Absolutely square is ideal for origami paper , but since wonton wrappers are a little bit stretchy , you can usually make them do your bidding even if they are n’t quite perfect .
While you are folding , keep the rest of the wrappers sealed in a plastic bag or covered with a damp cloth .
As they dry out they become brittle , which is not helpful .
Here is a supply of origami paper / wonton wrappers / embryonic crane croutons .
We get them at a local asian market .
They have a couple of brands , shapes and thicknesses .
Get the thinnest square ones you can .
>
Fold the square in half to form a rectangle .
Draw one corner toward the other to make a diagonal fold from corner to center .
You should end up with a nifty trapezoid ( trapezium , not trapezoid if you ’re using British English ) .
Fold the pointy corner in to form a square again .
Here ’s the tricky bit – if you pre-fold edges in to form a kite shape , you may crease the dough to the breaking point .
It is best to lift up one layer of dough and gently guide it into the rhombus shape with your fingers .
Turn over and repeat .
Fold the sides in to taper the head and tail .
Turn over and repeat .
Open one side slightly and fold up to form the head or tail .
Press the dough firmly together at the top – there are a lot of layers there and they need to be coaxed into shape .
Fold up the other side and fold down the head .
The head is n’t going to fold neatly unless you were an extreme perfectionist in earlier steps .
That is a lot of layers and they are quite a bit thicker than paper .
Treat it like clay ; give it a little bit of water and firm pressure .
You can open the wings and press down on the back gently to expand it .
Alternately , you can fold down one wing like the ones in the edges of this picture .
Depending on your cooking method you will want one or the other .
One way to cook your crane is to microwave it for about 30 seconds on high .
The surface will bubble .
Microwaved cranes are keep their three dimensional shape beautifully .
They stay a pale white which contrasts well with salad greens .
However , they are rather bland , much like a dried - out flour tortilla .
You can also deep ( or shallow ) fry them briefly on each side until they turn a golden brown which shades to a paler color in the center where there are more layers .
It is easy to overcook them , so be watchful .
Three dimensional shapes tend to roll around in the oil and do not cook as evenly , so fold down one wing for these ones .
After deep frying , they are crispy and flavorful .
We made a lot of fried ones after tasting the microwaved one .
Serve on greens with ginger sesame dressing , cherry blossom shaped carrot slices , snow peas , or whatever suits your fancy .
Alternately , serve by themselves with some dipping sauce , maybe a nice satay sauce ?
Additional origami shapes that might work : Boxes , Throwing Stars , Irises … the possibilities are endless .
Update : Instructions for the crane croutons will be published in
The Hungry Scientist Cookbook , forthcoming from ReganBooks at HarperCollins in September , 2007 .
Until then , you can hang out with the Hungry Scientists in their group on instructables .

Lindsay Lohan has been tapped as the new face of Proactiv Solution .
The acne treatment , that features such stars as Jessica Simpson , Diddy , Kelly Clarkson and Vanessa Williams providing testimonials about its miraculous results and their personal loyalty to the product , now has Lindsay Lohan sitting down for her very own Proactiv infomercial .
" My skin , thanks to Proactiv , is clear all the time , " reveals Lohan .
Two - minute spots begin airing today on MTV and E !.
The infomercial will also air on Style and MTV2 later this week .
In the ad the actress shares her acne experiences and her personal Proactiv success story .
In May , we noted the introduction of the Deleting Online Predators Act ( DOPA ) , which would among other things require schools and public libraries to bar children from accessing social networking sites like MySpace .
Despite widespread concerns about the Act , the US House of Representatives passed it by a 410 - 15 vote on Thursday .
When Rep. Michael Fitzpatrick ( R - PA ) introduced the legislation , he said it was necessary because social networking sites like MySpace were " feeding grounds for child predators that use these sites as just another way to do our children harm . "
Recent , high - profile stories such as teen girls being allegedly raped by men they met on MySpace provided ammunition for Rep.
Fitzpatrick and the bill 's other supporters , leading to its easy passage in the House .
DOPA attempts to deal with online predation by requiring schools and public libraries to bar access to " commercial social networking websites " and " chat rooms . "
However , the bill 's definition of what constitutes such sites is such that the list of sites that could be blocked is extremely broad .
Here 's how DOPA defines social networking sites :
( i ) is offered by a commercial entity ;
( ii ) permits registered users to create an on - line profile that includes detailed personal information ;
( iii ) permits registered users to create an on - line journal and share such a journal with other users ;
( iv ) elicits highly - personalized information from users ; and
( v ) enables communication among users .'.
Congratulations , Congress !
You 've just potentially barred everyone from using Amazon.com ( not to mention the Ars OpenForum ) at schools and libraries .
The Federal Communications Commission will be tasked with the unenviable job of deciding which sites are harmless and which are presumably rife with online predators and should be blocked .
Aside from the potential to block sites that fall under DOPA 's overly - broad definition , the bill suffers one other glaring flaw .
Schools and libraries are two important places where children can use the Internet under adult supervision .
By deleting online access to these sites , kids that want to access MySpace and other , prohibited sites will have to do so on the sly , meaning that interactions with would - be predators may be less likely to be observed .
Some schools have gone so far as to try blocking MySpace themselves .
In addition to leading to such well - thought - out responses from students like " THAT IS SO GAY ! " , students have been busy circumventing the filters with a surprising degree of success .
Now that DOPA has passed the House , it goes to the Senate for consideration .
Its passage through the House was surprisingly swift , and caught many of the bill 's opponents off guard .
It 's always popular for legislators to Think Of The Children , and it is an election year , so DOPA may get fast - tracked through the Senate as well .
Contact your senators and let them know what you think about DOPA and how it wo n't solve the problems it attempts to address .
Up to 40 people were believed to be living in the Economy Motor Lodge on Tulane Avenue when a fire struck the long - abandoned property on the night of March 7 .
Located six blocks from the mayor 's office and just down the street from the Superdome , the fire was the fourth at the boarded - up motel since hurricane Katrina .
Rescue workers spent the next day searching the ashes for possible victims .
None were found , though one man who had apparently slept though the blaze emerged from the building the next morning .
The city has since ordered the property torn down .
Behind that four - alarm fire lies a disturbing trend : Hurricane - ravaged New Orleans faces a major crisis with homelessness .
Already taxed to the breaking point on many fronts , the city has a homeless population that is now approximately double what existed before the storm – in a city half its previous size .
Facing a severe shortage of affordable housing , displaced residents returning to the city along with an influx of construction trade workers are being forced to sleep in everything from cars to flooded - out houses to long - abandoned motels , as Katrina relief workers from across the country still struggle to fill gaping holes in the city 's social services .
" The vast majority of emergency shelters have not been reopened since Katrina , " says Martha Kegel , executive director of UNITY , a regional collaborative of 60 agencies serving the homeless .
" There 's an enormous shortage of housing and people are desperate .
Do we have the resources to deal with this problem ?
No . "
While New Orleans has long struggled with poverty , the face of homelessness has changed since Katrina , Ms. Kegel and other advocates say .
The population now includes the chronically homeless who never left the city or have returned ; residents who lost their homes to the flood and have run out of federal assistance – or may have never received assistance – and cannot afford higher rents ; and thousands of Latino workers who came to rebuild the city , many of whom brought their spouses and children and cannot find a place to live .
" I 've been into some of these buildings myself and seen dozens of people living in them , including very young children , " Kegel says .
" One of the most shocking things we 're seeing now are the very elderly who are living in abandoned buildings and on the street – people in their late 80s living this way , who never in their lives expected to be homeless . "
More than 12,000 on the street each night
On any given night , more than 12,000 homeless men , women , and children need shelter in New Orleans , Kegel estimates .
Before Katrina it was 6,000 a night ; just a year ago it was 2,000 .
Her estimate does not include people living in federally provided trailers or multiple families occupying a single house .
The growing homeless population also faces a dearth of social services and a nearly complete lack of mental health care , along with rising crimes rates and the myriad other dangers that come with living on the streets .
According to homeless advocates , the city has no effectively functioning social - services agency offering case management to the homeless .
City officials say addressing the city 's shortage of affordable housing hinges on state and federal funds , both of which have been slow in materializing .
" Mayor [ Ray ]
Nagin realizes that homelessness is a growing problem in New Orleans , " says Pat Robinson , deputy chief for planning for the Mayor 's Office of Planning and Development .
" To address this , we 're utilizing state and federal allocations and working with agencies such as UNITY , which are working as an extension of city government . "
What little aid many of the homeless receive is being offered by grassroots volunteers who often have no experience .
Brandon Darby , interim director of Katrina relief group Common Ground , says the nonprofit has taken numerous calls from the public advocacy office asking for help to find housing for homeless residents .
During one recent week , a volunteer acting as a caseworker assisted a middle - aged diabetic who was facing discharge from a local hospital with nowhere to live , a senior citizen addicted to gambling who had been living in Harrah 's casino before she was turned out , and a mother who had spent weeks living in a car with her teenage son .
The mother had recently moved back into her flood - damaged house in the city 's hard - hit Ninth Ward when a tornado knocked it off its foundation in mid-February .
" By law the federal government was supposed to give people made homeless by Katrina 18 months of assistance , but in many , many cases that never happened , " says Mr. Darby , who has set up a toll - free number so Common Ground can take calls directly from the homeless and accept donations for their support .
" Many landlords will not work with people who have FEMA [ Federal Emergency Management Agency ] vouchers , because they 're afraid FEMA will not pay .
There are almost no services in this city for people with severe disabilities .
Rates of mental illness have gone through the roof , but there are no psychiatric beds available ....
Everyone has their own problems to deal with , and it's hard to find someone to help them . "
City opens new homeless housing facility
New Orleans did mark a step of progress last month when it opened a 40 - unit supportive housing facility for the homeless and disabled through a private - public partnership .
" This is a great day in the city of New Orleans , " Mayor Nagin said at the ribbon - cutting ceremony .
New Orleans resident Jackie Silverman , a member of Congregation Gates of Prayer Synagogue , helped establish one of the two small shelters Common Ground opened last year , providing 30 beds for the homeless .
She now volunteers as a lay caseworker with other congregants from her synagogue .
" We ask them where they were before the storm , where they are now , and where they want to go . "
Several homeless residents in the Ninth Ward have joined Common Ground 's staff , living in dorm facilities with volunteers from across the country while they await housing .
Al Bass , a resident of the Lower Ninth Ward , returned four months after Katrina with nowhere to live but his flooded - out home .
" I was in my house during the storm when 12 feet of water came in , and that 's what I came back to , " says Bass , who lived in the gutted - out property until last April .
Why stupidity is a good thing
A couple of weeks ago I read an amusing column by Joe Soucheray in the St. Paul Pioneer Press .
In it he wrote about how the educational system weâ€ ™re pouring billions of dollars into is failing because it continues to crank out idiots who ( among other things ) donâ€™t understand that you can actually die from drinking too much water .
Refreshingly , Soucherayâ€™s conclusion wasnâ€™t that teachers arenâ€™t doing their jobs .
It was that people are just dumber than they used to be .
He wasnâ€™t sure why , but based on how easy it is to find examples of stupidity today , he was quite sure people just donâ€™t have the brains they used to .
He did make some interesting points .
If you stop to think about it , initially , it does seem like the number of dumb people is on the rise .
Indeed , late night TV talk shows have been ahead of the curve on this one .
Except for terrible singers , nothingâ€™s funnier than stupidity .
What a great country .
Where else is it possible for a society to capitalize on itâ€™s own weaknesses ?
It certainly is an easy argument to make .
As Jay Leno has shown us , itâ€™s really not that hard to find stupid people these days .
Be it history , geography , literature , grammar , current events or mathematics , millions of Americans should know more than they do .
This is something I think we can almost all agree upon .
Itâ€™s why we , as a nation , are always so concerned about the state of education .
I mean , when was the last time you heard someone say , â€ œBoy our schools sure are great .
Kids today are smarter than ever.â€ ?
But if this is the caseâ € ” if , for some reason , Americans are indeed getting dumberâ€ ” logically we should begin to see a drop in the productivity of U.S. workers .
Right ?
But weâ€ ™re not .
According to the U.S. government , worker productivity has been on the rise since the early â€˜90s and has accelerated dramatically in the last five years .
According to a recent article in INC .
magazine , just one example of this rise in productivity can be found in the insurance industry .
On average , in 1991 , a worker in insurance contributed $ 85,000 in revenue to his or her company .
Today itâ€™s $ 250,000 .
So I guess the only conclusion we can make now is that stupid people ( and bad singers ) , while funny , are still great for the economy .
The problem with the argument that schools are failing or that people are dumber is that they both contain faulty assumptionsâ€ ” that we know what people today should know in order to be productive members of society .
Or better yetâ € ” we can know .
Children in kindergarten today will be graduating from high school in the year 2019 .
We donâ€™t know what the world will look like in five years .
What are the specific sets of facts or skills that are going to be valuable in the year 2019 and beyond ?
Will it be important to know where Edmonton is ?
Should everyone in that graduating class be required to know about John Smith and Pocahontas ?
How about the capital of
Rhode Island or the elements of the periodic table ?
Maybe we should be asking Jay Leno these questions .
Our current educational model was built to meet the needs of industrialism .
As such , it is assumes that you should know certain things , and you should be afraid of making mistakesâ€ ” just like you should be afraid of your boss and to make mistakes on the job .
Tests are given so that we know that you know certain things .
But letâ€™s face it .
Some kids are rebellious .
Some kids just donâ€™t care about tests .
And sometimes , try as we might , we simply canâ€™t make them afraid .
So today , understanding the complex interplay between all of the issues surrounding society and education , American politicians have devised a system called No Child Left Behind–so that others can be afraid for them .
And I think itâ€™s working .
Administrators , teachers and school boards across the nation are wringing their hands over test data , devising complex and thorough systems to identify children at risk , and redoubling their efforts to differentiate instruction to fit the unique learning styles of each student .
Thankfully , however , educators arenâ€™t fighting this battle alone .
Drs. and pharmaceutical companies are also doing their part by creating and distributing drugs that help fidgety kids stay focused .
â€ œEvery educational system around the world has the same hierarchy of subjects , â€ says Sir Ken Robinson , an expert educator and Senior Consultant for the Paul J. Getty Trust .
â€
œAt the top are mathematics and languages , then the humanities , and at the bottom are the arts .
And even within the arts is a hierarchy too .
Art and music are usually given a higher status than drama and dance .
There isnâ€™t an educational system in the world that teaches children dance every day the way we do mathematics .
â€ œTruly what happens as children grow up is that we start to educate them progressively from the waist up .
And then we focus on their headsâ€ ” and slightly to one side , â€  he says .
Robinson concludes that the whole purpose of educational systems around the world is to produce university professors .
What he advocates we do instead , is to cultivate creativity .
In 1934 , Gillian Lynneâ€™s teachers thought there was something wrong with the eight year old because she couldnâ€™t sit still .
She couldnâ€™t focus and wasnâ€™t getting anything done .
So they recommended her parents bring her to a Dr. .
After the initial examination , the Dr. asked her mother to step with him out of the room , leaving the young Gillian on her own .
But before he left , he flipped on the radio .
Outside , the Dr. simply asked Gillianâ€™s mother to watch her through the window .
â€ œYour daughter is not sick , Mrs. Lynne , â€ said the Dr.. â€ œSheâ€™s a dancer .
Take her to a dance school.â€ 
Luckily , she did , and Gillian Lynne excelled .
Eventually she met Andrew Lloyd Webber , and has since composed for some of the most successful musicals in history – including â€ œCatsâ€ and â€ œPhantom of the Opera.â€ 
Sheâ€™s been extremely successful in her career , contributed greatly to society and culture , given pleasure to millions and is a millionaire many times over .
But I have to wonderâ€ ” might she have just done better with an ADHD diagnosis and some meds ?
And do you think she knows that drinking too much water can be fatal ?
Last week I attended the Infosecurity Europe conference in London .
Like at the RSA Conference in February , the show floor was chockablock full of network , computer and information security companies .
As I often do , I mused about what it means for the IT industry that there are thousands of dedicated security products on the market : some good , more lousy , many difficult even to describe .
Why are n't IT products and services naturally secure , and what would it mean for the industry if they were ?
I mentioned this in an interview with Silicon.com , and the published article seems to have caused a bit of a stir .
Rather than letting people wonder what I really meant , I thought I should explain .
The primary reason the IT security industry exists is because IT products and services are n't naturally secure .
If computers were already secure against viruses , there would n't be any need for antivirus products .
If bad network traffic could n't be used to attack computers , no one would bother buying a firewall .
If there were no more buffer overflows , no one would have to buy products to protect against their effects .
If the IT products we purchased were secure out of the box , we would n't have to spend billions every year making them secure .
Aftermarket security is actually a very inefficient way to spend our security dollars ; it may compensate for insecure IT products , but does n't help improve their security .
Additionally , as long as IT security is a separate industry , there will be companies making money based on insecurity – companies who will lose money if the internet becomes more secure .
Fold security into the underlying products , and the companies marketing those products will have an incentive to invest in security upfront , to avoid having to spend more cash obviating the problems later .
Their profits would rise in step with the overall level of security on the internet .
Initially we 'd still be spending a comparable amount of money per year on security – on secure development practices , on embedded security and so on – but some of that money would be going into improving the quality of the IT products we 're buying , and would reduce the amount we spend on security in future years .
I know this is a utopian vision that I probably wo n't see in my lifetime , but the IT services market is pushing us in this direction .
As IT becomes more of a utility , users are going to buy a whole lot more services than products .
And by nature , services are more about results than technologies .
Service customers – whether home users or multinational corporations – care less and less about the specifics of security technologies , and increasingly expect their IT to be integrally secure .
Eight years ago , I formed Counterpane Internet Security on the premise that end users ( big corporate users , in this case ) really do n't want to have to deal with network security .
They want to fly airplanes , produce pharmaceuticals or do whatever their core business is .
They do n't want to hire the expertise to monitor their network security , and will gladly farm it out to a company that can do it for them .
We provided an array of services that took day - to - day security out of the hands of our customers : security monitoring , security - device management , incident response .
Security was something our customers purchased , but they purchased results , not details .
Last year BT bought Counterpane , further embedding network security services into the IT infrastructure .
BT has customers that do n't want to deal with network management at all ; they just want it to work .
They want the internet to be like the phone network , or the power grid , or the water system ; they want it to be a utility .
For these customers , security is n't even something they purchase :
It 's one small part of a larger IT services deal .
It 's the same reason IBM bought ISS : to be able to have a more integrated solution to sell to customers .
This is where the IT industry is headed , and when it gets there , there 'll be no point in user conferences like Infosec and RSA .
They wo n't go away ; they 'll simply become industry conferences .
If you want to measure progress , look at the demographics of these conferences .
A shift toward infrastructure - geared attendees is a measure of success .
Of course , security products wo n't disappear – at least , not in my lifetime .
There 'll still be firewalls , antivirus software and everything else .
There 'll still be startup companies developing clever and innovative security technologies .
But the end user wo n't care about them .
They 'll be embedded within the services sold by large IT outsourcing companies like BT , EDS and IBM , or ISPs like EarthLink and Comcast .
Or they 'll be a check - box item somewhere in the core switch .
IT security is getting harder – increasing complexity is largely to blame – and the need for aftermarket security products is n't disappearing anytime soon .
But there 's no earthly reason why users need to know what an intrusion - detection system with stateful protocol analysis is , or why it 's helpful in spotting SQL injection attacks .
The whole IT security industry is an accident – an artifact of how the computer industry developed .
As IT fades into the background and becomes just another utility , users will simply expect it to work – and the details of how it works wo n't matter .

The Solar Funnel Cooker How to Make and Use The BYU Solar Cooker / Cooler by Steven E. Jones , Professor of Physics at Brigham Young University ( BYU ) , with Colter Paulson , Jason Chesley , Jacob Fugal , Derek Hullinger , Jamie Winterton , Jeannette Lawler , and Seth , David , Nathan , and Danelle Jones .
Introduction A few years ago , I woke up to the fact that half of the world 's peoples must burn wood or dried dung in order to cook their food .
It came as quite a shock to me , especially as I learned of the illnesses caused by breathing smoke day in and day out , and the environmental impacts of deforestation - not to mention the time spent by people ( mostly women ) gathering sticks and dung to cook their food .
And yet , many of these billions of people live near the equator , where sunshine is abundant and free .
Ergo ...
As a University Professor of Physics with a background in energy usage , I set out to develop a means of cooking food and sterilizing water using the free energy of the sun .
First , I looked at existing methods .
The parabolic cooker involves a reflective dish that concentrates sunlight to a point where the food is cooked .
This approach is very dangerous since the sun 's energy is focused to a point which is very hot , but which can not be seen .
( BYU students and I built one which will set paper on fire in about 3 seconds ! )
I learned that an altruistic group had offered reflecting parabolas to the people living at the Altiplano in Bolivia .
But more than once the parabolas had been stored next to a shed -- and the passing sun set the sheds on fire !
The people did not want these dangerous , expensive devices , even though the Altiplano region has been stripped of fuel wood .
The box cooker : Basically an insulated box with a glass or plastic lid , often with a reflecting lid to reflect sunlight into the box .
Light enters through the top glass ( or plastic ) , to slowly heat up the box .
Problems : energy enters only through the top , while heat is escaping through all the other sides , which have a tendency to draw heat away from the food .
When the box is opened to put food in or take it out , some of the heat escapes and is lost .
Also , effective box cookers tend to be more complicated to build than the funnel cooker .
While studying this problem , I thought again and again of the great need for a safe , inexpensive yet effective solar cooker .
It finally came to me at Christmastime a few years ago , a sort of hybrid between the parabola and a box cooker .
It looks like a large , deep funnel , and incorporates what I believe are the best features of the parabolic cooker and the box cooker .
The first reflector was made at my home out of aluminum foil glued onto cardboard , then this was curved to form a reflective funnel .
My children and I figured out a way to make a large card - board funnel easily .
( I 'll tell you exactly how to do this later on . )
The Solar Funnel Cooker is safe and low cost , easy to make , yet very effective in capturing the sun 's energy for cooking and pasteurizing water ->
Eureka !
Later , I did extensive tests with students ( including reflectivity tests ) and found that aluminized Mylar was good too , but relatively expensive and rather hard to come by in large sheets .
Besides , cardboard is found throughout the world and is inexpensive , and aluminum foil is also easy to come by .
And individuals can make their own solar cookers easily , or start a cottage - industry to manufacture them for others .
Prototypes of the Solar Funnel Cooker were tested in Bolivia , and outperformed an expensive solar box cooker and a " Solar Cookit " - while costing much less .
Brigham Young University submitted a patent application , mainly to insure that no company would prevent wide distribution of the Solar Funnel Cooker .
BYU makes no profit from the invention .
( I later learned that a few people had had a similar idea , but with methods differing from those developed and shown here . )
So now I 'm trying to get the word out so that the invention can be used to capture the free energy of the sun - for camping and for emergencies , yes , but also for every day cooking where electricity is not available and even fuel wood is getting scarce .
How it Works
The reflector is shaped like a giant funnel , and lined with aluminum foil .
( Easy to follow instructions will be given soon . )
This funnel is rather like the parabolic cooker , except that the sunlight is concentrated along a line ( not a point ) at the bottom of the funnel .
You can put your hand up the bottom of the funnel and feel the sun 's heat , but it will not burn you .
Next , we paint a jar black on the outside , to collect heat , and place this at the bottom of the funnel .
Or one can use a black pot , with a lid .
The black vessel gets hot , fast .
But not quite hot enough to cook with ...
We need some way to build up the heat without letting the air cool it .
So , I put a cheap plastic bag around the jar -- voila , the solar funnel cooker was born !
The plastic bag , available in grocery stores as a " poultry bag " , replaces the cumbersome and expensive box and glass lid of the solar box ovens .
You can use the plastic bags used in American stores to put groceries in , as long as they let a lot of sunlight pass .
( Dark - colored bags will not do . )
I recently tested a bag used for fruits and vegetables , nearly transparent and available free at American grocery stores , that works great .
This is stamped " HDPE " for high - density polyethylene on the bag ( ordinary polyethylene melts too easily ) .
A block of wood is placed under the jar to help hold the heat in .
( Any insulator , such as a hot pad or rope or even sticks , will also work . )
A friend of mine who is also a Physics Professor did not believe I could actually boil water with the thing .
So I showed him that with this new " solar funnel cooker , " I was able to boil water in Utah in the middle of winter !
I laid the funnel on its side since it was winter and pointed a large funnel towards the sun to the south .
I also had to suspend the black cooking vessel -- rather than placing it on a wooden block .
This allows the weaker sun rays to strike the entire surface of the vessel .
Of course , the Solar Funnel works much better outside of winter days ( when the UV index is 7 or greater ) .
Most other solar cookers will not cook in the winter in northern areas ( or south of about 35 degrees , either ) .
I thought that a pressure cooker would be great .
But the prices in stores were way too high for me .
Wait , how about a canning jar ?
These little beauties are designed to relieve pressure through the lid -- a nice pressure cooker .
And cooking time is cut in half for each 10 º
C we raise the temperature ( Professor Lee Hansen , private communication ) .
I used one of my wife 's wide - mouth canning jars , spray - painted ( flat ) black on the outside , and it worked great .
Food cooks faster when you use a simple canning jar as a pressure cooker .
However , you can also put a black pot in the plastic bag instead if you want .
But do n't use a sealed container with no pressure release like a mayonnaise jar -- it can break as the steam builds up !
( I 've done it . )
How to Build Your Own Solar Funnel Cooker What You will Need for the Funnel Cooker : A piece of flat cardboard , about 2 feet wide by 4 feet long .
( The length should be just twice the width .
The bigger , the better . )
Ordinary aluminum foil .
A glue such as white glue ( like Elmer 's glue ) , and water to mix with it 50 - 50 .
Also , a brush to apply the glue to the cardboard ( or a cloth or paper towel will do ) .
Or , some may wish to use a cheap " spray adhesive " available in spray cans .
You can also use wheat paste .
Three wire brads -- or small nuts and bolts , or string to hold the funnel together .
For a cooking vessel , I recommend a canning jar ( " Ball " wide - mouth quart jars work fine for me ; the rubber ring on the lid is less likely to melt than for other jars I 've found .
A two - quart canning jar is available and works fine for larger quantities of food , although the cooking is somewhat slower . ) .
The cooking jar ( or vessel ) should be spray - painted black on the outside .
I find that a cheap flat - black spray paint works just fine .
Scrape off a vertical stripe so that you have a clear glass " window " to look into the vessel , to check the food or water for boiling .
A block of wood is used as an insulator under the jar .
I use a piece of 2 " X4 " board which is cut into a square nominally 4 " x 4 " by about 2 " thick .
( 10 cm square x 5 cm thick . )
One square piece of wood makes a great insulator .
A plastic bag is used to go around the cooking - jar and block of wood , to provide a green - house effect .
Suggestions : Reynolds ™ Oven Bag , Regular Size works great : transparent and wo n't melt .
( Cost about 25 cents each in U.S. grocery stores . )
Any nearly - transparent HDPE bag ( High- density Polyethylene ) .
Look for " HDPE " stamped on the bag .
I 've tested HDPE bags which I picked up for free at my grocery store , used for holding vegetables and fruits .
These are thin , but very inexpensive .
Tested side - by - side with an oven bag in two solar funnels , the HDPE bag worked just as well !
( Caution : we have found that some HDPE bags will melt should they contact the hot cooking vessel .
For this reason , we recommend using the oven - safe plastic bag wherever possible . )
An idea attributed to Roger Bernard and applied now to the BYU Funnel Cooker : place a pot ( having a blackened bottom and sides ) in a glass bowl , and cover with a lid .
Try for a tight fit around the bottom to keep hot air trapped inside .
The metal pot or bowl should be supported around the rim only , with an air space all around the bottom ( where the sunlight strikes it ) .
Put a blackened lid on top of the pot .
Then simply place this pot - in - bowl down in the bottom of the funnel - no plastic bag is needed !
This clever method also allows the cook to simply remove the lid to check the food and to stir .
I like this idea - it makes the solar cooker a lot like cooking over a fire .
See Photographs for further details .
Construction Steps Cut a Half - circle out of the Cardboard Cut a half circle out of the cardboard , along the bottom as shown below .
When the funnel is formed , this becomes a full - circle and should be wide enough to go around your cooking pot .
So for a 7 " diameter cooking pot , the radius of the half - circle is 7 " .
For a quart canning jar such as I use , I cut a 5 " radius half - circle out of the cardboard .
Form the Funnel
To form the funnel , you will bring side A towards side B , as shown in the figure .
The aluminum foil must go on the INSIDE of the funnel .
Do this slowly , helping the cardboard to the shape of a funnel by using one hand to form creases that radiate out from the half - circle .
Work your way around the funnel , bending it in stages to form the funnel shape , until the two sides overlap and the half - circle forms a complete circle .
The aluminum foil will go on the INSIDE of funnel .
Open the funnel and lay it flat , " inside up " , in preparation for the next step .
Glue Foil to Cardboard Apply glue or adhesive to the top ( inner ) surface of the cardboard , then quickly apply the aluminum foil on top of the glue , to affix the foil to the cardboard .
Make sure the shiniest side of the foil is on top , since this becomes your reflective surface in the Funnel .
I like to put just enough glue for one width of foil , so that the glue stays moist while the foil is applied .
I also overlap strips of foil by about 1 " ( or 2 cm ) .
Try to smooth out the aluminum foil as much as you reasonably can , but small wrinkles wo n't make much difference .
( If even cardboard is not available , one can simply dig a funnel - shaped hole in the ground and line it with a reflector , to make a fixed solar cooker for use at mid-day . )
Join side A to side B to keep the funnel together .
The easiest way to do this is to punch three holes in the cardboard that line up on side A and side B ( see figure ) .
Then put a metal brad through each hole and fasten by pulling apart the metal tines .
Or you can use a nut - and - bolt to secure the two sides ( A & B ) together .
Be creative here with what you have available .
For example , by putting two holes about a thumb - width apart , you can put a string , twine , small rope , wire or twist - tie in one hole and out the other , and tie together .
When A and B are connected together , you will have a " funnel with two wings " .
The wings could be cut off , but these help to gather more sunlight , so I leave them on .
Tape or glue a piece of aluminum foil across the hole at the bottom of the funnel , with shiny side in .
This completes assembly of your solar funnel cooker .
For stability , place the Funnel inside a cardboard or other box to provide support .
For long - term applications , one may wish to dig a hole in the ground to hold the Funnel against strong winds .
Final Steps
At this stage , you are ready to put food items or water into the cooking vessel or jar , and put the lid on securely .
( See instructions on food cooking times , to follow . )
Place a wooden block in the INSIDE bottom of the cooking bag .
I use a piece of 2X4 board which is cut into a square nominally 4 " X4 " by about 2 " thick .
Then place the cooking vessel containing the food or water on top of the wooden block , inside the bag .
Next , gather the top of the bag in your fingers and blow air into the bag , to inflate it .
This will form a small " greenhouse " around the cooking vessel , to trap much of the heat inside .
Close off the bag with a tight twist tie or wire .
Important : the bag should not touch the sides or lid of the cooking vessel .
The bag may be called a " convection shield , " slowing convection - cooling due to air currents .
Place the entire bag and its contents inside the funnel near the bottom as shown in the Photographs .
Place the Solar Funnel Cooker so that it Faces the Sun Remember : Sunlight can hurt the eyes : Please wear sunglasses when using a Solar Cooker !
The Funnel Cooker is designed so that the hot region is deep down inside the funnel , out of harm 's way .
Put the Solar Funnel Cooker in the sun pointing towards the sun , so that it captures as much sunlight as possible .
The design of the funnel allows it to collect solar energy for about an hour without needing to be re-positioned .
For longer cooking times , readjust the position of the funnel to follow the sun 's path .
It helps to put the Solar Funnel Cooker in front of a south - facing wall or window ( in the Northern Hemisphere ) to reflect additional sunlight into the funnel .
A reflective wall is most important in locations farther from the equator and in winter .
In the Southern Hemisphere , put the Solar Funnel Cooker in front of a North - facing wall or window to reflect additional sunlight into your cooker .
After Cooking Remember that the cooking vessel will be very hot :
Use cooking pads or gloves when handling !
If you are heating water in a canning jar , you may notice that the water is boiling when the lid is first removed - it gets very hot !
Open the plastic cooking bag by removing the twist - tie .
Using gloves or a thick cloth , lift the vessel out of the bag and place it on the ground or table .
Carefully open the vessel and check the food , to make sure it has finished cooking .
Let the hot food cool before eating .
Helpful Hints Avoid leaving fingerprints and smudges on the inside surface of the cooker .
Keep the inner surface clean and shiny by wiping occasionally with a wet towel .
This will keep the Solar Funnel Cooker working at its best .
If your funnel gets out - of - round , it can be put back into a circular shape by attaching a rope or string between opposite sides which need to be brought closer together .
For long - term applications , a hole in the ground will hold the Funnel Cooker securely against winds .
Bring the funnel inside or cover it during rain storms .
The lids can be used over and over .
We have had some trouble with the rubber on some new canning - jar lids becoming soft and " sticky . "
" Ball canning lids " do not usually have this problem .
Running new lids through very hot water before the first use seems to help .
The lids can be used over and over if they are not bent too badly when opened ( pry off lid carefully ) .
The jar can be suspended near the bottom of the funnel using fishing line or string ( etc. ) , instead of placing the jar on a block of wood .
A plastic bag is placed around the jar with air puffed inside , as usual , to trap the heat .
The suspension method allows sunlight to strike all surfaces of the jar , all around , so that heats faster and more evenly .
This suspension method is crucial for use in winter months .
Adjust the funnel to put as much sunlight onto the cooking jar as possible .
Look at the jar to check where the sunlight is hitting , and to be sure the bottom is not in the shadows .
For long cooking times ( over about an hour ) , readjust the position of the funnel to follow the sun 's path .
During winter months , when the sun is low on the horizon ( e.g. , in North America ) , it is helpful to lay the funnel on its side , facing the sun .
Tests in Utah I have personally used the Solar Funnel Cooker to cook lunches over many weeks .
My favorite foods to cook are potatoes ( cut into logs or slices ) and carrot slices .
Vegetables cook slowly in their own juices and taste delicious .
I also make rice , melted cheese sandwiches , and even bread in the Solar Funnel Cooker .
I usually put the food out around 11:30 and let it cook until 12:45 or 1 pm , just to be sure that it has time to cook .
I 've never had any food burn in this cooker .
I have also cooked food in the mountains , at an altitude of around 8,300 feet .
If anything , the food cooked faster there - the sunlight filters through less atmosphere at high altitudes .
I find that people are surprised that the sun alone can actually cook food .
And they are further pleasantly surprised at the rich flavors in the foods which cook slowly in the sun .
This inexpensive device does it !
Students at Brigham Young University have performed numerous tests on the Solar Funnel Cooker along with other cookers .
We have consistently found much faster cooking using the Solar Funnel Cooker .
The efficiency / cost ratio is higher than any other solar cooking device we have found to date .
Mr. Hullinger also performed studies of transmissivity , reflectivity and absorptivity of alternate materials which could be used in the Solar Funnel Cooker .
While there are better materials ( such as solar - selective absorbers ) , our goal has been to keep the cost of the Solar Cooker as low as possible , while maintaining safety as a first priority .
Tests in Bolivia
The BYU Benson Institute organized tests between the Solar Funnel Cooker and the " old- fashioned " solar box oven .
The solar box oven cost about $ 70 and was made mostly of cardboard .
It took nearly two hours just to reach water pasteurization temperature .
The Bolivian report notes that " food gets cold every time the pots are taken from and into the oven . "
The solar box oven failed even to cook boiled eggs .
( More expensive box cookers would hopefully work better . )
An aluminized - mylar Solar Funnel Cooker was also tested in Bolivia , during the Bolivian winter .
Water pasteurization temperature was reached in 50 minutes , boiled eggs cooked in 70 minutes , and rice cooked in 75 minutes .
The Bolivian people were pleased by the performance .
So were we !
( La Paz , Bolivia , August , 1996 ) I also donated two dozen solar funnel cookers for people in Guatemala .
These were taken there by a group of doctors going there for humanitarian service .
The people there also liked the idea of cooking with the sun 's free energy !
For an aluminized - Mylar Solar Funnel Cooker kit , please contact CRM ( licensed manufacturer ) at +1 ( 801 ) 292-9210 .
Water and Milk Pasteurization Contaminated drinking water or milk kills thousands of people each day , especially children .
WHO reports that 80 % of illnesses in the world are spread through contaminated water .
Studies show that heating water to about 65 º - 70 º C ( 150 º F ) is sufficient to kill coliform bacteria , rotaviruses , enteroviruses and even Giardia .
This is called pasteurization .
Pasteurization depends on how hot and how long water is heated .
But how do you know if the water got hot enough ?
You could use a thermometer , but this would add to the cost , of course .
When steam leaves the canning jar ( with lid on tight ) and forms " dew " on the inside of the cooking bag , then the water is probably pasteurized to drink .
( The goal is to heat to 160 º Fahrenheit for at least six minutes . )
With a stripe of black paint scraped off the jar , one can look through the bag and into the jar and see when the water is boiling - then it is safe for sure .
Think of all the lives that can be saved simply by pasteurizing water using a simple Solar Cooker !
( See also Recent Advances in Solar Water Pasteurization ) Safety Safety was my first concern in designing the Solar Funnel Cooker , then came low cost and effectiveness .
But any time you have heat you need to take some precautions .
The cooking vessel ( jar ) is going to get hot , else the food inside wo n't cook .
Let the jar cool a bit before opening .
Handle only with gloves or tongs .
Always wear dark glasses to protect from the sun 's rays .
We naturally squint , but sunglasses are important .
Keep the plastic bag away from children and away from nose and mouth to avoid any possibility of suffocation .
Cooking with the Solar Funnel Cooker
What do you cook in a crock pot or moderate - temperature oven ?
The same foods will cook about the same in the Solar Funnel Cooker -- without burning .
The charts below give approximate summer cooking times .
The solar cooker works best when the UV index is 7 or higher .
( Sun high overhead , few clouds . )
Cooking times are approximate .
Increase cooking times for partly - cloudy days , sun not overhead ( e.g. , wintertime ) or for more than about 3 cups of food in the cooking jar .
Stirring is not necessary for most foods .
Food generally will not burn in the solar cooker .
Vegetables ( Potatoes , carrots , squash , beets , asparagus , etc. )
Preparation :
No need to add water if fresh .
Cut into slices or " logs " to ensure uniform cooking .
Corn will cook fine with or without the cob .
Cooking Time : About 1.5 hours Cereals and Grains ( Rice , wheat , barley , oats , millet , etc. )
Preparation : Mix 2 parts water to every 1 part grain .

Cooking Times : Cooking time varies with the amount of food and darkness of package .
How to Use the Solar Funnel as a Refrigerator / Cooler A university student ( Jamie Winterton ) and I were the first to demonstrate that the BYU Solar Funnel Cooker can be used - at night - as a refrigerator .
Here is how this is done .
The Solar Funnel Cooker is set - up just as you would during sun-light hours , with two exceptions : 1 . The funnel is directed at the dark night sky .
It should not " see " any buildings or even trees .
( The thermal radiation from walls , trees , or even clouds will diminish the cooling effect . ) .
2 . It helps to place 2 ( two ) bags around the jar instead of just one , with air spaces between the bags and between the inner bag and the jar .
HDPE and ordinary polyethylene bags work well , since polyethylene is nearly transparent to infrared radiation , allowing it to escape into the " heat sink " of the dark sky .
During the day , the sun 's rays are reflected onto the cooking vessel which becomes hot quickly .
At night , heat from the vessel is radiated outward , towards empty space , which is very cold indeed ( a " heat sink " ) .
As a result , the cooking vessel now becomes a small refrigerator .
We routinely achieve cooling of about 20 º F ( 10 º C ) below ambient air temperature using this remarkably simple scheme .
In September 1999 , we placed two funnels out in the evening , with double - bagged jars inside .
One jar was on a block of wood and the other was suspended in the funnel using fishing line .
The temperature that evening ( in Provo , Utah ) was 78 º F. Using a Radio Shack indoor / outdoor thermometer , a BYU student ( Colter Paulson ) measured the temperature inside the funnel and outside in the open air .
He found that the temperature of the air inside the funnel dropped quickly by about 15 degrees , as its heat was radiated upwards in the clear sky .
That night , the minimum outdoor air temperature measured was 47.5 degrees - but the water in both jars had ICE .
I invite others to try this , and please let me know if you get ice at 55 or even 60 degrees outside air temperature ( minimum at night ) .
A black PVC container may work even better than a black - painted jar , since PVC is a good infrared radiator - these matters are still being studied .
I would like to see the " Funnel Refrigerator " tried in desert climates , especially where freezing temperatures are rarely reached .
It should be possible in this way to cheaply make ice for Hutus in Rwanda and for aborigines in Australia , without using any electricity or other modern " tricks . "
We are in effect bringing some of the cold of space to a little corner on earth .
Please let me know how this works for you .
Conclusion : Why We Need Solar Cookers The BYU Funnel Cooker / Cooler can : Cook food without the need for electricity or wood or petroleum or other fuels .
Pasteurize water for safe drinking , preventing many diseases .
Save trees and other resources .
Avoid air pollution and breathing smoke while cooking .
Use the sun 's free energy .
A renewable energy source .
Cook food with little or no stirring , without burning .
Kill insects in grains .
Dehydrate fruits , etc .
Serve as a refrigerator at night , to cool even freeze water .
( Try that without electricity or fuels !
See also Balancing the Scales . )
The burden for gathering the fuel wood and cooking falls mainly on women and children .
Joseph Kiai reports from Dadaab , Kenya : " Women who ca n't afford to buy wood start at 4 am to go collecting and return about noon ...
They do this twice a week to get fuel for cooking ...
The rapes are averaging one per week . "
From Belize : " Many times the women have to go into the forest dragging their small children when they go to look for wood .
It is a special hardship for pregnant and nursing mothers to chop and drag trees back to the village ... they are exposed to venomous snakes and clouds of mosquitoes . "
( Anna K. ) ( Quoted in newsletters by Solar Cookers International . )
And the forests are dwindling in many areas .
Edwin Dobbs noted in Audubon Magazine , Nov. 1992 , " The world can choose sunlight or further deforestation , solar cooking or widespread starvation ... "
Americans should be prepared for emergencies , incident to power failures .
A Mormon pioneer noted in her journal : " We were now following in their trail traveling up the Platte River .
Timber was sometimes very scarce and hard to get .
We managed to do our cooking with what little we could gather up ... " ( Eliza R. Snow )
Now there 's someone who needed a light - weight Solar Cooker !
Here 's another reason to use a solar cooker .
Many people in developing countries look to see what 's being done in America .
I 'm told that if Americans are using something , then they will want to try it , too .
The more people there are cooking with the sun , the more others will want to join in .
A good way to spread this technology is to encourage small local industries or families to make these simple yet reliable solar cookers for others at low cost .
I 've used this cooker for three summers and I enjoy it .
Cooking and making ice with the funnel cooker / cooler will permit a significant change in lifestyle .
If you think about it , this could help a lot of people .
The BYU Solar Funnel Cooker uses the glorious sunshine -- and the energy of the sun is a free gift from God for all to use !

As the sun moves closer to the southern horizon in the winter , the solar cooker is naturally less effective .
A good measure of the solar intensity is the “ UV index ” which is often reported with the weather .
When the ultraviolet or UV index is 7 or above– common in summer months – the solar cooker works very well .
In Salt Lake City in October , the UV index was reported to be 3.5 on a sunny day .
We were able to boil water in the Solar Funnel Cooker during this time , but we had to suspend the black jar in the funnel so that sunlight struck all sides .
( We ran a fishing line under the screw - on lid , and looped the fishing line over a rod above the funnel .
As usual , a plastic bag was placed around the jar , and this was closed at the top to let the fishing line out for suspending the jar . )
The solar “ minimum ” for the northern hemisphere occurs on winter solstice , about December 21st each year .
The solar “ maximum ” occurs six months later , June 21st .
Solar cooking works best from about March 20 - October 1 in the north .
If people try to cook with the sun for the first time outside of this time window , they should not be discouraged .
Try again when the sun is more directly overhead .
( One may also suspend the jar in the funnel , which will make cooking faster any time of the year . )
It is interesting to note that most developing countries are located near the equator where the sun is nearly directly overhead all the time .
Solar Cookers will then serve year - round , as long as the sun is shining , for these fortunate people .
They may be the first to apply fusion energy ( of the sun ) on a large scale !
And they may accomplish this without the expensive infrastructure of electrical power grids that we take for granted in America .
How do you cook bread in a jar ?
I have cooked bread by simply putting dough in the bottom of the jar and placing it in the funnel in the usual way .
Rising and baking took place inside the jar in about an hour ( during summer ) .
One should put vegetable oil inside the jar before cooking to make removal of the bread easier .
I would also suggest that using a 2 - quart wide - mouth canning jar instead of a 1 - quart jar would make baking a loaf of bread easier .
What is the optimum “ opening angle ” for the funnel cooker ?
A graduate student at Brigham Young University did a calculus calculation over two years ago to assess the best shape or opening angle for the Solar Funnel .
Jeannette Lawler assumed that the best operation would occur when the sun ’s rays bounced no more than once before hitting the cooking jar , while keeping the opening angle as large as possible to admit more sunlight .
( Some sunlight is lost each time the light reflects from the shiny surface .
If the sunlight misses on the first bounce , it can bounce again and again until being absorbed by the black bottle . )
She set up an approximate equation for this situation , took the calculus - derivative with respect to the opening angle and set the derivative equal to zero .
Optimizing in this way , she found that the optimum opening angle is about 45 degrees , when the funnel is pointed directly towards the sun .
But we do n’t want to have to “ track the sun ” by turning the funnel every few minutes .
The sun moves ( apparently ) 360 degrees in 24 hours , or about 15 degrees per hour .
So we finally chose a 60 - degree opening angle so that the cooker is effective for about 1.2 hours .
This turned out to be long enough to cook most vegetables , breads , boil water , etc. with the Solar Funnel Cooker .
We also used a laser pointer to simulate sun rays entering the funnel at different angles , and found that the 60 - degree cone was quite effective in concentrating the rays at the bottom of the funnel where the cooking jar sits .

オウムの上祐が新団体を設立して独立するというニュースが流れているが、これは、かなり前から動きがあったことで予想通り。
マスコミの取材には、麻原教祖の影響をなくすかのように、「ああいえば上祐」受け答えしているが、オウム信者達にはそのようなメッセージは送っていない。ヴァジラヤーナの教えで、彼らは、踏絵をしてみせるぐらい屁でもないのだ。独立するにあたって、旧団体、いわゆる麻原派とは、どちらが麻原の教えをより忠実に実践しているかというのが、末端信者の取り合いの論理で、内向けには、上祐の新団体もオウム麻原団体であることには変わりがないことを発信し続けている。もちろん、上祐にはそれ以外の論理はあり得ない。
なぜ、上祐は独立するのか？ 最大の理由は、サリン被害者への賠償金逃れであろう。賠償責任は旧団体に押しつけるということだ。また、上祐自身が、教団のなかでは正大師という教祖麻原から受けた教祖に継ぐ教団位を持っているにも関わらず教団幹部には宗教性が評価されていない為、カリスマ性が低く、教団が彼の自由になっていないからだ。単純化して言うと、上祐は、かつて逮捕されるまでは洗脳する側にいた確信犯テクノクラートである。一方現在の教団幹部は、事件当時に教団幹部がことごとく逮捕されたことにより、繰り上がって幹部になったに過ぎず、麻原逮捕以前には、洗脳される側にいた下っ端幹部だったという断絶がある。
上祐にしては、遙かに位が低い「下っ端」は、言うことを聞くのが当然という思いがあるのに、完全に麻原オンリーで洗脳されきった現教団幹部には、上祐の言動が、教祖気取りに見えて我慢がならないというところだ。
現教団の幹部は、上祐や現在刑務所にいる幹部達に比べると一世代後の「洗脳された」側の世代であり、何も見えない「洗脳された」側にすると、裏を知っている彼のテクノクラート的な立ち振る舞いが、宗教性が低いものと見えるのだ。元々、オウムは、カリスマとしての教祖麻原を囲む、上祐史裕や石川公一といった最高幹部テクノクラートと、サリン実行犯達で代表される実行部隊でなりたっていた訳で、上祐は、最高幹部のステータスはあってもカリスマ性は最初から期待されていなかったのだから無理もない。
とはいうものの、現教団幹部よりも遙か早い時代から最高幹部であった上祐は、誰よりも教祖麻原の教えを忠実に実行できるという自負がある。そして、テクノクラートとして、オウム教団を誰よりも大きくできるという自信があるのだ。
上祐自身は、元々オウムは、教祖麻原とテクノクラートがワンセットになって教団を動かしていたという裏の事実を知っている側だから、自分が麻原教祖の代わりになれば、オウムはまた、巨大教団に戻れると考えている。ただ、洗脳された側の現役幹部は、全てオールマイティの教祖麻原本人の代わりなどはあり得ないと深く、深く、洗脳されて、心から信じているので、上祐を麻原の代わりにすることなど考えもつかないからだ。上祐が現教団で、思うように動けないのは、上祐達自身が現在の幹部達をそこまで麻原ロボットに「洗脳」した結果であるという皮肉な話である。これで、上祐は、現教団幹部を従えることをあきらめ、独立をするわけだ。
一方、公安当局も、確信犯である上祐とは取引が可能で情報は取れるが、洗脳されたバリバリの現幹部のいわゆる麻原派が公安当局に気を許すはずがなく、満足に情報が取れていない。それなら、上祐派に大きくなってもらった方がいいという公安当局の思惑もある。諜報機関というのは、理想的な敵は、情報さえ取れれば、大きくなってもらうに限る。それが諜報機関の存在意義を増大させるのだ。
上祐にしてみれば、賠償金責任と厳しい世間の目で足かせを嵌められた現在のオウム（アレフ）では、教祖麻原の教えを思ったように広げていくことができないということだ。そこで、賠償責任と世間の目を、旧団体において、気に入った幹部を連れて独立するというわけだ。それを、公安当局も容認する動きで、渡りに船ということだ。もちろん、上祐としてみれば、その独立新団体こそが、ほんもののオウムだということだ。
教団資産に関しても抜かりはない。麻原がつけた正大師という教団最高位を利用して、上祐寄りの正悟師野田を旧団体の代表にあらかじめ指名した上での独立である。
このシンパ野田を経由して、旧教団の資産も新団体に分割して行くという目論見だ。一方、サリン被害者に対する賠償金は、独立した人数に比例した分のみを支払うということで実質大幅減額を企図してきた通り。布施の額も少ないあまり役に立っていない信者は切り捨てることで、その人数に比例した賠償責任はなくなり、極めて効率の高い新団体ができるというわけだ。それで身軽になって、直接的な関係などから上祐にカリスマを感じるオウム信者達と、「本来の」オウム活動を本格化しようということだ。実際、最近では、「上祐史裕」名で mixiに登 場 してみたり、信者とシンパ向けに裏ブログを始めたりと広報活動も活発だ。
これは、社会には危険なことである。上祐自身が、今でも「自分はマイトレーヤの化身だ」と語っているとおり、マイトレーヤ（弥勒菩薩）は教祖麻原からつけられたホリーネームであり、いわゆる上祐派の教義もすべてオウムのままで、オウムであることはまったく変わっていない。ただ、上祐によると、オウムは本来、オームと発音すべきで、オウムと名付けたことに間違いがあったなどということで、要するに表面的に名前などを変えればいいという発想で、本質は、なんら教祖麻原の教えを否定していない。単に、サリン事件を起こした信者個人達を逸脱した個人達として批判しているだけのことである。
そうではない。凶悪事件を起こした信者達こそが、まさにオウムなのだ。そして、そのオウムは全く変わっていないのだ。オウムは、教義の中心、根幹そのものに、ヴァジラヤーナで代表されるサリン事件を引き起こした危険思想を持ち続けているのだ。洗脳が解けていないオウム信者達は沢山いる。放っておけば解けるものではない。それほど、反人間的な、酷い薬物洗脳を行なってきた団体なのだ。
団体名を変えたり、団体を分割したり、色々やって、世間の目を誤魔化し続けることは巧みにやってきているが、私の目は絶対に誤魔化せない。もちろん、上祐を中心とした幹部達が、サリン事件を含む一連の事件に深く関わっていたことは、周知の事実であり、死体を巨大電子レンジで完全焼却するなどの徹底した証拠隠滅により、刑事事件として立件できなかった殺人事件と目される百人以上の行方不明事件など、北朝鮮による拉致事件を超える凶悪事件が文字通り数え切れない程あり、オウムが日本の近代史上最悪の殺人テロ教団である事実は名前や団体構成を変えても全く変わらない。徹底した証拠隠滅により法的に立件できなかったことと、彼らがギルティであることは全く別である。マスコミは、上祐の情報操作術に惑わされてはいけない。また、上祐にテレビなどのメディアで発言させるなどということは、決してないように謹んで欲しい。彼らはあらゆる機会を用いて、自己正当化し、また、社会にあの手この手の洗脳を仕掛けてくるのだ。
もちろん、上祐の狙いは明らかである。一方で賠償責任を逃れ、一方で野田などを利用して、旧教団資産を手中に収める。その上で、教祖とテクノクラートの両方の役割を自分で行なうことだ。最終的には、自分に従わない分子を排除したうえで、現教団を再度吸収合併することを目的としているのだ。
もちろん、上祐新団体で教えられる教義は、サリン事件を起こしたオウムの教義そのものだ。これは許されることではない。だまされてはいけない。

Reebok has urged worried parents to call its hotline number
A four - year - old boy in Minneapolis died from lead poisoning after swallowing one of the bracelets .
The silver coloured , heart - shaped charm jewellery was given away with its Children 's Reebok Classic footwear since December 2004 .
Reebok warned that the gift must be immediately taken away from children .
Voluntary recall
" Reebok is aware of the death from lead poisoning of a child who has reportedly swallowed a piece from one of these bracelets , " the firm said .
" This voluntary recall is being conducted because the bracelet may contain high levels of lead . "
Reebok , which recently merged with Adidas , said anxious parents should call its hotline number on 0800 305 050 .
The bracelets were produced by a contractor in China , and according to a US health official , are 99 % lead .
LEAD POISONING
Lead is a highly toxic metal and can be harmful if ingested , even in small doses
Children are more susceptible to lead poisoning , particularly those under five , partly because their body and brain are still developing
Two - year - olds tend to have the highest blood level concentration because they put so many things into their mouths
Lead poisoning has been linked to lower IQ scores in children exposed to even low levels
In adults , it can increase blood pressure , cause fertility problems , nerve disorders , muscle and joint pain and memory problems
Lead can be found in lead - based paints , contaminated soil , household dust , drinking water ( from old plumbing ) , lead crystal , lead - glazed pottery and some cheap metal jewellery
Source : NIEHA
Minnesota Department of Health official Harry F. Hull told the St. Paul Pioneer
Press that the boy 's death was a tragic case .
" This is the first time , at least in recent times , that a child has died like this from ingesting a charm . "
He said the fatal element was that the charm was too large to pass through the child 's small stomach , where it lodged and dissolved in stomach acid over several days .
Metal jewellery warning
Reebok said it learnt of the boy 's death from Minnesota health authorities on 10 March and began notifying retailers three days later to stop distributing the bracelets .
It is recalling 300,000 of them in the US .
Mr Hull warned parents to keep metallic jewellery away from all pre-school children as US company Dollar Tree Corporation announced it was recalling nearly 600,000 pieces of jewellery over similar lead - poisoning fears .
WASHINGTON , May 19 — The United States is continuing to make large payments of roughly $ 1 billion a year to Pakistan for what it calls reimbursements to the country ’s military for conducting counterterrorism efforts along the border with Afghanistan , even though Pakistan ’s president decided eight months ago to slash patrols through the area where Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters are most active .
The monthly payments , called coalition support funds , are not widely advertised .
Buried in public budget numbers , the payments are intended to reimburse Pakistan ’s military for the cost of the operations .
So far , Pakistan has received more than $ 5.6 billion under the program over five years , more than half of the total aid the United States has sent to the country since the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , not counting covert funds .
Some American military officials in the region have recommended that the money be tied to Pakistan ’s performance in pursuing Al Qaeda and keeping the Taliban from gaining a haven from which to attack the government of Afghanistan .
American officials have been surprised by the speed at which both organizations have gained strength in the past year .
But Bush administration officials say no such plan is being considered , despite new evidence that the Pakistani military is often looking the other way when Taliban fighters retreat across the border into Pakistan , ignoring calls from American spotters to intercept them .
There is also at least one American report that Pakistani security forces have fired in support of Taliban fighters attacking Afghan posts .
The hypocrisy of anti-copyright campaigns
This video , which I ’m sure we ’ve all seen , is the crown jewel of the “ respect copyrights ” campaign .
The blatant hypocrisy of the companies and government agencies which sponsor either the MPAA or this campaign is far reaching to the very foundation of capitalism .
This video ( and its campaign ) has 2 premises both of which are either hypocritical or just plain stupid .
These premises are :
# 1 ) what is illegal is also inherently morally wrong .
First , every thinking person knows that what is illegal or legal has no bearing on what is moral or immoral and this has been a known fact since the days of Plato .
Marxists believe that , while the practice of capitalism by definition is legal , it may still be immoral to allow people to starve to death and die all the while others go with too much food .
What ’s more though , this argument can also be made from a right - wing point of view .
Right - wing , anti-abortion activists would argue ( and they do frequently argue ) that while abortions are legal , they are nonetheless immoral .
So on this point , the anti-piracy campaign is just talking out of its ass because most politically engaged people on all sides of the political spectrum recognize the fact that the law does not equal morality .
So this premise is just plain stupid .
#2) You and I should n’t make our decision to share music based on a cost - benefit analysis .
We should make our decision not in terms of what is the best , most economical decision for us , but rather for what is the best for the industry .
Capitalism is based on the very idea of each person behaving in their own best interest through rational , cost - benefit analyses !!
That ’s just how capitalism works .
Union Carbide made a cost - benefit analysis and decided that if it just cut on safety measures and moved its operation to India , then it could save TONS of money even if it cost people their lives .
The result : 20,000 people DEAD because of the Bhopal disaster caused by Union Carbide .
British Petrolium ( BP ) made a cost - benefit analysis to intentionally allow its pipelines in Alaska to corrode through sheer negligence because it knew that the resultant oil spill would hike up oil prices globally and net the company an overall profit even after paying for repairs .
Ford Motor Company learned in the early stages of production that its Pinto model would explode under certain circumstances and would be expected to kill people .
Ford decided that it would cost more money to do an $ 11 repair on all of its models than it would to pay for lawyers to fight all the personal injury and wrongful death suits that would result from their car .
Chevrolet made basically the same decision with regards to their Malibu model .
Moreover , each of these 4 examples are just the really popular ones that have been published widely .
Most cost - benefit analysis is so common that it does n’t even get reported on .
For instance , every single capitalist company makes decisions everyday on how low they can pay their workers — ex .
“ Is paying starvation wages worth the extra cost in lower employee retention and higher training costs ? ” etc… — in order to make a profit .
Using the biblical ( and original ) definition of hypocrite , we see that a hypocrite is somebody who imposes standards on others which they refuse to accept for themselves .
So the very companies which support the MPAA in this campaign are by definition hypocrite since the very way they make money is founded upon the necessity of cost - benefit analyses while they advocate that we refrain from the same practice when it will cost them money .
If capitalism can use cost - benefit analyses at the cost of peoples LIVES in order to save money , then I sure as hell can use a cost - benefit analysis at the cost of their money .
And , what ’s more , I wo n’t feel the slightest bit of guilt because of it .
In fact , I ’ll do you one better : taking money away from companies which can do such things is perhaps the most patriotic and beneficial act you can do while sitting at home in front of your computer !
Chertoff : Katrina scenario did not exist
However , experts for years had warned of threat to New Orleans
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Defending the U.S. government 's response to Hurricane Katrina , Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff argued Saturday that government planners did not predict such a disaster ever could occur .
But in fact , government officials , scientists and journalists have warned of such a scenario for years .
Chertoff , fielding questions from reporters , said government officials did not expect both a powerful hurricane and a breach of levees that would flood the city of New Orleans .
( See the video on a local paper 's prophetic warning -- 3:30 )
" That ' perfect storm ' of a combination of catastrophes exceeded the foresight of the planners , and maybe anybody 's foresight , " Chertoff said .
He called the disaster " breathtaking in its surprise . "
But engineers say the levees preventing this below - sea - level city from being turned into a swamp were built to withstand only Category 3 hurricanes .
And officials have warned for years that a Category 4 could cause the levees to fail .
( See video of why the levee 's breech was devastating -- 1:53 )
Katrina was a Category 4 hurricane when it struck the Gulf Coast on August 29 .
Last week , Michael Brown , head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency , told CNN his agency had recently planned for a Category 5 hurricane hitting New Orleans .
Speaking to " Larry King Live " on August 31 , in the wake of Katrina , Brown said , " That Category 4 hurricane caused the same kind of damage that we anticipated .
So we planned for it two years ago .
Last year , we exercised it .
And unfortunately this year , we 're implementing it . "
Brown suggested FEMA -- part of the Department of Homeland Security -- was carrying out a prepared plan , rather than having to suddenly create a new one .
Chertoff argued that authorities actually had assumed that " there would be overflow from the levee , maybe a small break in the levee .
The collapse of a significant portion of the levee leading to the very fast flooding of the city was not envisioned . "
He added : " There will be plenty of time to go back and say we should hypothesize evermore apocalyptic combinations of catastrophes .
Be that as it may , I 'm telling you this is what the planners had in front of them .
They were confronted with a second wave that they did not have built into the plan , but using the tools they had , we have to move forward and adapt . "
But New Orleans , state and federal officials have long painted a very different picture .
" We certainly understood the potential impact of a Category 4 or 5 hurricane " on New Orleans , Lt. General Carl Strock , chief of engineers for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , said Thursday , Cox News Service reported .
Reuters reported that in 2004 , more than 40 state , local and volunteer organizations practiced a scenario in which a massive hurricane struck and levees were breached , allowing water to flood New Orleans .
Under the simulation , called " Hurricane Pam , " the officials " had to deal with an imaginary storm that destroyed more than half a million buildings in New Orleans and forced the evacuation of a million residents , " the Reuters report said .
In 2002 the New Orleans Times - Picayune ran a five - part series exploring the vulnerability of the city .
The newspaper , and other news media as well , specifically addressed the possibility of massive floods drowning residents , destroying homes and releasing toxic chemicals throughout the city .
( Read : " Times - Picayune " Special Report : Washing away )
Scientists long have discussed this possibility as a sort of doomsday scenario .
On Sunday , a day before Hurricane Katrina made landfall , Ivor van Heerden , director of the Louisiana State University Public Health Research Center in Baton Rouge , said , " This is what we 've been saying has been going to happen for years . "
" Unfortunately , it 's coming true , " he said , adding that New Orleans " is definitely going to flood . "
Also on Sunday , Placquemines Parish Sheriff Jeff Hingle referred back to Hurricane Betsy -- a Category 2 hurricane that struck in 1965 -- and said , " After Betsy these levees were designed for a Category 3 . "
He added , " These levees will not hold the water back . "
But Chertoff seemed unaware of all the warnings .
" This is really one which I think was breathtaking in its surprise , " Chertoff said .
" There has been , over the last few years , some specific planning for the possibility of a significant hurricane in New Orleans with a lot of rainfall , with water rising in the levees and water overflowing the levees , " he told reporters Saturday .
That alone would be " a very catastrophic scenario , " Chertoff said .
" And although the planning was not complete , a lot of work had been done .
But there were two problems here .
First of all , it 's as if someone took that plan and dropped an atomic bomb simply to make it more difficult .
We did n't merely have the overflow , we actually had the break in the wall .
And I will tell you that , really , that perfect storm of combination of catastrophes exceeded the foresight of the planners , and maybe anybody 's foresight . "
Chertoff also argued that authorities did not have much notice that the storm would be so powerful and could make a direct hit on New Orleans .
" It was n't until comparatively late , shortly before -- a day , maybe a day and a half , before landfall -- that it became clear that this was going to be a Category 4 or 5 hurricane headed for the New Orleans area . "
As far back as Friday , August 26 , the National Hurricane Center was predicting the storm could be a Category 4 hurricane at landfall , with New Orleans directly in its path .
Still , storms do change paths , so the possibility existed that it might not hit the city .
But the National Weather Service prediction proved almost perfect .
Katrina made landfall on Monday , August 29 .
Tens of thousands of people in New Orleans who did not or could not heed the mandatory evacuation orders issued the day before the storm made landfall were left in dire straits .
" I think we have discovered over the last few days that with all the tremendous effort using the existing resources and the traditional frameworks of the National Guard , the unusual set of challenges of conducting a massive evacuation in the context of a still dangerous flood requires us to basically break the traditional model and create a new model -- one for what you might call kind of an ultracatastrophe , " Chertoff said .
He vowed that the United States " is going to move heaven and earth " to rescue those in need .
we 're not clothing manufacturers - but when we tried to sell our cafepress merch at zero - profit , only our mothers bought it .

The future is now , and we are not impressed .
The future was supposed to be a fully automated , atomic - powered , germ - free Utopia — a place where a grown man could wear a velvet spandex unitard and not be laughed at .
Our beloved scientists may be building impressive technologies , but some key pieces are missing .
Where are the ray guns , the flying cars , and the X - ray specs we expected ?
The time has come to hold the golden age of science fiction accountable for its fantastic promises .
At the turn of the 19th century , visionaries like Jules Verne and H. G. Wells spun tales of spaceflight and underwater adventure .
By midcentury , the Apollo moon missions were gasoline on the flame .
As science conquered nature , an optimistic populace yearned to live in the perfect tomorrow .
Yet today zeppelins do not hover over fully enclosed skyscraper cities .
Shiny robot servants do not cook breakfast for colonists on the moon .
Worst of all , sleek titanium jetpacks are not ready and waiting on showroom floors .
Perhaps we have become complacent in our futuristic demands .
But scientists have provided us with useful tools that portend a Tomorrowland - like tomorrow .
From liquid laser weapons to Nursebots , we may yet be on the verge of a Buck Rogers way of life .
To speed science along , the course of action is clear :
We must educate ourselves about the technologies at hand and fight for the future we were promised .
The magnificent future of humankind depends on it .
Now is the time to stop wishing , to stand up , and to shout , " Where the hell is my jetpack ? ! "
Look at your car sitting there in the driveway — sad , squat , all four tires on the pavement .
You should feel sorry for your car for the same reason that you should feel sorry for yourself :
You are both flightless .
Optimistic drivers of the past imagined a future in which the stubby tail fins of their cars morphed into broad wings .
According to the car companies presenting at the World 's Fair of 1939 , your driveway was destined to become a runway , the highway a skyway , and the only speed limit the speed of sound .
The first attempts at creating flying cars were fairly simple — install an airplane engine and two wings on a regular car .
The first attempts were also disastrous .
Henry Ford 's " sky flivver " flew in 1928 , but production was nixed after an unlucky pilot died in a crash .
In 1956 , Moulton Taylor , an engineer who earlier had helped develop the cruise missile , unveiled the Aerocar .
The little yellow Aerocar could leap from the highway at 55 miles per hour and cruise up to 100 mph at around 12,000 feet with a range of up to 300 miles .
The Aerocar worked fine conceptually , but it was too impractical for everyday use — a business deal for full - scale production fell through in the early 1970s .
The only remaining Aerocar prototype was purchased by a fan who saw it advertised in the classifieds .
If you are averse to purchasing dangerous relics listed in obscure newspaper ads and you still want to acquire a flying car , the solution may be to let NASA take care of it .
That 's right , NASA gave us gooey foam pillows , dehydrated ice cream , and those shiny space blankets , and it may yet fork over the flying car .
NASA scientists working on the Small Aircraft Transportation System ( SATS ) project are making inroads on the two main problems holding back personal air travel on a massive , nationwide scale : midair collisions and complicated piloting mechanisms .
NASA eschews the term " flying car , " preferring " personal air vehicle " instead .
Nevertheless , NASA has imagined flying cars that would humiliate George Jetson .
Until their vehicle program was eliminated in 2005 , the folks at Langley Research Center planned to roll out three prototypes in sequence : a small prop plane that would tuck its wings in on the highway ( it should n't cost any more than a Mercedes - Benz ) ; a two - seater with rear - propeller drive ; and , for tight parking spots , one capable of vertical takeoff .
Merely providing the vehicles would not be enough , however .
If everyday people are to use them , scientists must know how to track thousands of these car - planes .
And knowing is half the battle .
Collision - deterring navigation systems are key to transforming highways into skyways .
Personal air vehicles will use GPS and cell phone technology to automatically broadcast information about location and speed to ground - based towers .
From the ground , an automated computer system will update the flight path of every sky vehicle and provide instant directions — automatically avoiding collisions and minimizing flight time .
Meanwhile , onboard sensors will detect nearby trees , buildings , and power lines .
And the jackpot bonus item for the sky - car consumer :
For most of the flight the human " driver " can take care of anything besides flying , like eating a whole bag of potato chips .
NASA 's dream cars may be exciting ( and legitimate ) , but they are n't available to the public right this second .
So turn your attention to the Moller M400 Skycar — a partially tested prototype offered in the 2005 Neiman Marcus gift catalog .
Paul Moller , a former engineering professor at the University of California at Davis , has spent all of his money and more than 40 years trying to build a flying car .
The current model is a cherry - red coupe that looks as though it should be dogfighting TIE fighters outside the Death Star .
The futuristic Skycar has four seats ( carrying up to 750 pounds ) , a maximum airspeed of 375 mph , and a range of about 750 miles .
On the ground , the Skycar should travel a dinky 30 to 35 mph , just fast enough to get to an empty parking lot and stun everyone with a sweet vertical takeoff .
Prototypes like the Skycar have been on the verge of full - scale production for almost a century , though , and it may be another hundred years before you can score that most badass symbol of the space age , the flying car .
Yesteryear 's dinner of tomorrow was designed to feed the spacefaring denizens of an overpopulated planet .
It was cheap , it was synthetic , and it was so completely off the mark as to be almost wholly inconceivable to us now .
These days people expect real food from the ground , preferably without any genetic splicing .
But the food predictions of yesterday are as tantalizing as ever .
What 's more American than an apple - pie pill ?
As a rule , future food does not come from the ground .
In the best - case scenario it comes from lush hydroponic gardens , but it 's much more likely to come from a factory , a tube , or a vat .
In addition , future fodder never looks like food , either ; it looks like a piece of plastic , a splash of corn - syrupy liquid , or — best of all — a tempting little white pill .
The space program kick - started a food revolution .
Kids were fascinated with how food got into the astronauts ( and how it got back out ) .
Space travelers have serious dietary restrictions :
Food has to be as light as possible because every ounce counts on liftoff , and gooey foods are preferred , as renegade crumbs can damage delicate machinery .
As a result , early astronauts had to suck food out of tubes , toss back vitamin pills , and generally have a culinarily bad time .
In the early 1960s , astronauts on the Mercury space missions sucked applesauce out of aluminum tubes .
Later , the menu was expanded to include " food powder , " freeze - dried food that had to be squirted with cold water and then sucked through a straw .
By 1965 , Gemini astronauts were subjected to Tang , which has the limited advantage of making water taste less like water .
Luckily , by 1973 , astronauts on the Skylab space station had a luxurious meal - preparation area and a menu with over 72 items .
But seriously , where are the food pills ?
The idea is theoretically possible , but like most " technological food , " it 's not commercially viable .
Thankfully , the Combat Feeding Directorate ( called Natick , after its location ) is working ceaselessly to keep U.S. soldiers well fed — and the soldiers have little say in the matter .
A decade ago Natick introduced MREs ( " meals ready to eat " ) — individually packaged , self - heating food pouches .
Its most recent innovation is the compressed meal ( CM ) .
A CM is one - third the size and weight of an MRE but has the same number of calories .
At this rate , the food pill may be on the menu soon .
Under the far - reaching metabolic - dominance program , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) is soliciting proposals for a pill that will allow soldiers to operate at peak performance during prolonged periods of starvation .
Meanwhile , Natick is working on a transdermal nutrient patch that will enable soldiers to go without food for up to three days .
Although military grunts must eat what they are given , the general public seems to hate the idea of nonnatural food sources .
For some reason , a bloody hunk of cow meat is more appetizing to most people than a shivering plate teeming with microbial life .
Go figure .
Nevertheless , many technological foods ( including food pills ) are either available or under development .
For now , you can find the closest food pill equivalent at your local 7 - Eleven — go out and buy a HOOAH !
brand energy bar ; the bars were developed by the Pentagon and have been shown to delay time to exhaustion by about 20 percent .
A lot of promises are made in the bedroom and on the campaign trail , but the biggest , most important promises are made in tiny print on the last few pages of comic books — like the promise of glasses that let you see through things .
For a modest price these advertisements guarantee the Superman - like ability to see through walls ; but honestly , X - ray spectacles were really all about seeing through clothes .
The " scientific marvel of the century " offered in comic books may be a gimmick , but modern defense contractors are not playing around .
Visible light insists on bouncing off even the flimsiest nontransparent objects .
An X - ray is like visible light except that it has more energy .
High - energy photons ( which are invisible to our eyes ) tend to penetrate farther into objects before they bounce off — or they can go all the way through .
To develop X - ray spectacles , the trick is to use light with just enough power to penetrate clothing but not enough to penetrate skin .
Because let 's face it , no matter what the fashion magazines say , walking skeletons are just not that sexy .
The need for better airport security led to the development of a new backscatter machine that uses low - power X - rays with just the right finesse — they penetrate clothing but not skin .
Specifically , the machine emits and measures the position of X - rays that " scatter back " from a person and generate a photograph - quality image .
The process is sometimes referred to by the vaguely disgusting term " backscatting . "
Very dense objects ( like guns ) show up dark , medium - dense objects ( like skin ) come out grayscale , and not - very - dense objects ( like clothes ) do n't show up at all .
To summarize , it 's a magical machine that spits out naked images of fully clothed people .
But a backscatter machine wo n't fit on your face ; it 's the size of a refrigerator and takes about eight seconds to scan a person standing about eight inches away .
When X - ray eyes leave the realm of gimmicks and enter the local airport , privacy becomes an issue .
Who should wield such awesome power ?
Though backscatter devices are commonly used in prisons , diamond mines , and customs searches , introducing the machines to airports has been a tough sell .
Critics warn against bombarding children and adults with X - rays , even low - power X - rays .
Meanwhile , the CEO of an X - ray machine company cheerfully reports that radiation levels are similar to that of good , clean sunlight .
The American Civil Liberties Union describes the process as a " virtual strip search . "
Travelers in the United Kingdom , however , are unfazed ; virtual strip search machines have been used at London 's Heathrow Airport for years .
Gawking at naked people is always good fun , but what about using your abilities for the forces of good ?
Superman used his X - ray vision to see through walls in an endless , obsessive search for truth and justice .
Now lowly humans can do the same using the Radar Scope .
Research funded by DARPA recently produced the device , which is the size of a telephone handset and can sense human beings through up to 12 inches of concrete .
The " through - wall personnel detector " uses radar to sense movements as small as breathing up to 50 feet into the next room .
Put simply , it is a motion detector that works through walls .
Whether your goal is to see through walls or bikinis , the technology is here .
And unlike the swirly sunglasses that disappointed so many of us , these gadgets actually work .
Finally , humankind has mastered the power of light and put it to a noble purpose .
For around a thousand dollars , you can buy a Radar Scope and dominate future games of hide - and - seek , but at a reported cost of six figures , backscatter portals are likely to be out of the reach of most comic - book readers .
Since the beginning of time , children have performed all the duties of a so - called smart home : grabbing beers from fridges , changing television channels , and taking verbal abuse for problems they do n't understand and probably did n't cause .
Considering that children have been around forever , it is only reasonable to expect that a better technology exists by now .
Certainly , we should all be living in robotic houses that act as conscious , living servants to meet our every need and desire .
Right now , " smart home " technology is available off the shelf ; home automation enthusiasts have access to all kinds of gadgets that can make life simpler ( and more complicated ) .
The key goal for home automation is to give the occupant total control over the house from anywhere .
Most home automation devices require a central personal computer to provide control and to run programs .
For instance , X10 modules plug into the wall and then communicate with a home computer , letting a person turn on and off lights and appliances via a Web site .
There are quite a few sensors , such as cameras , motion detectors , or water leak detectors , that can be used to monitor who is in your driveway , trigger exterior lights when people approach , or constantly check for broken water pipes .
Meanwhile , effectors can be used to water plants automatically , remotely raise and lower blinds , or feed your pets .
Anyone can create the ultimate remote - control house — the only limit is your wallet .
Sadly , fetching your beer is not a priority for smart homes .
Instead , the most promising application is to help elderly people live safely and independently .
Smart homes are being designed to use simple sensors common to home security systems and advanced artificial intelligence in order to figure out what people are doing ( activity recognition ) and where they are ( location estimation ) .
The Georgia Tech Aware
Home looks like a two - story house but is in reality a laboratory bristling with sensing equipment , including cameras in the ceiling , microphones in the walls , and invisible trip sensors in doorways .
The Aware Home and other laboratories like it are the very first prototype smart homes that will help us all stay out of the nursing home someday .
If you are frightened by disembodied voices that emanate from speakers in the walls , then you may want to complement your smart home with a mobile robot .
In an experiment with Nursebot ( a trashcan - size wheeled robot designed to deliver medicine and reminders ) at Carnegie Mellon University , researchers found that by using a laser range finder , a robotic home could correctly predict the paths that people commonly take so that mobile robots could learn to stay out of the way .
Nursebot can use such knowledge to effectively cater to occupants .
She even has grab bars so that elderly users can grab hold and stand up .
Beat that , Rascal Scooter !
The death ray is the logical equivalent of a six - shooter for a hard - drinkin ' , hard - fightin ' space cowboy .
In early science fiction pulps , any adventurer worth his space boots carried an old - fashioned holster containing a high - fashion ray gun — and the more stylish the fins , the better .
The hardware is now available for us to emulate our cosmic heroes .
Ray - gun - like weapons are quickly becoming commonplace .
Preliminary weapons are nonlethal and have been used by happy - go - lucky military troops and police officers eager to teach new dance moves to protesters and rioters .
Several classes of directed energy weapons , called nonkinetic weapons by military types , have met field trials and are coming into widespread use .
The Active Denial System , developed by the Pentagon , can aim and emit superhigh - frequency microwaves .
When the millimeter - size wave pulses hit human skin , they heat the body 's water to the point of pain .
The burning sensation has been compared to touching a hundred - watt lightbulb but without the singed hair — the system is only playing with your nerve endings , not causing permanent damage .
Currently , the weapon wo n't fit in your holster — soldiers have to mount them on top of Humvees .
Alternately , why not use a prototype " lightning gun " to harness the Zeus - like power of electricity ?
A host of new defense contractors have sprouted to help governments battle terrorists , and they supply a variety of hair - raising weapons .
Companies like Ionatron and Xtreme Alternative Defense Systems have developed competing zap guns .
Both weapons use pulsed lasers to create a conductive path in the air away from the gun 's barrel and then use a simple Tesla coil to generate a painful bolt of electricity .
Both rifles are the size of a briefcase , weigh 25 pounds , and can shoot electricity wildly at 12 feet or consistently at 4 feet .
Occasionally , the flashing purple discharge kicks back and lashes the bejesus out of the poor guy holding the gun .
We have so far ignored the most compelling directed energy weapon of all — the laser blaster .
Jedi Knights can apparently use light sabers to easily deflect laser bolts , but electrically driven solid - state laser weapons ( preferred over their less - wieldy chemical - based cousins ) are designed primarily to zap approaching missiles .
Field - tested military prototypes are pushing 25 kilowatts of power , and research is under way on versions that can turn missiles into swiss cheese with 100 kilowatts of laser power ( a million times more powerful than an everyday laser pointer ) .
Meanwhile , the General Atomics company has developed a prototype weapon , called the High Energy Liquid Laser Area Defense System ( HELLADS ) .
Precise details are classified , but the system purportedly combines two types of laser , liquid and solid - state , for a single über - powerful weapon .
Unlike other liquid lasers , the HELLADS can fire a continuous beam without a large cooling system , and unlike solid - state lasers , the HELLADS produces a high - energy density that does not require pulsing the laser on and off .
The whole system weighs 1,600 pounds and can fit into the space of a large refrigerator .
The project goal is to eventually spit a 150 - kilowatt beam clean through enemy missiles .
The big question , of course , is what is keeping a handheld laser blaster out of your pocket ?
The most noticeable obstacle is heat dissipation .
Operational lasers are inefficient , converting only about 15 percent of electric power into laser , with the rest wasted in the form of extreme heat .
More efficient diodes ( the part that converts electricity to light ) would lower heat output and shrink lasers so that they could hang jauntily on your hip .
For now , though , you will have to be happy with mounting military lasers to your tactical ground vehicle ( that 's your Buick ) .

THE mobile - phone industry 's recent jamboree in Florida was a brutal reminder of how fast innovations come and go these days .
A bare three months ago we were drooling over Apple 's forthcoming iPhone , with its ingenious touch screen that responds to pinches , pokes and other pawings .
But though not available until June , the $ 500 iPhone is as mouth - watering today as yesterday 's cold pizza .
The phone that stole the show at CTIA Wireless 2007 was the “ Ocean ” from Helio , a youth - oriented newcomer to the cellular business .
In many ways Helio has out - Appled Apple .
The start - up — launched less than a year ago as a joint venture between SK Telecom of South Korea and Earthlink , an American internet - service provider — caters to young trendsetters who appreciate ease of use and cutting - edge design .
Whereas the iPhone encapsulated a ho - hum smart phone in an exquisite package , the $ 295 Helio Ocean has been winning plaudits for its ingenious user interface that neatly integrates all the disparate functions of a modern multi-media mobile , such as dialling phone calls , texting messages , listening to music , taking pictures , recording videos , playing games and surfing the web .
To make a call , the Helio Ocean 's screen slides vertically to reveal a phone keypad .
To type an e-mail , do some texting or send an instant message , turning the device horizontally and sliding the screen upwards reveals a full keyboard .
With a separate microprocessor to run the media player , the Helio Ocean gets 15 hours of playing time from a single charge .
Little wonder it was hailed as the rock star of the industry 's show .
Apple / Helio
But it is the Helio Ocean 's EV - DO ( Evolution - Data Optimised ) wireless technology that renders Apple 's iPhone an also - ran .
Mobile experts have been mystified by Apple 's decision to use Cingular 's EDGE ( Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution ) network when far better wireless communications methods abound .
EDGE is a marginally enhanced version of the old GSM ( Global System for Mobile Communications ) cellular technology introduced in Europe in the early 1990s .
Cingular 's version of it provides data speeds of between 75 kilobits per second ( kbps ) and 135 kbps — not that much better than a dial - up internet connection , and often much worse .
By contrast , the EV - DO networks used by Helio ( as well as Verizon and Sprint in America and KDDI in Japan ) offer 450 kbps to 800 kbps , rates similar to those of DSL broadband connections .
EDGE 's slower data speeds mean that iPhone users must rely on Wi-Fi to do anything more than make phone calls or send the odd e-mail : the iPhone has a Wi -Fi radio embedded in its circuitry so users can access internet “ hotspots ” using the popular 802.11 form of wireless broadband .
Wi-Fi may be handy for networking wirelessly around the home or in hotel lobbies , coffee shops or airports .
But it is hardly the most efficient way to download videos or play multi-user games — tricks that multi-media mobile phones are supposed to perform flawlessly .
Mobile - phone companies have their own ideas about how to meet these new demands .
Most are working feverishly on upgrades for their existing 3G ( third - generation ) networks .
Qualcomm , the company behind the CDMA family of cellular technologies , has shown in trials that its EV - DO enhancements can deliver data rates of over three megabits per second ( mbps ) .
Cingular and other GSM - based networks are pushing a rival technology called High - Speed Downlink Packet Access ( HSDPA ) in a bid to close the performance gap .
In real - world trials HSDPA has clocked speeds of up to 1 mbps .
But even EV - DO , let alone the slower HSDPA , might prove too little too late .
The mobile - phone companies are about to be overwhelmed by a tsunami called WiMAX , a souped - up successor of Wi-Fi with a range of 30 miles or more instead of 100 yards or less .
Whereas 3G cellular networks might get 3 mbps and Wi-Fi around 30 mbps , mobile WiMAX is a 4G technology promising speeds of up to 100 mbps .
Comparable 4G networks from the cellular industry , such as the proposed Ultra Mobile Broadband from the CDMA camp or the Long - Term Evolution effort among GSM 's descendants , are still in the laboratory .
And that 's where they might well remain .
WiMAX ( or 802.16 , its technical name ) was conceived as a way to deliver broadband to remote areas beyond the reach of DSL or cable TV .
The mobile version of this form of wireless networking was supposed to be a more advanced sibling called 802.20 .
But with Intel , Sprint and the European Union throwing their weight behind the interim 802.16 mobile solution , the WiMAX bandwagon has become unstoppable .
In addition to being able to transfer at least twice the amount of data per second achieved by the best technologies of the cellular industry , mobile WiMAX is relatively cheap .
During the spectrum auctions of the heady dotcom era , cell - phone companies scrambled to outbid one another for 3G frequency allocations , paying typically $ 5 per megahertz for every member of the population covered .
In today 's more chastened times , mobile WiMAX licences can be had for less than one cent per megahertz per person — a whopping 500 times less .
This has tipped the tables in mobile WiMAX 's favour .
And with it , the writing on the wall is looming ever larger for most of the 3G phone operators .
Why Apple should have hitched its wagon to so fading a star shows how quickly even the most talented of companies can be blinded by today 's blistering pace of wireless innovation .

The 27 - year - old woman was travelling to the western region of Valle del Cauca , when police conducted a routine check .
The woman had almost 800 explosives attached to her which the authorities believe she was transporting to forces of the left - wing rebel army , the Farc .
It is still unclear whether she was doing so for payment or under duress .
When police searched the woman , they found she had a large quantity of explosives strapped to her body .
In total , there were 790 bomblets fixed to her , which police say were sufficient to have destroyed the bus and most likely killed everybody on board .
The woman , however , was not a suicide bomber - something which remains almost unheard of in Colombia 's 40 - year - long civil war .
Instead , she was transporting the material to members of the left - wing rebel group , the Farc , operating in Valle del Cauca .
The group has been known to use all sorts of methods to both transport explosives and carry out bomb attacks , sometimes involving people who unwittingly act as agents .
Indeed , the authorities attribute one of the most notorious Farc attacks in recent years - the 2003 bombing of El Nogal nightclub in Bogota which left 36 people dead - to a similar situation .
An impromptu “ Impeach Bush Cheney ” sign located on the westbound side of Interstate 64 near the I - 464 overpass in Chesapeake . …
A similar sign off U.S. 58 is on private land , said Harry Kenyon , a Virginia Department of Transportation spokesman .
So it ’s safe as long as the person who placed it has the property owner ’s permission .
Whoever placed the signs was determined that they stay up there – they are n’t easy to reach .
“ Someone had to really want to put it there , ” Kenyon said .

DENVER , April 6  Mack Louden worries that his 30,000 - acre ranch sits in the cross hairs of the Army ’s plans to expand its Piñon Canyon Maneuver Site at Fort Carson , and he , along with other Colorado ranchers , are increasingly upset about the idea .
“ Where we live , how we live , it ’s all going to die a slow death if the Army gets our land , ” said Mr. Louden , a fourth - generation rancher from Las Animas County , along the southern edge of the state .
He and other ranchers are to testify on Monday before a committee of state lawmakers in support of a bill that seeks to keep the Army from acquiring nearly a half - million acres it says it needs to train soldiers in the nuances of modern warfare .
Colorado law grants the federal government permission to condemn land for some purposes , like building courthouses and post offices .
And the Defense Department lifted a moratorium this year on land acquisitions to allow the Piñon Canyon expansion .
As I implied in an earlier discussion of resveratrol , the increasingly compelling data on this compound has encouraged me to do a little bit of research about taking it myself , as a dietary supplement ( supplementary , that is , to what I already get as part of a wine - rich lifestyle ) .
I ’m currently in the homework / due diligence phase , considering issues of price and purity as I look around for a source that I can ( a ) afford and ( b ) have some objective reason to trust .
As a pure compound , resveratrol is prohibitively expensive .
As an unregulated “ nutraceutical , ” however , it ’s still costly ( ~$ 450 per annum ) , but of uncertain potency .
None of the commercial suppliers I can find are straightforward about how many mg of resveratrol their products contain .
Even among the more reputable - seeming and less fly - by - night vendors , there tends to be a lot of misleading indirection on the labels — take , for instance , the label for Revatrol :
How much resveratrol is in one caplet ?
Not 400 mg , to be sure , but that ’s not very helpful , and it seems like the vendor is taking pains to avoid making a statement that they can be held to ( e.g. , the knotweed extract might be 15 % resveratrol , but it ’s not clear what proportion of the proprietary mix is knotweed extract , so what looks deceptively like data is really just a meaningless number ) .
Several of the other plant - derived compounds quoted on the label are also potent anti-oxidants , but it ’s becoming increasingly clear that a big part of resveratrol ’s activity is via activation of sirtuins , and that the antioxidant properties are either significantly less important or a complete red herring — so I ’m not terribly impressed by those .
Given that the current literature is focusing on resveratrol explicitly , I ’d like to see a commercial supplier take the plunge and do some analytical chemistry on their own product , establishing once and for all how much resveratrol is contained in each dose — and then standing by it for all time , ideally with the assay results for each lot to be shipped along with every bottle .
Because I ’m willing to make myself a guinea pig , but not a chump .
Has anyone else looked into these supplements ?
I looked at four or five different suppliers ; while I liked Revatrol the most , I still was n’t sold .
If you have done any thinking or research about this , please leave a comment .
Let us know how you evaluated different products and ( if you got that far ) how you made your choice .
( If you ’re affiliated with or are taking money from a supplier , please opt yourself out .
I ’ll just expose and mock you , and no one wants that . )
Walt Disney warped my mind .
It was the first time I visited a cinema , to see Sleeping Beauty .
That forest of thorns enveloping the castle has haunted me ever since ; in my dreams for years , a great chasm opened up before the prince , an impossible yawning space full of spikes and twisting briars .
Last night , I watched it with my daughter .
What will it become in her mind ?
It felt like passing on a folk tale by the fire , and yet some people are wary of exposing their children to the genius of Disney .
I do n't need to labour the vilification of the man , who died 40 years ago this Christmas .
No other artist 's signature appears on the products of an industry that is the cultural equivalent of Coca - Cola or McDonald's , and to many people , buying a toy Pinocchio is as bad as feeding your child burgers .
Marc Eliot 's 1993 biography branded Disney an FBI informant union - basher , and hints at worse .
In a classic episode of The Simpsons broadcast shortly after Eliot 's book came out , Bart and Lisa watch a corporate propaganda film at Itchy and Scratchy Land that says animation pioneer Roger Meyers
Sr " loved almost all the peoples of the world " - an apparent swipe at Disney 's alleged anti-semitism .
Hating Disney has become a cliche .
A few months ago , the over - rated guerrilla artist Banksy left a figure of a Guantanamo prisoner at Disneyland - where else ?
- as if Walt , who died in 1966 , was directing the war on terror from his cryogenic vault .
When a long dead cartoonist and film - maker is reviled for the crimes of the present administration , something is out of whack .
Walt Disney was one of the great American artists of the 20th century .
This needs to be recognised .
So here I am , Walt , coming to the rescue , aided by an exhibition at the Grand Palais in Paris that celebrates Disney 's films as visual art .
Yes , I know : to call Walt Disney a great artist begs a couple of questions .
Even his authorship of the mouse he drew in 1928 in his career - making cartoon , Steamboat Willie , has been questioned .
As soon as Disney started making money , he hired teams of designers and animators .
Obviously he was n't Nick Park , doing it all himself .
He never claimed to be .
He was a modern artist , an American artist - and far from ignorant about the avant - garde .
Salvador Dali's original paintings for an unfinished collaboration with Disney , a film called Destino , are on view at the Grand Palais .
They point to a film that would have been as remarkable a meeting of Hollywood and the avant - garde as Dali 's sequence in Hitchcock 's Spellbound .
This is not in the least surprising .
Disney 's films abound in stupendously imaginative metamorphoses , sublime fantasies to rival any surrealist painting .
Disney anticipated - and surely influenced - Andy Warhol in turning his studio into a collective enterprise , a factory .
He ruled over his cartoonists with an iron fist .
Yet when it comes to authorship , the analogies with Warhol , or Marcel Duchamp , are not really necessary .
You only have to watch a few Disney films , widely separated across the decades of his career , to recognise the consistent obsessions that can only have been the product of one man 's mind .
In 1929 , only a year after Steamboat Willie made Mickey Mouse a star , Disney created a cartoon that could not be more different .
Skeleton Dance is American , deeply so , in the vein of Washington Irving and Edgar Allan Poe - a jazz - age honk of American gothic that brilliantly uses black and white silhouettes to create an archetypal midnight churchyard where the skeletons get out of their graves and dance .
When Tim Burton does this sort of thing , it 's hailed as a gothic subversion of the homeliness of Disney , but Disney subverted himself first .
When later he came to make Fantasia , the skeleton dance was echoed in the march of the mops carrying their buckets of water until Mickey chops , chops , chops them up .
Walt Disney 's imagination is macabre , as well as delighting in innocence .
You could even say that far , from providing generations of children with innocent escape , he filled their minds with darkness - which somehow , in the hands of critics , becomes a fault .
In fact , it proves that , beneath the all - American facade , Walt Disney had a terrible secret : he was a true artist .
What strikes you , looking at his films , is not simply the consistent thread of ideas and images and ways of telling a story , but the unexpected nature of this personal style .
It 's not the routine comic stuff , the escapades of Donald and Mickey , that is inimitable hardcore Disney .
Few people find Donald Duck as funny as Bugs Bunny .
Disney was n't a humourist .
Again and again , it is the dark side of the Disney landscape that you know him by , from the early black and white Egyptian Melodies , in which a spider crawls down a highly realistic tomb shaft beneath the Sphinx to be terrified by the spectacle of mummies having a midnight party , to the skull - shaped island , inspired by King Kong , in Peter Pan .
Disney 's supreme achievement was to give visual reality to the fairytales of the Europe that Americans growing up in the 1930s and 40s no longer knew , as their immigrant parents had .
Of course , we can buy the original transcripts of peasant tales by the Grimms or Charles Perrault , or read retellings by Angela Carter .
Yet Disney reached into folklore , grasped its essentials , and represented it for the modern child .
When it comes to Snow White , can anyone separate the folk story from Disney 's version ?
Here we come to the one accusation , the one dilemma that really counts .
Is Disney good or bad for children ?
Do the studio's versions of classic stories do them justice ?
An adult fan of the fairytale might sit down and watch Sleeping Beauty or Cinderella and be appalled by the interpolated characters and dated graphic styles , and see in all this Disney 's true crime , the cosying - indeed the " Disneyfication " - of traditional stories .
One answer is : watch with a child , see the wonder on a little face .
But sadly , kids like the Tweenies , too .
What do they know ?
However , watch more closely , watch the films as art , and surely the truth becomes obvious .
Disney changed the letter of the fairytale but saved its spirit .
The forest of thorns that scared and amazed me in Sleeping Beauty is one version of the encounter with evil , death and terror that is at the heart of all his fairytale films , once the viewer has been lured in by the sugar candy coating .
The nightmare spirit of the fairytale that psychologist Bruno Bettelheim defended is all there .
What Disney actually achieved was not to diffuse an American banality worldwide but , in a world that was becoming ever more banal and forgetful , to preserve the old oral storytelling of the pre-industrial world .
Few artists have done as much as Disney to humanise modernity ; the magical proof of this is one of his last films .
If you still subscribe to the cliche of Disney as a propagandist of cosy Americana , consider this .
There was one Disney film I did n't intend to mention because I assumed it must have been made by the studio after he died or retired - it seems so remote from everything we " know " about him .
In fact , even hostile biographers acknowledge this magical , and totally unAmerican child 's - eye vision of London as one of the films on which he lavished most attention , a film he was obsessed with making for 20 years , and turned into his final testament .
If you want to know the real Walt Disney , watch Mary Poppins .

About one million unemployed people are claiming benefits
Up to 40,000 jobless people say their poor English is a barrier to finding employment , ministers say - and £ 4.5 m is spent on translators in job centres .
This money would be better spent on teaching them English , they say .
But critics say proposals do not square with other plans to stop free lessons for those who are in work .
Barrier to work
From April , new guidelines will require job centres in England to focus on encouraging the take - up of English courses .
Welfare minister Jim Murphy told a Work Foundation seminar that it was " unacceptable " that ethnic minorities in Britain earned on average a third less than their white counterparts .
He added that , as ethnic minorities became a larger part of the working age population , it was essential everyone could access the labour market .
The government have got it the wrong way round ... it 's the ones in factories they want to concentrate on
Adam Skwierawaski
Language efforts recalled
Some 15 % of members of ethnic minorities cite language difficulties as a barrier to work , the welfare minister said .
" We must utilise the resources we have to redress the balance : to put the emphasis not just on translating language to claim a benefit , but to teaching language to get a job , " he said .
But Habib Rahman , chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants , said it was not just language problems which stopped people from ethnic minority groups getting jobs .
" For all migrants , difficulties with immigration status and racial discrimination , together with the state of local employment markets , may impede their ability to access services , training and the kind of jobs where they can improve their English , " he said .
And Keith Best , of the Immigration Advisory Service , said those who were eligible for employment were keen to learn English , but there were not enough teachers and courses around .
' Unjoined - up government '
More than 100 MPs have signed a Parliamentary motion criticising plans to end free entitlement to courses for English - those in work will have to pay a third of costs from this summer .
Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesman David Laws said it was " ironic " that the government wanted the changes while reducing other English classes .
" What is happening here seems to be the perfect example of unjoined - up government , " he added .
HAVE YOUR SAY
How can you take part in society if you can't communicate properly ?

Shadow work and pensions secretary Philip Hammond said making working migrants pay for classes may end up trapping them in low - skilled jobs , because they cannot afford more tuition .
" We need to help them as well to acquire the language skills that will unlock the other skills they may have and allow them to move on , " he said .
Labour 's former Minister for Welfare Reform , Frank Field , told BBC Radio 4's World at One that the government should go further .
He said everyone who wanted to remain in Britain permanently should be able to speak English before they arrive .
" Not to insist on being able to speak the language means it 's easier for ghettos to develop and , of course , much more difficult once people are here to break out of those ghettos , " he said .
Meanwhile , a study by the think - tank Civitas suggests a third of households in the UK rely on benefits for at least half of their income .
Of course , I had to find a tactful way to ask her that .
" Why do n't they get an American actress ? " I heard my mouth saying , while my brain was still mulling it over .
" Because they 're all so Botoxed they can't show the range of emotion necessary for the part , " she replied .
Wow - that thrilled me .
The first sign that the tide is turning against plastic fantastic beauty .
And then the very next day after she said that , the equally un-Botoxed , non-liposucked , un- facelifted Helen Mirren won the Oscar for Best Actress .
It was n't so much that she won the award - it's well chronicled that actors generally have a better chance at that gong playing a role seriously at odds with their reality : disabled , bonkers , barely human , anciently old , etc .
And you can't get much weirder than the British royal family , so while her performance was extraordinary , it was a great Academy Award role as well .
What was thrilling - and important - about the whole event was how she looked on the night : bloody gorgeous .
She 's 61 .
She has n't had any surgery .
And she was n't gorgeous in a patronising " good for her age " mother - of - the - bride kind of way either ; she just looked fabulous , all other details irrelevant .
Now , of course , Helen Mirren has always been ridiculously beautiful - and famously sexy .
In fact , I used to find it quite annoying the way people were always going on about it .
Any interview you read with her , you could practically see the reporter 's drool on the page .
And then there was that relationship with the young Liam Neeson , of course , which I still find it quite hard to forgive her for ( please join me in a rousing chorus of " It should have been me ... " ) .
But I think I can get over it now on account of the role model she has become for young actresses - and women in general .
And men , too , come to think of it .
Any way you look at it , beautiful Helen Mirren , her face cross - hatched by quite deep lines , is a win - win for all of us .
So if she 's not having surgery , paralysing injections - or even hair colouring - what is she doing to hold on to that beauty and to that legendary sex appeal so far past the age when it is supposed to be possible for women ?
She does n't have a personal trainer - she claims to get her exercise walking her dogs - and I can't find any interviews espousing cranky diet regimens or hot - house yoga .
Studying the pictures , I reckon she 's fortunate to have been born with a very warm skin tone and a defined waist .
The key things she is adding to these attributes at this stage are the steely grey hair - so much more flattering than a desperation dye job - and wonderful posture .
I think the posture is a large part of it , so we 'd all better do some Alexander Technique .
But most of all , I think it is her attitude to ageing - which was clearly ingrained in her from childhood .
She quotes her own mother telling her this : " Do n't worry about getting older , nature has a wonderful way of maturing your mental faculties so that you do n't mind the physical side of ageing . "
Young actresses , everywhere , listen up .
The conventional scapegoat for all this is an extremist and incompetent American administration , to which our prime minister has foolishly hitched his policy .
I think this is only part of the story : the malaise is deeper .
My own experience of making and effecting policy in these areas is that the system itself is bust - not fit for purpose .
And in allowing it to continue in its current form , we the public are also culpable .
Through habit and traditional deference to the foreign - policy elite , we permit these mistakes in our name .
The abiding feature of foreign - policy making is its closed , secretive and circumscribed nature .
Information is reduced and filtered to a very small group of people , these days concentrated mainly in No 10 , who make decisions based on abstractions many removes distant from reality .
Even on the ground , the strictures of security prevent diplomats from all but the briefest contact with the everyday reality of Afghans and Iraqis .
When I helped negotiate UN security council resolutions on Iraq , I claimed knowledge of that country - from reports , intelligence and so forth - but with no experience whatsoever of the place itself , its air , its people , its reality .
After the invasion of Afghanistan , when I was posted to Kabul , I found myself writing reports about the " political situation " in Afghanistan based on brief forays outside the high embassy walls for meetings surrounded by bodyguards with sympathetic Afghans , conducted through interpreters .
I may as well have been a Pashtun trying to understand the Highlands of Scotland without English .
I did my best , but the temptation is strong and irresistible to bend this scant knowledge to our preferred version of events - for instance that Afghans want democracy ( when in fact their overriding message , still not fully heard , is the desire for security , development and freedom from the warlords , many of whom we helped place in power ) .
Back in the capital , greater is the need for officials and ministers to reassure the public that they understand what is " really " going on in Iraq or Afghanistan .
Officials rush about , ever more busily feeding the machine of endless meetings and briefings , but with all too little time to stop and think .
Even the press prefer western " experts " , usually located thousands of miles distant , to explain these places , rather than those with most at stake .
We all love to project our own designs and prejudices on the distant " other " .
We are stuck in old habits of making and talking about foreign policy .
We want our diplomats and ministers to take care of the world , so we can get on with our lives .
This is an unaffordable luxury .
In the 21st century , everything and everyone is connected - whether climate change or violence in Somalia , which can through myriad paths contribute to terror attacks in London .
In international forums , diplomats are arbitrating more and more of our business , while we have little or no idea of what they are doing , or even who they are .
The existing mechanisms of scrutiny leave much to be desired .
In parliament , no one reads the toothless reports of the foreign affairs committee , which is led by a government loyalist .
Full debates , even when so rarely permitted , are a party political knockabout .
Consideration of foreign policy needs to find much more room for the reality of those affected by our decisions .
Only they can speak with authority on what is " really " going on in their countries .
As I found in my work at the UN security council , all too often they are left out .
At the other end , there must be more consultation of those in whose name policy is made : us , the public .
This is not just an idealistic call for more accountability and democracy in foreign policy , it is deeply practical .
We cannot always know what policy is right , what is really going on .
Only through the closest possible encounter with the facts - the people - on the ground , through open debate , through scrutiny , can we hope to make better decisions in future .

Recently there has been controversy over the issue of " net neutrality . "
Companies like Google and Microsoft are trying to get Congress to prevent Internet service providers ( ISPs ) from charging them higher rates for customer access to their sites .
Many groups involved in political activism , such as Gun Owners of America , also expressed a desire to see the ability of ISPs to charge higher rates restricted .
They have done this in the name of " saving the Internet . "
The common belief is that left to their own devices without government regulation , Internet companies ( and all other companies ) would do whatever they want with their services .
They could , in theory , raise their rates and enact highly discriminatory policies .
They could even block out sites altogether .
Many people who fear this now call for government to step in and protect consumers from such activities .
In a fully free market , this would not be a problem .
If a provider raises rates for Google and Microsoft and blocked certain sites , people who do n't like it could simply switch providers .
If they really want unrestricted access , there would be providers who would give it to them .
And if all the companies somehow conspired to fix prices , new companies would appear to satisfy consumer demand for lower prices .
In contrast , the federal government has attempted to dictate its own vision of how Internet service providers should operate .
In 2005 , the Federal Communications Commission adopted a set of principles for preserving the Internet :
Consumers are entitled to access the lawful Internet content of their choice ; Consumers are entitled to run applications and services of their choice , subject to the needs of law enforcement ; Consumers are entitled to connect their choice of legal devices that do not harm the network ; and Consumers are entitled to competition among network providers , application and service providers , and content providers .
These principles , if enforced by the FCC , would result in compulsory service on the part of Internet providers .
It means that ISPs could not freely contract with consumers for Internet service .
With the right amount of political correctness , it could even mean that service providers would be forced to provide access to objectionable content or go out of business !
Furthermore , if rules were imposed on ISPs , it would result in compliance costs as the companies attempt to follow the government 's established procedures for ensuring " network freedom . "
This creates barriers to entry that would prevent new companies from entering the industry to provide alternative versions of Internet service to consumers .
In such a case , incumbent companies could very well get away with fixing prices against the wishes of consumers .
We can then expect to see the government step in to " solve " this problem that it created in the first place .
Although people find such behavior as charging Google and Microsoft higher rates for the same service to be unpleasant , they must be allowed to proceed unimpeded .
Prices are a natural way of allocating resources between all players in the free market and should not be restricted by government .
For example , if Google and Microsoft were really popular , ISPs might need to allocate more bandwidth to support access to their sites .
If ISPs were not allowed to charge higher prices for higher bandwidth , they would not provide that bandwidth .
Instead , they would choose to provide less for the same price in order to reduce costs .
As a result , consumers would not get more bandwidth for accessing Google and Microsoft 's web services regardless of whether they are willing to pay .
It is important to bear in mind what makes such innovative activity possible : private property and the free market .
Proponents of net neutrality hail companies like Google and Microsoft for having made the Internet what it is today , and claim that higher ISP fees would impede the innovation of such companies .
But the ISPs that made web access fast and affordable made the Internet as well .
Being able to freely charge prices for services is what makes innovation possible at all .
To stifle the free market is to stifle the potential for innovation .
Also , note the irony of promoting net neutrality under the banner of " Save the Internet . "
It was ISPs that brought us the Internet , as we know it .
Net neutrality advocates are calling on the government to protect the Internet from its own creators !
The Best of Simon Que
Scientists have combined two molecules that occur naturally in blood to engineer a molecular complex that uses solar energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen , says research published today in the Journal of the American Chemical Society .
This molecular complex can use energy from the sun to create hydrogen gas , providing an alternative to electrolysis , the method typically used to split water into its constituent parts .
The breakthrough may pave the way for the development of novel ways of creating hydrogen gas for use as fuel in the future .
Professors Tsuchida and Komatsu from Waseda University , Japan , in collaboration with Imperial College London , synthesised a large molecular complex from albumin , a protein molecule that is found at high levels in blood serum , and porphyrin , a molecule which is used to carry oxygen around the body and gives blood its deep red colour .
Porphyrin molecules are normally found combined with metals , and in their natural state in the blood they have an iron atom at their centre .
The scientists modified the porphyrin molecule to swap the iron for a zinc atom in the middle , which completely changed the chemistry and characteristics of the molecule .
This modified porphyrin molecule was then combined with albumin ; with the albumin molecule itself being modified by genetic engineering to enhance the efficiency of the process .
The resulting molecular complex was proven to be sensitive to light , and can capture light energy in a way that allows water molecules to be split into molecules of hydrogen and oxygen .
Dr Stephen Curry , a structural biologist from Imperial College London 's Division of Cell and Molecular Biology who participated in the research explains : " This work has shown that it is possible to manipulate molecules and proteins that occur naturally in the human body by changing one small detail of their make - up , such as the type of metal at the heart of a porphyrin molecule , as we did in this study .
" It 's very exciting to prove that we can use these biological structures as a conduit to harness solar energy to separate water out into hydrogen and oxygen .
In the long term , these synthetic molecules may provide a more environmentally friendly way of producing hydrogen , which can be used as a ' green ' fuel . "

autoincrement considered harmful
MySQL 's auto_increment , and similar features in other databases , are a powerfully useful function but ultimately lead to problems .
The first problem is that you will be tempted to use the internal identifiers in external URLs .
I realize that RESTian canon indicates that every single object have its own identifier , and many new and whizzy frameworks generate simple create / lookup / update / delete user interfaces automatically .
URLs that include an identifier will let you down for three reasons .
The first is that given the URL for some object , you can figure out the URLs for objects that were created around it .
This exposes the number of objects in your database to possible competitors or other people you might not want having this information ( as famously demonstrated by the Allies guessing German tank production levels by looking at the serial numbers . )
Secondly , at some point some jerk will get the idea to write a shell script with a for - loop and try to fetch every single object from your system ; this is definitely no fun .
Finally , in the case of users , it allows people to derive some sort of social hierarchy .
Witness the frequent hijacking and / or hacking of high - prestige low - digit ICQ ids .
The second problem , in the case of MySQL , setting a column as auto_increment requires that there be a primary key placed on this column .
It 's not well explained in the documentation , but under InnoDB , the primary key is similar to a unique key , except that the rows in the database are stored in the sort order of the primary key -- this is why there may only be one such key .
( Other database systems refer to this as a " clustered index " ) .
This means if you are using it merely as a join identifier , but freqently do large queries based on some other column , the rows have to be fetched from all across the disk since they are not all together .
As an example , in early implementations of del.icio.us , fetching all of the bookmarks for a given URL could cause tens of thousands of disk seeks even if there was an index on that column .
As a datastore grows , the location of things on disk in relation to each other becomes an important consideration for scaling .
Kerry Suspects Election 2004 Was Stolen By Robert Parry
November 6 , 2005 S en. John Kerry , the Democratic presidential candidate in 2004 , has told acquaintances over the past year that he suspects that the election was stolen , but that he didnt challenge the official results because he lacked hard proof and anticipated a firestorm of criticism if he pressed the point .
 Kerry heard all the disquieting stories  about voting irregularities in Ohio and other states , said Jonathan Winer , a longtime Kerry adviser and a former deputy assistant secretary of state .
 But he didnt have the evidence to do more . 
The Massachusetts senator conceded to George W. Bush on Nov. 3 , 2004 , the day after the election when it became clear that the uncounted votes in the swing state of Ohio were insufficient to erase Bushs narrow lead .
The move infuriated some Democratic activists who felt Kerry should have lived up to his campaign promise that he would make sure every vote was counted .
In January 2005 , as Bushs victory was being certified by Congress , Kerry also refused to back a resolution challenging the fairness of the Ohio vote .
Mark Crispin Miller , a New York University professor and author of a new book about the 2004 election entitled Fooled Again , said he discussed the voting issue with Kerry on Oct. 28 when he encountered the senator at a political event .
In a Nov. 4 interview on Amy Goodmans  Democracy Now ,  Miller said he gave Kerry a copy of Fooled Again , prompting Kerrys comments about the 2004 election results .
 He told me he now thinks the election was stolen ,  Miller said .
 He said he doesnt believe that he is the person who can go out front on the issue because of the sour grapes question .
But he said he believes it was stolen .
He says he argues about this with his Democratic colleagues on the Hill .
He had just had a big fight with Christopher Dodd . 
Miller and Winer said Kerry suspected possible tampering with electronic voting machines , but that he was persuaded by his campaigns top advisers , including veteran consultant Bob Shrum , that contesting the results only would lead to accusations that Kerry was a sore loser .
 Disquieting Stuff 
In an interview with me , Winer said the disquieting stuff  that troubled Kerry included reports that touch - screen systems had malfunctioned in such a way that voters who tried to vote for Kerry saw their votes switched to Bush .
Kerry also was upset with reports that Ohios Republican election officials shorted Democratic strongholds on voting machines , Winer said .
In some Democratic precincts , there were complaints that voters waited in line for hours or gave up and went home , while in heavily Republican precincts , there were plenty of voting machines and lines were relatively short .
Democratic activists also cited the disparity between exit polls , which showed Kerry winning by about 3 percentage points nationwide and carrying key swing states , and the official count , which flipped the results giving Bush wins in most swing states and a national popular vote margin of about 3 percent .
Some defenders of the election results argue that the exit - poll discrepancies could be explained by Bushs supporters just being less willing to answer questions from pollsters after leaving the voting booth .
According to this argument , Bush voters disdained the liberal media which they saw represented by the exit - poll questioners .
That explanation , however , doesnt explain why historically exit polls have been highly accurate or why the 2004 exit polls were on target when it came to the results for Senate candidates , while off the mark on the presidential race .
Presumably , if conservatives were ducking the exit pollsters , there would be a similar percentage shift for statewide races .
Doubts , Not Certainty Winer said he discussed the election irregularities with Kerry in November and December of 2004 .
At that time , Winer said Kerry never asserted outright  that the election had been stolen , but was uneasy  about what he had heard .
Adding to Kerrys suspicions , Winer said , was the memory of Election 2000 in which Al Gore defeated Bush in the popular vote by more than 500,000 ballots but lost when Bush got five Republicans on the U.S. Supreme Court to stop a recount of votes in Florida .
[ For details on Election 2000 , see Consortiumnews.coms  So Bush Did Steal the White House . ]
But Winer said Kerry didnt believe the evidence existed to prove systematic tampering with the vote in 2004 .
Kerry also was certain he would face withering criticism if he challenged the election results without strong evidence .
 The powers in place would have smashed him ,  Winer said .
On  Democracy Now ,  Miller said Kerry bent to the will of his campaign advisers to concede , even though his vice presidential running mate , John Edwards , favored holding out until more information was in .
Based on reporting for Fooled Again , Miller said Kerry told Edwards in a phone call that Shrum and other advisers insisted that a concession was the best course .
 They say that if I dont pull out , they ( Kerrys political opponents ) are going to call us sore losers ,  Miller said , recounting the substance of Kerrys phone call to Edwards .
Miller said Edwards responded ,  So what if they call us sore losers ? 
But Kerry pressed ahead with his decision to concede .
 Kerry s caving in like that gave an enormous gift to the right wing ,  Miller said .
 They ( the conservatives ) could now claim , well , even their ( the Democrats ) candidate doesnt think it was stolen .
And they ( Kerry and his advisers ) left the American people hanging out to dry there .
GAO Report A recent report by the Government Accountability Office , the investigative arm of Congress , also has questioned the security of U.S. electronic voting systems .
The GAO said some systems dont encrypt ballots or other data , leaving them open to tampering that could escape detection .
The GAO found that another danger was the potential for altering a ballots appearance to trick voters into thinking they were voting for one candidate when their ballots actually went to another .
 Some of these concerns were reported to have caused local problems in federal elections  resulting in the loss or miscount of votes  and therefore merit attention ,  the GAO said .
Winer , who is now a private attorney with a specialty in information security , said its conceivable that electronic balloting was hacked in Election 2004 but that  without a credible witness confessing  there is little hope to prove it .
 There are systems for one - time use that erase themselves afterwards ,  Winer said .
 Youd have to have a confession and anyone who would confess would look psychotic . 
Kerry , too , appears to have weighed how he would look if he made accusations about possible hi-tech hijinks affecting the outcome of a presidential election .
Pundits surely would have put him on the couch as a delusional conspiracy theorist .
But Kerrys decision not to fight has left millions of Americans wondering if their democratic birthright has been stolen  along with the last two presidential elections .

Hubble 's new 3D map shows the " clumpy " nature of dark matter
More details
Dark matter does not reflect or emit detectable light , yet it accounts for most of the mass in the Universe .
The study , published in Nature journal , provides the best evidence yet that the distribution of galaxies follows the distribution of dark matter .
This is because dark matter attracts " ordinary " matter through its gravitational pull .
Scientists presented details of their research during a news conference here at the 209th meeting of the American Astronomical Society ( AAS ) in Seattle , Washington .
It involved nearly 1,000 hours of observations with the Hubble Space Telescope .
For the first time , we can see what 's really out there
Prof Carlos Frenk , University of Durham
Ordinary matter - gas , stars , planets and galaxies - makes up just one - sixth of all matter in the Universe .
The remainder is unseen .
While previous studies of dark matter relied on simulations , this one details its large - scale distribution in 3D .
For astronomers , the challenge of mapping the Universe has been described as similar to mapping a city from night - time aerial snapshots showing only street lights .
Dark matter is invisible , so only the luminous galaxies can be seen directly .
The new images are equivalent to seeing a city , its suburbs and country roads in daylight for the first time .
Yet puzzling discrepancies remain .
Light bending
The map of mass distribution is based on measurements of about half a million distant galaxies .
Lead author Richard Massey and his colleagues used a technique called weak gravitational lensing to detect the dark matter .
To reach us , the light from galaxies has to pass through intervening dark matter .
The study traced subtle distortions in galactic light
More details
" We understand statistically what those galaxies are supposed to look like , " said Dr Massey , from the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) in Pasadena , US .
" If you place some dark matter in the way , this dark matter - through its gravity - bends the path of light .
" As the light gets deflected , it distorts the shape of the background galaxies .
So we end up seeing them in a distorted way , as if through lots of little lenses - and each of those lenses is a bit of dark matter . "
To add 3D distance information , the Hubble observations were combined with multi-colour data from powerful ground - based telescopes .
The map of dark matter distribution confirms that galaxy clusters are located within clumps of this invisible material .
These clumps are connected via bridges of dark matter called filaments .
The clumps and filaments form a loose network - like a web .
Cold and dark
Dr Eric Linder , from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , US , said the study was a " big step forward " in understanding the influence of dark matter on our Universe .
" It 's still a small fraction of the sky we 're talking about - something like two square degrees out of 40,000 square degrees in total ; but they are definitely the clearest pictures we have to date , " he said .
The study involved nearly 1,000 hours of Hubble observations
" In the next decade , I think most studies of the Universe 's large - scale structure will be dark matter structure studies .
In this sense , I think galaxies will be relegated to a secondary role . "
He added : " For the first time , we can see what 's really out there . "
The University of Durham astronomer said that , overall , the results were a " beautiful confirmation " of the cold dark matter theory on which he works .
This theory is a leading model to explain how structures in the Universe evolved over cosmic time .
Soon after the Big Bang , cold dark matter formed the first large structures in the Universe , which then collapsed under their own weight to form vast halos .
The gravitational pull of these halos sucked in ordinary matter , providing a focus for the formation of galaxies .
' Naked ' clumps
But astronomers will have to resolve discrepancies in the otherwise tight connection between ordinary matter and the dark " stuff " .
Concentrations of ordinary matter almost always overlap with concentrations of dark matter - but not absolutely always .
Conversely , the researchers saw that dark matter concentrations sometimes seemed to have no corresponding ordinary matter .
" It 's not forbidden , but you get a little uncomfortable because you would think the two should go together , " said Dr Linder .
Carlos Frenk commented : " Finding what I would call ' naked ' clumps of dark matter where there are no galaxies for me is very strange .
All dark matter clumps of sufficient size should have galaxies - if our understanding is correct . "
For the moment , no - one is talking about needing to revise cosmological models ; but Professor Frenk said everything hinged on the size of these anomalies .
" What would be an enormous puzzle would be to find big , luminous galaxies sitting out there in the middle of nowhere with no dark matter around them .
That really would be shocking . "
The discrepancies could turn out simply to be artefacts , caused by noise in the data .
But then again , said Carlos Frenk , they could be real .
Dr Massey said the anomalies were " tantalising " and that his team was eager to investigate them more closely .
But , he told BBC News , " the discrepancies are not yet at a level of significance where I am definitively convinced they are something other than noise or isolated defects in our analysis . "
The findings come from the Cosmic Evolution Survey ( Cosmos ) project - the largest ever undertaken with Hubble Space Telescope .
The map stretches halfway back to the beginning of the Universe

Here we are readers , in the final stretch of the election cycle .
We are solidly in the lead , and it looks like very little can stand in our way .
So , while Satan - loving - leftists and their unfortunate children are dressing up as demons , ghouls and liberal ax murderers going door to door begging for food , let us take a moment to examine how we can make sure we win this year .
The fact of the matter is simple : Politics has nothing to do with how you play the game .
I hear people telling their children that winning is not the important part of a competitive activity , and then they say some stupid little platitude about it being “ how you play the game .
” No , no , no , that is just some banal phrase that silly lefties use to explain to their children that it is ok to be a wishy - washy little doormat for my Republican children to wipe their blessed feet on .
Winning is , in fact , everything .
Nothing that we do , as Republicans , is wrong or amoral if we win .
You , the man on the street , can do so much to help our cause , and if you want to live in a free society where no one is allowed or encouraged to sodomize you every time you leave your house , you will .
November 8 , 2007
There is nothing wrong with bending the truth in order to ensure a win .
I personally am a big fan of having my people hang flyers for a Republican candidate on telephone poles in Democratic neighborhoods .
Just make sure you put the wrong date on the flyer , and there you go .
Even if someone with half a brain notices and complains , there will be no ramifications .
Remember , it is not election “ fraud ” if you screw up a flyer for your own candidate .
If all you liberals out there are too stupid to know that Election Day is , then it is not my problem .
That is right , Democrats , in case no one has mentioned it yet , you are expected to get out there and do your civic duty .
See you at the polls on the eighth of November , I hope !
Urban areas are traditionally strongholds of the left , since they enjoy things such as drugs and prostitution .
Aside from using the fake signs , another way to help keep down the vote in an urban area is to put up flyers offering " free chicken and a forty " with directions leading people away from polling places .
Remember , nothing we can do is wrong ; we are the Party of God !
God helps those who help themselves to the spoils of political victory .
If we let the Democrats win , then all is lost .
You will be subjected to depravity the likes of which the world has never seen .
Death squads will be seen as a blessed relief by the time the sodomy squads , abortion squads , and Chomsky squads have had their way with you .
Your children will be sent to “ Evolution Schools ” where all knowledge of the Bible and of God will be drummed out of their heads .
Your job will be taken away , and given to someone who will tell you to “ cleen ooot you desk , mang , ees meen now , mang ” , and you will have no choice but to comply .
“ Vote for Pedro ” shirts will no longer be a humorous item .
Hippies will be allowed to eat in any restaurant they want , and they might even be able to share drinking fountains with us !
We must not allow this to come to pass .
Get out there and suppress that vote , Christian Soldiers .
There is only so much that Diebold and our other friends can do .
The rest is up to us , and God .
OpenID announced the release of a new draft of OpenID Authentication 2.0 today .
I ’m reluctantly forced to come to the conclusion that the OpenID people do n’t care about phishing , since they ’ve defined a standard that has to be the worst I ’ve ever seen from a phishing point of view .
OK , so what ’s the problem ?
If I ’m a phisher my goal is to be able to log in to some website , the Real Website , as you , the Innocent Victim .
In order to do this , I persuade you to go to a website I control that looks like the Real Website .
When you log in , thinking it is the Real Website , I get your username and password , and I can then proceed to empty your Paypal account , write myself cheques from your bank account , or whatever fiendish plan I have today .
So , why does OpenID make this worse ?
Because in the standard case , I ( the phisher ) have to make my website look like the Real Website and persuade you to go to it somehow – i.e. con you into thinking I am the real Paypal , and your account really has been frozen ( or is that phrozen ? ) and you really do need to log in to unphreeze it .
But in the OpenID case I just persuade you to go anywhere at all , say my lovely site of kitten photos , and get you to log in using your OpenID .
Following the protocol , I find out where your provider is ( i.e. the site you log in to to prove you really own that OpenID ) , but instead of sending you there ( because , yes , OpenID works by having the site you ’re logging in to send you to your provider ) I send you to my fake provider , which then just proxies the real provider , stealing your login as it does .
I do n’t have to persuade you that I ’m anything special , just someone who wants you to use OpenID , as the designers hope will become commonplace , and I do n’t have to know your provider in advance .
So , I can steal login credentials on a massive basis without any tailoring or pretence at all !
All I need is good photos of kittens .
I had hoped that by constantly bringing this up the OpenID people might take some step to deal with the issue , but they continue to insist on punting on it entirely :
The manner in which the end user authenticates to their OP [ OpenID provider ] and any policies surrounding such authentication is out of scope for this document .
which means , in practice , people will authenticate using passwords in forms , as usual .
Which means , in turn , that phishing will be trivial .

Ultra - hard materials are used for everything from drills that bore for oil and build new roads to scratch - resistant coatings for precision instruments and the face of your watch .
UCLA scientists are now reporting a promising new approach to designing super - hard materials , which are very difficult to scratch or crack .
Their findings appear in the April 20 issue of the journal Science .
Diamond is the hardest material known , because its carbon atoms form very short covalent bonds , according to co-author Richard B. Kaner , UCLA professor of inorganic chemistry and materials science and engineering .
Most of the diamond used in the world is actually synthetic and very expensive .
Diamond powder is used for oil drills and machines that build roads and cut holes in mountains .
Diamond cannot be used , however , to cut steel without ruining the diamond blade .
Cubic boron nitride is a diamond substitute used to cut steel ; it is made synthetically under very high - temperature , high - pressure conditions , and is even more expensive than diamond , Kaner said .
There are two ways to make super - hard materials that are " ultra - incompressible , " meaning they are resistant to shape deformation , which is a necessary condition for hardness :
One is to imitate diamond by using carbon and combining it with boron or nitrogen to maintain short bonds ; the other is to look for metals that are already incompressible and try to make them hard , said Kaner .
He and his colleagues are developing the second approach .
" Our idea is to combine an incompressible metal , which happens to be soft , with short covalent bonds to make it hard , " said Kaner , who is a member of the California NanoSystems Institute ( CNSI ) at UCLA , which encourages cross-disciplinary collaboration to solve problems in nanoscience and nanotechnology .
In 2005 , Kaner 's research team combined the relatively soft element osmium , the most incompressible metal known , with small covalent - bond forming atoms to make a material that is almost as incompressible as diamond , yet is so hard that it scratches sapphire , which is ranked 9 on a hardness scale of 1 to 10 ) .
" We found that if we combine boron with osmium , we push the osmium atoms apart by only 10 percent from where they were in osmium metal , which is very good ; you want to push them apart as little as possible , " Kaner said .
" Then we searched through the transition metals to see if we could do better than osmium , to get an expansion of less than 10 percent .
The only metal we could find that had the potential for doing this is rhenium ; hence , we made rhenium diboride .
Rhenium is a fairly dense , soft metal , which is next to osmium on the periodic table of chemical elements .
" We formed short covalent bonds , pushing the rheniums apart by just 5 percent from where they were in rhenium metal , making it both incompressible and very hard .
The rhenium - rhenium distance expanded by only 5 percent from the metal — that 's the key to this Science paper .
Rhenium diboride is as incompressible as diamond in one direction , and in the other direction , just slightly more compressible . "
At low applied forces , the hardness of rhenium diboride is equivalent to cubic boron nitride , the second - hardest material known , Kaner said .
At higher applied forces , rhenium diboride is a little bit below that .
" Our material is hard enough to scratch diamond , and much harder than osmium diboride , " he said .
While other super - hard materials , including diamond and cubic boron nitride , are made under expensive , high - pressure conditions , " our material is made in a simple process without applying pressure , " Kaner said .
Speaking of the collaboration , Kaner said , " The reason I came to UCLA , and a reason I love this place , is because whatever you do — in my own case , whenever you make a new material — you often need equipment and expertise that you do n't have .
At UCLA , there will be an expert in that area who has the equipment , and every time I 've asked , everybody is happy to help you do experiments and excited to collaborate with you . "
Despite the potential of new super - hard materials , they are not likely to replace diamond any time soon , Kaner said .

This petition is to make certain that the celebutant Paris Hilton is held accountable for driving on suspended license while on probation .
She was caught , signed a waiver about her actions and now claim innocence .
It \'s a crime to allow her to walk away after all of her actions .
It is a crime to allow celebrity as an all access pass to do whatever you please , whenever you want .
Paris Hilton has a responsibility to American public and allowing her to walk away from her crimes , we are telling American culture , moreover TEEN AMERICAN CULTURE , that driving while intoxicated , driving while on suspended license would carry no consequences , that laws are not something that we should concern ourselves with .
Laws are not trivial things to be tossed aside when they do n\'t suit our needs for that day .
Paris\ 's lack of social awareness and concern over the consequences of the law should allow her to become a symbol of what happens when celebrity breaks the law .
Hilton serving time in jail will offer more to the general youth of America than most effort by organized social networks like M.A.D.D..
We the undersigned , implore you , Gov. Schwarzenegger , to dismiss the petition to allow Paris Hilton to be pardoned for her actions .

In April 2003 , 21 - year old Tom Hurndall was shot in the head in Gaza by an Israeli soldier as he tried to save the lives of three small children .
Nine months later , he died , having never recovered consciousness .
Emine Saner talks to his mother Jocelyn about her grief , her fight to make the Israeli army accountable for his death and the book she has written in his memory .
It is one of the poignancies of Tom Hurndall 's short life that he had gone to Gaza in search of a story , and ended up becoming it .
A 21 - year - old photography student at Manchester Metropolitan University , he went to Baghdad in February 2003 to photograph human shields , activists who were trying to protect ordinary Iraqis from the threat of Anglo - American attack .
While he was there he heard about Rachel Corrie , a 23 - year - old American peace activist with the International Solidarity Movement ( ISM ) , who had been protecting a Palestinian 's family 's house in Rafah , in the southern Gaza strip , when an Israeli bulldozer crushed her to death .
Tom went to Gaza to find out what had happened .
All that is clear from the book his mother , Jocelyn , has written about Tom 's life , and about his family 's battle to bring the Israeli army to account for killing him .
It 's not a political book , she stresses , though the anger , frustration and disappointment she feels towards the army , and the Israeli and British governments , is obvious .
Tom was in Rafah , in the Israeli - occupied Gaza strip , on April 11 , at an ISM demonstration .
Suddenly low shots were fired from an Israeli army watchtower in the direction of children playing on a mound of rubble .
Most of them ran - but three froze .
Tom , wearing a bright orange ISM jacket , ran to help them .
He scooped up a boy and carried him to safety .
He ran back for the two girls , bent down to put his arm round one of them and was shot in the head .
Jocelyn was at work , at a school in London where she was head of learning support , when she got a call from her daughter Sophie saying that Tom had been shot .
It was the last day of the spring term .
She calmly finished photocopying a report she had been working on and distributed it into pigeonholes , before setting off for home .
It was as if she was trying to put off discovering the full horror of the story .
" I think you do anything to delay the moment of impact , " she says in the bright sitting room of her north London home .
After nearly two months by his hospital bedside in Israel , the family - Hurndall , her former husband , Anthony , and their children Sophie , Billy and Fred - were allowed to bring Tom back to the UK .
The brain injury had left him in a coma ; his main organs working , but nothing else .
Did she accept that Tom would die from the start ?
" I think I knew , " she says .
" The pressure in Tom 's head had damaged other parts of his brain .
I knew he would never recover . "
Tom eventually died nine months later on January 13 2004 - Jocelyn's birthday - in hospital in London .
Was it a relief , in a way ?
" It was , because he was n't in pain any more , " says Hurndall .
" But it was also impossible when he died . "
She is silent for a long time .
" I still have n't accepted it . "
Hurndall is softly spoken with gentle , pale blue eyes .
She seems fragile but with an intense strength .
She 's a battler but seems surprised by it .
She tells of the time she met Tony Blair at a dinner .
" I remember saying to him , ' You 've hurt me ' .
I could n't imagine saying that to anybody five years ago . "
She laughs at this .
" This middle - class mother coming out with these strident things . "
Tom 's death has changed her .
" You develop this language when there 's this anger .
I 'm not usually a strident person , I 've never needed to be . "
Her book is called Defy the Stars , words Tom had tattooed on his wrist .
They come from Romeo's cry " Then I defy you , stars ! " in Romeo and Juliet , and seemed to say a lot about his attitude to life .
Hurndall says she finds herself carrying her book around the house , " because it 's what 's left of Tom .
It 's my gift to Tom , it 's my gift from Tom . "
Apart from the anger and the love and the pain , one of the strongest senses in the book is that of discovering Tom , as his mother has since his death .
She read his journals and pored over his photographs .
Tom was young and idealistic , but he also knew how dangerous it would be to go to Iraq and Gaza .
" He was very mature in many senses , " says Hurndall .
" He was aware of the risks , but his desire to see and question and be curious was greater .
People are surprised to read that Tom considered the possibility of being shot .
I gulp when I read it , but I understand that of course he would consider it .
If you 're there , it 's on your mind all the time . "
She did n't want him to go to Baghdad but she knew she could n't stop him .
" I could n't condone it .
I felt angry with Tom and a terrible worry that weighed me down and affected me every minute he was away .
I was numb , anaesthetised , blank .
I kept expecting him to come home .
I think he would have left Rafah within 48 hours of his final entry in his journal . "
His final entry was on the morning of the day he was shot .
From the beginning , the Hurndalls worried that there could be a cover - up .
The first news reports , heard by an Israeli friend on the radio station Kol - Israel , said a man wearing military fatigues had been shooting at a watchtower .
" Even days later no one from the Israeli army or Israeli government had been in touch with us , " says Hurndall .
" So that in itself spoke volumes .
We really felt this draught of silence . "
At the hospital , one doctor suggested that Tom 's head injury " was commensurate with a blow from a baseball bat " , even though on his notes it clearly said " gunshot wound " , with an entry point and exit point - as though someone was suggesting that the injury had been caused at close range and so not from the watchtower .
The Palestinians , meanwhile , held Tom up as a hero .
Hurndall received a letter from Yasser Arafat praising her son .
" I do understand something of the mentality of the need to make Tom an icon , a martyr , " she says .
" Having seen the level of Palestinian desperation myself , you would grasp at people who seemingly have taken up your cause and suffered because of it , and you idolise them because they represent hope . "
It was shortly after seeing Tom in hospital for the first time that she took her first trip into Rafah .
" I remember the faces of the women and the men and the grandfathers , which spoke of such a worn kind of loss .
Life was very , very hard .
I definitely had a feeling that they were thinking , ' Here 's this shocked western family .
Do they know that this happens to us every day and we live under the threat of it happening every minute ? '
I remember really wanting to find a way of saying ' I understand ' . "
Tom 's father , Anthony , a lawyer , set about collecting witness statements and writing his own report into his son's death , an attempt to get the Israeli army to accept accountability .
It was intensely frustrating .
The report the Israeli army produced was amateurish , the incident itself reduced to simplistic scenarios including the idea that Tom was hit by a Palestinian gunman , or that he was even the gunman himself .
Little of what they said tallied with the many witness statements that Anthony had collected .
The map they produced to show where it had happened was out of date , and they had got the location of where Tom had been shot wrong .
The Israeli army said they had fired a single shot ; witnesses stated there had been at least five shots , maybe as many as eight .
The Hurndalls ' requests for a meeting with Israeli officials went unanswered until , on the day they were due to fly Tom home , they were granted a meeting at the ministry of foreign affairs .
Major Biton , the Israeli soldier in charge of the inquiry , insisted that the army could n't have seen
Tom from the watchtower , saying buildings were in the way of the window where the soldier was standing .
Anthony calmly pointed out that there was a surveillance platform on the top of the tower , and that visibility would have been perfect .
When he asked for CCTV footage to prove it , he was told there was no footage , although a camera could clearly be seen on the photographs of the tower Tom had taken .
Anthony raised the shootings of two young Palestinian men who had been shot within 48 hours of Tom 's shooting , in the same area .
" It was clear that Anthony had mentioned the unmentionable , " writes Hurndall .
" The shooting of a young Englishman was one thing , but to mention the shooting of young Palestinians was quite another . "
The Israeli government eventually sent a cheque to pay for the repatriation ( though it covered only a fraction of the cost ) , but they did not admit liability .
The cheque , for £ 8,370 , bounced .
Compensation and damages are still an issue .
When the Hurndalls met Rachel Corrie 's parents , their experience was painfully familiar .
The Corries said the doctor who did the autopsy had claimed that her death had been caused by tripping over , though as her father pointed out , " I would like to ask the doctor how many times he 's seen somebody with broken ribs , breaks in her spinal column , crushed shoulder blades and cut lungs just from tripping . "
The British government was n't much help .
Despite assertions that it had " repeatedly pressed the Israeli government for a full and transparent inquiry " , the Hurndalls felt this was hollow .
When the Hurndalls met Jack Straw , the then foreign secretary , they found him remote and cold .
Blair never publicly condemned the shooting .
On top of all this , she received anonymous phone calls and letters calling her a " Nazi- lover " for questioning the Israeli authorities .
With a son in hospital wasting away , and three grieving children at home , how did she cope ?
" I do n't think I did .
I made sure there was food in the fridge and I did n't crack up .
As a mother , you 're used to getting in there if there 's a problem and suddenly I could n't get in there .
Suddenly motherhood seemed distanced and that is terrible .
Grief is such that you do have to do it on your own .
The only way that I could grieve for Tom was to uncover who he was and to think about my relationship with him .
And to untangle this complex bundle of tragedy . "
The fight still is n't over .
Taysir Walid Heib , a soldier in the Israeli army , was put on trial for shooting Tom , and it was unbearable .
A medical witness called by the Israeli army suggested that Tom 's death had nothing to do with the shooting and had been a result of negligence by the British hospital .
He even implied that the family had been complicit in Tom 's death .
Another medical witness agreed - he claimed Tom 's death had not been caused by pneumonia , but by an overdose of morphine and that this was the fault of British doctors .
It was so ludicrous that it strengthened the prosecution .
In June 2005 , Taysir , a Bedouin sergeant , was convicted of manslaughter and , in August , was sentenced to eight years , the longest sentence an Israeli soldier has been given for killing a civilian since the start of the second intifada .
" It was limited justice , " says Hurndall .
" He did break the so - called rules of engagement .
On the other hand , he was in a culture where there are very loose rules of engagement and their senior commanders turn a blind eye . "
An Arab , Taysir could neither read nor write Hebrew , and had a learning disability .
Although the Bedouins are marginalised in Israel , some do volunteer for the army , although they tend to be sent to the most dangerous zones and career progression is rare .
" I was convinced that Tom was the victim of a victim , " Hurndall writes .
" That it was the policy - makers who had put Taysir in this position , who should be on trial . "
The family are hoping there will be further arrests up the chain of command and they have yet to receive a public apology .
But is it getting easier ?
" It is less mad , less chaotic , less muddled .
There are fewer distractions .
It feels like coming to the edge of a cliff .
I went to Fred 's school to watch him playing football and I was in heaven .
I do n't mean because Tom had been at the same school and also played football in the same way , had the same long legs .
I mean that I 've come to value those moments so much more .
What happened really put a focus on every minute of life , so in some ways it has made our lives more vibrant .
It seems terrible that it has taken that .
But life matters even more than it did " .
Whether you want to optimise your nutrition during exam season or stay sharp in your next work meeting , paying attention to your diet can really pay off .
Although there ’s no single ‘ brain food ’ to protect against age - related disorders such as Alzheimer ’s or dementia , thinking carefully about what you eat gives you the best chance of getting the nutrients you need for cognitive health and mood .

Eating a healthy , balanced diet that includes these 10 everyday brain - boosting foods may help to keep your memory , concentration and focus as sharp as can be .
1. Wholegrains
May improve concentration and focus
Like everything else in your body , the brain cannot work without energy .
The ability to concentrate and focus comes from an adequate , steady supply of energy ( in the form of glucose ) in our blood , to the brain .
Achieve this by choosing wholegrains which have a low - GI , which means they release their energy slowly into the bloodstream , keeping you mentally alert throughout the day .
Eating too few healthy carbs , like wholegrains , may lead to brain fog and irritability .
Opt for ‘ brown ’ wholegrain cereals , granary bread , rice and pasta .
Find our favourite healthy pasta and healthy rice recipes .
2. Oily fish
May promote healthy brain function
Essential fatty acids ( EFAs ) ca n’t be made by the body which means they must be obtained through food .
The most effective omega - 3 fats occur naturally in oily fish in the form of EPA and DHA .
Good plant sources include flaxseed , soya beans , pumpkin seeds , walnuts and their oils .
These fats are important for healthy brain function , the heart , joints and our general well - being .
Although studies are at an early stage there is some suggestion that adequate amounts of omega - 3 fats in your diet may help to relieve depression .
What makes oily fish so good is that they contain these active fats in a ready - made form , which means the body can use it easily .
The main sources of oily fish include salmon , trout , mackerel , herring , sardines , pilchards and kippers .
Low DHA levels may be linked to an increased risk of dementia , Alzheimer ’s disease and memory loss , whilst having sufficient levels of both EPA and DHA is thought to help us manage stress and make the good mood brain chemical , serotonin .
If you ’re vegetarian or vegan , you may wish to add seeds like flaxseed , hemp and chia to your diet , or consider a plant - based omega - 3 supplement from micro-algae .
If you are considering taking a supplement speak to your GP first .
It ’s worth remembering that vegetarian or vegan mums - to - be , or those who are breastfeeding , should consider a supplement because of the important role omega - 3 fats play in the development of the central nervous system of your baby .

3. Blueberries
May boost short - term memory
Evidence accumulated at Tufts University in the United States suggests that the consumption of blueberries may be effective in improving or delaying short - term memory loss .
They ’re widely available , but you can also achieve the same effect with other dark red and purple fruits , like blackberries , and veg , like red cabbage .
These contain the same protective compounds called anthocyanins .
Read more about the health benefits of blueberries .
4. Tomatoes
May prevent free radical damage
There is good evidence to suggest that lycopene , a powerful antioxidant found in tomatoes , could help protect against the kind of free radical damage to cells that occurs in the development of dementia , particularly Alzheimer’s .
Favour cooked tomatoes and enjoy with a little olive oil to optimise your body ’s absorption and use .
Other foods supplying this , and similar protective phyto - nutrients , include papaya , watermelon and pink grapefruit .

5. Eggs
May delay brain shrinkage
Certain B vitamins – B6 , B12 and folic acid – are known to reduce levels of a compound called homocysteine in the blood .
Elevated levels of homocysteine are associated with increased risk of stroke , cognitive impairment and Alzheimer ’s disease .
A study of a group of elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment found that after two years of intervention with high doses of B6 , B12 and folic acid there was significantly less brain shrinkage compared to a subset given placebo treatment .
Other B vitamins including vitamins B1 , B3 and choline play an important part in regulating normal brain function .
Choline , which is rich in egg yolk , is essential for the memory - boosting brain chemical , acetylcholine .
Opt for B - rich foods like eggs , chicken , fish , leafy greens and dairy .
If you ’re vegan , look to fortified foods , including plant milks and breakfast cereals , for vitamin B12 or consider a supplement .
Other useful vegan sources of B vitamins , including B6 , include nutritional yeast , avocado , soya , nuts and seeds .
Learn more about vitamin B12 , and discover the health benefits of eggs .
6. Blackcurrants
May reduce anxiety and stress
Vitamin C has long been thought to have the power to increase mental agility , and some research suggests that a deficiency may be a risk factor for age - related brain degeneration including dementia and Alzheimer ’s .
Furthermore , interesting studies demonstrate that vitamin C may be useful in managing anxiety and stress .
One of the best sources of this vital vitamin are blackcurrants .
Others include red peppers , citrus fruits such as oranges and broccoli .
Discover more about why we need vitamins .
7. Pumpkin seeds
May enhance memory and boost mood
Richer in zinc than many other seeds , pumpkin seeds supply this valuable mineral which is vital for enhancing memory and thinking skills .
They ’re also full of stress - busting magnesium , B vitamins and tryptophan , the precursor to the good mood chemical serotonin .
Other useful food sources include beef , oysters , chickpeas and nuts including cashews and almonds .
Read more about the health benefits of pumpkin seeds .
8. Broccoli
May improve brainpower
Broccoli is great source of vitamin K , which is known to enhance cognitive function and improve brainpower .
Researchers have reported that because broccoli is high in compounds called glucosinolates , it can slow the breakdown of the neurotransmitter , acetylcholine , which we need for the central nervous system to perform properly and keep our brains and memories sharp .
Low levels of acetylcholine are associated with Alzheimer ’s .
Other cruciferous veg rich in glucosinolates include cauliflower , kale , cabbage and Brussels sprouts , whilst you can obtain vitamin K from liver , hard cheeses and prunes .
Discover more about the health benefits of broccoli .
9. Sage
May boost memory and concentration
Sage has long had a reputation for improving memory and concentration .
Although most studies focus on sage as an essential oil , it could be worth adding fresh sage to your diet too .
Add at the end of cooking to protect the beneficial oils .
Put sage to good use in our healthy recipes , including butternut soup with crispy sage , pearl barley & sage risotto and veal escalopes wrapped with proscuitto , sage & lemon .
10 . Nuts
May help protect healthy brain function
A study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology suggests that an adequate intake of vitamin E might help to prevent cognitive decline , particularly in the elderly .
Nuts are a great source of vitamin E along with leafy green vegetables , asparagus , olives , seeds , eggs , brown rice and wholegrains .
Learn more about the health benefits of nuts .
The importance of exercise
Do n’t forget that as well as a healthy diet , exercise helps to keep our brains sharp .
Research suggests that regular exercise improves cognitive function , slows down the mental aging process and helps us process information more effectively .
Get inspired with our guides to how to workout at home and how to exercise for free .
Brainpower supplements
Although research linking diet and dementia is still in its infancy , there are a few important relationships between nutrients and brain health that are worth exploring .
Having a nourishing , well rounded diet gives our brain the best chance of avoiding disease .
If your diet is unbalanced for whatever reason , you may want to consider a multivitamin and mineral complex and an omega - 3 fatty acid supplement to help make up a few of the essentials .
If you are considering taking a supplement it is best to discuss this with your GP or qualified healthcare professional .

In 2003 , I said that the only time you ’d ever find me running was if Godzilla were chasing me .
Then , a year later , I ran a trail marathon in November 2004 .
Marathons are officially 26.2 miles .
Since that point , I ’ve falling quite off that wagon , due to work pressures , and some lifestyle changes , and I could n’t run a single mile in a row .
However , that ’s about to change .
How does a fat guy get fit enough to run ?
Are you thinking of taking up running ?
Here ’s some advice :
Trails versus Street
First , a word about trail running .
Trails are softer which gives two immediate results .
One , your knees thank you for less painful impact .
Two , because trails are less solid than streets , you end up running slower than your maximum potential .
This is great from my perspective , because I have a habit of overdoing it .
I want the slowdown .
The Right Shoes
Advertising
It ’s really important to us proper footwear .
I learned firsthand all the crazy things that can go wrong .
I will throw out there , however , that barefoot running is a really small niche interest right now , and I ’ve tried it on beaches and on safe trails , and I loved it .
Every one is different and there are all kinds of articles out there for selecting shoes .
Just know that you need new shoes , you need them to be really well fit for your needs ( for instance , you take a larger shoe size for running than you do for casual wear ) , and that you need the right kind of support for the way your feet land .
Google around for this , or email me .
I ’ll help you further , if you ’d like .
Run / Walk Programs
When I had my first running breakthrough , it was this : you are still a runner if you have to slow down and walk for a bit .
John Bingham ’s great book , NO NEED FOR SPEED , was an excellent resource for me in learning how to run .
All of John ’s products are great that way , and “ The Penguin , ” as he likes to call himself , is a wealth of knowledge unto himself .
Standard Disclaimer : see your physician before trying this or any other program .
This is just for informational use and does n’t constitute something worth doing .
Worked for me .

Here ’s a sample of a run / walk program that I mentioned to a friend the other day .
The “ R ” stands for running , and the “ W ” stands for walking .
The number is for how many minutes of each one might do .
I do this in multiples of 30 minutes for the first few weeks .
As time progresses , I consider adding more minutes ( maybe another cycle of the run / walk program ) into the mix .
The basic premise is to slowly build yourself up to running more and walking less .
Each line represents a week of training :
Warm up by walking briskly for 2 minutes , maybe 3 .
Then , start this :
1R , 4W x 6 times .
Week 1
1R , 3W x 7 times .
Week 2
2R , 3W x 6 times .
Week 3
2R , 2W x 7 times .
Week 4

FULL Running for 30 minutes .
If you have to skip a running minute or two early on , do so .
Just walk briskly and catch your breath .
Do n’t be religious about this .
Make it work for you .
How FAST ?
When I ’m saying running , this is basically a step above brisk walking .
Think of it as a controlled shuffle .
Focus on turning your feet over quickly , and not running fast .
Just keep thinking about turning your feet over , which should be slightly longer strides than if your shoes were tied together , but not big huge gaping stretches .
With a run / walk program , the trick is to keep the “ difference ” between the running and the walking down to a minimum , so when you ’re walking and catching your breath a bit , make sure that ’s still a brisk walk .

Do n’t worry about speed .
Get your distance and your duration up .
Then , speed will come out of your endurance and your toning .
Mileage versus Minutes
I ’m a bigger fan of minutes versus miles , but as you get faster and better , and more confident in your running , you might switch .
The best thing to realize is : unless you ’re trying out for a world - class team , there is no official right or wrong way to do it , only strong suggestions and passionate people on either side of every possible schism one could experience .
This is how * I * did it the first time , and how I plan to do it next .
Hydration , Eating
First , get a lexan water bottle .
The famous brand name is Nalgene .
They are recycling number 7 , in case you ’re being offered a ripoff .
In the US , they cost around $ 7 on the low end .
But why ?
Because those bottles handle bacteria way better than when you re-use your disposable water bottles , and they ’re nicer on the environment .
Having them around makes you want to drink more .
And other hacks I have n’t considered .
Advertising
A note about eating : do so a half hour or so before you run .
An hour ’s best , but fit it into your schedule .
What ’s good to eat ( and NOT good to eat ) before a run ?
High carbs and low glycemic index food , like energy bars ( CLIF Bar is my personal favorite ) , Oatmeal is easy , even the instant kind .
What NOT to have are things high in fats , like sausage .
Peanut butter is usually a great energy food , but keep it to maybe 1 table spoon along with a slice of multigrain bread .
The point is , it ’s important to have energy in the tank .
The more you have ready for your run , the better you ’ll feel while trying to run .
Your Advice
I ’m open to your advice .
One thing that ’s certain about things like running : you ’ll get about 50 /50 responses to the above where some will say , “ This is full of crap ” or “ that ’s not running , that ’s jogging ” or whatever .
You know what ?
YOU are the person qualified to tell whether advice works for you .
If it ’s running to you , it ’s running to me .
But what else will you add ?
I ’m looking for tips before I get out all the lead and start running this week .

He ’s looking for more subscribers .
Do n’t make him beg .
Robert Rapier suggested that we debate this topic , and I agreed .
In reality , there are only shades of gray difference between us regarding the timing of Peak Oil and Peak Exports .
I believe that the crisis has hit , while Robert believes that the worst wo n't be upon us until some time shortly after 2010 .
Robert will file his rejoinder about a week from today .
Resolved : World Net Oil Export Capacity is Now Declining Because of Involuntary Reductions in Production and / or Because of Increases in Domestic Consumption in Major Oil Exporting Countries
In any case , in a guest post on The Oil Drum ( TOD ) in January 2006 , I predicted , based on graphs primarily done by Khebab that the world would see declining net oil exports this year .
I focused on the top three net oil exporters -- Saudi Arabia ( KSA ) ; Russia and Norway -- which together accounted for 48 % of the ( total liquids ) exports by the top net oil exporters in 2004 ( all production data based on EIA numbers , unless noted otherwise ) .
Top exporters are defined as those exporting one mbpd or more .
In his most recent book , " Beyond Oil : The View from Hubbert 's Peak , " Kenneth Deffeyes outlined a simplified version of the mathematical techniques that M. King Hubbert used to accurately pick the time frame for the peak of Lower 48 oil production .
The method , named " Hubbert Linearization " ( HL ) by Stuart Staniford on TOD , is outlined in the article " Texas and US Lower 48 oil production as a model for Saudi Arabia and the World " .
Deffeyes defines Q t as a mathematical estimate of the ultimate recoverable reserves for a region .
Regions tend to peak , and start declining when they are about 50 % depleted , i.e. , the 50 % of Q t mark .
The following regions have now shown lower production after crossing the 50 % of Q t mark : Texas ; Lower 48 ; Total US ( which had a secondary , but still lower peak , after the North Slope production came on line ) ; Russia ; North Sea ; KSA and Mexico .
In the January article , I outlined my " Export Land " model , which was inspired by work done earlier by Matt Simmons .
I stipulated that we had a country producing 20 mbpd and consuming 10 mbpd .
I then stipulated Export Land hits the 50 % of Q t mark , and over a five year period , production declines by 25 % and consumption increases by 20 % .
Because of these two factors -- falling production and rising domestic consumption -- the net oil exports from out hypothetical exporter decline by 70 % , from 10 mbpd to 3 mbpd .
Note that the underlying assumption , which I think is generally true , is that domestic demand is generally satisfied before oil is exported .
We have a real life example of the Export Land model in the UK , which has gone from exporting one mbpd in 1999 to being a net importer in 2005 .
Also note that I expect domestic consumption in the exporting countries to go up quite rapidly , at least initially , as oil prices rise faster than their production is falling .
What I found deeply troubling in January was that the top three net oil exporters were all past their respective 50 % of Q t marks .
In January , KSA was showing stable production , Russia was showing a slow rate of growth and Norway was in decline .
I predicted , based on the HL method and based on the Export Land model , that we would see lower exports from these three countries in 2006 .
2006 Data
The EIA has now released a table showing the estimated production and exports from the top net exporters for 2005 ( again all total liquids ) , and the data are very interesting , since we can compare the 2005 production , consumption and exports for various countries to the 2004 numbers .
KSA , Russia and Norway collectively have shown a 13 % increase in domestic consumption from 2004 to 2005 .
Even Norway , which I expected to be flat , showed an 11 % increase in consumption .
It appears that the only readily available current production data are for crude + condensate ( C+C ) , but the EIA shows that these three countries are down , in September , 2006 by 3.7 % from their December , 2005 production levels ( KSA and Norway are down ; Russia is basically flat ) .
These data are subject to revision , but Khebab has demonstrated that the revisions tend to be downward with time .
In any case , if we assume that Total Liquids behave similarly to C+C , and if we use the same rate of increase in domestic consumption as 2004 to 2005 ( which may be conservative given the rapidly escalating demand in KSA and Russia ) , this suggests that the top three net oil exporters are experiencing about an 8 % decline ( 1.5 mbpd ) in net oil exports in 2006 versus 2005 ( based on data through September , 2006 ) .
The EIA tracks C+C for 11 of the other 12 largest exporters .
Their combined C+C production is up just barely ( by 0.6 % or 0.16 mbpd ) from 12/05 to 9/06 , which almost certainly translates to a decline in net exports , given the increasing consumption in most exporting countries .
Saudi Arabia :
Why is their production falling ?
No one , as far as I know , now disputes that KSA 's production is falling .
The question is why .
KSA is now at about the same stage of depletion that the prior swing producer , Texas , started declining .
In the spring , the Saudis announced that they could not find buyers for all of their oil , " Even their light , sweet oil , " when light , sweet oil was going for about $ 70 per barrel in the US .
At the same time that the Saudis were announcing that they could not find buyers for all of their oil , and that they were " voluntarily " reducing their production , they were vastly expanding their drilling program .
Their largest field , Ghawar , which at one time accounted for more than 50 % of their production , is now at about the same stage of depletion that an analogue field , Yibal , started declining .
The best case for Ghawar is that they are producing one - third water , after the field was redeveloped with horizontal wells .
At the same time that the Saudis announced their " voluntary " production cutbacks in the spring , their stock market started crashing .
Interesting enough , Venezuela , which has long life unconventional oil reserves , has a booming stock market .
In my opinion , Saudi Arabia , like Texas in 1973 , is at the start of a long term and irreversible decline in conventional oil production , with a long - term decline rate in the 4 % to 5 % range , perhaps sharper at first if Ghawar is crashing .
Russia :
What next ?
Mathematically , Khebab has demonstrated that the recent rebound in Russian production was just making up for what was not produced following the collapse of the Soviet Union .
In my opinion , Russia will join Saudi Arabia in showing a long term and irreversible decline in conventional oil production next year .
The " Bidding Cycle " Theory
Given the reports of lower production by the top three exporters , and one can assume increased consumption , someone must be conserving .
The Wall Street Journal recently ran a story , which profiled an African country , Guinea , which has been forced to conserve , " As fuel prices soar , a country unravels . "
An excerpt from the article :
" The impact of today 's energy crunch on the poor is plain in rich nations such as America : Expensive gasoline and soaring heating bills make a hard life harder .
In impoverished countries such as Guinea , where per capita income is just $ 370 a year and surging gasoline prices have helped spark bloody riots , the energy shock has become a matter of life and death . "
I believe that we are going to see rounds of bidding cycles with available exports going to the winning bidders , e.g. , the US so far this year , and with the losing bidders being forced to conserve , e.g. , Guinea so far this year .
However , I predict that the next round of bidding ( which I believe that we are currently in ) , against regions like Europe and China , instead of Africa , will be much tougher for the US .
The Expectation of an Infinite Exponential Growth Rate Versus
The Reality of Exponential Decline
Because of a steady increase in US petroleum consumption and because of a steady decline in US oil production , total US petroleum ( crude oil + product ) imports have been increasing at an annual rate of about 4 % per year since 2001 .
This is one reason that assertions that year over year US petroleum imports may be flat is not much of a comfort .
In most of the US , it is simply a given that the " American Way of Life " is non-negotiable and that we can continue to increase our petroleum imports year after year .
Unfortunately , I predict that Americans are going to realize that the reality of exponential decline is going to trump expectations of an infinite growth rate .
While there are many suggestions for alternative energy sources and for the expanded use of other fossil fuel sources and the expanded use of nuclear energy , the reality in my opinion , is that the Net Oil Export Crisis is hitting so hard and so fast that our only recourse is to effectively implement a triage operation , where large portions of American suburbia are effectively abandoned .
I do strongly support a proposal to tax energy consumption to fund Social Security and Medicare , offset by eliminating or reducing the Payroll Tax , combined with a major push to implement Alan Drake 's Proposal for Electrification of Transportation .
I am primarily supporting Alan 's proposal because he is advocating proven technology that we essentially perfected more than 100 years ago .
Furthermore , he documents how the Swiss were able to survive -- by electrifying their transportation system and by restricting oil supplies to emergency uses -- an oil supply cutoff in the Second World War .
The average American today uses about as much oil as 400 Swiss citizens used in the Second World War .
As President Bush throws himself into the final days of a particularly nasty campaign season , he ’s settled into a familiar pattern of ugly behavior .
Since he can’t defend the real world created by his policies and his decisions , Mr. Bush is inventing a fantasy world in which to campaign on phony issues against fake enemies .
In Mr. Bush ’s world , America is making real progress in Iraq .
In the real world , as Michael Gordon reported in yesterday ’s Times , the index that generals use to track developments shows an inexorable slide toward chaos .
In Mr. Bush ’s world , his administration is marching arm in arm with Iraqi officials committed to democracy and to staving off civil war .
In the real world , the prime minister of Iraq orders the removal of American checkpoints in Baghdad and abets the sectarian militias that are slicing and dicing their country .
In Mr. Bush ’s world , there are only two kinds of Americans : those who are against terrorism , and those who somehow are all right with it .
Some Americans want to win in Iraq and some do n’t .
There are Americans who support the troops and Americans who do n’t support the troops .
And at the root of it all is the hideously damaging fantasy that there is a gulf between Americans who love their country and those who question his leadership .
Mr. Bush has been pushing these divisive themes all over the nation , offering up the ludicrous notion the other day that if Democrats manage to control even one house of Congress , America will lose and the terrorists will win .
But he hit a particularly creepy low when he decided to distort a lame joke lamely delivered by Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts .
Mr. Kerry warned college students that the punishment for not learning your lessons was to “ get stuck in Iraq . ”
In context , it was obviously an attempt to disparage Mr. Bush ’s intelligence .
That ’s impolitic and impolite , but it ’s not as bad as Mr. Bush ’s response .
Knowing full well what Mr. Kerry meant , the president and his team cried out that the senator was disparaging the troops .
It was a depressing replay of the way the Bush campaign Swift - boated Americans in 2004 into believing that Mr. Kerry , who went to war , was a coward and Mr. Bush , who stayed home , was a hero .
There are two alternative versions of the Closures for Java specification : one with function types ( the functional version ) and one without ( the nominal version ) .
You have chosen to see Both versions the Functional version the Nominal version .
You can also Include the Rationale .
This revision of the closures proposal describes both the nominal and the functional versions of the proposed language specification , with a brief description of the differences between the two .
A new syntax is introduced for both function types and closure literals .
Function types are now defined as language - provided interface types , which simplifies much of the specification .
This revision also contains paragraphs in a smaller font , like this one , that briefly discuss the rationale for notable design decisions .
Closures for the Java Programming Language ( v0.3 )
Gilad Bracha , Neal Gafter , James Gosling , Peter von der Ahé
Modern programming languages provide a mixture of primitives for composing programs .
Most notably , Ruby , Scala , Smalltalk , and Simula have direct language support for delayed - execution blocks of code , called closures .
Closures provide a natural way to express some kinds of abstractions that are currently quite awkward to express in Java .
For programming in the small , closures allow one to abstract an algorithm over a piece of code ; that is , they allow one to more easily extract the common parts of two almost - identical pieces of code .
For programming in the large , closures support APIs that express an algorithm abstracted over some computational aspect of the algorithm .
There are two alternative specifications : the nominal version includes closure literals but requires programmer - provided interfaces for their types while the functional version includes all of the features of the nominal version but also includes a syntax and semantics for function types , which act as special kinds of interfaces .
This document contains both the nominal and the functional versions of the specification .
Closure Literals
We introduce a syntactic form for constructing a closure value :
Primary : Closure Closure : { FormalParameterDecls opt => BlockStatements opt Expression opt }
A closure is converted to some object type at compile - time by a closure conversion .
In the nominal version of the specification , it is a compile - time error if a closure appears in a context where it is not subject to a closure conversion .
In the functional version of the specification , if a closure is not subject to a closure conversion it is converted to the corresponding function type of the closure , which is the function type with : identical argument types ; a return type that is the type of the final expression , if one exists , or java.lang .
Unreachable if the closure body cannot complete normally , or void otherwise ; and a throws type list corresponding to the checked exception types that can be thrown from the body of the closure .
The conversion , in either case , occurs entirely at compile - time .
Example : the following closure takes two integers and yields their sum : {int x , int y => x+y}
A closure captures a block of code - the block statements and the expression - parameterized by the closure 's formal parameters .
All free lexical bindings - that is , lexical bindings not defined within the closure - are bound at the time of evaluation of the closure expression to their meaning in the lexical context in which the closure expression appears .
Free lexical bindings include references to variables from enclosing scopes , and the meaning of this , break , continue , and return .
Evaluating the closure expression does not cause the statements or expression to be evaluated , but packages them up at runtime with a representation of the lexical context to be invoked later .
Rationale :
One purpose for closures is to allow a programmer to refactor common code into a shared utility , with the difference between the use sites being abstracted into a closure .
The code to be abstracted sometimes contains a break , continue , or return statement .
This need not be an obstacle to the transformation .
One implication of the specification is that a break or continue statement appearing within a closure may transfer to any matching enclosing statement .
A return statement always returns from the nearest enclosing method or constructor .
But a closure may outlive the target of control transfers appearing within it .
At runtime , if a break statement is executed that would transfer control out of a statement that is no longer executing , or is executing in another thread , the VM throws a new unchecked exception , UnmatchedNonlocalTransfer .
Similarly , an UnmatchedNonlocalTransfer is thrown when a continue statement attempts to complete a loop iteration that is not executing in the current thread .
Finally , an UnmatchedNonlocalTransfer is thrown when a return statement is executed if the method invocation to which the return statement would transfer control is not on the stack of the current thread .
Function Types
We introduce a syntactic form for a function type :
Type : FunctionType FunctionType : { Types opt => ResultType } FunctionThrows opt Types : Type
Type , Types ResultType : void
Type FunctionThrows : throws ThrowsTypeList ThrowsTypeList : Qualified Identifier
Qualified Identifier | ThrowsTypeList
Note : the existing syntax for the throws clause in a method declaration uses a comma to separate elements of the ThrowsTypeList .
For backward compatibility we continue to allow commas to separate these elements in methods and constructors , but in function types we require the use of the ' | ' ( vertical - bar ) character as a separator to resolve a true ambiguity that would arise when a function type is used in a type list .
It is sometimes useful to think of the thrown type as a disjunctive type as well , and this syntax is suggestive of that .
Informally , a function type describes the set of closures that accept a given list of argument types , result in a value of the given type , and may throw the indicated checked exception types .
Example : the following assigns to the local variable plus a function that computes the sum of its two int arguments : {int , int= > int} plus = { int x , int y => x+y } ;
A function type { T 0 ... T n =>
T r } throws E 0 | ... E m is an interface type with a single abstract method T r invoke( T 0 x 0 , ... T n x n ) throws E 0 , ... E m ; and the following subtyping relationship : A function type { T 0 ... T n =>
T r } throws E 0 | ... E m is a subtype of function type { U 0 ... U l =>
U r } throws X 0 | ... X k iff all of the following hold : Either T r is the same as U r or Both are reference types and T r is a subtype of U r ;
n is equal to l ;
for every i in 0..n , either T i and U i are the same types or both are reference types and U i is a subtype ofT i ; and
and U are the same types or both are reference types and U is a subtype ofT ; and for every j in 0 ..m , there exists an h in 0..k such that E j is a subtype of X h .
In English , these rules are Function types may have covariant returns ;
A subtype function must accept the same number of arguments as its supertype ;
Function types may have contravariant argument types ; and
The subtype function may not throw any checked exception type not declared in the supertype .
While the subtype rules for function types may at first glance appear arcane , they are defined this way for very good reason : this is the classical arrow rule , which has proven itself indispensible in languages that offer support for higher - order programming .
And while the rules seem complex , function types and their subtype relations can be understood as a straightforward application of generics and wildcards in the following possible ( note : not yet part of the specification ) translation scheme :
A function type is translated into an instantiation of a generic system - generated interface type that has a type parameter for each argument type and return type that is a reference type , and one additional type parameter for the exception signature .
This instantiation uses a covariant wildcard for the return type and contravariant wildcards for argument types , except when used in the context of a declared supertype or the type of a creation expression , in which case the types are used without wildcards , For example , in the variable declaration {int , String= >
Number}throws IOException xyzzy ; the variable declaration is translated into interface Closure1 < R, A2 , throws E> { // system - generated R invoke( int x1 , A2 x2 ) throws E ; } Closure1 <?
extends Number , ? super String , null > xyzzy ;
This is not the exact translation : all of the generated names would be synthetic , and we would expect the compiler , runtime system , and debuggers to display these types using the function syntax rather than in terms of the translation involving generics and wildcards .
But types constructed this way satisfy precisely the required subtype relations .
Because a function type is an interface type , it can be extended by a user - defined interface type and it can be implemented by a user - defined class type .
Closure Conversion
A closure may be assigned to a variable or parameter of any compatible interface type by the closure conversion :
There is a closure conversion from a closure to every interface type that has a single method m such that the closure is compatible with m .
A closure is compatible with a method m iff all of the following hold :
Either
The closure has no final expression and the method m has return type void ; or The closure has a final expression and there is an assignment conversion from its type to the return type of m ; or The body of the closure cannot complete normally .
m has the same number of arguments as the closure .
For each corresponding argument position in the argument lists , both argument types are the same .
Every exception type that can be thrown by the body of the closure is a subtype of some exception type in the throws clause of m .
If the target of the closure conversion extends the marker interface java.lang .
RestrictedClosure then
it is a compile - time error if the closure being converted contains a break , continue or return statement whose execution would result in a transfer of control outside the closure ; and
, or statement whose execution would result in a transfer of control outside the closure ; and it is a compile - time error if the closure being converted refers to a non-final local variable declared in an enclosing scope .
The closure conversion to a " restricted " interface type applies only to closures that obey the same restrictions that apply to local and anonymous classes .
The motivation for this is to help catch inadvertent use of non-local control flow in situations where it would be inappropriate .
Examples would be when the closure is passed to another thread to run asynchronously , or stored in a data structure to be invoked at a later time when the method invocation in which the closure originated no longer exists .
We expect to retrofit a number of existing JDK classes with this marker interface .
Example :
We can write a closure that adds two to its argument like this : interface IntFunction { int invoke ( int i ) ; } IntFunction plus2 = {int x => x+2} ; Alternatively , using function types we have {int= > int} plus2 = {int x => x+2} Executor framework to run a closure in the background : void sayHello( java.util.concurrent .Executor ex ) { ex.execute ({=> System.out.println ( " hello " ) ; } ) ; }
Exception type parameters
To support exception transparency , we add a new type of generic formal type argument to receive a set of thrown types .
[ This deserves a more formal treatment ]
What follows is an example of how the proposal would be used to write an exception - transparent version of a method that locks and then unlocks a java.util.concurrent .
Lock , before and after a user - provided block of code .
In the nominal version of the proposal :
interface Block < throws E> { void invoke ( ) throws E ; } public static < throws E extends Exception > void withLock ( Lock lock , Block < E > block ) throws E { lock .lock ( ) ; try { block .invoke( ) ; } finally { lock.unlock ( ) ; } }
Or using the functional version of the proposal :
public static < throws E extends Exception > void withLock ( Lock lock , {=> void} throws E block ) throws E { lock .lock ( ) ; try { block .invoke( ) ; } finally { lock.unlock ( ) ; } }
This can be used as follows :
withLock ( lock , {=> System.out.println ( " hello " ) ; } ) ;
This uses a newly introduced form of generic type parameter .
The type parameter E is declared to be used in throws clauses .
If the extends clause is omitted , a type parameter declared with the throws keyword is considered to extend Exception ( instead of Object , which is the default for other type parameters ) .
This type parameter accepts multiple exception types .
For example , if you invoke it with a block that can throw IOException or NumberFormatException the type parameter E would be IOException | NumberFormatException .
In those rare cases that you want to use explicit type parameters with multiple thrown types , the keyword throws is required in the invocation , like this :
Locks .< throws IOException|NumberFormatException>withLock( lock , {=> System.out.println ( " hello " ) ; } ) ;
You can think of this kind of type parameter accepting disjunction , " or " types .
That is to allow it to match the exception signature of a closure that throws any number of different checked exceptions .
If the block throws no exceptions , the type parameter would be the type null ( see below ) .
Type parameters declared this way can be used only in a throws clause or as a type argument to a generic method , interface , or class whose type argument was declared this way too .
We introduce a meaning for the keyword null as a type name ; it designates the type of the expression null .
A class literal for the type of null is null.class .
These are necessary to allow reflection , type inference , and closure literals to work for functions that result in the value null .
We also add the non-instantiable class java.lang .
Null as a placeholder , and its static member field TYPE as a synonym for null.class .
Definite assignment
The body of a closure may not assign to a final variable declared outside the closure .
A closure expression does not affect the DA / DU status of any free variables it names .
Free variables referenced inside a closure receive their initial DA value from the DA status of the variable at the point where the closure expression appears .
The type Unreachable
We add the non-instantiable type java.lang .
Unreachable , corresponding to the standard type - theoretic bottom .
Values of this type appear only at points in the program that are formally unreachable .
This is necessary to allow transparency for closures that do not return normally .
Unreachable is a subtype of every type ( even primitive types ) .
No other type is a subtype of Unreachable .
It is a compile - time error to convert null to Unreachable .
It is an error to cast to the type Unreachable .
Example :
The following illustrates a closure being assigned to a variable of the correct type .
interface NullaryFunction <T , throws E> { T invoke ( ) throws E ; } NullaryFunction < Unreachable , null > thrower = {=> throw new AssertionError ( ) ; } ;
Reachable statements
An expression statement in which the expression is of type Unreachable cannot complete normally .
The initial statement of a closure is reachable .
Control invocation syntax
A new invocation statement syntax is added to make closures convenient for control abstraction :
ControlInvocationStatement Primary ( Formals : ExpressionList opt )
Statement
Primary ( ExpressionList opt )
Statement
This syntax is a shorthand for the following statement :
Primary ( ExpressionList , { Formals => Statement } ) ;
This syntax makes some kinds of closure - receiving APIs more convenient to use to compose statements .
Note :
There is some question of the correct order in the rewriting .
On the one hand , the closure seems most natural in the last position when not using the abbreviated syntax .
On the other hand , that does n't work well with varargs methods .
Which is best remains an open issue .
We could use the shorthand to write our previous example this way
withLock ( lock ) { System.out.println ( " hello " ) ; }
Rationale :
This is not an expression form for a very good reason : it looks like a statement , and we expect it to be used most commonly as a statement for the purpose of writing APIs that abstract patterns of control .
If it were an expression form , an invocation like this would require a trailing semicolon after the close curly brace of a controlled block .
Forgetting the semicolon would probably be a common source of error .
The syntax is convenient for both synchronous ( e.g. see withLock ) and asynchronous ( e.g. see Executor.execute ) use cases .
Another example of its use would be a an API that closes a java.io .
Closeable after a user - supplied block of code :
class OneArgBlock <T , throws E> { void invoke( T t ) throws E ; } < T extends java.io.
Closeable , throws E > void closeAtEnd( OneArgBlock <? super T , E > block , T t ) throws E { try { block .invoke( ) ; } finally { try { t.close ( ) ; } catch ( IOException ex ) {} } }
Or using the functional version :
< T extends java.io.
Closeable , throws E > void closeAtEnd( {T=> void}throws
E block , T t ) throws E { try { block .invoke( ) ; } finally { try { t.close ( ) ; } catch ( IOException ex ) {} } }
We could use the shorthand with this API to close a number of streams at the end of a block of code :
closeAtEnd( FileReader in : makeReader ( ) ) closeAtEnd( FileWriter out : makeWriter ( ) ) { // code using in and out }
Type inference
The rules for type inference need to be augmented to accomodate the inference of exception type parameters .
Similarly , the new subtype relationships introduced by function types need to be reflected as well .
Future Directions
Specify the unmatched nonlocal transfer exception in more detail , including support for resuming them across threads .
Elided exception type parameters enable existing interfaces to be retrofitted for exception transparency .
Allow volatile on locals .
Abstractions for loops that work with break , continue ?

MEDIA companies have published numerous articles on global warming and greenhouse emissions in recent years .
Now , a couple of large publishers are starting to think about their own impact on the environment .
Time Inc. participated in a study published this year by the Heinz Center that calculated the amount of carbon dioxide emissions produced over the entire process of publishing Time and In Style .
Other magazine companies , including the Hearst Corporation , now say they are studying the Heinz report to consider the implications for their magazines , and Rupert Murdoch recently announced that the News Corporation is developing a plan to become entirely carbon neutral , meaning the company will reduce its carbon emissions and try to offset the emissions left over .

The particles first passed through a detector at the Fermilab
This is the first major finding of the US - based Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search ( Minos ) experiment .
The findings suggest that the Standard Model , which describes how the building blocks of the Universe behave and interact , needs a revision .
Neutrinos are believed to be vital to our understanding of the Universe .
But scientists know frustratingly little about these fundamental particles .
The findings build on work carried out by Japanese physicists .
Different ' flavours '
Neutrinos are sometimes described as " ghost particles " because they can pass through space , the Earth 's atmosphere and the Earth itself with almost no interaction with normal matter .
This makes studying them very difficult .
There are three kinds - or " flavours " - of neutrinos : muon , tau and electron .
To examine their properties , scientists created muon neutrinos in a particle accelerator at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory ( Fermilab ) in Illinois , US .
A high intensity beam of these particles was fired through a particle detector at Fermilab , and then to another particle detector 724 km ( 450 miles ) away in a disused mine in Soudan , US .
Fewer neutrinos arrived at the detector in Soudan than expected
" Because they so rarely interact with matter we can shoot them straight through the Earth , and most will travel through without doing anything , " explained Dr Lisa Falk Harris , a particle physicist at the University of Sussex , and a member of the Minos team .
" Of course , most of them travel right through our detectors as well , but once in a blue moon one of them will interact - about one or so per day . "
The scientists ' set up established that fewer particles were being detected at the Soudan site than had been sent .
They had effectively " disappeared " .
" What they have done is to convert into another type of neutrino , " Dr Falk Harris told the BBC News website .
Physicists call the process of transforming from one type of neutrino into another flavour oscillation .
And to be able to perform this transformation , particle physics theory states that the particles need mass .
" The fact that we see them ' disappear ' and they do this little transmutation , means that they must have mass , " said Dr Falk Harris .
' Missing mass ' mystery
These are the first results from the Minos experiment , which has involved scientists from 32 institutions in six countries .
It confirms the earlier observations of neutrino " disappearance " found in 2002 by the Japanese K2 K experiment , where scientists fired muon neutrinos at a detector situated 240 km ( 150 miles ) away .
The corroboration that the neutrino has mass has profound implications for particle physics .
" In particle physics there is the Standard Model which describes how the fundamental building blocks of matter behave and interact with each other , " explained Dr Falk Harris .
" And this model tells us that neutrinos should have no mass .
So the fact that we have now got independent measurements of neutrinos saying that they must have mass , means that this Standard Model is going to have be revised or superseded by something else . "
In the longer term , the findings may also help us to better understand the mystery of " missing mass " in the Universe .
" Various observations show there appears to be much more mass in the Universe than is visible , " said Professor Jenny Thomas , a particle physicist at University College London , and a member of the Minos team .
" We are surrounded by neutrinos , so in every cubic centimetre there are hundreds at any instant .
" To put it simply , if they are heavy , it means that there is a lot more mass in the Universe than we thought there was . "
Neutrinos are also thought to have played an important role in the formation of the Universe .
The Minos findings and future ones may help to shed light on how matter formed , and why so much of the Universe 's antimatter has disappeared .

On a Mission – Taking Away Al Gore ’s Carbon Credits …
We are on a mission to take away every one of Al Gore ’s meaningless carbon credits by simply providing carbon debits .
Help us make this dream a reality by purchasing one of the packages below .
Do n’t let Al Gore assuage his guilt with meaningless penance , heap it back on with carbon debits â€ “ every one of which we will let him know about .
Do We Really Kill Trees ?
The short answer is “ Yes ” .
We run a burgeoning business of clearing trees from grasslands so the Antelope wonâ€™t be scared .
As silly as that previous sentence sounds it is the truth .
So , you can have a clear conscience that you removed a terror inducing tree in an effort to improve the antelope state of mind â€ “ which makes them better targets during hunting season .
Although we donâ€™t completely follow the logic of the game and fish department on this , we go along with it .
After looking the site over for a while I , in the words of a wise Internet user , “ see what you did there . ”
These guys are either right wingers who want to make a quick buck , or people who have to clear these trees anyway , and want to make a quick buck .
They offer several packages , the most offensive being the …
Either way its stupid .
Its not always bad to cut down trees , especially if you are restoring grassland habitat .
Something I myself have done .
These people are playing into the “ anything Al Gore does is evil ” stereotype that pervades the right wing of America .
The really sad thing is that global warming does n’t care if you are a liberal or a conservative its going to mess you up either way .
To repeat , human caused climate change , global warming , whatever you want to call it , IS NOT a political issue .
Rising oceans lift all ships .
Another trip down Random Rd .
Paul Benacerraf was my advisor as well .
Seventeen was indeed his favorite number and used it in many examples .
He was desperately disappointed when his , then , young son reported that his favorite number was eight .
( I tried to cheer him up by suggesting that it was a coded representation of seventeen . )
Anyway , Paul attributed his obsession with seventeen to Hilary Putnam , his advisor , who had a pseudo - proof that seventeen was the most arbitrary number .
I once saw a copy of the proof in Hilary 's hand in Paul 's office , but I can not now remember how it went .
But it was surely from him that I got it , although I learned later that it was a well - known fact :
True , it was known hereabouts as the Feller Number .
According to my story , he frequently said : " Take a number , any number , say , 17 . "
Feller , by the way , lived on Random Road -- a further , if indirect , proof of the randomness of 17 .
As for Hilary 's proof , the one I remember best is this [ a proof by cases ] :
A completely random number can't [ =should not ] be too large .
Say , </=20 .
After that it 's a breeze .
Working from below , it clearly can't be 1 , nor can it be even , and hence neither 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 18 , nor 20 [ proof left to the reader ] .
3 is for the Trinity and 5 is too important in base 10 notation ; 7 and 11 are lucky , and 9 is a perfect square and hence hardly random .
13 is unlucky ; 15 is a multiple of 5 ; and 19 is too close to 20 .
That leaves 17 as the only possible candidate .
Q.e.d .
A Clockwork Orange
( Note : Colbert continues with " Close ... it was 4 " . )
I 've always heard that 37 is the number that most commonly comes to mind when people are asked for a random number ( between 1 and 100 , maybe ? )
I was gratified a few weeks ago when Penn Jillette was on Stephen Colbert , and Colbert asked him " What number am I thinking of ? " and Penn quite offhanded answered " 37 " .
See video here , 5:00 minutes in ... ( Note : Colbert continues with " Close ... it was 4 " . )
One of my favorite bar tricks is prepared by writing the numbers " 1 2 3 4 " with a fat pen on one side of an index card , and the number " 3 " alone on the reverse .
When I have an excuse to be looking through my wallet , or at some other lull in the conversation , I pull out the card and shove it under the nose of an unsuspecting neighbor with the instructions " Pick a number " .
I can flip over the card to reveal that I predicted his answer far more often than the 25 % predicted by pure chance .
Out of these four numbers , " 3 " appears to be " more random " than the others .
Posted by Arnold Zwicky at December 22 , 2006 02:25 PM
In my last adventure with the random number 17 , I followed it back to Princeton mathematicians in the 1960s and speculated about where I got the idea .
My senior thesis adviser Paul Benacerraf was one of three likely sources .
Now Mark Kalderon has written from the Department of Philosophy at University College London to fix on Paul : Hilary and Paul confirm most of this , though Paul 's not so sure that the proof was written down .
Paul continues :
If you have a good memory and have been following things carefully , you 'll recognize the Putnam proof as a more detailed version of the argument I gave in favor of 17 back in my first posting on the matter .
Pretty clearly I got it from Paul , who got it from Hilary , and then things disappear in the mists of time past .
Some notes and additions :
We had mathematicians Kelly and Spivak putting 17 together with yellow pigs in the 1960s , and then Lander creating a club devoted to the randomness of 17 in the 1970s .
Now Lance Knodel recalls that the name of Lander 's club was , yes , the Yellow Pigs .
Cultural continuity !
Once you start looking for 17 , you of course find it all over the place .
Stalag 17 .
Band names , including ( again ) Stalag 17 , Heaven 17 ( in Burgess ' sand now in real life ) , East 17 .
Alex Baumans suggests that 17 has a special resonance for bands -- though there 's the Mile 21 Band , also Level 42 , with other significant numbers in their names .
Meanwhile , other candidates vie with 17 for exemplary random - number status .
Don Porges says : Obviously , it 's time for someone to do that research .
You could try various ranges .
Maybe 1 - 20 instead of 1-100 .
Here 's Jonathan Ferro writing on the range 1 - 4: Well , 1 and 3 are the odd numbers , and 1 is very special indeed , so that leaves 3 .
Simple Putnamian reasoning .

Ghanaian mechanic Frank Darko boasts that he can make any car .
Any car ?
Everything you need to build a car is available in the Magazine .
Enlarge Image
A Mercedes Benz ?
" I need the engine but the body I can build it .
It would take me two or three weeks to complete it , if you bring the engine and chassis , " he said .
Few of Mr Darko's customers want Mercedes Benz and few want their cars built from scratch .
But many bring cars , trucks , buses and trailers so badly damaged that in any other country they would be a write - off .
In the hands of Mr Darko and others like him , life is breathed back into hulks of scrap metal and fashioned with heat and hammers into something , well almost new .
Artisans
Mr Darko is a " straighter " - so - called because he can straighten crooked vehicles .
He is one of an estimated 80,000 mechanics , engineers and artisans who work in Suame Magazine , an industrial slum , possibly one of Africa 's biggest .
Frank Darko specialises in straightening wrecked vehicles
Over time , more and more of these artisans turned their hands to vehicle repairs and engineering , eventually moving to Kumasi's Suame suburb after World War II .
In a continent and a country where buying new can stretch already overburdened pockets , the Magazine 's artisans show how far you can get with ingenuity , skill and a few mechanical tools .
Shoppers from afar
The casual shopper in Suame can choose from a wide range of tyres , windscreens , hub caps and vehicle parts .
Abandoned carcasses of vehicles are scattered on the mud and tar streets .
The mechanics say even this bus can be repaired
Mercedes Benz mechanic Kingsley Mensah has been in the business for nearly 30 years .
His customers come from all over Ghana , Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast to buy spare parts and for repairs .
Not far from where he works , Atta Samuel stands within the wrecked frame of a bus .
Two weeks is all he needs to rebuild it and deliver it as new to his customer .
Most of those who work in the Magazine made their way in the trade through its apprenticeship system .
For welder Mohammed Adams , busy making the trailer of a truck , his life in the Magazine began as an apprentice aged 11 .
Now 21 , he has been a master for five years .
Workshop of broken dreams
More and more of the Ashanti region 's unemployed youth are making their way to the city and find work in the city 's vast workshop .
Its artisans and engineers once dreamed - and some still do - of government backing to set up a factory in Kumasi , where its numerous craftsmen could work together .
But some Ghanaians do not give the artisans the respect they deserve , assuming products from the Magazine are poorer quality than imports , said George Yaw Obeng , research fellow at the city 's Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology .
The craftsmen - many of whom make food processing equipment and other engineering goods - also face tough competition from cheaper imports , he added .
More and more people in the Magazine are selling spare parts as well as doing repairs .
" Fewer people do manufacturing , it does not pay well , they are not able to face competition for products ...
It is not dying but it is not growing the way we thought it was going to grow , " said Mr Obeng .
Creating a factory where all the Magazine 's workers could work together is certainly what Frank Darko would like to see .
" We need something like that , we want all the mechanics , straighters , fitters and sprayers , everybody together under one roof . "
A fungus that caused widespread loss of bee colonies in Europe and Asia may be playing a crucial role in the mysterious phenomenon known as Colony Collapse Disorder that is wiping out bees across the United States , UC San Francisco researchers said Wednesday .
Researchers have been struggling for months to explain the disorder , and the new findings provide the first solid evidence pointing to a potential cause .
But the results are “ highly preliminary ” and are from only a few hives from Le Grand in Merced County , UCSF biochemist Joe DeRisi said .
“ We do n’t want to give anybody the impression that this thing has been solved . ”
Other researchers said Wednesday that they too had found the fungus , a single - celled parasite called Nosema ceranae , in affected hives from around the country -- as well as in some hives where bees had survived .
Those researchers have also found two other fungi and half a dozen viruses in the dead bees .
Advertisement
N. ceranae is “ one of many pathogens ” in the bees , said entomologist Diana Cox -Foster of Pennsylvania State University .
“ By itself , it is probably not the culprit ... but it may be one of the key players . ”
Cox -Foster was one of the organizers of a meeting in Washington , D.C. , on Monday and Tuesday where about 60 bee researchers gathered to discuss Colony Collapse Disorder .
“ We still have n’t ruled out other factors , such as pesticides or inadequate food resources following a drought , ” she said .
“ There are lots of stresses that these bees are experiencing , ” and it may be a combination of factors that is responsible .
Historically , bee losses are not unusual .
Weather , pesticide exposures and infestations by pests , such as the Varroa mite , have wiped out significant numbers of colonies in the past , particularly in the 1960s and 1970s .
Advertisement
But the current loss appears unprecedented .
Beekeepers in 28 states , Canada and Britain have reported large losses .
About a quarter of the estimated 2.4 million commercial colonies across the United States have been lost since fall , said Jerry Hayes of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services in Gainesville .
“ These are remarkable and dramatic losses , ” said Hayes , who is also president of the Apiary Inspectors of America .
Besides producing honey , commercial beehives are used to pollinate a third of the country ’s agricultural crops , including apples , peaches , pears , nectarines , cherries , strawberries and pumpkins .
Ninety percent of California ’s almond crop is dependent on bees , and a loss of commercial hives could be devastating .
“ For the most part , they just disappeared , ” said Florida beekeeper Dave Hackenberg , who was among the first to note the losses .
“ The boxes were full of honey .
That was the mysterious thing .
Usually other bees will rob those hives out .
But nothing had happened . ”

Researchers now think the foraging bees are too weak to return to their hives .
DeRisi and UCSF ’s Don Ganem , who normally look for the causes of human diseases , were brought into the bee search by virologist Evan W. Skowronski of the U.S. Army ’s Edgewood Chemical Biological Center in Maryland .
Dr. Charles
Wick of the center had used a new system of genetic analysis to identify pathogens in ground - up bee samples from California .
He found several viruses , including members of a recently identified genus called iflaviruses .
It is not known whether these small , RNA - containing viruses , which infect the Varroa mite , are pathogenic to bees .
Advertisement
Skowronski forwarded the samples to DeRisi , who also found evidence of the viruses , along with genetic material from N. ceranae .
“ There was a lot of stuff from Nosema , about 25 % of the total , ” Skowronski said .
“ That meant there was more than there was bee RNA .
That leads me to believe that the bee died from that particular pathogen . ”
If N. ceranae does play a role in Colony Collapse Disorder , there may be some hope for beekeepers .
A closely related parasite called Nosema apis , which also affects bees , can be controlled by the antibiotic fumagillin , and there is some evidence that it will work on N. ceranae as well .

The number Phi , according to some , is intrinsic in forms of beauty and balance .
It can be detected in the best designs , including architecture , art and life itself .
Now it may be that in some extreme cases excitable people are overanalyzing and finding
Phi where it does n't necessarily exist , but it's at least obvious that Phi is part of the best designs in nature , e.g. phyllotaxis , and is highly regarded by architects and artists , e.g. the Golden Mean .

Excursion to Gulag
Below are photos of labor prison camps of Soviet Time
Gulag stands for " Chief Administration of Corrective Labor Camps . "
The system of Stalin 's labor camps was the most monstrous death factory in all history , with ' production ' exceeding even WW - IIs Holocaust .
Many millions died in Gulag labor camps .
Camps were located in Taiga , a huge forest in Russian Siberia .
Now , all roads are overgrown and only a helicopter can reach those sites .
Camps have been abandoned since summer 1953 , when Stalin died .
A general amnesty was announced and everyone , inmates and guards alike , quickly fled the area .
Roosevelt observed that capitalism is unequally divided riches while socialism is equally divided poverty .
Gulag prison life meant an equal distribution of death among both rich and poor , old and young .
Death played no favorites and came readily to all , regardless of gender , beliefs or nationality .
People lived in wooden barracks .
Political prisoners , so - called " enemies of the state , " and criminals were all kept together .
" Enemies " were taken mostly from the ranks of prominent , intelligent and cultured people .
Under the inhuman conditions of the camps , the civilised and cultural folks appeared to be less equipped for survival than the criminals .
To establish their iron rule , communists thought they had to rid society of all thinking and honest people .
Such types are always a threat to despotic regimes .
They almost succeeded : in twenty years of repression they rooted out many values , beliefs , and traditions that had been cultivated for centuries .
After they killed the brains of the nation , the Soviet Union became a kind of laughing - stock ; a national bully that everyone feared because it was stupid and fat with nukes .
Like a mindless giant , the Soviet Union was incapable of anything intelligent or creative .
Having killed off all its wise and educated people , the Soviet Union was only capable of setting examples to the rest of the world of how things should not be done .
Everyone who tried to escape the Gulag had almost no chance of surviving .
They had to walk hundreds of kms through forested wilderness ... the direction hardly mattered because the people had nowhere to run .
The whole country was one big prison labor camp .
Bottle of vodka - a legal drug that guards often sold , illegally , to prisoners .
Nothing is left inside this once - crowded barrack .
There were two layers of plank beds with more than 120 convicts living in each barrack .
Most historians believe that repressions began in 1932 and peaked in 1937 .
Incoming traffic only slowed down in those camps with the beginning of Great Patriotic War in 1941 .
Why ?
Gulag convicts could instead choose to join army penal battalions and risk death under bullets .
In 1945 WW - II ended and millions of such convicts returned to the camps .
The repressions actually lasted until Stalin 's death in 1953 .
This is punishment cell .
Feeding - rack .
People were dying from exhaustion , starvation , hard labor ...
Marxism - Leninism was based on the theory of evolution which teachs that through millions of years , labor had helped the ape - man to became human ...
Here , in camps , they proved that this process is reversible .
With hard labor and little food they were able to turn human beings back into animals in just in a few months ...
" I did my plan and you ? " asks the socialist " poster - boy . "
Communists have always been compulsive planners , even planning exactly how many people were to be sent to those camps .
Each region had to report the count of " enemies " detained , and if the regional leaders did n't reach their quotas , then they became " enemies " themselves and joined those camps .
This is one of many bridges built by convicts .
It was never used because Stalin died before completion .
They have built 900 kms out of 1263 that was needed to connect two towns Igarka and Salechard .
300.000 convicts died while building this road within years 1949 - 1953 .
Now this road , like so many others , leads to nowhere .
Steam locomotives of that time .
Work here essentially stopped when authorities decided to start playing the music of national mourning on the radio .
This music played nonstop all day , convincing people more and more that the death was their own .
Soon both convicts and guards cared only to leave and return to their homes .
No caring remained to fix either barbed wire or locomotives .
It is a place , where before revolution , young Joseph Stalin who was known as Koba , have spent a few years of his prison sentence .
Later , it became a big transit prison , with this museum that everyone called " Stalin 's Pantheon . "
It has been abandoned since 1953 .
May these photos remind us that no State can build prosperity upon the bones of its own citizens and if all who have eyes to see are tortured and killed , than the rest will live in a kingdom of blind for a very long time .
It sounds like something from a science fiction film : a parasite that enters the brain and manipulates the behaviour of its host .
But this is not science fiction – it ’s very real .
The parasite is a unicellular organism called Toxoplasma gondii , which “ hijack [s ] the mind ” of its host , according to Ajai Vyas , lead author of a paper , published online last week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , describing the effects of T. gondii infection on the behaviour of rodents .
T. gondii is but one of thousands of different types of manipulative parasites , all of which alter the behaviour of their hosts to increase the efficiency with which they are transmitted .
Like the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum , to which it is closely related , T. gondii is a protozoan .
It has a complex life cycle involving transmission between , and infection of , at least two species .
The reproductive phase of the life cycle takes place in the cells lining the intestine of the cat , which is the primary host .
Here , T. gondii forms structures called oocysts , which consist of fertilized eggs enclosed in a thick wall .
These serve to transfer the parasite to its other host , a rodent .
The oocysts are extremely resilient – they can survive treatment with disinfectants such as bleach , and exposure to temperatures as low as - 12°C .
After being excreted in cats ’ faeces , they can survive in soil for up to a year , until ingested by rodents .
N ormally , rodents have a aversion to the smell of a pheromone found in cat urine , for obvious reasons .
This aversion is innate – rodents fear the smell of cats ’ urine even if they have never encountered it before , so this fear seems to be hard - wired .
In 2000 , researchers from the University of Oxford discovered that T. gondii manipulates this fear behaviour – infected rodents are mildly attracted to , rather than averse to , the smell of cat urine .
This is a case of fatal attraction – of course , attraction to the smell of cats ’ urine makes infected rats and mice more susceptible to predation , thus increasing the probability that the parasite will complete its life cycle .
Vyas and his colleagues presented infected and uninfected rodents with a series of choose tests .
The animals were placed in an enclosed circular area that had been divided into four sections .
One of the sections was laced with bobcat urine , another with rabbit urine .
The amount of time spent by each group of animals in each section of the area was then measured .
Sure enough , in confirmation of the earlier findings , it was found that infected animals spent far more time than uninfected ones in the section laced with bobcat urine .
T. gondii infection had effectively abolished their aversion to the odour of the urine , and made them mildly attracted to it instead .
The animals were then trained to fear a region of their enclosure .
On several occasions , they were placed in the middle of the arena , where electric shocks were administered to their feet .
When this was repeated a number of times , the association of the middle of the arena and electric shocks was strengthened , and the animals displayed fear behaviour – standing still – when placed in that part of the enclosure ( i. e. the animals had been classically conditioned to fear that part of the arena ) .
When tested later , both infected and uninfected animals froze when placed in the centre of the arena , because they expected to receive a shock to their feet .
Infected animals also remained fearful of the odour of foods they had not encountered before , and still became anxious when placed in an open space .
Infected rodents continued to exhibit other anxieties and are still capable of learning to fear other stimuli .
Thus , rather than altering the host ’s sense of smell , or having a generalized effect on fear behaviour , T. gondii specifically targets and modifies the response of rodents to the smell of cat urine .
Vyas ’s group labelled the parasites they used in their study with a bioluminescent molecule called luciferase , enabling them to visualize how it spreads through the body during the course of infection .
This showed that it initially infects peripheral tissues before making its way to the brain .
1 month after infection , T. gondii was no longer detected in peripheral tissues , but was found solely in the brain .
Dissection of the rodent ’s brains showed that the parasite had formed cysts in a variety of brain regions , including the olfactory bulb hippocampus , prefrontal cortex , all of which have previously been shown to be responsive to cat odour , as well as several other regions that are unresponsive to cat odour .
But the greatest densities of cysts were found in the amygdala , a region of the limbic system involved in the encoding of fearful memories .
( The image at the top shows a cyst formed by T. gondii in brain tissue . )
So , T. gondii not only targets the neural circuitry involved in fear , but it also alters a specific response mediated by that circuitry .
Exactly how remains unclear , but it is likely that the parasite synthesizes chemicals that mimic the rodents ’ own neurotransmitters .
These chemicals apparently manipulate the rodent ’s response to cat urine by perturbing the neurochemistry of the amygdala and connected structures .
Specifically , the authors speculate that T. gondii has an effect on neuromodulation mediated by the transmitters dopamine and noradrenaline .
But the plot thickens , and takes a somewhat sinister turn .
T. gondii can infect most species of warm - blooded animals , including humans , who may become infected by coming into contact with cat faeces or by eating undercooked meat .
It is estimated that some 40 % of the world ’s people harbour the parasite , and that up to 80 % have been infected at some time in their life .
In people with a compromised immune system , such as AIDS patients and pregnant women , toxoplasmosis , the disease caused by T. gondii infection , can , in some cases , be fatal ( this is why pregnant women are told to stay away from cat litter ) .
But in the vast majority of people , T. gondii infection results is asymptomatic .
Or so it would seem …
A number of recent studies have suggested that T. gondii can cause subtle changes in the personalities and behaviour of infected people .
Last year , for example , Jeroslav Flegr , a parasitologist at Charles University in Prague , found that women infected with the protozoan are more likely to give birth to boys than to girls .
Thus , by influencing the boy - to - girl birth ratio , T. gondii may have a considerable effect on the human population .
Flegr also administered a battery of psychological tests to infected and uninfected people , and compared the results .
His preliminary data suggest that T. gondii can alter the behaviour of humans as well as that of rodents .
Nicky Boulter , a research fellow at the Institute for Biotechnology of Infectious Diseases , at the University of Technology in Sydney , Australia , summarizes the findings :
Infected men have lower IQs , achieve a lower level of education and have shorter attention spans .
They are also more likely to break rules and take risks , be more independent , more anti-social , suspicious , jealous and morose , and are deemed less attractive to women .
On the other hand , infected women tend to be more outgoing , friendly , more promiscuous , and are considered more attractive to men compared with non-infected controls .
In short , it can make men behave like alley cats and women behave like sex kittens .
Epidemiological studies have also implicated T. gondii in some cases of schizophrenia .
This is particularly interesting , especially when we consider the speculations of Vyas ’s group about how the parasite manipulates neural circuitry in the amygdala .
Because both dopamine and noradrenaline have also been implicated in schizophrenia , it seems plausible that any link between T. gondii and schizophrenia would likely be linked to the organism ’s ability to alter the levels or activity of these neurotransmitters .
Finally , Kenneth Lafferty , a biologist with the U. S. Geological Survey , has also found a positive correlation between of T. gondii infection and levels of neuroticism .
But he goes so far as to suggest that the aggregate ( or cumulative ) effects of T. gondii infection in millions of people may have a major effect on collective personality , and could , therefore , subtlly influence human societies and cultures .

Development through infrastructure has worked in China , but China is not only an authoritarian state ; it is also a managerial or technocratic one , in which the ruling party marshals the nation ’s energies and capital in the name of development and stability .
Angola , on the other hand , is a semifunctional oligarchy .
Jaime and his fellow technocrats may know very well what they are doing , but even Angola ’s biggest boosters concede that the real power lies with President dos Santos and his circle .
The big public - works projects , for example , are now being directed not by the ministries but by Gen. Manuel Hélder Dias , a close associate of the president .
This subject is so sensitive that when I raised it , Jaime made me turn off my tape recorder .
And President dos Santos shows no signs of releasing the grip on power he has held for 27 years .
He has postponed elections again and again .
The ruling M.P.L.A. ( Movement for the Liberation of Angola ) and the state are virtually one ; even their flags are almost identical .
It ’s hard to feel confident about the uses to which the national bounty will be put so long as power and wealth are concentrated in one man and his entourage .
One morning I left Kuito and headed east once again in a last - ditch effort to locate the elusive Chinese railway workers .
Sales Duarte , then a project manager with CARE who was working as my guide and translator , a photographer and I drove 80 miles over pitted roads to Kwanza , a small town on the banks of the Kwanza River .
No sign of the Chinese .
The road ended at a railway bridge said to have been dynamited by South African mercenaries in 1989 .
The bridge must have measured about 150 yards long ; at its center , which now lay in the water , bare - breasted village women washed themselves and their babies .
Much stranger , though , was the sight of a battered blue Toyota 4 by 4 with its tires on the tracks and its front bumper submerged in the water .
Perhaps it had been sitting there since 1989 .
The bridge provided the only connection between the towns along the railway line , and quite a lot of traffic was moving in either direction .
A column of bicyclists passed by with rolled - up mattresses strapped to the backs of their bikes .
They had come all the way from Kuito , where mattresses were cheaper than in the local market , and were continuing on to Kuembe , the next big town , a distance of about 100 miles .
An official from the Ministry of Health was taking a pack of vaccines by motorbike from Kuito to Kuembe .
Just as I reached the eastern side of the bridge I heard a tremendous roar — the Toyota was fishtailing wildly at the base of the bridge .
It bucked forward and then slipped back .
Only then did I discover that this jalopy , with bales of material and a live chicken in the back , was in fact the Kuembe - Kuito taxi service .
The driver , Anacleto Kakande , said that he made the round trip twice a week .
Somehow , four times a week he would navigate the bent railroad tracks , the shattered bed , the logs , the foot - high water .
The five women , with five babies , waiting patiently at the western edge of the bridge were his fares ; they said they were charged 1,500 kwanzas — about $ 19 — for the trip .
It was only then that I fully understood how the terribly abstract word “ infrastructure ” could come to feel like life itself .
For 15 years , the traders and farmers of this region had lived with no other means of crossing from one side of the Kwanza River to the other .
( Why a ferry service had n’t been developed , I have no idea . )
They had improvised heroically , but at an absurd cost in time and effort .
If those Chinese engineers ever got to the bridge , the local economy might really , as Jaime said , jump .
But the Chinese were only a rumor — the very incarnation of a development process imposed from above and answerable to no one .
We headed back toward Kuito .
As we drove through Kamakupa , a town that , according to a sign , occupies the exact geographical center of Angola , Sales Duarte shouted , “ The Chinese ! ”
And there they were , operating derricks in front of the Kamakupa train station .
In the fields behind the station we found half a dozen Angolans wrenching nuts and bolts from the train tracks and two Chinese employees , in clean dress shirts , advising them in pidgin Portuguese .
Guards from the president ’s own security service watched over them .
We approached one of the Angolan workers , who complained that he was earning only 200 kwanzas a day — $ 2.50 — and added bitterly , “ and they do n’t even give us lunch . ”
Out front , we found the boss , a young Chinese man who spoke excellent Portuguese and introduced himself as “ Eddy . ”
He and his team of 12 Chinese nationals worked for the National Railway Company of Hong Kong ; the bulk of the workers on the project were Angolan .
The tracks , Eddy explained , were unusable , so they were being separated in order to be torn from the ground .
They would go to work on the bridge as soon as the equipment arrived from China .
“ We ’re responsible for repairing the railroad all the way to Moxico , ” he said — a distance of 55 miles .
How long would it take ?
Maybe three years , maybe five .
And as he spoke , an immense splintering noise shattered the late - afternoon torpor of Kamakupa , as the derrick operator knocked over a tree that marred the perfect , smooth surface he was creating .
Here , at last , was the wreckage of creation .
The Chinese premier , Wen Jiabao , visited Angola over the summer and announced that China had extended another $ 2 billion to Angola , on top of $ 1 billion announced a few months earlier and the original $ 2 billion from 2004 .
But Angola was only one stop on Wen ’s seven-nation tour of Africa .
He also announced a series of trade agreements with the Congo Republic , a country just beginning to exploit its oil deposits .
China is now one of Africa ’s largest customers not only for oil but also for timber , minerals , cotton and other natural resources .
China in turn has flooded Africa with cheap consumer goods .
The I.M.F. forecasts that China ’s trade with Africa will top $ 50 billion this year and could reach $ 100 billion by 2010 .
Over the last five years , sub -Saharan Africa ’s growth rate has almost doubled , to 5.8 percent from 3 percent ; economists attribute much of the increase to trade with China and other Asian countries .
Today my coworker Marcello pointed out to me an interesting anti-majoritarian effect .
There are three major interpretations of probability : the " subjective " view of probabilities as measuring the uncertainty of agents , the " propensity " view of probabilities as chances inherent within objects , and the " frequentist " view of probabilities as the limiting value of long - run frequencies .
I was remarking on how odd it was that frequentism , the predominant view in mainstream statistics , is the worst of the three major alternatives ( in my view , you have to presume either uncertainty or propensity in order to talk about the limiting frequency of events that have not yet happened ) .
And Marcello said something along the lines of , " Well , of course .
If anything were worse than frequentism , it would n't be there . "
I said , " What ? "
And Marcello said , " Like the saying that Mac users have , ' If Macs really were worse than Windows PCs , no one would use them . ' "
At this point the light bulb went on over my head - a fluorescent light bulb - and I understood what Marcello was saying : an alternative to frequentism that was even worse than frequentism would have dropped off the radar screens long ago .
You can survive by being popular , or by being superior , but alternatives that are neither popular nor superior quickly go extinct .
I can personally testify that Dvorak seems to be much easier on the fingers than Qwerty - but this is not surprising , since if Dvorak really were inferior to Qwerty , it would soon cease to exist .
( Yes , I am familiar with the controversy in this area - bear in mind that this is a politically charged topic since it has been used to make accusations of market failure .
Nonetheless , my fingers now sweat less , my hands feel less tired , my carpal tunnel syndrome went away , and none of this is surprising because I can feel my fingers traveling shorter distances . )
In any case where you 've got ( 1 ) a popularity effect ( it 's easier to use something other people are using ) and ( 2 ) a most dominant alternative , plus a few smaller niche alternatives , then the most dominant alternative will probably be the worst of the lot - or at least strictly superior to none of the others .
Can anyone else think of examples from their experience where there are several major alternatives that you 've heard of , and a popularity effect ( which may be as simple as journal editors preferring well - known usages ) , and the most popular alternative seems to be noticeably the worst ?
Addendum : Metahacker said of this hypothesis , " It 's wrong , but only sometimes . "
Sounds about right to me .
Paradise Found - Through a Black Hole .
Matt Brown proves , beyond all doubt , that the afterlife awaits us inside a black hole .
But how do we get there ?
by Matt Brown , 28 February 2007
Image : Wikipedia Gravitational distortions from a black hole in front of the Large Magellanic Cloud ( artist 's depiction ) .
Could heaven lie therein ?
There are many questions for which science does not have an answer .
For a subset of these questions , such as “ Is there a god ? ” we ’re told that science should n’t even be asking , and everyone would be very much obliged if it would mind its own business , thank you very much .
Which is a crushing pity , as these are precisely the questions we really want to know the answers to .
But Inkling is a brash young publication , with a sassy swagger and a shiny white labcoat as - yet untarnished by the slings and arrows of outrageous criticism .
Which is why the editors have approved publication , without peer review , of the following groundbreaking theoretical research .
To whit , the author presents the case that Heaven resides beyond the event horizon of a black hole .
The Christian Heaven , and other flavors of theistic afterlife , are often described as places outside of space and time , existing at the end of a long dark tunnel .
Not unlike a black hole , then .
And a little gedanken experiment suggests that this might be no coincidence .
First , we must imagine somebody so pious that there is no question of his soul rising to heaven upon death .
Step forward the Pope , who being God ’s infallible representative on Earth , is unlikely to cause much of a queue at the Pearly Gates while St. Peter checks his credentials .
Assumption 1 : The Pope ’s soul must go to Heaven .
Next , we place the Pope in the vicinity of a black hole .
When he ’s looking the other way , we playfully nudge him beyond the event horizon .
Thus ensnared , the pontiff will be squeezed by gravitational forces as he begins his inexorable spiral towards the singularity .
His death is assured .
Assumption 2 : Nothing can escape from a black hole , not even the papal soul .
Taking Assumptions 1 and 2 together , the only self - consistent outcome is that Heaven must be within the event horizon of the black hole , and most persuasively at the singularity itself .
Unless he pulls some kind of clever trick with Hawking radiation , whereby black holes can leak matter / energy , there ’s no way his holiness ’s spirit can escape .
So for his soul to reach heaven , heaven itself must be inside the black hole .
Fairly watertight logic , I hope you ’ll agree .
Of course , this raises all kinds of interesting questions .
The nearest black hole is more than a thousand light - years away , so do departed souls take more than a millennium to reach the Great Hereafter , or do they somehow break the light - speed barrier ?
Perhaps we each carry a micro - black hole around in our heads , which would itself raise questions about the cause and nature of consciousness .
Could this be a whole new branch of research , to be known as biocosmological theology ?
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Internet radio broadcasts , jeopardized by a royalty payment ruling earlier this year , would get a reprieve under bipartisan legislation introduced in Congress .
The Internet Radio Equality
Act would roll back dramatic rate increases handed down earlier this year by the Copyright Royalty Board and instead charge royalty payments for Web - based radio broadcasting , or streaming , in line with those paid by satellite radio .
Under the rules issued by the CRB , an agency charged by Congress with overseeing royalty disputes , streamers would be charged .08 cents a song retroactively to 2006 - a rate that would increase to 0.19 cents a song in 2010 .
For public broadcasters , the CRB set fees at a flat $ 500 a month but only for a set level of listening hours per month , one that many station owners said they would easily exceed and thus have to pay much higher fees .
Internet streamers said the increases amounted to 30 to 300 percent increases over what they are paying now .
The new legislation , proposed by Reps. Jay Inslee ( D - Wash . ) and Don Manzullo ( R - Ill . ) , would instead charge streamers a flat fee of 7.5 percent of their revenue through 2010 .
A companion piece is expected to be introduced in the Senate this week .
Advocates championed the bill as more in line with reality and a proper response to the public outcry from critics who said the ruling could kill Internet radio streaming .
Inslee spokeswoman Christine Hanson said the congressman 's office alone received about 1,000 complaints about the CRB fees , and members of Congress had received more than 400,000 e-mails demanding the fees be changed , so the sponsors are hoping quick action can be taken on the legislation
" You ca n't put an economic chokehold on this emerging form of democracy , " Inslee said in a statement .
" There has to be a business model that allows creative Webcasters to thrive , and the existing rule removes all the oxygen from this space . "
Radio stations large and small as well as Internet - only broadcasters who have gotten into the streaming business were united in their opposition to the new royalty fees and had been preparing a court challenge .
A National Public Radio official praised the Internet Radio Equality Act. Congress " has recognized that public radio has a very different mission from commercial media and cannot pay commercial - level royalty rates , " said NPR spokeswoman Andi Sporkin .
" This bill will provide a long - term resolution that is fair for all sides . "
The CRB rejected an appeal brought by broadcasters as well as NPR and others that sought to delay the May 15 deadline for the introduction of the new fees .
Tim Westergren , president and CEO of popular Internet radio station Pandora , attended a briefing Monday in Washington , D.C. , on the legislation and said there was only a glimmer of hope that the new fees would be stayed pending the outcome of the legislation .
A court order would be needed to stay the increases .
" Nobody has any idea , but the presumption is it will go into effect on or before the 15th , " Westergren said .
" On that day , on paper just about every Webcaster becomes officially bankrupt because they 'll owe way more money than they have because the fees are retroactive . "
Savings would vary among stations because of differing royalty structures .
Stations now pay .07 cents a performance for AM or FM signals that simultaneously air online and 0.14 cents a performance for Internet - only broadcasts .
Pandora , for instance , would pay less under the structure set up under the legislation than it does now , Westergren said .
SoundExchange , a performance rights organization that collects royalty payments for entertainers , supports the rate structure proposed by the royalty board .
In a statement on its Web site , the company said the proposed legislation would result in a windfall of $ 50 million to large Webcasters like Clear Channel ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , Microsoft ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , AOL and Yahoo !
( Charts , Fortune 500 ) while depriving artists of payments to which they are entitled .

Kangaroo ( Guugu Yimidhirr language : gang - oo - roo [ 1 ] ) , several species of large marsupial of the genus Macropus native to Australia and adjacent islands , characterized oversized hind legs by which they use hopping to move about .
The de facto symbol of Australia , kangaroos have been displayed on everything from the national coat of arms to coins , airline symbols , tourist advertisements , as well as numerous appearances in popular culture .
Description
Kangaroos have large ears on top of their small heads , a long snout , and short arms with clawed fingers .
Their legs are strong , powerful , and are made for leaping .
Their feet have four toes at the end of elongated metatarsi that they rest on when standing .
They also have a powerful , thick tail that is used as support when standing , a third - leg when walking slowly , and for counterbalance while hopping .
Like all marsupials , female kangaroos have a pouch on their stomachs in which they carry their young .
Diet
Kangaroos are herbivores , eating grass , roots , and shrubs .
They have a chambered stomach similar to sheep and cattle .
They are able to regurgitate their food , chew it again as cud , and then swallow it for digestion .
Social Order
Kangaroos travel in mobs of about ten or more males and females .
The leader of the mob , called a " boomer " , is a male determined by age and size .
The boomer has access to females in his mob for mating and will wander around the mob intimidating any other males who try to mate with his harem .
Reproduction
Female kangaroos usually only have one baby kangaroo ( called a " joey " ) at a time .
The newborn joey weighs as little as 0.03 ounces when first born , after which it crawls into its mothers pouch where it will nurse , grow , and develop .
Red Kangaroo joeys will stay in their mothers pouch for about eight months and Grey Kangaroo joeys stay in there for about one year .
Uses
Kangaroos are commonly hunted for their meat , with it being exported all over the globe .
Kangaroo leather is commonly used in items such as football boots and driving booties .
Living species
Origins
Creation science and Creationism
Consistent with their view that the fossil record as a whole does not support the evolutionary position , [ 2 ] [ 3 ] creationists state that there is a lack of transitional fossils showing an evolutionary origin of kangaroos .
Rebecca Driver writes :
The Macropod family is alleged to have evolved from either the Phalangeridae ( possums ) or Burramyidae ( pygmy - possums ) ...
However , there are no fossils of animals which appear to be intermediate between possums and kangaroos .
Wabularoo naughtoni , supposed ancestor of all the macropods , was clearly a kangaroo ( it greatly resembles the potoroos which dwell in Victoria ’s forests ) .
If modern kangaroos really did come from it , all this shows is the same as we see happening today , namely that kangaroos come from kangaroos , " after their kind . " [ 4 ]
According to the origins theory model used by young earth creation scientists , modern kangaroos are the descendants of the two founding members of the modern kangaroo baramin that were taken aboard Noah 's Ark prior to the Great Flood .
It has not yet been determined by baraminologists whether kangaroos form a holobaramin with the wallaby , tree - kangaroo , wallaroo , pademelon and quokka , or if all these species are in fact apobaraminic or polybaraminic .
After the Flood , these kangaroos , bred from the Ark passengers and then migrated to Australia .
There is debate whether this migration happened over land [ 5 ] with lower sea levels during the post - flood ice age , or before the super - continent of Pangea broke apart . [ 6 ]
Arguments and evidence relating to kangaroos that support a biblical creation model
Scientists and Christian apologists who advocate the biblical creation model have provided a number of pieces of evidence and arguments which support the creation model .
Some of the more notable articles supporting the biblical creation model are :
Evolution
The evolutionary / atheistic view is that kangaroos and other marsupials evolved from a common marsupial ancestor which lived hundreds of millions of years ago . [ 7 ]
Dreamtime
Some Australian Aborigines believe that kangaroos were sung into existence by their ancestors during the Dreamtime . [ 8 ]

Revealed : Eight Ways The Media Distorts Psychology
[ Photo by Thomas Hawk ]
In a revelation that has shocked the world , PsyBlog reveals mainstream media reporting of psychology studies has been grossly distorted for decades .
PsyBlog can now exclusively expose the eight ‘ specialist ’ techniques journalists use to misrepresent psychology studies .
1 . I ’ve told you a million times not to exaggerate
Practically the first rule of journalism is to sensationalise .
Do n’t just say here ’s another study which adds a tiny little piece to an ever - growing jigsaw puzzle .
Boring !
People want mind - reading !
Now that ’s news .
Example :
The brain scan that can read people ’s intentions ( The Guardian )
2. Correlation is not as sexy as causation
All scientists have it drummed into them : an association ( correlation ) between two factors does n’t mean one causes the other .
But , if you just say ‘ there ’s a strong connection ’ , readers assume it means causation .
No need to correct this natural assumption because , repeat after me , correlation is not as sexy as causation .
Example : Buying a dog can make you happier ( The Independent )
3. Comedy research
Dusty old journal articles filled with technical language ?
My God !
What ’s this ?
A study about comedy ?
Oh that ’s bound to be a laugh , forget the earnest stuff , let ’s put this one in .
Example : Scientists find the perfect comedy face : Ricky Gervais ( The Independent )
4 . Sexy psychology
Sex sells .
Do n’t you forget it .
Psychology of sex ?
Sexual psychology .
Loads of sex advice but not a single sexpert in sight ?
Commission that article now !
Example : Redheads ‘ have more sex than blondes or brunettes ’ ( The Daily Mail )
5 . Sexy psychology … but with real expert opinion buried at the end
All the hallmarks of a sexy psychology article but instead a quote from a recognised expert is buried at the end to give a whiff of credibility .
The article below has a quote from PsyBlog ’s favourite proper sexpert , Dr Petra Boynton .
You ’ll notice her caution way down the article .
Long after quotes from random people the journo happens to know .
Unfortunately , also long after most people have stopped reading .
Example : Why British women go off sex ( unlike the French and Germans ) ( The Independent )
6 . The power of tenuous celebrity links
A study about golf and psychology ?
Great , let ’s have a nice picture of Catherine Zeta - Jones and Michael Douglas .
The psychology can go hang .
Example : A happy home can make you better at golf , say psychologists ( The Daily Mail )
7 . Put psychology in the title , ignore in the body
Just the word psychology itself is attractive to readers .
Perhaps you ’ll learn something about the human psyche .
Perhaps not .
Clever journos put psychology in the title and never mention it again .
Oh , and if it ’s a bit titillating , all the better .
Example : Psychology of stripping ( The Times )
8. Combine above techniques for more power
Exaggerate wildly , imply correlation equals causation , focus on comedy research , preferably about sex , hide the expert comment at the end , find a celebrity tie in and make sure you put psychology in the title and never mention it again .
Use all these and what have you got ?
The perfect media psychology article , guaranteed science - free .
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Estonia ’s ambassador to Moscow says she is besieged inside her own embassy .
Police walk past flags of Kremlin - loyal youth organisations as they patrol the Estonian embassy in Moscow picketed by protesters May 3 , 2007 amid growing tensions between Russia and Estonia .
REUTERS / Alexander Natruskin
Sitting in a leather armchair in her office as the sound of protesters ’ chants filtered through the windows , Marina Kaljurand said that during the night they had thrown stones at the building , smashing four windows .
“ ( The protesters ) are deciding who is let in and who is not , ” she told two reporters who were escorted past crowd control barriers into the embassy after a Russian policeman had photographed their identity documents .
“ We calculate each and every time if someone has to leave the embassy or not and we try to keep that movement very small until Russia can guarantee the security of all our staff . ”
About 10 Estonian diplomats , including the ambassador , sleep at the embassy .
The protesters demand Estonia apologise for moving a bronze statue of a Red Army soldier -- revered in Russia as a symbol of its huge sacrifices in World War Two -- from its spot in central Tallinn .
The embassy , a two - storey mansion built in 1903 by a wealthy merchant , has now become the front line in a dispute that has sent ripples across Europe .
As the protest entered its seventh day on Thursday , about 80 protesters milled around the embassy , in a quiet side - street , as a handful of police looked on .
More protesters dozed in tents along the pavement .
Plastered on walls along the street were posters with Kaljurand ’s picture and a small moustache scrawled over her top lip .
“ Wanted : the ambassador of a fascist state , ” they said .
PORTABLE TOILETS
Most of the protesters are from Nashi , a pro-Kremlin youth group that has official endorsement .
They are well - equipped .
One tent housed a makeshift Internet cafe .
A generator was supplying electricity for the computers , and for a row of water coolers .
Four portable lavatories had been set up and patriotic music was blaring from enormous loudspeakers .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
“ Of course psychologically it is very difficult to work under these conditions , ” said 44 - year - old Kaljurand .
On Wednesday , her bodyguards used pepper spray on protesters who stormed a news conference where she was due to speak .
Earlier , her car was mobbed as she left the embassy .
Diplomats ’ children have been sent home to Estonia .
Outside , a group of protesters bussed in by Nashi organisers on Saturday from Lipetsk , about 400 km ( 248.5 miles ) south of Moscow , were chatting quietly .
“ We want them ( the Estonians ) to return the monument to where it was and to apologise , ” Alexei Safarov , an 18 - year - old student , told Reuters .
They all denied they were being paid to protest .
“ We came here to defend our country , not for money , ” said 17 - year - old Darya Kopkova , also from Lipetsk .
But inside the embassy , Kaljurand said there was more to the protest than a spontaneous expression of anger .
“ It is clear that the actions in front of the embassy are very well organised and very well orchestrated , ” she said .
“ I think the money has to come from somewhere .
But of course , I am not in a position to accuse anybody specific . ”
The New Hampshire House of Representatives voted last week to block implementation of the federal government 's controversial Real ID act .
Since New Hampshire Governor John Lynch does not intend to veto the Real ID rejection bill , it will pass if approved by the state senate .
Characterized by New Hampshire Representative Sherman Packard as " the worst piece of blackmail to come out of the federal government , " the Real ID Act creates a set of uniform standards for state - issued ID cards , and mandates the construction of a centralized national database to store information on American citizens .
Included in a 2005 military spending bill , the Real ID Act passed with virtually no discussion or debate in the US Congress .
Heavily criticized by concerned citizens , civil liberties groups , and state government agencies , the Real ID act is opposed by over 600 organizations including the National Governors Association .
Although the Real ID act was originally written as a means of improving identification security , critics argue that the act increases the risk of identity theft without providing any tangible security benefits .
To make matters worse , congress vastly underestimated implementation costs and many state governments now fear that Real ID compliance is a financial impossibility .
Despite this , state identification cards that do n't comply with the act by the December 2009 deadline will not be accepted or considered valid at airports or federal buildings .
Idaho and Maine have already passed bills rejecting implementation of the Real ID act , and similar proposed bills are being evaluated in South Carolina and Arkansas as well as New Hampshire .
ACLU state legislative department director Charlie Mitchell says that this is just the beginning of a " tidal wave of rebellion against Real ID . "
If enough state governments refuse to comply with the requirements of the Real ID act , it is likely that congress will have to reevaluate the entire plan .
" Across the nation , local lawmakers from both parties are rejecting the federal government 's demand to undermine their constituents privacy and civil liberties with a massive unfunded mandate , " says Mitchell .
" Congress must revisit the Real ID Act and fix this real mess . "
Although the standards established by the Real ID act would make it harder for illegal immigrants to obtain fraudulent identification records , doing so would have little discernible impact on national security .
When considering the potential security implications of the Real ID act , it is worth noting that the 9/11 hijackers were all legal residents with proper identification .
Meanwhile , critics worry that by facilitating the creation of a centralized database of citizen records and by requiring state identification cards to include a machine - readable mechanism , the Real ID act provides identity thieves with unprecedented access to private information .
Your other option is to manage the forest sustainably .
You consult a sustainable forestry expert who estimates that you could cut an amount of timber that would net you $ kX this year , where k is some number much less than one , and the same amount of timber year after year in perpetuity ( which would produce more $ $ when adjusted for inflation ) .
Thus k is roughly the fraction of the timber you'd get in one go from the clearcut that you could cut each year on a sustainable basis ( the " roughly " comes from correcting for harvesting and management expenses , etc ) .
The expert believes in sustainable forestry and emphasizes to you the benefits for the wildlife ( who live in the trees ) , downstream neighbors ( who wo n't get flooded with rivers choked with your silt ) , and fish ( who can spawn in the unsullied gravels of the streams ) .
Suppose you own a forest .
You 'd like to make some money from the trees and you are considering two options .
One is to clearcut the whole thing and sell the timber , which will net you .
This particular forest happens to be on a steep erodable slope such that the soil will probably wash off and no more trees will grow after one clearcutting .
I should say at the outset : yes I know this is a gross oversimplification of the tradeoffs present in real forestry .
But bear with me - let 's just take this premise and see what your accountant would recommend .
He or she would probably perform what 's called a net present value calculation to determine what was economically rational .
The idea is as follows .
Somehow we 'd like to compare the value of getting a one time payment of $ X with an infinite stream of smaller $ kX dollar payments from now into the indefinite future .
Clearly we'd like to somehow add up the benefits of all the future payments into a single number that we can compare to $ X ( the sum we'd net if we just clearcut the forest ) .
It might seem that this sum will be infinite if the forest lasts forever , but it is n't so .
Let 's take it step by step .
Clearly , this year 's $ kX of sustainable income from the forest is money that is directly comparable to this year 's $ X of clearcut payment .
However , next year 's payment seems to be somehow not quite as good , since we wo n't get it till next year .
The trick to comparing is to notice what money we would have to invest now to get $ kX next year .
If interest rates are currently i % , then it would seem like if we invest $ kX / ( 1+i ) now , we would have $ kX next year .
So the net present value ( NPV ) of $ kX next year is $ kX / ( 1+i ) ( which is smaller than $ kX ) .
Which interest rate should we use ?
Well , a sensible thing ( since we are overall making a long term comparision ) is to use a safe investment like a long US treasury bond .
Right now , the nominal yield on those is about 5.25 % .
However , it 's a little tricky because next year we 'll have the same amount of wood , not dollars .
And the wood will be worth more in dollars because of inflation .
We can correct for this , however , by using real interest rates ( minus inflation ) , rather than nominal ones .
The treasury also issues 30 year inflation indexed bonds .
The yield on those is a decent estimate of what the market thinks inflation - adjusted yields will be over the long haul .
That number is about 2.5 % presently .
You might think you should compare against something with a higher yield than treasury bonds , but assuming all those hedge fund managers , investment banks , and credit rating agencies have done their homework right on setting bond price / yields in the bond market , any bond that yields more should mainly be doing so because it 's riskier and the extra yield should exactly take into account the extra risk .
So let 's stick with treasury bond yields .
Then i , the interest rate , is presently 2.5 % .
( And let 's assume that the $ kX is net of insuring the forest so we do n't have to worry about the risk in our future income stream from fire etc - in reality companies use higher internal discount rates to account for the various risks / uncertainties that plague projects ) .
You might also think that perhaps wood will get more valuable in future , more so than the general rise in prices embodied in the inflation rate .
But let 's assume for simplicity now that the real price of wood is anticipated to stay fixed ( eg by the lumber futures market ) .
( Uncertainty in future wood prices would tend to make us choose a higher interest rate to compensate for the risk ) .
We 'll take up price changes in a later thought experiment .
So then we can just proceed out to further years .
So far , the value of the income stream is $ kX ( for this year ) , plus $ kX / ( 1+i ) for next year .
For the year after that , the amount of money we would need to have to get $ kX in two years ( in current dollars ) is $ kX / ( 1+i ) ^2 ( because that amount would get multiplied in a compounded manner by ( 1+i ) on two years to give the $ kX payment ) .
Clearly , we can keep doing this for all the years .
I 'll spare you the algebraic detail , but if you work out the series it sums up that the net present value of the future income stream is $ X x k ( 1+i ) /i.
So the condition that the net present value of the sustainably managed forest would be higher than profit from clearcutting it is that k > i /( 1+i ) .
Now , remembering that the proper i right now is 2.5 % , we see that the equation is equivalent to k > 1/41 .
In other words , if we have more than 41 years worth of forest growth on the land , then we are definitely financially better off clearcutting the forest than managing it sustainably forever .
I note that in translating profit ratios to forest age directly , we are making a crude approximation .
In reality , it 's worse than this because the economies of scale in doing the harvesting and managing will be greater if we clearcut , and not only that , but it 's likely there will be some regrowth after the clearcut and young trees create wood faster than mature trees .
Thus where trees take a long time to regrow , you can see why there 's a financial advantage to clearcutting as fast as the regulators will allow .
And that 's why lumber companies often do it : they have a fiduciary duty to provide their shareholders with the maximum possible return on shareholder capital , and clearcutting frequently provides it .

If it seems like this net present value calculation is some kind of complex technical accounting rule that ought to be changed for the benefit of forests , I 'd like to try to disabuse you of that idea .
As far I can see , any economic system in which :
natural ecosystems like forests are private property and can be traded for money people are allowed and encouraged to maximize their own self interest interest is paid on loans
will have this property .
In particular , an equivalent way of looking at it is this .
If , you would make more money by cutting down the forest and investing the money in treasury bonds .
( Of course , regulations could , and do , limit what landowners can do , but the finances dictate what self - interested landowners wouldto do , if they can ) .
We 've been running our civilization on those three rules for many centuries now , so the NPV logic is very deeply embedded in the whole way Western culture works .
To change it would be a massive cultural wrench .
An important point is that the actual current price of lumber should make no difference to our decision criterion .
Unless we can predict changes in prices in the future , the economics of our decision should mainly be sensitive to interest rates .
Now , in this condition of whether sustainable management of the forest makes economic sense or not , recall k > i /( 1+i ) , the variable k is more - or - less a property of the forest - the speed with which it grows ( modulo some correction for the cost of managing it ) .
However , the interest rate i is a property of the economy , and indeed is somewhat under the control of the central bank ( the Federal Reserve in the US ) .
( I say somewhat because the Fed targets short - term rates and long - term rates do n't move exactly with short - term rates , though mostly so ) .
Because of it's importance to these kinds of NPV calculations , interest rates basically set how much society cares about the future .
Specifically , let 's first look at some history of real interest rates to get a feeling for the range they vary in :
Nominal yields on ten year treasuries ( 1955 - Feb 2006 ) , nominal rates minus CPI - U inflation over the prior 12 months , and inflation adjusted ten year treasury yield .
Source : Federal Reserve Bank .
Note that the best estimate of long - term real interest rates is the yield of the inflation - adjusted treasury ( the blue line ) .
However , this series only goes back to 2003 , so I 've also included an estimate of real rates constructed by subtracting the consumer price index change over the prior 12 months from the nominal rate on regular 10 year treasury bonds .
That line ( green ) goes back to 1955 , but should only be viewed as a rough approximation of anticipated real interest rates ( since long term expectations of future inflation could vary somewhat from the value the CPI happened to take over the last 12 months ) .
In particular , it 's probably never been the case that long term expectations of real interest rates were negative .
Anyway , the graph gives us the sense that real rates vary from 0 % - 8 % or so over the course of recent history .
Let 's have a look at the shape of the net value function for the rest of the century as a function of those interest rates .
Ie what I 'm about to plot is how much the cashflow from the forest ( or anything else ) would contribute to NPV in year Y relative to how much it contributes in 2006 .
Discount applied to future cash flows ( in present dollars ) as a function of year for varying real interest rates .
In general , as you can see , the degree to which future cash flows contribute to present value is highly dependent on interest rates .
When interest rates are high , the degree to which future cashflows contribute is very small and it's very unlikely that it would make financial sense to manage the forest sustainably .
On the other hand , when interest rates are low , the discount function is still non-negligible far out into the century , and managing the forest sustainably is more likely to be the profitable option .
A way to summarize the situation is the half life ( the point at which the contribution from a future cash - flow drops to half ) , which is given by log ( 2 ) / log( 1+i ) .
If we plot that , it looks like this :
Half life of discount function as it depends on interest rate .
The red square is based on interest rates as of this writing .
Again , when interest rates are low ( below 1 % ) , the half life of our interest in future cash - flows gets up around a century .
However , when they are high , it drops down to only a decade or two , and the poor trees have no chance .
As an aside , it 's interesting to note that the very controversial acquisition of Pacific Lumber ( then owners of the Headwaters Forest ) by Maxxam , which was financed almost entirely by junk bonds and led to greatly increased cutting of Pacific Lumber 's timber holdings ( and a long litany of litigation ) , took place in 1985 .
If you look back up at my first graph of interest rates , you 'll see that real interest rates in 1985 were just about at their peak of around 8 % ( on the nominal - CPI method of estimation ) .
This suggests that the influence of high real interest rates on unsustainable cutting of forests is a real effect .
Also , during the era of high interest rates in the 1970s and 1980s , forest cut rates increased .
Since then they have been reduced , and we are importing more timber instead .
So this is at least consistent with the hypothesis that interest rates are important in affecting the desire to liquidate natural resources more quickly .

So in summary , real interest rates control how far project finances are sensitive to cashflow into the future ( what economists call inter- temporal preferences ) .
In a sense , they control how much the economy cares about the future .
Now , this is not usually the main focus that the business community places on interest rates .
Instead , the focus is on the effects of interest rates on the short term growth of the economy and on inflation .
Generally speaking , when the central bank wants to accelerate the economy ( or prop up an ailling one ) , it targets a lower interest rates .
This makes it cheaper for businesses and households to borrow , thus encouraging them to do so , which can increase both consumption and capital investment .
It also makes it less rewarding to save , and this also encourages consumption .
This tends to increase the amount of economic activity in the near term .
Correspondingly , when the central bank is concerned about inflation ( which economist frequently view as aggregate demand for goods and services ( and / or labor ) growing faster than businesses can supply those goods and services , or trained labor can become available ) , it is likely to increase interest rates which has the reverse effect and slows the economy .
This , eventually , will reduce inflationary pressures .
Note that the Fed does not directly control interest rates - what it directly controls is the size of the monetary base , the amount of currency in circulation and the quantity of bank reserves on deposit with the Fed .
However , what it does with that power is adjust the monetary base via open market operations in such a way as to maintain short term interest rates as near as possible to a stated target .
And it has got increasingly good at that :
Fed target and actual daily market rate for Fed funds .
Source : This is Figure 18.2 of Money , Banking , and Financial Markets by Stephen Cecchetti ( a book I highly recommend ) .
In short , the interest rate is viewed as a big lever that roughly controls the speed of the economy .
Push it down ( lower rates ) and the economy goes faster , but if it goes too fast , inflation is likely to ensue .
Pull it up , and the economy slows down .
You cannot read the business press or economics blogs for any length of time without reading constant discussion of what the Fed is likely to do to interest rates and how that will affect the economy .
And herein lies the paradox .
On the face of it , the question of whether the economy should care about the far future or not is fairly unrelated to the question of whether the economy should be sped up or slowed down in the near future .
But in fact , the same lever manages both things .
And it seems to me that there is a potential problem there .
Let me switch to another thought experiment .
Suppose humanity were faced with the following dilemma .
We could carry out a series of projects which would result in unsustainably consuming the entire biosphere to make food , fiber , and biofuels for the present and near - term human population , but which would mean that there would be no biosphere for our grandchildren ( who would therefore all die ) .
Under this alternative , we recklessly use up water , degrade soil , and throw away genetic diversity in such a way that plant productivity in future is irretrievably damaged .
Alternatively , we could experience a decrease in our lifestyle now , which would mean that the fossil fuels would last longer , and the biosphere could continue to produce a fairly constant amount of food , fiber , and fuel indefinitely .
Which should we do ?
Again , I stress that this is a hypothetical thought experiment .
I realize that the actual human dilemma in the 21st century is more complex and much less clear than this .
However , bear with me .
I 'm making an extreme simplification of the situation because I want to explore what seem to me some less than optimal things about the decisions free market economics suggests in these cases .
It 's also not totally out of the question that we face a complicated variant of this choice : biologists do estimate that humans already appropriate 15 % - 25 % of net primary productivity and those biologists are pretty concerned about it :
Land use has generally been considered a local environmental issue , but it is becoming a force of global importance .
Worldwide changes to forests , farmlands , waterways , and air are being driven by the need to provide food , fiber , water , and shelter to more than six billion people .
Global croplands , pastures , plantations , and urban areas have expanded in recent decades , accompanied by large increases in energy , water , and fertilizer consumption , along with considerable losses of biodiversity .
Such changes in land use have enabled humans to appropriate an increasing share of the planet 's resources , but they also potentially undermine the capacity of ecosystems to sustain food production , maintain freshwater and forest resources , regulate climate and air quality , and ameliorate infectious diseases .
We face the challenge of managing trade - offs between immediate human needs and maintaining the capacity of the biosphere to provide goods and services in the long term .
So the world is filling up in several senses , and peak oil is just one symptom of that .
We can probably expect to be hitting a variety of resource constraints in this century , and having to work around all of them .
Anyway , whether you buy that or not , just suppose that the situation was as I describe it in my thought experiment .
In a more - or - less free - market world , each individual decision to cut down this or that forest , or take all the straw from this or that field for biofuels , would be taken separately based on the profitability for the individual or company owning the land .
Recall that a main control on whether you want to slash and burn something or manage it sustainably is real interest rates .
The higher interest rates are , the faster your NPV discount function decays in future years , and the less sensitive economic decision - making becomes to anything that might happen in the future .
So the question becomes as the economy hits various resource constraints , what is likely to happen to interest rates ?
Well both theory and past experience suggest that resource constraints are inflationary .
The theoretical argument is that resource constraints reduce aggregate supply of goods and services , and unless aggregate demand is correspondingly reduced also , price levels will increase as people enter a bidding war for the goods and services that are still available .
To manage this contraction ( possibly in the face of people borrowing more aggressively to maintain their lifestyle ) the central bank will have to increase interest rates .
The best empirical evidence of this comes from oil shocks .
Major oil shocks have all caused a big spike in inflation over and above whatever the prevailing rate was beforehand ( and indeed they 've been the main cause of big spikes in inflation in the US in the last 50 years .
This is not to discount that other factors have caused lower but longer - lasting inflation .
Also , this is not to discount that there are some tempting arguments that we are overdue for a credit contraction - but I view that as something likely to be short - term ( decade or sub - decade ) if it occurs .
Over the mid-to - long term , a cascade of resource constraints has got to be inflationary .
So if that 's true , we might expect that a biosphere constraint ( along with other resource constraints like peak oil ) will tend to cause inflation .
In the current economic consensus , the correct central bank response to that will be to increase interest rates with a view to throttling the economy back and reducing inflation .
And the problem with that is those higher interest rates will sway the balance of decision - making towards less sustainable management of the biosphere .
In other words , it appears to me that there is a potential for a nasty positive feedback here that could promote a downward spiral .
One might call it an inflationary collapse : the harder the resource constraint bites , the more tendency towards inflation in the economy , the higher interest rates will go , and the less incentive anyone will have to manage their piece of the biosphere sustainably .
Now , there 's one dangling point here that I should clear up .
In my first example ( the individual forest ) I assumed that price rises were not forseeable ; prices were expected to stay flat .
However , in this example of consuming the entire biosphere , someone might argue that the classic Hotelling analysis of a finite resource should apply ( eg as discussed by Dave a while back ) .
Basically , the Hotelling analysis says that if you know how much of a resource there is left , then as it becomes more scarce it 's price should go up exponentially with the exponential constant being the interest rate .
If that situation obtained , then the net present value analysis above ( which assumed constant real prices ) does not apply .
However , it does not seem that the Hotelling model is all that applicable to real resource constraints .
In particular , if experience to date is any guide , it seems that we usually have terrible information about the amount of resource left .
This is obviously true of oil ( think OPEC reserve distortions , uncertainties over future recovery rates , undiscovered oil , etc ) .
So the effect of this has been to make the futures price - curve more - or - less flat .
As of yesterday , it looked like this :
Price of a barrel of oil on Nymex future contracts as of 6/28/06 .
Source : New York Mercantile Exchange .
However , over the course of the last few years , the shape of the back - end has been whipping up and down ( in and out of contango ) but always staying within $ 10 of the current price .
Meanwhile , the current price has been rising exponentially at about 30 % per year , much faster than interest rates .
Thus the Hotelling theory really does n't seem to help us : at any given time the futures curve has been more - or - less flat , because the information about the resource was too poor to constrain the price curve well , and so what the back end of it is probably doing is wandering up and down driven by momentum traders .
In the meantime , the spot price has continued to rise , on average , much faster than interest rates .
Now , the situation in biosphere resource constraints is that the information is even poorer than on oil reserves ( this will have to wait for future posts to flesh out , but aquifer volumes , etc are very poorly understood ) .
And thus we might expect whatever resource constraints there are to show up in the same not -very - forseeable way that peak - oil seems to have been showing up .
And that 's a problem .
Because it means that the economy will not get the right signals to anticipate the problem , and then when it does hit the constraint , inflation and high interest rates will tend to promote exactly the wrong kind of choices .
I 'm not saying that this is definitely going to happen - I do n't know at present .
But it seems plausible enough to be worth worrying about .
It also reinforces two points :
Tony Blair is to announce the moves - the result of months of intense debate in Whitehall - within 24 hours , possibly later today , according to officials .
The prime minister is expected to say that Britain intends to gradually reduce the number of troops in southern Iraq over the next 22 months as Iraqi forces take on more responsibility for the security of Basra and the surrounding areas .
Ministers have taken on board the message coming from military chiefs over many months - namely that the presence of British troops on the streets of Basra is increasingly unnecessary , even provocative .
The reduction of just 1,000 by early summer cited by officials yesterday is significantly less than anticipated in reports that British troops in southern Iraq , presently totalling 7,200 , would be cut by half by May .
A more cautious reduction may reflect concern expressed by the Iraqi and US governments about British intentions .
The US has privately admonished Britain claiming it is interested only in Basra .
British ministers and officials say the situation in the Shia - dominated south cannot be compared to Baghdad , which is plagued by Sunni - Shia sectarian violence .
Under the plan due to be outlined by Mr Blair , British troops will gradually move into a single base on the outskirts of Basra .
They will continue to take part in operations but in a role supporting Iraqi security forces rather than leading them , according to defence officials .
They will also continue operating long range desert patrols in Maysan province , north of Basra , along the border with Iran - a mission pressed on Britain by the US which says it is concerned about the smuggling of weapons from Iran .
By the end of next year , all but a few army instructors will have left the country .
Military commanders insist they are encouraged by evidence that the Iraqi army and even local police are now able to maintain order in southern Iraq .
As evidence of progress , Britain yesterday handed over control of an Iraqi army division based in Basra in what it called " a significant step towards Iraqi forces taking responsibility for security in the city " .
For the first time the Iraqi army 's 10th division , trained by British troops , will take orders from Iraqi military headquarters in Baghdad .
Until now , it has been under British control .
Major General Jonathan Shaw , British commander in southern Iraq , signed a memorandum of understanding with General Abdul Lateef Thu'ban , the 10th division commander .
British defence officials also say they have been encouraged by the role played by Iraqi forces in Operation Sinbad , a winter - long campaign designed to root out criminals and supporters of Shia militia from the Basra police force .
In last week 's Operation Troy , Iraqi and British forces sealed the city of Basra and set up checkpoints at border crossings with Iran .
Mr Blair gave an upbeat message when interviewed on Sunday AM on BBC1 .
" It is absolutely true , as we have said for months , that as the Iraqis are more capable in Basra of taking control of their own security we will scale down .
But you 've got to make sure you have sufficient forces in support and in reserve to be able to help the Iraqis if a problem arises , " he said .
Yesterday a bomb destroyed a truck carrying chlorine north of Baghdad , killing at least five people and spewing toxic fumes that left 140 others ill , Iraqi police said .
It was not immediately clear if the blast was caused by a roadside bomb or if the truck was rigged with explosives as a makeshift chemical gas bomb .
In Baghdad , a suicide bomber and two car bombs killed at least 17 yesterday and police said 20 unidentified bodies were found on Monday , a spike in the daily toll after a marked reduction since the start of a US - backed security crackdown .
This is my foreword to Bob Walsh ’s new book , Micro - ISV : From Vision to Reality .
How the heck did I become the poster child for the MicroISV movement ?
Of all people .
Sheesh .
When I started Fog Creek Software there was gonna be nothing “ micro ” about it .
The plan was to build a big , multinational software company with offices in 120 countries and a skyscraper headquarters in Manhattan , complete with a heliport on the roof for quick access to the Hamptons .
It might take a few decades–after all , we were going to be bootstrapped and we always planned to grow slowly and carefully –but our ambitions were anything but small .
Heck , I do n’t even like the term MicroISV .
The “ ISV ” part stands for Independent Software Vendor .
It ’s a made - up word , made up by Microsoft , to mean “ software company that is not Microsoft , ” or , more specifically , “ software company that for some reason we have not yet bought or eliminated , probably because they are in some charming , twee line of business , like wedding table arrangements , the quaintness of which we are just way too cool to stoop down to , but you little people feel free to enjoy yourselves .
Just remember to use . NET ! ”
It ’s like that other term , legacy , that Microsoft uses to refer to all non-Microsoft software .
So when they refer to Google , say , as a “ legacy search engine ” they are trying to imply that Google is merely “ an old , crappy search engine that you ’re still using by historical accident , until you bow to the inevitable and switch to MSN . ”
Whatever .
I prefer “ software company , ” and there ’s nothing wrong with being a startup .
Startup software company , that ’s how we describe ourselves , and we do n’t see any need to define ourselves in relation to Microsoft .
I suppose you ’re reading this book because you want to start a small software company , and it ’s a good book to read for that purpose , so let me use my pulpit here to provide you with my personal checklist of three things you should have before you start your Micro… ahem , startup software company .
There are some other things you should do ; Bob covers them pretty well in the rest of the book , but before you get started , here ’s my contribution .
Number One .
Do n’t start a business if you ca n’t explain what pain it solves , for whom , and why your product will eliminate this pain , and how the customer will pay to solve this pain .
The other day I went to a presentation of six high tech startups and not one of them had a clear idea for what pain they were proposing to solve .
I saw a startup that was building a way to set a time to meet your friends for coffee , a startup that wanted you to install a plug - in in your browser to track your every movement online in exchange for being able to delete things from that history , and a startup that wanted you to be able to leave text messages for your friend that were tied to a particular location ( so if they ever walked past the same bar they could get a message you had left for them there ) .
What they all had in common was that none of them solved a problem , and all of them were as doomed as a long - tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs .
Number Two .
Do n’t start a business by yourself .
I know , there are lots of successful one - person startups , but there are even more failed one - person startups .
If you ca n’t even convince one friend that your idea has merit , um , maybe it does n’t ?
Besides , it ’s lonely and depressing and you wo n’t have anyone to bounce ideas off of .
And when the going gets tough , which it will , as a one - person operation , you ’ll just fold up shop .
With two people , you ’ll feel an obligation to your partner to push on through .
P.S. , cats do not count .
Number Three .
Do n’t expect much at first .
People never know how much money they ’re going to make in the first month when their product goes on sale .
I remember five years ago , when we started selling FogBugz , we had no idea if the first month of sales would be $ 0 or $ 50,000 .
Both figures seemed just as likely to me .
I have talked to enough entrepreneurs and have enough data now to give you a definitive answer for your startup .
That ’s right , I have a crystal ball , and can now tell you the one fact that you need to know more than anything else : exactly how much money you ’re going to make during the first month after your product goes live .
Ready ?
OK .
In the first month , you are going to make ,
about ,
$ 364 , if you do everything right .
If you charge too little , you ’re going to make $ 40 .
If you charge too much , you ’re going to make $ 0 .
If you expect to make any more than that , you ’re going to be really disappointed and you ’re going to give up and get a job working for The Man and referring to us people in startup - land as “ Legacy MicroISVs . ”
That $ 364 sounds depressing , but it ’s not , because you ’ll soon discover the one fatal flaw that ’s keeping 50 % of your potential customers from whipping out their wallets , and then * tada !* you ’ll be making $ 728 a month .
And then you ’ll work really hard and you ’ll get some publicity and you ’ll figure out how to use AdWords effectively and there will be a story about your company in the local wedding planner newsletter and tada !
You ’ll be making $ 1456 a month .
And you ’ll ship version 2.0 , with spam filtering and a Common Lisp interpreter built in , and your customers will chat amongst themselves , and tada !
You ’ll be making $ 2912 a month .
And you ’ll tweak the pricing , add support contracts , ship version 3.0 , and get mentioned by Jon Stewart on The Daily Show and tada !
$ 5824 a month .
Now we ’re cooking with fire .
Project out a few years , and if you plug away at it , there ’s no reason you ca n’t double your revenues every 12 - 18 months , so no matter how small you start , ( detailed math formula omitted – Ed. ) , you ’ll soon be building your own skyscraper in Manhattan with a heliport so you can get to that 20 acre Southampton spread in 30 minutes flat .
And that , I think , is the real joy of starting a company : creating something , all by yourself , and nurturing it and working on it and investing in it and watching it grow , and watching the investments pay off .
It ’s a hell of a journey , and I would n’t miss it for the world .
Another feature that ’s coming along , into Firefox 3 , from the WHATWG Web Applications 1.0 spec is that of Online / Offline events .
This feature serves as the second piece to the “ Offline Web Application ” puzzle ( The first being DOM Storage ) , that ’s really coming into place in Firefox 3 .
What is the purpose of offline events ?
Effectively , in order to build a good offline application , you need to know when you ’re actually offline .
Incidentally , you also need to know when your application has returned to an ‘ online ’ status again .
Generally speaking , the flow for an offline - capable web application would look something like this , written completely in pseudo - code :
function saveData ( item ) { if ( navigator .
onLine ) { saveToServer ( item ) ; } else { toSave .
push ( item ) ; } } function loadData ( item ) { if ( navigator .
onLine ) { return loadFromServer ( item ) ; } else { var result = loadFromQueue ( item ) ; if ( ! result ) { displayError ( ) ; toLoad.push ( item ) ; } return result ; } } setInterval ( function ( ) { if ( navigator .
onLine ) { var item = predictNextItemToBeLoaded ( ) ; loadData ( item ) ; } } , 5000 ) ; window.ononline = function ( ) { toSave.forEach ( saveData ) ; toLoad.forEach ( loadData ) ; } ; window.onload = function ( ) { document.getElementById(" myform " ) .onsubmit = function ( ) { saveData ( this ) ; return false ; } ; } ;
As you can see from this code , there are two very important aspects at play :
You need to know when the service comes back online , so that you can re-synchronize with the server .
You need to know when your service is offline , so that you can be sure to queue your requests for a later time .
It is this process that offline events helps to trivialize .
So let ’s take at the API that we ’re given by the specification :
navigator.onLine
This is a single property that maintains a true / false value ( true for online , false for offline ) .
Currently , this property is updated ( in Firefox ) whenever you switch into “ Offline Mode ” ( more details at the end of this post ) .
Additionally , this property should update whenever a browser is no longer capable of connecting to the network .
According to the specification :
The navigator .
on Line attribute must return false if the user agent will not contact the network when the user follows links or when a script requests a remote page ( or knows that such an attempt would fail ) …
As of this time , Firefox only appears to update this property when switching to / from the browser ’s Offline mode .
One point that I found to be curious , about this property , was it ’s naming .
It appears as if someone originally felt that “ online ” was spelled “ on - line ” ( and since you ca n’t have dashes in JavaScript property names , converted it to its camelcase equivalent , “ onLine ” ) .
Unsurprisingly , this naming convention is a bit of legacy .
Interestingly , this property already exists in Firefox and Internet Explorer ( the specification based itself off of these prior implementations ) , so you can begin using them today .
“ online ” and “ offline ” events
These two events are the truly - new aspects of offline events .
They are fired against the document body of any page that switches inbetween online and offline mode .
Additionally , the event bubbles up from document . body , to document , ending at window .
Both of the events are non-cancellable ( you ca n’t prevent the user from coming online , or going offline ) .
As a side note , Mozilla has had these built in to its XPCOM layer for some time now , specifically the network : offline - status - changed event .
A Simple Test
In the ticket that describes the implementation of these events in Firefox , there ’s a simple test case that you can run to verify that the events are working .
Considering that you probably do n’t want to go through the trouble of building your own copy of “ Minefield ” , let ’s take a quick look at what happens in this test ’s code .
<! doctype html > < html > < head > < script > function updateOnlineStatus ( msg ) { var status = document.getElementById(" status " ) ; var condition = navigator .
on Line ?
" ONLINE " : " OFFLINE " ; status.setAttribute(" class " , condition ) ; var state = document.getElementById(" state " ) ; state.innerHTML
= condition ; var log = document.getElementById( " log " ) ; log.appendChild(document.createTextNode(" Event : " + msg + " ; status= " + condition + "
" ) ) ; } function loaded ( ) { updateOnlineStatus ( " load " ) ; document.body.addEventListener( " offline " , function ( ) { updateOnlineStatus ( " offline " ) } , false ) ; document.body.addEventListener(" online " , function ( ) { updateOnlineStatus ( " online " ) } , false ) ; } </script > < style >...</ style > </ head > < body onload= " loaded ( ) " > < div id =" status " >< p id =" state " ></p></div> < div id =" log " ></div > </body > </html >
There are four important lines to take note of : 7 , 16 , 19 , and 26 .
We ’ll be looking at them in depth here .
You ’ll notice , that if you tried to run the test in your browser ( even if you did n’t have the bleeding - edge build ) , that it worked !
You probably saw a result just like this :
Why is this the case ?
As I mentioned before , Firefox already has support for the navigator .
on Line event , the only thing that ’s been added was the addition of events to notify you when the property changes .
Incidentally , you can still bind an onload= ” ” event and check for a browser ’s online / offline status there .
Now , you might be asking yourself ( as I did ) , when can a page load and NOT have a status of “ online ” ?
Upon reading through some of the information available , it appears as if this can occur when a page is loaded directly from the browser ’s cache , while you ’re in an offline mode .
These are the steps that Mark Finkle took to reproduce this :
Load a web page from a bookmark .
Put the browser into offline mode .
Close the browser .
Open the browser .
( Incidentally , you ’re back in online mode . )
Re-enable offline mode .
Click the bookmark again , and you ’ll be visiting the “ offline ” copy of that page .
Let ’s take a look , now , at the browser ’s “ Work offline ” mode , and what that offers to us web application developers .
Enable Offline Mode
In a nutshell : Offline mode is a means , through which , a user can tell the browser to be much greedier , and possibly more proactive , about the caching that it performs .
Effectively , a browser will try to use the browser ’s cache as much as possible .
In order to move into offline mode , you can toggle the menu option like so :
This triggers the “ offline ” event – giving your web application the ability to react , and behave , accordingly .
Disable Offline Mode
Additionally , when it comes time for the user to move back into “ online ” mode , another event is fired ( which can be handled and interpreted ) .
Summary and Comments
This is a really handy feature , and certainly a great tool for making offline web application simpler .
I ’m looking forward to its widespread adoption .
My biggest gripe with the feature , right now , is more in its implementation ( rather than its concept ) .
There ’s a huge amount of ambiguity concerning what “ Working Offline ” means .
It ’s not really clear what is supposed to happen when that menu option is triggered – nor , what exactly , is supposed to trigger the online / offline events .
I see a huge amount of potential in Firefox 3 ’s offline capabilities , however they really need to be clarified – and made useful to the user .
Hooking “ offline ” mode purely to network connectivity would be a great start .
( Forcing the user to toggle some sort of offline mode is cumbersome – especially considering that most of the time that I go offline , it ’s not of my own free will . )
In short : I think Firefox 3 is off to a great start , in supporting offline web applications , but we still have a ways to go in order to make the whole process ( both for users and for developers ) as smooth as possible .
More than a year ago , I wrote about the increasing risks of data loss because more and more data fits in smaller and smaller packages .
Today I use a 4 - GB USB memory stick for backup while I am traveling .
I like the convenience , but if I lose the tiny thing I risk all my data .
Encryption is the obvious solution for this problem – I use PGPdisk – but Secustick sounds even better :
It automatically erases itself after a set number of bad password attempts .
The company makes a bunch of other impressive claims :
The product was commissioned , and eventually approved , by the French intelligence service ; it is used by many militaries and banks ; its technology is revolutionary .
Unfortunately , the only impressive aspect of Secustick is its hubris , which was revealed when Tweakers .
net completely broke its security .
There 's no data self - destruct feature .
The password protection can easily be bypassed .
The data is n't even encrypted .
As a secure storage device , Secustick is pretty useless .
On the surface , this is just another snake - oil security story .
But there 's a deeper question :
Why are there so many bad security products out there ?
It 's not just that designing good security is hard – although it is – and it's not just that anyone can design a security product that he himself cannot break .
Why do mediocre security products beat the good ones in the marketplace ?
In 1970 , American economist George Akerlof wrote a paper called " The Market for ' Lemons ' " ( abstract and article for pay here ) , which established asymmetrical information theory .
He eventually won a Nobel Prize for his work , which looks at markets where the seller knows a lot more about the product than the buyer .
Akerlof illustrated his ideas with a used car market .
A used car market includes both good cars and lousy ones ( lemons ) .
The seller knows which is which , but the buyer can't tell the difference – at least until he 's made his purchase .
I 'll spare you the math , but what ends up happening is that the buyer bases his purchase price on the value of a used car of average quality .
This means that the best cars do n't get sold ; their prices are too high .
Which means that the owners of these best cars do n't put their cars on the market .
And then this starts spiraling .
The removal of the good cars from the market reduces the average price buyers are willing to pay , and then the very good cars no longer sell , and disappear from the market .
And then the good cars , and so on until only the lemons are left .
In a market where the seller has more information about the product than the buyer , bad products can drive the good ones out of the market .
The computer security market has a lot of the same characteristics of Akerlof 's lemons market .
Take the market for encrypted USB memory sticks .
Several companies make encrypted USB drives – Kingston Technology sent me one in the mail a few days ago – but even I could n't tell you if Kingston 's offering is better than Secustick .
Or if it 's better than any other encrypted USB drives .
They use the same encryption algorithms .
They make the same security claims .
And if I can't tell the difference , most consumers wo n't be able to either .
Of course , it 's more expensive to make an actually secure USB drive .
Good security design takes time , and necessarily means limiting functionality .
Good security testing takes even more time , especially if the product is any good .
This means the less - secure product will be cheaper , sooner to market and have more features .
In this market , the more - secure USB drive is going to lose out .
I see this kind of thing happening over and over in computer security .
In the late 1980s and early 1990s , there were more than a hundred competing firewall products .
The few that " won " were n't the most secure firewalls ; they were the ones that were easy to set up , easy to use and did n't annoy users too much .
Because buyers could n't base their buying decision on the relative security merits , they based them on these other criteria .
The intrusion detection system , or IDS , market evolved the same way , and before that the antivirus market .
The few products that succeeded were n't the most secure , because buyers could n't tell the difference .
How do you solve this ?
You need what economists call a " signal , " a way for buyers to tell the difference .
Warrantees are a common signal .
Alternatively , an independent auto mechanic can tell good cars from lemons , and a buyer can hire his expertise .
The Secustick story demonstrates this .
If there is a consumer advocate group that has the expertise to evaluate different products , then the lemons can be exposed .
Secustick , for one , seems to have been withdrawn from sale .
But security testing is both expensive and slow , and it just is n't possible for an independent lab to test everything .
Unfortunately , the exposure of Secustick is an exception .
It was a simple product , and easily exposed once someone bothered to look .
A complex software product – a firewall , an IDS – is very hard to test well .
And , of course , by the time you have tested it , the vendor has a new version on the market .
In reality , we have to rely on a variety of mediocre signals to differentiate the good security products from the bad .
Standardization is one signal .
The widely used AES encryption standard has reduced , although not eliminated , the number of lousy encryption algorithms on the market .
Reputation is a more common signal ; we choose security products based on the reputation of the company selling them , the reputation of some security wizard associated with them , magazine reviews , recommendations from colleagues or general buzz in the media .
All these signals have their problems .
Even product reviews , which should be as comprehensive as the Tweakers '
Secustick review , rarely are .
Many firewall comparison reviews focus on things the reviewers can easily measure , like packets per second , rather than how secure the products are .
In IDS comparisons , you can find the same bogus " number of signatures " comparison .
Buyers lap that stuff up ; in the absence of deep understanding , they happily accept shallow data .
With so many mediocre security products on the market , and the difficulty of coming up with a strong quality signal , vendors do n't have strong incentives to invest in developing good products .
And the vendors that do tend to die a quiet and lonely death .

The form asks for a " detailed menstrual history "
The ministry of personnel says that the decision to delete the controversial part of the form was taken following an intervention by the prime minister .
Some female civil servants described the form as grossly insensitive .
The questions were reported to have been put in the 2007 appraisal on advice from the health ministry .
Intervene
" Following a series of protests we have decided to delete the objectionable part of the form which require women to provide details of their menstrual cycles , " the secretary of the personnel department at the Ministry for Personnel , Public Grievances and Pensions , Satyanand Mishra , told the BBC Hindi service .
Female civil servants say they are being discriminated against
The decision to scrap the " menstrual question " was taken after the Communist Party of India ( Marxist ) MP and women 's activist , Brinda Karat led a delegation to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and asked him to intervene in the matter .
He in turn directed the ministry of personnel to drop the objectionable parts of the new appraisal form , Mr Mishra said .
Correspondents say that senior ministers were embarrassed over the issue , and wanted to stop left parties from making political capital out of it .
Ms Karat described the decision as a " victory for common sense " .
Annual appraisals and health checks are mandatory in India 's civil service , one of the country 's largest employers .
HAVE YOUR SAY
There are some things that employers do n't need to know and this is one of them

Send us your comments
Mr Mishra said on Thursday that since women officers had raised objections about certain questions in the form , he had written to the health ministry to ask whether specific information about their menstrual cycles was really required .
He was quoted earlier this week as saying that he assumed the new questions would " help evaluate the officer 's fitness " .
Under the new nationwide requirements , female officials also have to say when they last sought maternity leave .
One senior female member of staff said she was " gob smacked " at being asked about her menstrual cycle .
' shocked '
The questions at the root of the controversy are on page 58 of the new appraisal forms for the current year issued by the Ministry for Personnel , Public Grievances and Pensions .
Women officers must write down their " detailed menstrual history and history of LMP [ last menstrual period ] including date of last confinement [ maternity leave ] , " the form says .
Women working in the civil service told the BBC the government had no need for this kind of personal information .
" I am completely shocked ! " said Sharwari Gokhale , environment secretary in western Maharashtra state .
" I have absolutely no words to describe how I feel and I have no intention of telling them anything about my personal life .
I am gob smacked . "

The videos of Seung - hui Cho , the man who fatally shot 32 people at Virginia Tech on Monday and then killed himself , should n't have been released because they do n't offer the public any greater understanding of the gruesome crime , said Michael Welner , a forensic psychiatrist and ABC News consultant , on " Good Morning America " today .
" If anybody cares about the victims in Blacksburg and if anybody cares about their children , stop showing this video now .
Take it off the Internet .
Let it be relegated to YouTube , " Welner said .
" This is a social catastrophe .
Showing the video is a social catastrophe . "
During a pause in his killing spree Monday , Cho sent a package that included 43 photos , video clips and a letter to NBC .
NBC received the package Wednesday .
The videos included Cho 's rants on the reasoning behind the crimes he was presumably about to commit .
" Do you know what it feels like to be torched alive ?
Do you know what it feels like to be humiliated and impaled on a cross and left to bleed to death for your amusement ?
You have never felt a single ounce of pain in your whole lives .
You have vandalized my heart , raped my soul and torched my conscience , " Cho said in the videos .
Welner believes that instead of offering insight , these videos merely offer validation of delusional behavior .
" I think that 's very important for the viewing audience to understand .
This is not him .
These videos do not help us understand him .
They distort him .
He was meek .
He was quiet .
This is a PR tape of him trying to turn himself into a Quentin Tarantino character , " Welner said .
" This is precisely why this should not be released .
Parents , you should cut the pictures out of the newspaper .
Do not let your children see it .
Take them out of the room when these videos are shown .
Because he 's paranoid and his agenda of blaming the rest of the world is unedited . "
" There 's nothing to learn from this except giving it validation .
If this rambling showed up in an emergency room , my colleagues and I would listen carefully and , when we reflected that it was delusional , would go see the next patient and start the medication , " he said .
" This makes it sound like he was tormented .
He was n't . "
Although the school and authorities have been criticized in recent days about reports of Cho 's mental states and past run-ins with students , Welner said that unless someone appeared to be high risk there was little medical professionals could do .
" In an emergency room , again , unless someone is at high risk , then there 's nothing you can do .
[ Cho ] presented to mental health authorities .
He 's certainly capable of presenting himself quietly , " Welner said .
Welner also said that he believed showing the video just gave fodder to people who were already isolated and disaffected .
" I promise you the disaffected will watch him the way they watched ' Natural Born Killers . '
I know .
I examine these people , " he said .
" I 've examined mass shooters who have told me they 've watched it 20 times .
You cannot saturate the American public with this kind of message . "
Welner maintained , however , that he was not blaming the media for airing the footage .
" It 's not an issue of blame .
It 's an appeal .
Please stop now .
That 's all , " he said .
" If you can take [ talk show host Don ] Imus off the air , you can certainly keep [ Cho ] from having his own morning show . "
" They turn themselves into icons .
They get articles written about themselves in The New York Times .
This is perversion .
We have to send a message to alienated people , you know what ?
You hate everybody around you ?
You 're paranoid .
You 're sad .
You 're depressed .
But these people are perverts , " Welner said .
" They 're … not powerful .
He 's a weak link .
He needs to create and produce his own picture in order to give himself a sense of power .
Nobody saw him that way .
He did n't see himself that way and that 's why he set this up and he did this to achieve immortality .
We have to stop giving him that and we can do it now . "
With the sale of his company JBoss to Red Hat , Marc Fleury will be going to work for an open source pretender that has never done much in the way of innovation .
Or , at least that 's what Fleury used to think .
An archived blog post from September of 2004 reveals Fleury 's candid opinion of Red Hat .
You will , however , struggle to find Fleury 's writings as Red Hat and JBoss have tried to erase the comments from the internet 's memory .
Luckily , we 're here to help with a cached image .
" Today RH * IS * a proprietary vendor , " Fleury wrote .
" Their whole business is around proprietary wrappers to Open Source Linux to drive the subscription business .
" RH is a packager , it does n't create JACK , it does n't create Linux , it wraps it up in proprietary shit .
And no the contributions that they make do n't really count .
Linus Torvalds creates Linux . "
Tell us how you really feel , Marc .
" But what really gets me , is this :
Our own talks with RH broke down , RH is NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF PAYING OPEN SOURCE DEVELOPERS .
We are , that is why we created JBoss inc. RH wanted to keep the services revenues all to themselves .
That is the dirty little secret , so for them to come out and claim they are the open source when we know the reality is distasteful . "
Fleury seems to have gotten past these issues and has accepted Red Hat 's $ 350 m bid for JBoss .
When the deal closes , Fleury will report to Red Hat CEO Matthew Szulik .
" The union of these two companies will demonstrate the benefits of a pure open source play , " Fleury said in a statement today , countering past contentions that Red Hat is a shit - wrapping " open source wannabee " and " open source girly man " .
Neither Red Hat nor JBoss has returned our calls seeking comment .
This author noticed the missing text .
You can catch the original post here and the missing text here .
One blog post that is still hanging around is this rather nonsensical item from Fleury 's wife .
Surely the Red Hat lawyers could have saved us from that too ? ®
To conservatives , this talk of communism 's root causes looked like an effort to rationalize evil , to suggest America 's real foe was not communism itself , but the forces that produced it .
" The fact that some poor , illiterate people have ' gone Communist ' does not prove that poverty caused them to do so , " insisted Barry Goldwater , the first National Review - style conservative to win a Republican presidential nomination .
On domestic policy , the argument was similar .
For liberals , the New Deal had tempered capitalism 's instability and inequality , thus preserving Americans ' belief in democracy when people were losing it around the world .
America 's ongoing task , Niebuhr argued , was to " make our political and economic life more worthy of our faith and therefore more impregnable . "
But for conservatives , the liberal push for equality at home did not strengthen America in its cold - war struggle ; it undermined the very ideological clarity upon which that struggle relied .
Viewed from the right , Franklin Roosevelt had already moved America perilously far along what the Austrian émigré economist Friedrich von Hayek famously called the " road to serfdom . "
And the more the United States aped communism , the less it would recognize its evil .
" The liberal 's arm cannot strike with consistent firmness against communism , " Burnham wrote , " because the liberal dimly feels that in doing so he would be somehow wounding himself .
"
In the years since 9/11 restored foreign policy to the heart of American politics , these cold - war debates have returned in another form , with the critical difference that only one side knows its lines .
Even before the attacks , many conservatives feared America was emasculating itself yet again .
In a one - superpower world , they argued , America no longer had to tailor its foreign policy to the wishes of others .
And yet , in the conservative view , the Clinton administration had permitted constraints on American power , playing Gulliver to foreign Lilliputians intent on binding it in a web of international institutions and international law .
Predictably , conservatives attributed this submission to America 's lack of faith in itself .
The " religion of nonjudgmentalism , " wrote William Bennett in the book " Why We Fight : Moral Clarity and the War on Terrorism , " " has permeated our culture , encouraging a paralysis of the moral faculty . "
In his first eight months in office , President Bush aggressively reasserted American freedom of action , repudiating no fewer than six international agreements or institutions .
And after 9/11 , he began depicting this freedom to act alone as a means not merely of safeguarding American interests but also of liberating American virtue so it could remake the world .
In 2002 , the conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer noted that " people are now coming out of the closet on the word ' empire . ' "
And that discussion had an idealistic cast .
For its proponents , " empire " was usually preceded by the adjective " benign " or " liberal . "
In other words , the United States would rid itself of external impediments but nonetheless act in the global good , uncorrupted by the temptations of unrestrained power .
It has not turned out that way .
On global warming , an America liberated from international restraint has acted irresponsibly ; in our antiterrorist prisons , we have acted inhumanely .
And from the moment the United States invaded Iraq , the Bush administration 's complacent certainty of its own benevolence has blinded it to the dangers of colonial rule .
While the authors of the Marshall Plan avoided remaking Europe 's economy , for fear of sparking nationalist resentment , the head of the Coalition Provisional Authority , L. Paul Bremer III , unilaterally rescinded Iraq 's import tariffs on foreign goods .
Bremer may have thought he was acting on Iraq 's behalf , even without its people 's consent .
But that is only because he lacked the self - consciousness and humility to see that he was not .
As Larry Diamond , a more reflective C.P.A. official , noted : " American political leaders need to take a cold shower of humility : we do not always know what is best for other people , even when we think it is their interests we have in mind .
And as I saw during my time in Iraq , it was frequently our interests that were driving decisions we were trying to impose . "
Niebuhr could n't have said it better himself .
But for all their practical failures , conservatives have at least told a coherent political story , with deep historical roots , about what keeps America safe and what makes it great .
Liberals , by contrast , have offered adjectives drawn from focus groups and policy proposals linked by no larger theme .
In his 2004 convention acceptance speech , John Kerry used variations of the word " strong " 17 times .
For the 2006 campaign , Congressional Democrats have unveiled a national - security vision they call " tough and smart . "
It calls for more spending on homeland security , energy independence and Special Forces .
But these disparate , worthy proposals are not grounded in an account of the world America faces , or the sources of American strength .
In fact , present conditions make liberalism 's forgotten story especially compelling .
The unprecedented post - cold - war gap between America 's military power and every other nation 's does not make international institutions unnecessary , as the right argues ; it makes them even more essential .
The liberals of the early cold war , who had seen depression and war cross the oceans and imperil the United States , believed America could guarantee neither its prosperity nor its security alone .
And globalization makes that even truer today .
The world 's increased integration has left the United States more vulnerable to pathologies bred in other nations .
So more than ever before , American security requires economic , political and even military interventions in the internal affairs of other nations : to stop bird flu from spreading in rural China , corruption from sparking a banking collapse in Thailand or jihadists from plotting in Pakistan .
( As published on OpEdNews December 2nd , 2006 )
A man whose country has been invaded and is under occupation by the most powerful nation in the world is suddenly arrested in the middle of the night and taken away from his family and friends by the army of his occupiers .
As he is rendered from place to place his startled loved ones have no idea where he has been taken .
He is put on trial .
Despite the fact that the court procedure falls pathetically short of providing him with the Due Process that is indeed at the very core of any definition of civilized government , and despite the fact that laws of neither his own country nor those of their occupiers are followed in his hearings , he is convicted and harshly sentenced .
He is beaten and tortured mercilessly , publicly shamed beyond measure and eventually he is put to death .
The leader of the occupying nation , whose military has made a gruesome habit of such atrocities publicly washes his hands of the whole affair .
This is the story of the man named Jesus of Nazareth , whom we know as The Christ , The Chosen One , The Son of Man , the only begotten Son of God. Our Saviour .
It is also the story of a number of men that have been arrested by our military and sent on orders from our government to Guantanamo Bay in Cuba , Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan , Abu Gahrib in Iraq as well as being â€œfarmed outâ€ to Syria and other nations where there are no restrictions on torture to be concerned with .
To support or even passively allow these actions by our government is abject hypocrisy – enough so that if you do support these policies and actions actively I would question the depth of your understanding of the great price – the gruesomely atrocious death – paid for your soulâ€™s ransom .
This according to our understanding of the redemptive sacrifice of the Lamb of God – the blood of Jesus shed for us upon the cross .
Indeed , if you actively support such policies and actions I would question the very salvation you may arrogantly assume for yourself .
Are you a Roman – supporting torture , extreme rendition and even capital punishment being meted out by our government without the charges against the accused being made public , without a fair trial , without representation or the right to know and dispute the charges against him ?
Are you standing at the foot of the cross screaming : â€ œCrucify him !â€?â€™
Or are you a Christian – standing in the gap as Christ did and does between every evil thing and those who are powerless unto themselves to escape a hideous end ?
Are you at the foot of the cross or are you willing to let your sins of complicity in all of this be nailed there ?
The School of the Americas in Fort Benning , Georgia , from which the American government exports torture techniques to the world , must be closed at once in the name of God .
You must insist upon it or leave Jesus and walk away forever from the tree upon which he was hung , leaving him there forever :

Scientists are figuring out how magicians fool our brains in research that also helps uncover how our mind actually works .
A great deal of what scientists now understand about how the human visual system works stems from research into our susceptibility to optical illusions .
" It made sense to look at magicians to advance knowledge of human cognition , since magicians have been working on figuring out how certain principles of psychology work for hundreds of years , " said researcher Gustav Kuhn at the University of Durham in England , a cognitive psychologist who has also performed magic the past couple decades .
" Magicians really have this ability to distort your perceptions , to get people to perceive things that never happened , just like a visual illusion , " he added .
The researchers looked into a magic trick called the " vanishing ball , " in which a ball apparently disappears in midair .
It 's done by faking a throw while keeping the ball secretly palmed in the magician 's hand .
Kuhn videotaped himself performing two versions of the illusion .
In the " pro-illusion " version , on the fake throw , his gaze and head followed an imaginary ball moving upwards .
In the " anti-illusion " version , Kuhn 's eyes stayed on the hand concealing the ball [ video ] .
Videos Disappearing Ball How to Levitate Turn a Lemon into a Battery Videos Disappearing Ball How to Levitate Turn a Lemon into a Battery
Roughly two - thirds of volunteers watching the pro-illusion version on television had a vivid recollection of the ball leaving the top of the screen .
" Often they claimed someone at the top of the screen caught the ball , " Kuhn told LiveScience .
In comparison , only a third of the people viewing the anti-illusion version experienced that illusion .
Kuhn and his colleagues measured the eye movements of volunteers during the experiment .
Surprisingly , they found that when people believed they saw the ball vanish , most claimed they spent their entire time looking at the ball , yet most actually glanced at the magician 's face prior to following the ball to help them perceive the ball 's location .
" Even though people claimed they were looking at the ball , what you find is that they spend a lot of time looking at the face .
While their eye movements were n't fooled by where the ball was , their perception was .
It reveals how important social cues are in influencing perception , " Kuhn said .
" As we are looking at the world , we have this impression that what we see is the real world .
What this tells us is the way we see the world is more strongly dominated by how we perceive it to be rather than what it actually is , " Kuhn added .
" Even though the ball never left the hand , the reason people saw it leave is because they expected the ball to leave the hand .
It 's the beliefs about what should happen that override the actual visual input . "
In the future , the researchers plan to investigate how other magic tricks fool the brain .
Kuhn and his colleagues will report their findings in the Nov. 21 issue of the journal Current Biology .

The most compelling reason for establishing a base on the Moon is to insure the future of humanity on Earth .
( credit : NASA ) Why the Moon ?
Human survival !
NASA wants to return humans to the Moon .
Those of us who are middle - aged or older may recall that we have been there before .
I can conjure up images of blurred figures in spacesuits jumping about on my black - and white 12 - inch television screen .
This time the plan , the Vision for Space Exploration , calls for the construction of a permanently - staffed lunar base .
The cost has not been presented , but outside estimates have placed at it a few hundred billion dollars .
This idea deserves praise , but the reasons provided for it have provoked the opposite reaction .
NASA presented a justification for this expenditure on its web site late last year .
After consulting with over 1,000 individuals and 13 international space agencies , NASA produced six general themes , which have already been discussed and criticized in The Space Review .
( See “ Moonbase why ” , December 11 , 2006 and “ Just how full of opportunity is the Moon ” , February 12 , 2007 ) I shall not repeat this discussion , but I can illustrate it with a single concrete example : scientific knowledge .
The idea of a moonbase deserves praise , but the reasons provided for it have provoked the opposite reaction .
On a 30 - second video that accompanies the NASA presentation , Laurie Leshin of the Goddard Space Flight Center explains that “ studying lunar rocks and craters helps us understand life right here on Earth ” .
These goals are admirable , but is the lunar approach cost - effective ?
Will the study of lunar rocks and craters really tell us more about life here than several thousand separate projects at the National Institutes of Health ?
The majority of the science community does not agree .
For example , a critical editorial in Chemical and Engineering News ( February 5 , 2007 ) was titled “ NASA ’s Bad Idea ” and Nature ( February 1 , 2007 ) commented “ science does not come close to offering a justification . ”
The public media have shown a comparable disenchantment .
For example , an editorial in the Los Angeles Times carried the blunt message “ Do n’t colonize the moon . ”
They felt that robotic exploration would harvest the same results at a much reduced cost .
Other observers have presented an even simpler alternative :
Why go at all ?
The money could be better spent on improvements at home .
Science writer Dennis Overbye pointed out in the New York Times that “ the moonbase could disappear like raindrops in the desert during the four presidential administrations and nine Congresses to come between now and 2024 . ”
That year was proposed as a target for permanent lunar habitation .
I am not writing here to add my voice to the chorus of Moon - bashers , but to express my astonishment that NASA , and most supporters of space , have overlooked the one goal that , even if taken alone , would justify the massive cost of a permanent lunar base : insuring the survival of our species , and of the civilization that sustains us .
Each year I insure my home for perhaps one percent of its value , and use a smaller amount to rent a safe deposit box to store valuable documents .
What value do we place on our entire scientific , medical , and technical literature , together with our literary , artistic , and musical heritage ?
To raise the stakes , let me add the value of our own lives and those of all of our unborn descendents .
This possibility was described eloquently more than two decades ago by Johnathan Schell in his anti-nuclear was treatise The Fate of the Earth .
In his words : “ But although the untimely death of everyone in the world would in itself constitute an unimaginably huge loss , it would bring with it a separate , distinct loss that would be in a sense even huger - the cancellation of all future generations of human beings . ”
NASA , and most supporters of space , have overlooked the one goal that , even if taken alone , would justify the massive cost of a permanent lunar base : insuring the survival of our species , and of the civilization that sustains us .
Of course , we have been hearing predictions of Doomsday for years , and we are still here .
According to geologists , the eruption of Mt. Toba in Indonesia 71,000 years ago darkened the sky for years .
The event caused killed much of plant life on the planet .
The famine that resulted caused a severe drop in the human population of that time .
The Black Death of the 14th century killed perhaps one - third of the population of Europe and the great flu epidemic of 1918 claimed an estimated 40 million victims .
Despite these disasters , and others such as global wars , humanity has muddled through and even prospered .
Why should things be different now ?
The answer is simple .
Our prospects have worsened because we have come to a unique place in human history .
Suppose we wanted to conjure up a recipe for human disaster .
Here is my suggestion about steps that we might take : ( 1 ) Let the population swell up to seven billion or more .
Then we will need vast and complex systems to ensure the production of food , materials , and energy sources , as well as transportation to deliver the goods .
By increasing our numbers , we will also increase the playing field in which new viruses can develop , increase pollution and the probability of dramatic climate change , and hasten the day when important natural resources are exhausted .
( 2 ) Computerize the operation of the food , energy , and transportation systems , and store all of the instruction manuals and needed references within the computers .
Similarly , place all of our scientific , technical and medical knowledge within computers .
Make the computers more and more complicated , so that only a handful of experts are prepared to deal with a massive failure .
( 3 ) Arrange to have the computers , and most other functions of society , dependent upon the operations of an intricate power grid that is subject to massive and unexplained failure .
We have already had a rehearsal of such an event .
For example , on August 14 , 2003 , 50 million people in the northeast United States were deprived of power for many hours .
The main cause of the blackout , according to the task force charged with its investigation , was the failure of an Ohio power company to trim trees in part of its service area .
In September of that year , a similar blackout shut off power to almost all of Italy and part of Switzerland .
Unintended causes might of course be eclipsed by the deliberate actions of terrorists .
Gregory McNeal estimated in the New York Times that “ a coordinated attack on four or five critical sites could send much of the nation into darkness for weeks . ”
( 4 ) Streamline the production of nuclear and biological weapons so that they become available not only to most heads of state , but also to groups of religious zealots and of extreme nationalists .
Encourage both the exchange of information about such weapons , and their availability on the international black market .
Individuals who are technically competent but mentally unbalanced will then also have access to such weapons , enriching their current arsenal of computer viruses , bombs , and hijacked airplanes .
We need to place a self - sufficient fragment of society out of harm ’s way , which for practical purposes means off the Earth .
All of the above events have already taken place or are likely to occur in the near future .
We may also expect that single disasters may trigger a cascade of others .
For example , my local power company has circulated a card advising its customers to assemble “ at least a three - day supply of water and non-perishable food ” as part of a “ family emergency preparedness plan ” .
But what would we do , in urban centers , when that supply was exhausted but power and transportation had not been restored ?
Looting of stores and warehouses might be expected , together with an attempt by residents to flee to less populated areas where conditions might be better .
Famine and civic disorder will inevitably produce casualties ; unburied bodies could then lead to disease epidemics .
Considerations of this type led Dr. Martin Rees , Professor of Cosmology at Cambridge and President of the Royal Society , to publish a gloomy estimate .
In his 2003 book , Our Final Hour , he gave civilization only a 50 - percent chance of surviving until the year 2100 .
When we face a brand new situation , such probabilities are impossible to calculate .
Countermeasures against each individual threat can of course be taken , but we would also be prudent to back up our civilization and our species .
We need to place a self - sufficient fragment of society out of harm ’s way , which for practical purposes means off the Earth .
A buffer of empty space would protect that sanctuary from virtually all of the catastrophes named above .
Physicist Stephen Hawking , and a number of others , have called for humanity to spread out to distant planets of our Solar System .
But there is no need to go so far to protect ourselves .
After a few decades — centuries at worst — dust and ash will settle , radioactive materials will decay , and viruses will perish .
Earth will once again become the best home for humanity in the Solar System .
Return would be easiest if a safe sanctuary were nearby .
In the more probable instance that only a limited disaster took place , that nearby sanctuary could also play a valuable role in restoring lost data and cultural materials , and coordinating the recovery .
And of course , construction of the rescue base will be much easier if it is only days , rather than months or years , away .
We do not have to build the base from scratch , in an environment of emptiness , as we are attempting to do with the space station .
A suitable platform has been orbiting our planet ever since its formation .
On most clear nights , we need only look up to see it .
If I employ the same arithmetic that I use when I insure my home , the cost of the lunar base can easily be justified .
My house has not burned down , and the disasters I described may not occur .
A host of other benefits , described on the NASA web site , will result from human presence on the Moon .
But we do not need to invoke them to provide reasons for our investment .

has written a great piece about the new publication released by chemical scientists at Sense about Science , called “ Making Sense of Chemical Stories . ”
In the Trevor Butterworth , editor at STATS has written a great piece about the new publication released by chemical scientists at Sense about Science , called “ Making Sense of Chemical Stories . ”
In the free download , they examine six of the most common misconceptions about chemicals in our lives and help us make sense of them .
As Mr. Butterworth writes :
If someone came into your house and offered you a cocktail of butanol , iso amyl alcohol , hexanol , phenyl ethanol , tannin , benzyl alcohol , caffeine , geraniol , quercetin , 3 - galloyl epicatechin , 3 - galloyl epigallocatchin and inorganic salts , would you take it ?
Or would you place it in a secure container and contact the Environmental Working Group for advice ?
If recent media coverage of environmentalists ’ concerns about our exposure to chemicals has left you feeling paranoid , then you might opt for the second option – or , as is more likely , you ’d pour the mix down the drain and leave it for someone else to take care of .
Relax , says research chemist Derek Lohmann , all you ’ve been offered is a cup of tea .

Recently I blogged that copyright violations are analogous to borrowing your neighbor ’s underpants without asking , then laundering and returning them before he returns home .
I was immediately attacked for my analogy .
Critics said my borrowed underpants analogy was flawed for several reasons :
1. Unlike copyrighted material , underpants are physical objects .
So in my analogy , the owner of the underpants would be unable to simultaneously wear the underpants he already has on plus the underpants he intentionally left at home in his drawer .
Apparently this is a problem for some people .
2 . At a microscopic level , the borrowed underpants would be slightly degraded by this one additional wearing .
This is important for people who wear their underpants until the last fiber gives out and the material disintegrates and trickles out the pant legs .
And those were the GOOD criticisms .
If you think I ’m making this up , check out one of my more eloquent critics :
http://techdirt.com/articles/20070412/183135.shtml
Let me explain something about analogies .
Analogies are not supposed to be identical to the thing you are making the analogy about .
Imperfection is necessary .
Otherwise an analogy would be , for example , “ Downloading music without paying is like downloading music without paying . ”
It does n’t add much to your understanding .
The underpants analogy , in its original context , addressed the question of whether copyright violations are a victimless act .
This is separate from the legal question .
The point of the analogy is that the artist who loses legal control over his creation feels violated , just as you would if someone borrowed your underpants .
I dare say it was one of my finest analogies , although admittedly the bar is set low .
In addition , as I previously argued , when an artist loses the ability to control when , and where , his art is distributed , it can be a real economic loss , depending on his marketing plan .
This led to the following brilliant criticism :
1 . Adams thinks artists have the legal right to prevent you from reading a book on the toilet .
Artists never had that right !
Seriously .
That was the criticism .
I was hoping people would understand that I meant the artist would lose control of , for example , whether his book appears on the Internet before it ’s published on paper .
I also heard the argument that any idiot knows copyright violations are good publicity , and as such , they lead to more sales .
I tested this theory last year by making my book , God ’s Debris , available for a free download .
About a million people downloaded it .
Based on my e-mail , a large percentage of them loved it .
( It ’s probably my most loved work , even though a good chunk of people felt it did a bad job of being what it was n’t intended to be . )
The total number who actually went out and bought that book , or the sequel that ’s not available for free , is about 1,000 .
The free download did little but to make the economic value of my sequel appear to be zero .
If giving away your work for free is such a good strategy , you have to wonder why all the major artists are n’t doing it .
Do n’t the big record companies have any economists working for them ?
Or is it possible that the people with advanced degrees in business and economics know more about business and economics than the people downloading music with one hand , while masturbating furiously with the other , and wishing they had a tail to hold the bong ?
Yes , yes , I can see how an unknown band might become popular by making its music available for free .
That makes perfect sense .
Luckily , every artist has that option .
But as my experience with God ’s Debris shows , every situation is unique .
If the artist loses his right to decide when , and if , his creation is available to the world for free , he loses something of potential value , even in the unlikely event that the loss leads to more sales in the long run .
I ca n’t steal a jacket from JC Penney and hope they understand that it ’s good publicity , thus causing several people to buy the same jacket .
It is n’t my right to make that decision , even if I happen to be correct .
There ’s an argument that the world would be better if copyrighted works were available for free to anyone who wants them .
I can only speak for myself , but I can say with certainty that I would n’t have pursued creating Dilbert comics without the potential for getting rich while working at home .
That was my entire motivation .
I worked for about ten years , without a day off , to make Dilbert a success .
There ’s no way I would have done that much work just to earn an average income .
That would have been irrational .
I had easier options .
I think a reasonable person can dislike capitalism and wish for a more socialist world where art is free for all takers .
But a reasonable person can’t expect that a socialist world would produce nearly as much art .
That ’s bat shit thinking .
I invite all bat shit thinkers to reiterate my point that free downloads might help unknown bands , and act as if I did n’t already address that exception .
You are also invited to point out the fact that some middle men and some artists make more money than you do , and should be punished .

UN staff say the hijacked ship , the MV Rozen , is at anchor after delivering food aid in north - eastern Somalia .
There have been no reports of demands from the pirates who boarded the ship armed with AK - 47s .
It is not known if any of the 12 crew have been injured .
Piracy was rampant in Somalia , but stopped during recent Islamist rule .
Since the overthrow of the Union of Islamic Courts at the turn of the year , Somalia has been descending back into the violence and chaos seen in the previous 16 years , and this latest incident raises fears of a resumption of lawlessness on the seas as well .
A World Food Programme spokesman , Said Warsame , said the US warship was still in international waters , but was heading towards the port of Bargal in the Puntland area , where the MV Rozen has docked .
US officials in Nairobi have not confirmed the reports .
" The administration in Puntland is also involved in efforts to secure the release of the vessel and its crew , " Mr Warsame told the BBC .
Puntland 's Ports Minister Sa'id Mohamed
Raage said three police speed boats were planning to surround the pirates .
A policeman said the boats were now in range of the ship .
The crew is composed of six Kenyans and six Sri Lankans , including the captain .
" We asked them to stop going further because our biggest concern is the safety of the 12 crew on board , " Col Abdi Ali Hagafe told the BBC .
Concern
WFP says there are no demands for ransom .
" We know it has been hijacked by pirates but we do not know how many pirates there are , " the WFP's Stephanie Savariaud said .
Ms Savariaud said the Rozen had delivered 1,800 tonnes of food aid to the semi-autonomous Puntland region of Somalia and was returning to its home port of Mombasa in Kenya .
The Rozen was attacked last year off a port south of Mogadishu , but dodged the pirates that time , the WFP said .
In October , Kenya jailed a group of Somali pirates after they were captured by the by the US Navy off the Somali coast .
Meanwhile five people were injured when an unidentified attacker hurled an explosive device at a stall selling fuel in the Somali capital , Mogadishu .
A police officer was among those wounded in the explosion in the north of the capital .
Witnesses said the attacker escaped in a vehicle which sped from the scene .
What do you make of the current situation in Somalia ?
What can be done to resolve the problems in the country ?
Should the whole of Africa be taking responsibility for the situation in Somalia ?

Here 's the entire text of her letter :
Dear Sir :
I 'm writing to urge you to consider blocking in committee the nomination of John Bolton as ambassador to the UN .
In the late summer of 1994 , I worked as the subcontracted leader of a US AID project in Kyrgyzstan officially awarded to a HUB primary contractor .
My own employer was Black , Manafort , Stone & Kelly , and I reported directly to Republican leader Charlie Black .
After months of incompetence , poor contract performance , inadequate in - country funding , and a general lack of interest or support in our work from the prime contractor , I was forced to make US AID officials aware of the prime contractor 's poor performance .
I flew from Kyrgyzstan to Moscow to meet with other Black Manafort employees who were leading or subcontracted to other US AID projects .
While there , I met with US AID officials and expressed my concerns about the project -- chief among them , the prime contractor 's inability to keep enough cash in country to allow us to pay bills , which directly resulted in armed threats by Kyrgyz contractors to me and my staff .
Within hours of sending a letter to US AID officials outlining my concerns , I met John Bolton , whom the prime contractor hired as legal counsel to represent them to US AID .
And , so , within hours of dispatching that letter , my hell began .
Mr. Bolton proceeded to chase me through the halls of a Russian hotel -- throwing things at me , shoving threatening letters under my door and , generally , behaving like a madman .
For nearly two weeks , while I awaited fresh direction from my company and from US AID , John Bolton hounded me in such an appalling way that I eventually retreated to my hotel room and stayed there .
Mr. Bolton , of course , then routinely visited me there to pound on the door and shout threats .
When US AID asked me to return to Bishkek , Kyrgyzstan in advance of assuming leadership of a project in Kazakstan , I returned to my project to find that John Bolton had proceeded me by two days .
Why ?
To meet with every other AID team leader as well as US foreign - service officials in Bishkek , claiming that I was under investigation for misuse of funds and likely was facing jail time .
As US AID can confirm , nothing was further from the truth .
He indicated to key employees of or contractors to State that , based on his discussions with investigatory officials , I was headed for federal prison and , if they refused to cooperate with either him or the prime contractor 's replacement team leader , they , too , would find themselves the subjects of federal investigation .
As a further aside , he made unconscionable comments about my weight , my wardrobe and , with a couple of team leaders , my sexuality , hinting that I was a lesbian ( for the record , I 'm not ) .
When I resurfaced in Kyrgyzstan , I learned that he had done such a convincing job of smearing me that it took me weeks -- with the direct intervention of US AID officials -- to limit the damage .
In fact , it was only US AID 's appoinment of me as a project leader in Almaty , Kazakstan that largely put paid to the rumors Mr. Bolton maliciously circulated .
As a maligned whistleblower , I 've learned firsthand the lengths Mr. Bolton will go to accomplish any goal he sets for himself .
Truth flew out the window .
Decency flew out the window .
In his bid to smear me and promote the interests of his client , he went straight for the low road and stayed there .
John Bolton put me through hell -- and he did everything he could to intimidate , malign and threaten not just me , but anybody unwilling to go along with his version of events .
His behavior back in 1994 was n't just unforgivable , it was pathological .
I cannot believe that this is a man being seriously considered for any diplomatic position , let alone such a critical posting to the UN .
Others you may call before your committee will be able to speak better to his stated dislike for and objection to stated UN goals .
I write you to speak about the very character of the man .
It took me years to get over Mr. Bolton 's actions in that Moscow hotel in 1994 , his intensely personal attacks and his shocking attempts to malign my character .
I urge you from the bottom of my heart to use your ability to block Mr. Bolton 's nomination in committee .
Respectfully yours ,
Melody Townsel

Am gestrigen Donnerstag beschlagnahmten Polizisten bundesweit bei sieben Providern mehr als zehn dedizierte Mietserver .
Die Aktion erfolgte aufgrund von Vorermittlungen der Staatsanwaltschaft Konstanz , wie deren Sprecher Jens Gruhl auf Anfrage von heise online bestätigte .
Es gehe um Webforen , in denen kinderpornografisches Material verbreitet worden sei .
Nähere Informationen möchte die Staatsanwaltschaft zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt bekannt geben .
In mehreren Fällen haben die Beamten offensichtlich auch Server beschlagnahmt , auf denen lediglich der Anonymisierungsdienst TOR ( " The Onion Routing " ) lief .
Aus den Durchsuchungsbeschlüssen geht hervor , dass sich die Staatsanwaltschaft dieser Sachlage durchaus bewusst war .
Vermutlich handelte es sich bei den TOR - Servern um so genannte " Exit Nodes " , die in der TOR - Anonymisierungskaskade als Router zum Zielsystem dienen und deshalb auch in dessen Log -Dateien auftauchen .
Den Betreibern solcher Server ist der durchgeleitete I nhalt nicht bekannt , sie hatten deshalb wahrscheinlich auch keine Kenntnis davon , dass über ihre Server auf kinderpornografisches Material zugegriffen worden war .

Job hunting online gets trickier
Federal regulations kick in today that will make Internet job hunting more complicated .
Here 's what candidates need to know � and change -- now .
NEW YORK ( FORTUNE ) - Friends , be warned :
If you 're hoping to find a new job through a job board or other online channel -- or if you 're an employer seeking candidates on the Web -- the world just got a little bit more difficult .
New federal guidelines meant to standardize how employers track data on the diversity of their job - applicant pool are taking effect starting today for jobs at federal contractors -- and similar rules will kick in later this year at U.S. companies with more than 50 employees .
And resumes and search approaches that worked perfectly well before may no longer do the trick .
In the new system , federal regulators will be checking to see that companies are keeping diversity data on all applicants , according to a new , more uniform definition of " applicant . "
According to this definition , an applicant must " express interest " in the job , whether by sending in a resume , applying on the company 's site , or whatever other means the company requests , says Gerry Crispin , founder and principal of CareerXRoads and a long - time Internet job hunting expert .
That " expression of interest " must show that he or she has all the qualifications for the job listed in the company 's job description ( not just some or most of them ) -- and those qualifications must be specific and measurable .
The applicant must be considered for a specific current or future position , and " never remove himself from consideration for the job , " says Crispin .
For example , " if I have a job opening in Boston , for example , and you 've specified that you want to work in Chicago , I can infer that you 've removed yourself , " he says .
To comply with these new rules and get the most diversity , employers will have an incentive to keep the pool of applicants for each job relatively small and as random as possible .
To make sure you 're considered now , you 'll have to :
Follow the company 's instructions .
" If an employer says that , to apply for a given job , you must go to their web site and enter a certain code number , then do that , " says Crispin .
" Otherwise your resume will never be seen . "
Spell out your qualifications clearly .
" Pay very close attention to the specific qualifications an employer lists for a particular job , and make sure your resume contains those exact words , " Crispin says .
For instance , if a job description includes the words " three years of credit accounting experience , " put " three years of credit accounting experience " on your resume .
" Do n't just list a credit - accounting position with the dates you had it and assume someone will figure it out , " Crispin advises .
This may mean you have to rewrite your resume for each job opening you apply for .
Keep your resume up - to - the - minute current .
" The rules allow companies to pick a random pool of applicants by searching the job boards for ' most recent ' qualified applicants , " Crispin notes .
" In those cases , no one will even look at a resume that is more than two or three weeks old . "
Yikes .
Target specific companies and visit their web sites often .
" The first announcement of a job opening very often appears on a company 's own site before it is posted anywhere else , " says Crispin .
If enough applicants turn up on the site , the employer is unlikely to look any further .
" Companies really do not want 500 or 1,000 applicants for each job , " Crispin says .
" If they get 30 who are qualified , that 's a reasonable number for a hiring manager to consider and select from . "
If someone is referring you for a job , make sure you -- and they -- understand how to do it .
About one - third of all new hires now come through employee - referral programs , and companies are still permitted to run these however they like , as long as they follow a consistent policy .
So if your pal at Ostrich Corp. wants to refer you for a job , know what Ostrich 's policy is ( whether via the company web site , having your friend submit your resume for you in a particular way , or what - have - you ) and follow it to the letter .
Of course , it remains to be seen whether the new rules will actually increase diversity in companies or just create extra work for everybody .
Either way , if you 're looking for a new job , you can't afford to ignore them .
