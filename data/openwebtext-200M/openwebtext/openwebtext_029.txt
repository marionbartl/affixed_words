The Halloween horror hit Saw III was released on Friday in the UK
One woman was taken to hospital and two other adults were treated by medics after fainting in Stevenage , Herts .
And in a separate case , a man collapsed at a cinema in Peterborough , Cambs , " due to the film 's content " .
" If you know you 're squeamish , do n't go , " warned a spokesman for the East of England Ambulance Service .
" This is obviously a blood - thirsty film .
Some of the scenes are fairly horrific , " Matthew Ware told the BBC News website .
All the incidents took place on Friday evening , one of the busiest nights of the week for emergency crews , he added .
Discharged
" Taking three ambulances out of the system on a Friday could potentially be a problem " , said Mr Ware .
A woman in her 20s was discharged from the Lister Hospital in Stevenage after being treated .
And the two other cinemagoers - who had been at the town 's Cineworld complex - were left " in the care of friends and relatives " without needing to be taken to hospital .
A man aged 34 fainted at the Showcase in Peterborough , Mr Ware said .
There was also a case of a 22 - year - old woman passing out at Cineworld in Cambridge on Friday , but it had not been confirmed that she was watching Saw III , he added .
The slasher movie is currently number one in both the UK and North American box office charts .
A spokeswoman for the Cineworld chain said they did not wish to comment .
Another Space Adventures client , Greg Olsen , who made millions in the sale of his camera technology company , Sensors Unlimited , is preparing to visit the space station for several days in October .
Of the Moon trip , he said , " It 's certainly intriguing , and it 's something I 'd like to do . "
Will he buy a ticket , then ?
" One trip at a time , " he replied .
The trip seems feasible , said Dr. John M. Logsdon , director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University .
" As a nontechnical person , I do n't see any technical showstoppers , " Dr. Logsdon said , " if people are crazy enough to do it . "
And , he added , it would make " a lot of money for the Russians . "
Christopher C. Kraft , a former director of the Johnson Space Center , said his feelings about the enterprise were mixed .
" I think it would be a fantastic journey , " he said .
" I could see why , if I had the price of the ticket and could use the money that way , that it would be tempting to go . "
But Mr. Kraft added that the flight would be cramped and probably extremely unpleasant .
With three people in a small Soyuz craft for an extended trip , he said , " I imagine that you could endure that , but , man , it would be tough . "
Mr. Anderson of Space Adventures said the craft had about as much room as a sport utility vehicle .
" Will it be cramped ?
Yes , " he said .
" But will it be doable ?
Yes . "
He noted that the Gemini capsule was smaller than the Soyuz , and that the astronauts James A. Lovell and Frank Borman orbited the Earth for 14 days in the Gemini 7 mission in 1965 .
But Mr. Kraft , who was the flight director for that mission , recalled that Mr. Lovell and Mr. Borman were miserable .
They complained bitterly that the trip was like " 14 days in a men 's room , " and Mr. Kraft said that he had to talk them out of ending the mission early .
" They wanted to get out of there , " he said .

Time Warner seems to have lost patience with the dropping AOL subscriber count , and is making some radical changes to squeeze some profit out of the wilting subsidiary before it 's too late .
AOL management has announced that services that currently cost money will become free - for - all as early as next month .
That includes the flagship e-mail service , content now inside AOL 's subscriber - only walled garden , and even 5GB online storage account through AOL's Xdrive.com service .
The subscription revenues are expected to be replaced by advertising income , which makes the Google partnership all the more vital to AOL 's future success .
Its European dial - up access operations are on the sales block , with a buyer already lined up for the French service and several interested parties swarming around the British and German ones .
That planned divestiture , along with plain old job cuts inside and outside American borders , will remove 5,000 jobs from AOL 's current headcount of 19,000 workers , all over the next six months .
A lot of people still use AOL out of old habit , or because they just do n't know any other way to access the Internet ( Hi , Joseph and Leslie , hope the kids are OK ) .
Now that the same features will be available for free , traffic on AOL 's online properties should increase even as the subscriber count falls through the floor , and online advertising is certainly serving Google quite well .
Still , this remains a dangerous gambit , and places a lot of trust in AOL 's ability to remain relevant even as MySpace , YouTube , Google , and others push into territories where AOL has traditionally ruled the roost .
Now we 'll see how much of that dominance was due to user inertia , and how much was truly based on great products .

Many villagers ran to escape the encroaching hot mud
The sludge , which has been spewing out of the ground for more than two months , is the result of a crack in a gas drilling project near Indonesia 's second city , Surabaya .
In a sign of growing international concern over the disaster , Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono visited the affected area of Sidoarjo last week .
But despite attempts by government officials and the company involved , so far nothing has managed to contain the flow .
The mud now covers around 20 square kilometres .
Climb up a bank of earth at the outskirts of Shiring village and you see it - a lake of mud stretching for kilometre after kilometre .
A white plume of gas marks the spot where it all started ; a crack in the earth spewing out steaming sludge .
You can count the rooftops floating in the mud - marking out factories and schools .
And you can imagine the things you cannot see - the homes , the rice paddies , the furniture , the toys : whole lives buried ; their owners gone , forced to run for higher ground .
' We just ran '
A few kilometres away is what one local person described as a " people market " .
It is a newly - built market place , not yet filled with shops .
Residents have been living in temporary shelters
Instead , most of the 9,000 people who have been displaced by the mud have ended up here , two families to one shop space .
Motorbikes , clothes and plastic buckets mark the entrance to these new homes - a handful of belongings saved from the sludge .
" We were all scared , " Suliati said , as she squatted outside one shop entrance , cooking up a dinner of fried eggs .
" The mud came up to our chest , we did n't have time to save anything from the house , we just ran to save our lives . "
Behind her , her mother nodded agreement .
" Now we have to help each other just to survive , " she said .
" Some people borrow things from us , we borrow other things from them .
We have food , but we 've lost everything else - our homes , our jobs .
It 's a hard time for us . "
Investigation
The gas company running the operation in Sidaorjo , Lapindo Brantas , has been criticised for risking the safety of local people , and allegations of corruption have soured the air .
A criminal investigation has begun into several senior executives from Lapindo and one of their sub-contractors , but the company 's lawyer , Masieyh Sutiono , said the company had done nothing wrong .
Instead , he said , the company was acting responsibly towards local people by offering food and compensation to those affected by the mud , while everyone waited for the results of the police investigation .
Lapindo has been trying to stem the flow of mud , but so far nothing has worked .
The government , meanwhile , is anxious to keep the sludge away from any other residential areas and is putting its faith in a series of dams meant to contain the growing lake .
Trucks carrying mounds of earth to build these new barriers rumble up and down the main highway every couple of minutes , but the dams have not always proved effective .
Earlier this month , a barrier around the village of Shiring burst , causing a second wave of refugees .
Many of those living close to the affected area have now moved out , and many of those that remain are thinking about it .
Rainy season
Mrs Jhoni watches the trucks come and go from the front of her button and bead shop on the main highway .
She is reluctant to leave her customers , and her shop - which is raised a little way above the main road - will give her some protection .
Dams are being built to hold back the mud
But she says she is playing a " wait and see " game and is ready to run whenever things take a turn for the worse .
Officials are working against the clock .
The rainy season is due to begin in two months ' time , and plans to build a stronger , concrete barrier to cope with it have not convinced many of the experts brought in to find a solution .
Heavy rainfall , they say , could break through the barrier in a matter of hours .
Pressure from environmentalists has so far prevented them from using the river to divert tonnes of sludge into the Java Sea .
But with pressure also growing from the local population to find a solution , and with the volume of mud increasing and the rainy season approaching , everyone in Sidoarjo is having to think hard about who will pay the cost of fixing the problem .
By Martha J. SpearAs a high school library media specialist , I have the good fortune to work with , and sometimes mold , young people .
If I ’m lucky , I discover what they do after graduation .
Recently , one of my favorite students informed me that after earning her humanities degree at a tiny private college , she was pursuing a master ’s degree in museum studies .
Congratulating her , I jokingly said , “ Watch it .
That ’s awfully close to a master ’s in library science . ”
She laughed and said : “ Oh , I ’d never do that . ”
Somewhat defensively , I replied , “ You could do worse .
” Long after this brief conversation , I wondered , where did we , as librarians , go wrong ?
Why is there such an onus on this profession that a bright , young person would choose , well , any career but that of librarianship ?
I think it ’s sad .
Librarianship has much to offer , and I think we can do better in promoting our profession .
Toward that end , I present my top 10 reasons for being a librarian .
The single thing I like most about being a librarian is that it is , to paraphrase Ernest Hemingway , a moveable feast .
I ’ve been employed in academic , public , and school libraries in three different states working in technical services , public services , and classrooms , and with street people , teachers , and young adults .
I ’ve booked psychics , mountain climbers , rock musicians , and landlords for programs .
I teach , catalog , book talk , advise , troubleshoot , demonstrate , connect s-video cables , and shelve . . . in a single day .
What I learned in my master ’s program bears little resemblance to what I actually do in my library today .
Yet the principles remain ; and , through conferences , professional literature , and networking , I hold my own .
If the new books do n’t excite me , the new technologies do .
Most importantly , I learn something new every day .
Can you say that about working at McDonald ’s ?
Okay , so I may be stretching things a bit here .
I married a librarian .
( For the record , we met in a singles group ; but our paths would have crossed in local library circles eventually , I ’m sure . )
My case may be extreme , but there is help for the lovelorn in libraries — either in the wonderfully interesting colleagues we meet ( see reasons # 2 and # 7 ) or in the books and resources libraries offer .
I did not enter library school with a soaring heart .
I viewed the degree less as graduate school and more as a kind of trade school .
Truthfully , my library education was both .
I learned the value of organization ( I finally put my massive LP collection in alpha order by artist ) .
I discovered the importance of collection development , equal access to resources , and intellectual freedom .
I learned valuable skills in locating and using information that serve me to this day , whether I ’m helping a patron write a paper on the Manhattan Project or figuring out the best place to buy a teakettle online .
Librarians host good conferences .
I love the hustle and bustle of ALA Annual Conference .
I consider my state conference to be so necessary to my mental well - being that I often pay my own way .
My husband ’s ties to the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions have taken us to Nairobi , Tokyo , Havana , and elsewhere .
What better way to see the world and recharge the professional batteries ?
Conferences are blessed events , and you do n’t have them when you work at Wal - Mart .
Librarians may not get great pay , but we do generally receive liberal vacations .
As a public librarian , I got six weeks off and as a school media specialist . . . well , you do n’t want to know .
In any case , these vacations have made it possible to visit Paris in April , and Beijing in September , and to spend five weeks in Scandinavia .
And when I ’m not away , I ’ve been able to repaper my hallway , paint the family room , and put in a patio .
As a child , when people asked me what I wanted to be , I have to admit I never said librarian .
Although I used and enjoyed libraries , it never occurred to me to actually work in one .
I did say that I wanted a job with scope .
I am not sure what I meant by that then , but I know what it means now .
It means being a librarian .
I do dozens of different things every day .
It ’s not a desk job and it ’s anything but routine .
When you work with people , changing technologies , and always - new resources , how could it be ?
As a librarian , I will never get rich .
However , it has allowed me to live alone ( without the dreaded roommate ) , subsist moderately well , and be employable in different markets and in changing times .
I have made a living as a librarian for almost 25 years and I ’m not on the street corner selling pencils yet .
I ’ve worked in factories where I stood on my feet for nine hours .
I ’ve worked in kitchens where I came home smelling of puréed peas .
I was a production typist where my derrière routinely fell asleep , not to mention my brain .
In a library , you ’re clean , dry , warm , and working with people who are generally happy to be there .
I love librarians ( also see # 9 ) .
We are intelligent , cultured , well - read people who bring a myriad of skills , backgrounds , and interests to the job .
Most of my fellow librarians , myself included , have degrees and / or work experience in other areas .
I backed into librarianship after realizing that a major in English and German was n’t going to make me very employable .
I know librarians who are former attorneys , truck drivers , teachers , and factory workers .
This experiential , intellectual potpourri makes for an interesting mix .
And librarians are readers .
The conversational gambit “ Read any good books lately ? ” is met with a din around librarians .
As librarians , we support the freedom to read .
We champion the right to access information for all people , regardless of race , creed , religion , or economic disposition .
Libraries are everyone ’s university .
These may feel like clich‚s to the converted ( us librarians ) , but they remain truisms .
In sum , I feel very much like Evelyn Carnahan in the film The Mummy .
To refresh your memory , our leading lady is in the midst of describing — and defending — what she does for a living to a roguish male .
They have been drinking .
Evelyn : Look , I — I may not be an explorer , or an adventurer , or a treasure - seeker , or a gunfighter , Mr. O’Connell !
But I am proud of what I am !
Rick O’Connell :
And what is that ?
Evelyn : I am . . . a librarian !
I could n’t have said it better .

Quick guide to somewhat advanced JavaScript
tour of some OO features

last update : February 21st 2006

Hey , I did n't know you could do that
If you are a web developer and come from the same place I do , you have probably used quite a bit of Javascript in your web pages , mostly as UI glue .
Until recently , I knew that Javascript had more OO capabilities than I was employing , but I did not feel like I needed to use it .
As the browsers started to support a more standardized featureset of Javascript and the DOM , it became viable to write more complex and functional code to run on the client .
That helped giving birth to the AJAX phenomena .
As we all start to learn what it takes to write our cool , AJAXy applications , we begin to notice that the Javascript we used to know was really just the tip of the iceberg .
We now see Javascript being used beyond simple UI chores like input validation and frivolous tasks .
The client code now is far more advanced and layered , much like a real desktop application or a client - server thick client .
We see class libraries , object models , hierarchies , patterns , and many other things we got used to seeing only in our server side code .
In many ways we can say that suddenly the bar was put much higher than before .
It takes a heck lot more proficiency to write applications for the new Web and we need to improve our Javascript skills to get there .
If you try to use many of the existing javascript libraries out there , like Prototype.js , Scriptaculous , moo.fx , Behaviour , YUI , etc you 'll eventually find yourself reading the JS code .
Maybe because you want to learn how they do it , or because you 're curious , or more often because that 's the only way to figure out how to use it , since documentation does not seem to be highly regarded with most of these libraries .
Whatever the case may be , you 'll face some kung - fu techniques that will be foreign and scary if you have n't seen anything like that before .
The purpose of this article is precisely explaining the types of constructs that many of us are not familiar with yet .

JSON
JavaScript Object Notation ( JSON , ) is one of the new buzzwords popping up around the AJAX theme .
JSON , simply put , is a way of declaring an object in javascript .
Let 's see an example right away and note how simple it is .
var my Pet = { color : ' black ' , leg_count : 4 , communicate : function ( repeatCount ) { for ( i=0 ; i< repeatCount ;i++ ) alert ( ' Woof ! ' ) ; } } ;
Let 's just add little bit of formatting so it looks more like how we usually find out there :
var my Pet = { color : ' black ' , legCount : 4 , communicate : function ( repeatCount ) { for ( i=0 ; i< repeatCount ;i++ ) alert ( ' Woof ! ' ) ; } } ;
Here we created a reference to an object with two properties ( color and legCount ) and a method ( communicate . )
It 's not hard to figure out that the object 's properties and methods are defined as a comma delimited list .
Each of the members is introduced by name , followed by a colon and then the definition .
In the case of the properties it is easy , just the value of the property .
The methods are created by assigning an anonymous function , which we will explain better down the line .
After the object is created and assigned to the variable myPet , we can use it like this :
alert ( 'my pet is ' + my Pet.color ) ; alert ( 'my pet has ' + myPet.legCount + ' legs ' ) ; // if you are a dog , bark three times : myPet.communicate(3 ) ;
You 'll see JSON used pretty much everywhere in JS these days , as arguments to functions , as return values , as server responses ( in strings , ) etc .
What do you mean ?
A function is an object too ?
This might be unusual to developers that never thought about that , but in JS a function is also an object .
You can pass a function around as an argument to another function just like you can pass a string , for example .
This is extensively used and very handy .
Take a look at this example .
We will pass functions to another function that will use them .
var myDog = { bark : function ( ) { alert ( ' Woof ! ' ) ; } } ; var myCat = { meow : function ( ) { alert ( ' I am a lazy cat .
I will not meow for you . ' ) ; } } ; function annoyThePet( petFunction ) { // let 's see what the pet can do petFunction ( ) ; } //annoy the dog : annoyThePet( myDog.bark ) ; //annoy the cat : annoyThePet( myCat.meow ) ;
Note that we pass myDog.bark and myCat. meow without appending parenthesis " ( ) " to them .
If we did that we would not be passing the function , rather we would be calling the method and passing the return value , undefined in both cases here .
If you want to make my lazy cat start barking , you can easily do this :
myCat.meow = myDog.bark ; myCat.meow ( ) ; //alerts ' Woof ! '
Arrays , items , and object members
The following two lines in JS do the same thing .
var a = new Array ( ) ; var b = [ ] ;
As I 'm sure you already know , you can access individual items in an array by using the square brackets :
var a = [ ' first ' , ' second ' , ' third ' ] ; var v1 = a [ 0 ] ; var v2 = a [ 1 ] ; var v3 = a [ 2 ] ;
But you are not limited to numeric indices .
You can access any member of a JS object by using its name , in a string .
The following example creates an empty object , and adds some members by name .
var obj = {} ; //new , empty object obj [ ' member_1 ' ] = ' this is the member value ' ; obj [ ' flag_2 ' ] = false ; obj [ ' some_function ' ] = function ( ) { /* do something */} ;
The above code has identical effect as the following :
var obj = { member_1 :' this is the member value ' , flag_2 : false , some_function : function ( ) {
/* do something */} } ;
In many ways , the idea of objects and associative arrays ( hashes ) in JS are not distinguishable .
The following two lines do the same thing too .
obj.some_function ( ) ; obj [ ' some_function ' ] ( ) ;
Enough about objects , may I have a class now ?
The great power of object oriented programming languages derive from the use of classes .
I do n't think I would have guessed how classes are defined in JS using only my previous experience with other languages .
Judge for yourself .
// defining a new class called Pet var Pet = function ( petName , age ) { this .
name = petName ; this .age = age ; } ; // let 's create an object of the Pet class var famousDog = new Pet ( ' Santa\'s Little Helper ' , 15 ) ; alert ( ' This pet is called ' + famousDog.name ) ;
Let 's see how we add a method to our Pet class .
We will be using the prototype property that all classes have .
The prototype property is an object that contains all the members that any object of the class will have .
Even the default JS classes , like String , Number , and Date have a prototype object that we can add methods and properties to and make any object of that class automatically gain this new member .
Pet.prototype.communicate = function ( ) { alert ( ' I do not know what I should say , but my name is ' + this .name ) ; } ;
That 's when a library like prototype.js comes in handy .
If we are using prototype.js , we can make our code look cleaner ( at least in my opinion . )
var Pet = Class.create ( ) ; Pet.prototype = { // our ' constructor ' initialize : function ( petName , age ) { this .
name = petName ; this .age = age ; } , communicate : function ( ) { alert ( ' I do not know what I should say , but my name is ' + this .name ) ; } } ;
Functions as arguments , an interesting pattern
If you have never worked with languages that support closures , like Ruby or C#2.0 , you may find the following idiom too funky .
var myArray = [ ' first ' , ' second ' , ' third ' ] ; myArray.each ( function ( item , index ) { alert ( ' The item in the position #' + index + ' is :' + item ) ; } ) ;
Whoa !
Let 's explain what is going on here before you decide I 've gone too far and navigate to a better article than this one .
First of all , in the above example we are using the prototype.js library , which adds the each function to the Array class .
The each function accepts one argument that is a function object .
This function , in turn , will be called once for each item in the array , passing two arguments when called , the item and the index for the current item .
Let 's call this function our iterator function .
We could have also written the code like this .
function myIterator ( item , index ) { alert ( ' The item in the position #' + index + ' is :' + item ) ; } var myArray = [ ' first ' , ' second ' , ' third ' ] ; myArray.each ( myIterator ) ;
But then we would not be doing like all the cool kids in school , right ?
More seriously , though , this last format is simpler to understand but causes us to jump around in the code looking for the myIterator function .
It 's nice to have the logic of the iterator function right there in the same place it 's called .
Also , in this case , we will not need the iterator function anywhere else in our code , so we can transform it into an anonymous function without penalty .
Let 's look at the original example again with some highlighting to hopefully make things clearer .
var myArray = [ ' first ' , ' second ' , ' third ' ] ; myArray.each ( function ( item , index ) { alert ( ' The item in the position #' + index + ' is :' + item ) ; } ) ;
This is this but sometimes this is also that
One of the most common troubles we have with JS when we start writing our code is the use of the this keyword .
It could be a real tripwire .
As we mentioned before , a function is also an object in JS , and sometimes we do not notice that we are passing a function around .
Take this code snippet as an example .
function buttonClicked ( ) { alert ( ' button ' + this .id + ' was clicked ' ) ; } var myButton = document.getElementById('someButtonID ' ) ; var myButton2 = document.getElementById('someOtherButtonID ' ) ; myButton.onclick = buttonClicked ; myButton2.onclick = buttonClicked ;
Because the buttonClicked function is defined outside any object we may tend to think the this keyword will contain a reference to the window or document object ( assuming this code is in the middle of an HTML page viewed in a browser . )
But when we run this code we see that it works as intended and displays the id of the clicked button .
What happened here is that we made the onclick method of each button contain the buttonClicked object reference , replacing whatever was there before .
Now whenever the button is clicked , the browser will execute something similar to the following line .
myButton.onclick ( ) ;
That is n't so confusing afterall , is it ?
But see what happens you start having other objects to deal with and you want to act on these object upon events like the button 's click .
var myHelper = { formFields : [ ] , emptyAllFields : function ( ) { for ( i=0 ; i< this .formFields.length ; i++) { var elementID = this .formFields [i ] ; var field = document.getElementById(elementID ) ; field.value = '' ; } } } ; //tell which form fields we want to work with myHelper.formFields.push('txtName ' ) ; myHelper.formFields.push('txtEmail ' ) ; myHelper.formFields.push(' txtAddress ' ) ; // clearing the text boxes : myHelper.emptyAllFields ( ) ; var clearButton = document.getElementById('btnClear ' ) ; clearButton.onclick = myHelper.emptyAllFields ;
So you think , nice , now I can click the Clear button on my page and those three text boxes will be emptied .
Then you try clicking the button only to get a runtime error .
The error will be related to ( guess what ? ) the this keyword .
The problem is that this .
formFields is not defined if this contains a reference to the button , which is precisely what 's happening .
One quick solution would be to rewrite our last line of code .
clearButton.onclick = function ( ) { myHelper.emptyAllFields ( ) ; } ;
That way we create a brand new function that calls our helper method within the helper object 's context .
Books I 've read and recommend
Some books are just too good not to pass the word forward .
I have n't read a whole lot of Javascript books , but the following books were very helpful to me .
They are very well written and did n't cause me to lose interest before reading half of it .
I 'm comfortable recommending them if you 're on the market for a new book .
SAN FRANCISCO – Jim Harper left his hotel early Thursday at 5:30 a.m. to give himself more than two hours to clear security at San Francisco International Airport .
It was n't that he was worried the security line would be long , but because he accepted a dare from civil liberties rabble - rouser John Gilmore to test whether he could actually fly without showing identification .
Gilmore issued the challenge at Wednesday 's meeting of the Department of Homeland Security 's privacy advisory committee in San Francisco , which otherwise lacked much in the way of controversy .
An entrepreneur and co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation , Gilmore recently lost a court battle seeking to unmask the government 's secret regulations asking passengers to show identification when flying , and to have those rules declared unconstitutional .
Scolding the DHS committee for dithering over small matters , Gilmore said that it should be investigating the National Security Agency 's eavesdropping program and that the committee 's real job was to " protect the homeland from mean - spirited officials . "
Gilmore then dared committee members to place their driver 's licenses in the envelopes he had passed out , mail them to their home addresses and then attempt to fly home without identification .
While signs in the airport and on the Transportation Security Administration website insist that showing ID is mandatory , the official policy , as revealed by the judges ' decision ( .pdf ) in Gilmore 's case , is that " airline passengers either present identification or be subjected to a more extensive search . "
But Gilmore said that 's not what really happens in an airport when one refuses to provide identification .
" You will find out what the real rules are , " Gilmore said .
" Are you afraid to ?
You have good reason . "
Gilmore referred to his own experience when Southwest Airlines refused to let him fly in 2002 without identification , and a recent blog post by travel expert Edward Hasbrouck , chronicling his near - arrest for trying to figure out if the person checking identification at Washington Dulles International Airport was an airline or federal employee .
At the meeting 's close , Harper , a committee member , said he'd take the challenge so long as he could hand his envelope to a reporter who accompanied him to the airport .
He also challenged the other members to join him .
" We have influence , " Harper said .
" I challenge my colleagues to believe in the law . "
None of the other committee members volunteered , but the committee 's chair , former director of consumer protection for the Federal Trade Commission Howard Beales gave Harper a tongue - in - cheek blessing .
" I wish Jim the best and hope to see you in the future , " Beales said .
At 6 a.m. the next morning , Harper handed this reporter a green , self - addressed stamped envelope and entered the checkpoint line , which even at that early hour was filled with travelers facing a 20 - minute crawl to the magnetometers .
Harper told the identification checker he had no ID , and the attendant quickly wrote " No ID " with a red marker on his ticket and shunted him off to an extra screening line – generously allowing him to bypass the longer queue of card - carrying passengers .
There Harper was directed into the belly of a General Electric EntryScan puffer machine that shot bits of air at his suit in order to see if he had been handling explosives .
TSA employees wearing baby blue surgical gloves then swiped his Sidekick and his laptop for traces of explosives and searched through his carry - on , while a supervisor took his ticket , conferred with other employees and made a phone call .
Meanwhile , a TSA employee approached this reporter , who was watching the search through Plexiglas , and said , " It 's pretty awkward you are standing here taking notes , " but he did not ask for identification or call for a halt to the note - taking .
The TSA supervisor returned from her phone call and asked Harper why he did n't have identification and to where he was traveling .
But she was satisfied enough with his answer – that he had mailed his driver 's license home to Washington , D.C. – that she allowed him to pass .
At 6:30 a.m. , standing 50 yards away on the other side of the glass screen , Harper phoned to say he now had two hours to kill , having gotten through screening perhaps even faster than he would have if he 'd shown ID .
He guessed he was able to get through without much hassle by being polite and dressing well .
Why did he take the challenge ?
" Part of it was my concern with the growing use of identification checks to control access to society , such as buildings , stadiums and air travel , " Harper said , referring to issues that are central to his recently published book , Identity Crisis .
And will he do it again ?
" Yeah , I 'm inclined to do it more and more and hopefully more people will follow my lead and it will become a clear option to not show government ID to fly , " Harper said .
" My identity has nothing to do with the real risk .
" In fact , today , I 'm the safest guy on the plane . "
In the last year , 15 states have enacted laws that expand the right of self - defense , allowing crime victims to use deadly force in situations that might formerly have subjected them to prosecution for murder .
Supporters call them “ stand your ground ” laws .
Opponents call them “ shoot first ” laws .
Thanks to this sort of law , a prostitute in Port Richey , Fla. , who killed her 72 - year - old client with his own gun rather than flee was not charged last month .
Similarly , the police in Clearwater , Fla. , did not arrest a man who shot a neighbor in early June after a shouting match over putting out garbage , though the authorities say they are still reviewing the evidence .
The first of the new laws took effect in Florida in October , and cases under it are now reaching prosecutors and juries there .
The other laws , mostly in Southern and Midwestern states , were enacted this year , according to the National Rifle Association , which has enthusiastically promoted them .
Florida does not keep comprehensive records on the impact of its new law , but prosecutors and defense lawyers there agree that fewer people who claim self - defense are being charged or convicted .

The printer .
It 's one of the most common peripherals in the computer age and so cheap -- at first blush , anyway -- that stores often give them away when you buy a PC .
Yet how many people realize , when they walk out of CompUSA , a nice $ 99 inkjet model tucked under their arm , that it 's likely they 've just committed themselves to spending nearly $ 1,500 on ink cartridges over the next four years ?
( In fact , only about 3 percent realize it , according to Stanford economist Robert Hall . )
We 're living today in the hidden - fee economy .
Printers come with a particularly hefty and devious add - on fee in the form of those cartridges , but they 're just one of many products with a sneaky price structure .
Cell phones , of course , have deadly overage charges lurking behind the attractive monthly rates and credit card companies lure customers with low annual fees then hit them with late fees and higher interest rates if payment is even a day late .
( In 2001 , banks pulled in $ 7 billion in late fees according to one study . )
Comically pricey phone calls and outlandish minibar tabs pad the balance sheets of hotels whose affordable basic room rates serve as a come-on .
Low weekly fees for rental cars attract customers , but they get you on the insurance , car seats for the kids and $ 6 - per - gallon gas .
Getting nailed by a hidden fee is one of the great annoyances of modern life .
But , if it 's any consolation , the fees have also raised fascinating questions for economists :
Why , for example , do n't companies compete on all costs , including the ones in fine print ?
According to classical economic theory , it should n't be possible to conceal price information that 's important to the consumer : Competing firms will educate consumers about the other guy's high hidden prices in order to win business .
" We do n't think that 's right , " contends David Laibson , a professor of economics at Harvard and coauthor , with MIT 's Xavier Gabaix , of an article on hidden fees that appears in the latest issue of the Quarterly Journal of Economics .
" We think there are robust market forces that serve to suppress that information , and keep it suppressed . "
Laibson and Gabaix are n't conspiracy theorists .
Their explanation for the persistence of hidden prices , laid out in " Shrouded Attributes , Consumer Myopia , and Information Suppression in Competitive Markets , " describes a complex balancing act , in which companies must weigh the costs of educating consumers against the benefits of duping them .
And their work relies on the insight , now common in what 's called behavioral economics , that many consumers are far less rational than economists used to think .
Laibson and Gabaix 's explanation relies on a good bit of math , too , but it can be summarized pretty simply using a hypothetical example .
Imagine two hotel chains .
The first , Hidden Price Inn , has a very low room rate of $ 80 a night , but makes liberal use of high " shrouded " fees :
Three bucks for a minibar Coca - Cola , $ 25 for parking , $ 12 for eggs at breakfast .
The unsophisticated traveler cheerily ( if unwittingly ) forks over the fees , all the while patting herself on the back for getting a cheap room .
Now imagine a second chain , Straightforward Suites .
It charges much more reasonably for the extra costs ( $ 1 , say , for that Coke ) , but because it makes less on the extras , it has to charge slightly more for the room -- $ 95 , instead of $ 80 .
Even an unsophisticated traveler can tell $ 95 is n't as good as $ 80 .
Through an aggressive ad campaign , Straightforward could try to point out how devious the approach of Hidden Price Inn is and how much less deceptive its own prices are .
But Laibson and Gabaix show that there 's a catch in this strategy : Hidden Price
Inn actually has two key types of customers .
Yes , there are the clueless consumers ( the economists prefer to call them " myopic " ) .
But there are also the sophisticated ones , who know that if they avoid the hotel restaurant , take a taxi instead of using the parking garage and call home with a cell phone , they 'll actually get a better deal at Hidden Price than at Straightforward .
Straightforward Suites ' ad campaign , then , might just end up increasing the ranks of sophisticated consumers who will in turn dial up Hidden Price Inn for a cut -rate room .
Rather than play this self - defeating game , Straightforward will most likely just lower its own room prices and stick it to the customers on the extras .
The specifics may vary from industry to industry , but Laibson and Gabaix argue that this basic dynamic helps explain why we see so many shrouded fees .
Regulations requiring companies to be more up - front about their prices might help in some cases , they say .
But , being economists , they distrust regulation .
As long as these games exist , they conclude that your best bet is to be a sophisticate .
Laibson offers this tip in particular : " Print in draft mode , do n't gratuitously print things that you do n't need , and when in doubt , print at work .
Those simple pieces of advice will save you about $ 500 a year . "
But not all economists say it makes sense , even in self - interested terms , for companies to embrace the hidden - fee economy .
Barry Nalebuff , a professor of business strategy at the Yale School of Management and author of " In Praise of Honest Pricing , " which appeared in the MIT Sloan Management Review in 2003 , says Laibson and Gabaix 's article fails to consider that annoying consumers has a cost :
It drives them away .
" In the end , you do n't fool the customers with the hidden price , " he says .
" They know they 've paid it even if they did n't know they were going to pay it . "
And if they feel ripped off , they wo n't come back .
In the cell phone industry , he says , carriers lose 40 percent of their customers each year , a tremendous " churn " rate that industry players are starting to take note of .
Sprint , Nalebuff points out , recently began pushing what it calls its " Fair and Flexible " plan , which adjusts customers ' calling plans to minimize overage charges .
Sprint is betting , in other words , that customer loyalty is worth more , in the long run , than sneaky fees .
Laibson , though , has his doubts .
Companies that hide fees " may lose some customers , " he says , " but along the way it 's a good ride . "
これである 。
はてなブックマーク - Yahoo!ニュース - 時事通信 - イスラムは「邪悪」と発言＝ローマ法王発言に怒り広がる
うっかり報道を真に受けて[ これはひどい
]といってしまったのだが、ブクマでも指摘にあるようにどうも様子がおかしい。
そして、原文をのぞいてみたところ、
CNN.com - Pope : Conversion by violence not of God - Sep 12 , 2006
どうやら問題はこの 「要約報道」にあったようなのである。
問題は 「 かのような」という点だ。
原文をたどると、確かになんとも微妙な発言であることは確かだ。
" The emperor comes to speak about the issue of jihad , holy war , " the pope said .
" He said , I quote , ' Show me just what Mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached . ' "
ポイントはまさにここだろう。
He said , I quote ,
（注：簡単に訳すと、 「彼は引用してこう言いました」。となる。）
つまり、 「現法王が東ローマ皇帝が*1引用した言葉をさらに引用して発言した。」ということである。
＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊【ココ】「挿入」の＜訂正＞の「挿入」【カラ】＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊
＜コメント欄でのご指摘＞
He said , I quote , ’ Show me ... ” の部分です が 、I quoteは挿入です 。
（根拠はクオーテーション・マークの位置です。）
つまり 、He said ” Show me ... ” と I quoteは別々で 、
「 私（＝ベネディクト16世）は引用しますが、彼（＝皇帝）は『……を見せなさい』と言いました」
ということになります。
よって、 「現法王が東ローマ皇帝が引用した言葉をさらに引用」したのではなく、
「 現法王は東ローマ皇帝の言葉を引用した」ということになります
誤訳を言上げする記事で誤訳してたら世話ないですね。
まぁ、幸いにも ？
（注：簡単に訳すと、 「彼は引用してこう言いました」。となる。）
の部分は間違ってなかったってことでなにとぞご勘弁ください。

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊【ココ】「挿入」の＜訂正＞の「挿入」【マデ】＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊
なんともわかりにくいことはなはだしい、実にクドクドしい発言である。
だが、報道されていない後段の発言を読めばその意図がいかなるものははっきりとしている。
" The emperor goes on to explain in detail the reasons why spreading the faith through violence is something unreasonable , " Benedict said .
" Violence is incompatible with the nature of God and the nature of the soul , " the pope said , issuing an open invitation to dialogue among cultures .
（私訳）
「 皇帝は暴力を利用して信仰を広げることに何の理由もないことを説明しようとしたのです」と法王は言った。
そして、 「暴力は、神の本質や魂の本質と交換できるものではない」と言い、異文化間での対話の必要性を示唆しました。
これのどこが、 「 問題のある発言」なのだろうか。
しかし、現実に問題は発生している。
ならば、発言内容に問題があったのではなく、その発言形式にこそ問題があったとみるべきではないだろうか。
それを示す箇所がこれである。
Clearly aware of the sensitivity of the issue , Benedict added , " I quote , " twice before pronouncing the phrases on Islam and described them as " brusque , " while neither explicitly agreeing with nor repudiating them .
（注：要するに、法王は発言の際に「唐突ですが」とのことわりをつけた上で「引用ですよ」と二度も念を押したということである。）
つまり、何度も念を押さないといけないような発言とは、すなわち、発言者自身も誤解を招く可能性を十分に意識していた発言であるということになる。
要するに、法王が背負わなくてもいいリスクをわざわざ背負った発言形式を選択してしまった、と言うことがまさに問題だったのである。
そして案の定、そのリスクは、問題として具現化したというわけである。
なぜ、わざわざこんな言い回しをしたのか。
おそらくその理由は、この発言が「母国ドイツの大学で行った講義」におけるものだったという環境要因が作用していることは間違いないだろう。
この 「唐突ですが」とのことわりで始まる「とある言葉の引用」というのは、アカデミックなセカイでは毎度お決まりの話法として、極めてベーシックなものである。
この「引用」は、実にさまざまな効果を持っている。
その効果とは 、
自分の発言に客観性を持たせると同時に、自分の教養レベルを相手にアピールすることで知的ヒエラルキーを形成し、さらに、すでに出来上がった先人の言葉を使うことで自分が新たに対象について言葉をひねり出すという作業を省略することが出来る、といったものである。
まさに、一粒で二度も三度もおいしい話法なのである。
これに味をしめたら、その甘い誘いから逃れることはなかなかに難しい。
特に、それ が 「 許される」ひいては「求められる」ような場面においては。
大学という環境下に身を置いたことでつい、そのような二重鍵括弧言語を多用する学者気分で発言をし、
そして、高精度読解力を基礎とするその場においては、それが全く問題のない発言として受け取られたのであろう。
事実、発言内容自体に問題はないのだから。
よく読めば発言と報道が違うという指摘をするのはたやすい。
対して、法王がイスラームのジハード（聖戦）を肯定していないことも確かである。
しかし、
やはり、何万何億という人々の耳目に届く言葉において、専門的リテラシー能力を持つごくごくわずかな人々にだけ向けた「二重鍵括弧の付いた言葉」を発したことが、この問題のすべての原因ではないだろうか。
10億人とも言われるカソリックの頂点に立つ法王は、この点について責任を負わなければならない。
世界全体の大学進学率は1％程度に過ぎないのだから。
さらに付け加えれば、この「誤報」問題を引き起こした責任があるのは、イスラム圏に対して法王発言の恣意的な要約と誤報を撒き散らしたメディアにもある、といえるだろう。

私のオーディオ 歴
副題の説明 。
『木を見て森を見ず』 『鰯の頭も信心から』 この二つの諺はオーディオマニアが陥りやすい傾向で、心すべき戒めです。
まず、『木を見て森を見ず』について。そもそも、オーディオ装置の目的は音楽
（私の場合クラシック音楽） を出来るだけ演奏会で聴いているのに近い雰囲気でリスニングルームに再現することにあります。このとき、その性能
（森 ）を決め る因子 （木） はたくさんありますが最大のものはリスニングルームそのものとスピーカーシステムの性能だと思っています。他の装置はスピーカーシステムに見合った価格の、名の通ったメーカーの製品を買っておけば大差ありません。 このとき具体的に何を選ぶかの基準は周波数帯域やひずみ率 （これらの値は同じ価格帯の製品ならほとんど同じです） などのデータや評論家先生の評価より、使い勝手で決めることをお勧めします。また、スピーカーケーブルに凝り何万円もかけるマニアがあると聞き及びますがこれなど典型的な『木を見て森を見ず』の一例です。たとえば、材料の銅線の純度を4N(99.99%純銅から6Nに変えても電気抵抗の変化は室温が1℃下がったと同じくらいの効果しかありません。
『鰯の頭も信心から 』
ともかくオーディオは趣味の世界です。従って、その性能の差が物理学的、電気工学的にみて、根拠のないものであっても本人が最高と思っていればそれでいいわけではあります。
この場合あまり物理学や電気工学を知らないほうがｈａｐｐｙかもしれません。しかし、私に言わせればメーカーの宣伝文句や評論家の記事はかなり眉につばをつけて見る必要があります。特に一見科学的な根拠を挙げてもっともらしい説明をしてある記事には注意する必要があります。科学的説明には定性的説明と定量的説明とがあります。前者は因果律といってもよく、例えばケープルの例で言いますと、他の条件が同じであれば確かに、4Ｎの線材より6Ｎの線材を使うほうがいいかもしれません。しかし、導線の電気抵抗の原因はこの程度の純度の銅線だと殆ど熱抵抗で決まっており、4Ｎ銅と6Ｎ銅の電気抵抗率の違いは温度差にしてせいぜい1度くらいです。そう考えればこんなところにお金をかけるのは意味のないことだといわざるを得ません。つまり、一見もっともらしい説明も定量的に分析すると殆ど意味のないことがこの世界には往々にしてあるということです。
そう思って、スピーカーケーブルについて宣伝文句や評論を見てみると、ちゃんとしたメーカーの宣伝文句は、確かに技術者も目を通しているだろうし、物理学的、技術的な事実に対しては嘘は書いてありません。しかし、『丸みのある音』だとか、『締まった音』だとかは証明しようのない主観なので決して誇大宣伝で訴えられるようなことではないことに注意する必要があります。また、いわゆる評論家には技術者出身とそうでない人があり、前者の場合は1ｍ何万円もするケーブルを薦めていることはあまりないと思います。しかし、後者の場合かなり高名な評論家でも物理法則をまったく無視した、あるいは矛盾したことを平気で言っている人があります。そんな記事を信じて、大枚のお金を投じるのはまさに『鰯の頭も信心から』と言わざるを得ません。
すこし一般的に『科学的とはどういうことか？』について論じてみました。
リスニングルームとスピーカーのセッティング
リスニングルームは低音域の特性に大きな影響を与えます。下の表1に可聴周波数帯
( 20 Ｈ ｚ 〜 20k Hz ) の各音域での周波数とその波長 （音波および電磁波） を示します。低音域での音波の波長は部屋の大きさに近く、壁面からの反射による定在波の発生や干渉効果が大きく壁面の構造やスピーカの置き場所や聴く位置により周波数特性は大きく変わります。 （このことは低周波発振器で周波数を連続的に変え音出しをしてみると明らかにわかります。） カタログにのっているスピーカーの周波数特性は無響室で測定したものですから概ねフラットですが実際には大きく波打っているはずです。また、中・高音域では直接波と反射波の位相差のため音像定位感の低下などを招きます。しかし、これらの現象はある程度避けられないもので、壁や床天井になるべく吸音効果のありそうな材質を使うこと、また、薄い窓ガラスや薄いベニヤやプラスティック板を使った家具など、共振しそうな平面版を使うのを避けることなどが対策です。音楽ホールがそうであるように、適当に音の反射 （残響） はあったほうが聞きやすいとも考えられるのであまり神経質に考えることはありません。
なお、リスニングルームの特性を決める壁面の遮音と吸音について、雑学帳に書いておきました。（ 2005.7.2 )
次にスピーカーのセッティングですが、確かにスピーカーを置く位置を変えると低音域の特性が変わります。しかし、聴く位置によっても変化するので置く位置ばかり気にしても意味がありません。2つのスピーカの位置の部屋に対する対象性
（壁面やコーナーからの距離） が極端にずれていなければそれほど気にすることではないと思います。ただし、中心軸を部屋の中心に一致させるのは感心しません。なぜなら、壁面からの反射による定在波の腹 （最大振幅） の位置は反射面にあり、中心位置は一次定在波の節
（振幅0 ） の位置に当たるからです。それから、よくスピーカと聞く位置は正三角形になるような位置がよいと書いてありますが、確かに２等辺3角形の頂点で聞くほうがいいと思いますが、正三角形である必然性があるとは思えません。むしろ、2つのスピーカーの間隔に適正距離があるはずです。音の指向性 （方向感覚） は両耳に入る音波の位相差が関係します。従って、波長が十数センチの音、つまり人の音声などがもっとも敏感に検知されます。この周波数帯から極端にずれた周波数の音は指向性がありません。従って、スピーカーの間隔は2〜3 ｍ離しておけば十分でそれ以上はなすと音波の干渉効果で周波数特性の『でこぼこ』が激しくなるので逆効果になると思います。
このように書くと、私がリスニングルームやセッティングを軽く見ていると思われるかもしれませんが決してそうではありません。これは、次項のスピーカーシステムと同等もしくはそれ以上に音質に影響します。ただ、一旦部屋の条件が与えられてしまうと
（例えば普通に設計されたリビングルームを使うなど）
少々手を加える程度では大きな改善は見込めず、あちら立てればこちら立たずという状況になりがちだということです。もし、本格的に音に拘るなら、過剰性能の高価なアンプやプレーヤー、ましてや怪しげで高価なケーブルやアクセサリー類には手を出さずに将来専用のリスニングルームを作る資金をためておくことをお奨めします。

スピーカーシステムはオーディオ装置の中で、再現する音を決定付ける最も重要な部分です。したがって購入するに当たっては試聴なども行い慎重に決定すべき部分です。また予算の半分くらいはスピーカーシステムの購入に当てるべきだと思います。
（逆に他の部分については店の試聴室でちょっと聞いたくらいでは差は分からないと考えた方が無難です。この場合はカタログ等でスペックや使い勝手をよく検討する方が後で後悔しません。）
なお、『スピーカーの高域再生能力はどこまで必要か？』
および『スピーカーの低域再生能力』についてオーディオ雑学帳で論じています。また、基礎となる理論をスピーカーの物理学講座で解説しています。
まず、スピーカーの構造と動作を知っておきましょう。
右図は一般的な （ダイナミック） スピーカーの横断面の概念図です 。
永久磁石で発生する磁束が鉄で出来たヨークに導かれボイスコイルの所に強い磁場を作ります。
（この図では永久磁石は中心の円柱部にありますが、最近のフェライト磁石を使ったスピーカーでは、外側のシリンダー部に付けてあります。） ボイス コイルに流れる電流はこの磁場でローレンツ力を受け左右方向に動きこの動きが振動板 （コーン） に伝わり周りの空気を振動させ音に変わります。振動板はダンパーとエッジにより支えられています。
スピーカーの性能を決めるのは周波数特性、高調波歪み、能率 （音圧レベル ）、過渡特性などです。このうち、周波数特性は何で決まるか？
これは低音域と高音域を別に考える必要があります。
音波のエネルギーは振幅 ａ と振動数 ｆ の積の2 乗 （ａ・ｆ ）2 に比例します。 ｆ の小さい低音では振幅 ａ を大きくする必要があります。つまり、スピーカーは空気をゆっくりと大きく振動させる必要があるわけです。そのためには振動板を出来るだけ大きくし、かつ大振幅で振動するようにしなければなりません。当然ウーファーの口径が大きいほうがいいわけですが、実はこれは必要条件でなく、口径が小さくても無歪み振幅が大きければいいわけで、最近の傾向としてはあまり大口径のウーファーは使われなくなっています。その理由は、口径が大きいことの一義的なメリットはは能率が高くなることで、デメリットとして(1)質量が大きくなり過渡特性が悪くなること、(2)小口径ウーファーに比べ大きな箱を必要とすること、などがあり大出力のアンプが安価に手に入るようになった現在、能率についてあまり考慮する必要がなくなったからだと思います。
一方、高音域では、振幅は小さくとも高速に振動させる必要があり、振動板は出来るだけ軽くする必要があります。つまり、低音再生のための条件と高音再生の条件はあい矛盾するため、低音専用のスピーカー （ウーファー） と高音専用のスピーカー （トゥイター） を使い、更に、中音域を受け持つスピーカー （スコーカー） を加え た3ｗａｙ システムがよく使われます。実は、専用スピーカーを使うもう一つの理由があります。それは、ボイスコイルの変位が振動板に伝わるとき、波として伝わります。つまり、振動板は必ずしも平行移動 （いわゆるピストン運動 ) するのではなく、中心部から周辺部に変位が伝わっていくわけです。この現象が顕著になると、振動は同心円上に広がる波となり,エッジで反射された波との干渉で定在波が生じ、振動板がいわゆる分割振動を起こします。分割振動が生じると周波数特性に凹凸が生じ、高域になるほど放射される音が打ち消しあい高域が出なくなります。分割振動を起す周波数は、スピーカーの口径、振動板の強度 （剛性） などにより決まり、普通1000Hz以上の高音で生じます。低音用の大口径のスピーカーでは分割振動の生じる周波数が低く高音が出にくくなります。再生音域をさらに上げようとすると、口径を小さくする必要があり、そうすると低音が出にくくなり、いわゆるフルレンジスピーカーでの広帯域再生は難しくなることがわかります。さらに、最近のように５0000Hzあたりまで分割振動を抑え再生しようとすると、軽くて硬い特殊な材料を使い、振動板の口径を小さくする必要があります。トゥイター用の材料は時代とともに流行り廃りがあり、
ベリリウムが使われたり アルミやチタン合金が使われたりしました。私のスピーカの材料はボロン・カーバイト（B 4 C)という材料が使われているようです。
スピーカーの性能としてもう一つ重要なのは過渡特性です。右図は過渡特性を説明する図です。黒い線がスピーカーに入力する電気信号で赤線は音声出力を表します。両者が一致するのが理想ですが、実際にはずれが生じます。このずれを過渡歪みといいます。過渡特性を決めるのは立ち上がり
（下がり） の速さと制動力 ( すぐに静止する能力 ) また、固有振動を起こさないことも重要です。立ち上がりの速さは振動板の軽さと強度で決まります。出来るだけ軽くて硬い材料を使う必要があります。
制動力ははいろいろな因子で決まりますが、まず考えられるのは空気抵抗ですが、ダイナミックスピーカーでは余り大きな寄与をしません。従って、この場合スピーカー自身の持つ制動力に頼る必要があります。力学的な制動力はダンパーとエッジで決まり、その制動能力は、振動板の運動エネルギーをいかに早く吸収するかにより決まります。もう一つ重要なのは固有振動を起こさないことです。軽くて硬い材料といえばアルミ合金などの金属を思い浮かべますが、金属は一般に振動エネルギーを吸収する能力が低く、たたけば『カーン』という音がすることからもわかるように振動板に使うと固有振動を起こし不都合です。特にウーファーでは振動板のサイズが決める固有振動の周波数が可聴周波数帯にあるので使えません。これに対して例えばボール紙などはは叩いても殆ど音がしません。これは繊維が絡み合ったパルプ紙などは振動のエネルギーを素早く吸収するからです。普通低音用スピーカーの振動板には繊維系の材料を出来るだけ軽くて強度が出るように加工して使います。それに対し高音用スピーカーは口径が小さく固有振動の振動数が可聴周波数外になることもあり、制振よりも軽くて硬いことを重視し金属材料を使うこともあるようです。
（あまり感心しませんが）
スピーカーの制動能力を決めるもう一つの重要な因子は電磁制動力です。ボイスコイルはアンプにつながっており閉回路を作ります。すると、振動することによって生じる逆起電力が制動力となります.。その強さは、アンプの出力抵抗を含んだ閉回路の抵抗値に反比例し、磁場の強さ、コイルの巻き数に比例します。なお、後者はスピーカーの能率にも関係するので、出来るだけ強い磁石を使うことが望まれます。ここで、磁性材料の専門家として言わせてもらうと、永久磁石としてネオジム磁石を使い、ヨーク、特にギャップ部の材料に磁束密度が最大の鉄コバルト合金を使うと最も強い磁場が得られるはずです。ただし、磁気回路の設計が適切なら、ギャップの部分の磁束密度は永久磁石でなく、ギャップ部に使われている電磁石材料の飽和磁束密度が決めるので、永久磁石材料に何が使われているかはあまり重要ではありません。また、あまり制動力が強すぎるといわゆるオーバーダンプとなり低音が出にくくなるので磁場は強ければ強いほどいいというわけではありません。この辺りがスピーカーの設計者の腕の見せ所です。
** 最近ネオジム磁石を使ったスピーカーも出始めています。ただし、ウーファーなどはどちらかというと重い方がいいので、安価なフェライト磁石をたっぷり使って磁束密度を上げる方が賢明だと思います。 2004.11.24 追加
最後に、制動力を決めるもう一つの因子はスピーカーボックスです。そもそも、スピーカーを箱に入れるのは振動板の後方から出る逆位相の音波を遮断することにあります。最も単純なスピーカーボックスは密閉箱です。この場合箱の内部の空気が空気バネとして働きダンパー・エッジと合わせた、振動板を支えるバネ定数が増加します。従って、振動板の共振周波数 ｆ 0 が上昇し、かつ同一入力に対する振幅が減少します。その結果、低音の出力能率が低下します。
この時、ボックス内の吸音材などにエネルギーが吸収され制動力が生じます。もう一つはバスレフタイプといいい、スピーカーボックスの下部に穴 （ダクト ) を開け、ヘルムホルツ共鳴で低音を増強しかつ逆位相の音波を半波長遅らせ正位相にして放出するという方式です。この場合箱からの制動力はあまり期待できず、共鳴効果を利用するので共鳴周波数付近で過渡歪が生じやすくなります。さらに、共鳴周波数付近は位相特性の変化が著しく
（群遅延特性が悪化する） 、共振周波数より波長の長い超低音は打ち消され出なくなります。一方、バスレフタイプの利点として、最低音の共振周波数付近ではスピーカーの振動板の振幅が密閉型に比べ小さく抑えられ、エッジやダンパーの非線形性から来る歪が生じにくいという点です。最近の中小型のスピーカーシステムがほとんどバスレフタイプなのはこのためです。しかし、私に言わせれば、バスレフタイプを使っても重低音域の再生能力は一般に不足気味で、下に述べるようにスーパー （サブ） ウーファーを使い補強するという手をお奨めします。
さて、以上の話は、出来るだけ電気信号を忠実に音声信号に変えるのがいいスピーカーとして話を進めてきましたが、実際にはあまり制動の効かないボンボンした音が好きだとか、高音域がある程度カットされた音のほうが聴きよいという人もいるわけで、決して聴きよいスピーカーの条件を述べているわけでないことをお断りします。
ちなみに、私が使っているスピーカーシステムはかなり物理特性重視型で、一応聴き比べはしましたが、必ずしも最高のものと思っているわけではありません。特に、このスピーカは高域が60kHz まで伸びていることがうたい文句なのですが、CDがソースの場合20kHZ以上の周波数帯に意味のある情報は含まれておらず、回路で発生する超音波ノイズのみを放射する役目を担っているだけかも知れず、少々オーバースペックのような気がします。
通常のフロア型スピーカーでは、クラシック音楽で重要な役割を果たす30Hz〜40Hzの重低音を能率よく再生するには無理があります。このため、超低音の再生のみを受け持つサブウーファー
（以前はスーパーウーファーと言った）
を使う意味があります。理想的な方式は超大型のホーンを使うことですが、一般家庭で実現するのは困難です。私の使用しているヤマハのスーパーウーファーは30ｃｍ径のスピーカーを内臓の特殊なアンプ
（電流帰還によりスピーカーの内部抵抗を見かけ上ゼロにする方式）
で制動係数無限大で駆動し、その空気振動をヘルムホルツ共鳴の原理に基づきダクト内の気柱振動でとして放出するという方式です。その効果ですが、例えば室内楽などを聴いているとその存在は殆ど感じませんが、オルガンの演奏や、近代オーケストラの、特にバスドラムの音など大変な迫力で迫ってきます。それから、意外な効用ですが、最近、衛星放送などで放映される音楽会の中継録画をよく見 （聴き） ますが、サブウーファーがあるとすごい臨場感が感じられます。実は、これは会場の超低音ノイズを再現するためのようで、オーディオ的には邪道ですが音楽会の雰囲気を生々しく伝えてくれます。
低音楽器が活躍する曲として代表的なものを挙げると、R．シュトラウス｢ツアラスストラ｣冒頭オルガン （C 0 ：32.7 Hz） 、バッハ｢トッカータとフーガ ニ短調｣２小節目 (? ) 持続低音 （D 0 36.7 Hz） 、 ショウタコーヴィッチ｢交響曲第5番」、ベルリオーズ｢幻想交響曲｣のフィナーレのバスドラム強奏
（ 37Hz） といったところか。 その他、スペクトルアナライザーで解析した結果をここに載せています。
2006.10.1
なお、サブウーファーが受け持つ周波数帯では音の指向性がないので、1個のスピーカーで充分です。普通は左右の信号を足し合わせて駆動します。また、置く位置についても指向性の観点からは左右スピーカーの中心である必要はありません。しかし、何処へ置いても同じかというとそんなことはありません。表1からわかるようにこの周波数帯の波長は数ｍなので、メインスピーカーからの音、壁面からの反射波との干渉により、置く位置により大きく変化します。いろいろ試して最適の位置を見つければいいわけですが、何処に置いても強調される周波数、打ち消しあう周波数はあるので結局好みの問題となります。
このとき、メインスピーカーシステムがバスレフ型だと、スーパーウーファーとのクロスオーバー周波数付近で位相関係が複雑になり
（群遅延特性が暴れる） 、つながりが悪くなることが懸念されます。スーパーウーファーを使うときは
（メインシステムが密閉型であっても） 、正弦波発振機を用い低音域の周波数特性をしらべ、カットオフ周波数や位相関係を適当に選び周波数特性が出来るだけフラットになるよう調整することをお勧めします。
最後に、サブウーファーを使うと『音が遅れる』と言われることがあります。私はさほど感じませんが、部屋の定在波と一致する周波数
（８畳間だと50Hz ) 付近ではあり得ることです。というのは、定在波とはスピーカら出た音が正面の壁
（又は床面、側面） で反射し、さらに後面の壁 （天井、もう一方の側面） からの反射波、後続の音とが干渉し強め合い成長するものなので、少なくとも3,4周期 （ 50 Hzだと約0.1秒位） 後に最大振幅となります 。一方、スピーカ自身も共振周波数付近では群遅延により多少音が遅れますがせいぜい0.01〜0.02秒位で恐らく検知不能の遅れだと思います。つまり、仮に『音が遅れる』と感じても、スピーカーを疑う前に部屋の特性を疑うべきです。なお、実際にサブウーファーの過渡特性を測定した結果をここに挙げておきます。
また、実際の選択に当たっては、サブウーファーの薦めのページも参考にして下さい。
現在のスピーカーシステムはＣＤに録音されている超低音を十分再生出来ないものが多い。これをあまり費用をかけず簡単にチェックする方法を伝授しましょう。それは、ネオジ磁石を使った最近の密閉型 （カナル型） イヤホンを使うことです。密閉型イヤホンは電気→音響変換器として理想的な性質を備えたもので、安価なものでも、20Hzの超低音から20kHz 以上の高音までをほとんどフラットな特性で再生出来ます。また、振動板も軽量で過渡特性も極めて優秀です。これを使い、例えば上に例を挙げたような超低音を含むいい録音のCDを聴いて見て下さい。おそらく、スピーカーシステムではほとんど聴き取れなかった超低音が録音されていることが分かるでしょう。このとき注意すべきことは、耳とイヤホンの密閉性を完全に保つことです。普通、色々なサイズのイアーピースが付属しているので自分に最適なものを選び、空気漏れがないようしっかり耳に挿入して下さい。少しでも空気漏れがあると極端に低音の音圧が落ちます。もし、このテストで自分のスピーカーシステムに不満を感じたらサブウーファーを導入することをお薦めします。また、サブウーファーは『音が遅れる』と思われる方は一度このイヤホンと比較してみて下さい。イヤホンでは原理的に『音が遅く』なることは考えられません。
ちなみに、自分が使っているのは AudioTechnica 製の ATH - CKS990という製品で、カタログスペックは 5〜28，000
Hz となっています 。
アンプはオーディオシステムの中心の一つですが、これについてはあまり論ずるところがありません。最近の技術の進歩により、ちゃんとした技術者のいる定評あるメーカーの製品であれば同じ価格帯の製品ならどれを選んでも電気的性能に変わりありません。むしろ使い勝手とか見た目のかっこよさで選べばいいと思っています。ただどの価格帯を選ぶかは問題ですが、価格はほぼ出力に比例するのでどのくらいの出力が必要かということになります。
実際に家で聞く出力はかなりい小さく、数ワットあれば充分かもしれません。しかし、バスドラムの強奏のような低域の衝撃音をリアルに再現するには瞬間的にかなりの大電流を必要とし出力にはかなり余裕を見ておく必要があります。さらに、アンプの性能としてもう一つ重要で見逃されているのは上記のスピーカの項でのべた、ダンピングファクターで、これはアンプの出力インピーダンスに反比例します。出力インピーダンスが低いことは、いわゆる駆動力が大きいことを意味し、パルシブな音の立ち上がり特性も良くなります。普通大出力のアンプはダンピングファクターが大きく、制動の効いた、歯切れの良い音を良しとする場合は結果的にある程度出力の大きいアンプを選ぶ方がいいということになります。なお、見かけのダンピングファクターは負帰還を深くかける事により大きくすることが出来ますが、負帰還をかけすぎると弊害も生じ、無負帰還時の内部抵抗が低いハイパワーアンプの方が有利です。
ところで、この項の『アンプ （ただし、中級程度以上の半導体アンプ） によって大した 差がない』という主張は、オーディオマニアの常識とあまりにもかけ離れているようで、ひんしゅくをかっているようです。しかし、ブラインド・テストの結果などを見ると決して私の耳が悪いせいで分からないというわけではなさそうです。ただし、その結果をここで示すのはあまりに味気ないので、別ページにアップしておきました。入り口はこのサイトの別の所からリンク出来るようになっています。
セパレートアンプとトーンコントロール
LPレコードを真空管アンプで聴いていた時代は、プリアンプとメインアンプを切り離した、いわゆるセパレートアンプがいいとされ、実際自作する場合もこの方が楽でした。これには理由があり、微少信号を扱うプリアンプは出力段で使う大電流や電源のからの誘導ノイズ （ハム音など） を受けやすく両者を切り離すことによりノイズが軽減されるからです。しかし、CDプレーヤの出力を半導体アンプにより再生する場合は別です。そもそも、CDプレーヤーの出力電圧は大きく通常の規格のメインアンプであれば電圧を増幅する必要はありません。プリアンプの役割はもっぱらボリュームやトーンコントロールなどの制御機能で、本来コントロールアンプ
（増幅していないのにアンプというのも変ですが）
というべきでしょう。この場合扱う信号電圧は比較的大きく、また半導体回路は小さく、シールドも容易でなので別の筐体に入れる必要はありません。せいぜい電源部を別にするといった対策で十分でしょう
（これも過剰装備かもしれない） 。 ということで、アンプはプリ・メインアンプ
（インテグレーテッドアンプ） で十分です。セパレートでないとだめだというマニアの言は真空管時代のノスタルジーからくる思い込みに他ならないと思っています。
ところで、プリ・メインアンプであっても、トーンコントロール回路を通すと音が汚れるといって、これを活用しないマニアが多いようで、アンプの方でも、これをパスするダイレクトスイッチという物が付いているものがあります （私のアンプも） 。しかしこの回路を通したからと言って検知可能なレベルで歪みが増えるわけでなく、大いに活用すべきでしょう。特に、あまり大きな音で聴かない
（聴けない） 場合はいわゆる等ラウドネス曲線 （下のリンク先参照） に従って低域 （場合によっては高域も） を少し持ち上げてやるほうが実際の音楽体験に近い雰囲気が味わえます。

AVアンプ 2014年6月追加
最 近5.1ch サラウンド放送など多チャンネルを使う音源が増えています （例えば、NHK Eテレのクラシック音楽館など） 。これを有効に使うにはいわゆるAVアンプが必要となります。AVアンプに必要とされる最小限の機能は、MPEG-2、-4 などの圧縮音源のデコーダーと多チャンネルアンプ （通常デジタルアンプ） ですが、その他にも、DSP
（ Digital Signal Processor ) を利用した音場効果付加機能 （もちろんこのような効果を付加しないモードも備えている） 、サブウーファー用のハイカットフィルター、さらには、視聴位置にマイクを置き、その位置での音場特性を自動的に最適化する機能なども供えている機種が多い。圧縮音源やデジタルアンプと聞くと、ピュアーオーディオファンからは毛嫌いされそうですが、一度体験されることをお薦めします。デジタルアンプといっても、ブラインドテストではアナログアンプと区別がつかないようです。
真空管アンプについ て
昔はアンプといえば真空管アンプでした。私も若い頃、何台か自作した覚えがあります。ところで、真空管アンプには普通真空管の高いインピーダンスとスピーカの低い抵抗をマッチさせるため出力トランスを使います。私は磁性物理学が専門なのですが、鉄心を使ったトランスは、周波数特性、線形性、位相遅れ、エネルギー損、バルクハウゼンノイズ,低ダンピングファクターなど多くの問題を抱えた代物でその物理特性を考えればとても使う気になれません。もちろん、世の真空管アンプ愛好家はこの点は承知で、無個性なトランジスターアンプより好ましい点を見つけられているのだと思いますが。

スピーカーケーブルによって音が変わるということがよくいわれ、雑誌などで話題になっています。結論を先にいえば、１ｍ千円以下で手に入る太めのスピーカーケーブルを使っておけば充分で、それ以上この部分に投資する必要はありません。こんなところにお金を使うのがいかに無駄なことかを示すためその物理的側面を論じます。参考のため、表2に代表的なメーカーのいろいろなレベルのスピーカーケーブルの価格と特性をあげておきます。手短に要点だけ知りたい場合はここへジャンプしてください。逆に、詳しい電磁気学的解析が知りたい人はケーブルの電磁気学をご覧下さい。また、日本音響家協会の機関誌
SOUND A&T の" 電気音響はケーブルで音が変わる？ " というタイトルの特集号（No.88 ) に投稿した 「 オーディオケーブルを科学する 」 という記事も参考にして下さい。そこでは、ピンケーブルを含めたオーディオケーブルについて電磁気学、材料科学、心理学の視点からケーブルの特性を総合的に論じています。
スピーカーケーブルが音質 （正確にいうと信号伝達特性） に及ぼすと思われる要因 は ( 1 ) 直流抵抗値 ( 2 ) 表皮効果 ( 3 ) 静電容量 ( 4 ) 自己インダクタンス ( 5 ) 自己振動によるロ ス ( 6 ) その他、渦電流損失などが考えられます。以下に各々の要因について半定量的な説明を加えておきます。なお、量的な見積もりは、最も安価なケーブルAについて、長さを4m （往復8 m） 、負荷のスピーカーのインピーダンス （直流抵抗値） は 8 Ω （一定） 、パワーアンプの内部抵抗 （出力インピーダンス） は 0.8Ω （ DF=10 ) として計算しています。以下の解析は最も安価なケーブルAを例として計算しています。これは、直径1mm、線間間隔4mm程度の並行２芯線に相当する特性値です。なお、表には書いてないですがこの場合の自己インダクタンスは約1μH/m となります。
(1 ) 直流抵抗： 導線の電気抵抗は Ｒ＝ρ×l / Ｓ で与えられます。ここで、 l は線の長さ 、 Ｓ は断面積、 ρ は抵抗率 （単位長さ , 単位断面積当りの抵抗値） で材料により決まる量です。電気抵抗の原因は ( i ) 結晶格子の熱振動 ( ii ) 不純物 ( iii ) 格子欠陥 （結晶粒界、格子歪など） などです。ケーブルの宣伝文句などでは、( ii ) と( iii ) のみが論じられていますが、実は室温での電気抵抗の原因はは殆ど(i)で99.999%程度の純度の銅線だと ( ii ) と( iii ) の寄与は( i ) の100分の1以下です。つまり、安価なＯＦＣ材を高価な7Ｎ材に変えても温度が1,2度下がった程度の効果しかありません。ところで、表2 を見ると1ｍ当りの抵抗値は材料で決まっているわけでないことがわかります。すなわち、上式で l ＝ 1 ｍ なので、抵抗値を決めているのは 導線の断面積で決まっています。要するに線の太さが太いほど抵抗が小さくなるわけです。もちろん実際のケーブルは多芯構造なので素線の断面積の総和が
Ｓ となります。表2の例では比較的安価なＢが最小値となっています。なお、抵抗の原因によって音が違うなどと言う人もいますがそんなことはありえないことです。
スピーカーケーブルの直流抵抗が音に及ぼす効果は2つ考えられます。すなわち、
( i)単純なジュール熱による損失(ii)上記スピーカーの項で述べた電磁制動力の低下です。
( i ) ジュール損失 は Ｗ ＝Ｖ * Ｉ＝Ｒ * Ｉ 2 と抵抗値 Ｒ に比例します。ケーブルはスピーカーと直列につながっているので電流
Ｉ はスピーカーに流れる電流と同じです。いま、スピーカの抵抗値を8オームとして、ケーブルはもっとも安価なＡを4ｍ （往復で8ｍ） 使ったとすると、約１%のパワーロスとなります。Ｂの線を使うと0.3 % に減少し多少効果はありますが、普通アンプの出力には充分余裕があるのであまり気にすることではありません。
( ii ) スピーカーの電磁制動力 は [ アンプの出力インピーダンス＋スピーカーのボイスコイルのインピーダンス＋スピーカーケーブルの抵抗]
が小さいほど強くなります。アンプの出力インピーダンスは普通明示されていませんが、ダンピングファクター
Ｄ がそれにあたります。 Ｄ の定義はスピーカーのインピーダンスを Ｒ 、アンプの出力インピーダンスを Ｚ とすると、 Ｄ＝Ｒ / Ｚ で与えられます。従って、 Ｒ ＝ 8Ω 、 Ｄ ＝100 とすると Ｚ ＝0.08 Ω となります。従って、アンプの制動力を生かそうとすると, スピーカーケーブルの抵抗値は
Ｚ より小 さいことが望まれます。さきのケーブ ルＡ 4ｍの場合 , 抵抗値は0.18Ωとなるので制動力低下を招きます。Ｂの場合 0.052Ωとなりほぼ合格です。このように、スピーカーケーブルの直流抵抗はエネルギーのロスについてははあまり問題になりませんが制動力低下には影響があるかもしれません。ただし、全体のインピーダンスが約８Ωなので音質の変化として分かるかどうかははなはだ疑問です。
( 2) 表皮効 果
導線に高周波電流が流れるとき、電流が発生する磁場の影響で電流は表面部分を流れる傾向があります。これを、表皮効果と呼び、周波数が高いほどその影響は大きくなります。すなわち、高周波になるほど実効抵抗値が大きくなり高域の低下を招く可能性があります。では、これを定量的に考えて見ましょう。周波数
ｆ のとき、表皮効果の生じる厚さ ｄ は ｄ ＝sqrt [ 2 ρ /（ 2 πｆμ） ] で与えられます。 （μは真空の透磁率、ρは比抵抗） 銅線についてｆ ＝ 20000 Ｈ ｚとして計算すると、 ｄ 〜 0.5 mm ｆ ＝ 50000
Hzで ｄ 〜 0.3 mm となります。これより太い単芯線を使うと確かに表皮効果による高域の減衰が無視出来なくなります。実際にどれくらいの抵抗変化が生じるかは簡単な式では表せませんが、理論的計算により求められており、下表に直径1.6mm ( 実測値と比較するた めAより少し太めで計算） 、長さ4 ｍ （往復で8ｍ） の銅線について求めた結果を実測値とともに示します。透過率(%)、減衰率( dB)はスピーカー負荷を8オーム一定とし,1kHz を基準として計算しています。 なお、透過率は、スピーカー端子電圧/アンプ出力電圧×100
です。 （直流抵抗による減衰 （一定） を除くため ）
表 3 表皮効果 周 波 数 ( kHz ) 10 20 50 100 200 備考 交流抵抗/直流抵抗 1.09 1.21 1.64 2.34 3.09 計算値 同上 実測値 1.04 1.23 1.50 2.0 日立電線データ 同上 同じ断面積のリッツ 線

この表からわかるように、1.6φ単線の表皮効果による抵抗増加は100kHz
で計算値、実測値とも約2倍となり、20kHzでも無視できませんが、これによる信号減衰は、ケーブルの抵抗値がスピーカのインピーダンスに比べ十分に小さいため極わずかです。
ここで、表皮効果の低減のため使われる リッツ線 （互いに絶縁された細線を束ねた線） についても抵抗変化のデータがあり載せてありますが、確かに表皮効果による抵抗増加は抑えられているもののそれほど効果がないことがわかります。 （ちなみに、上の例の素線である0.25 φ単線の表皮効果 （抵抗増加） は 100 k
Hz でもせいぜい1%くらいです） これは、表皮効果とほぼ同じ原理で生じる近接効果によるものでリッツ線を使ったからと言って高域の減衰は免れないことに注意する必要があります。また、大多数のケーブルがそうである裸多芯線のケーブルについては単芯線とリッツ線の中間にあると考えられ多芯構造にしたことによる表皮効果の低減はあまり期待できません。なお、太い単芯線と多芯線を組み合わせたハイブリッド線というのもあるようですが、少なくとも表皮効果という観点からはあまり意味はありません。
なお、上の減衰率の計算は負荷のスピーカーのインピーダンスを一定としていますが実際には周波数とともに増加するので、減衰率はさらに小さくなります。いずれにせよ、表皮効果による高域信号の減衰は以下の自己インダクタンスによる減衰より小さく、少なくとも可聴周波数では問題にする必要はなさそうです。
(3)静電容量：通常の並行2芯線では行き帰りの2線間に静電容量
Ｃ があります。これがケーブルの直流抵抗 Ｒ +アンプの出力インピーダンス
Ｚ とでいわゆる直 流ＲＣ 回路を形成し、さらにスピーカーのインピーダンス
R sp を考慮しモデル化すると右図のような等価回路となり高域信号の減衰を招く可能性があります。しかし、具体的に4ｍのケーブルＡ （ C=45 pF×4＝180 pF ) についてインピーダンス （ Z c ＝ 1/2π ｆ C） を計算すると20kHzでは約40kΩとなり、スピーカーのインピーダンス
R sp の5000 倍にもなり 、100MHz でやっと8Ωくらいになります。つまり、ケーブルの容量成分は可聴周波数領域の減衰には全くといっていいほど寄与しません。ただし、これはスピーカーケーブルの場合でありプレイヤーとアンプをつなぐピンケーブルの場合は
R sp に相当するアンプの入力インピーダンスが20kΩ程度なのでこちらの方が高音減衰の主役となります（詳しくはここ）。
( 4) ケーブルの自己インダクタン ス
平 行2芯ケーブルは、単位長さ当り L＝（μ/π）ln(線の間隔/線の半径）
で与えられる自己インダクタンスを持ちます。インダクタンスによるインピーダンスは Z L ＝2 πｆ･L なので高周波数領域で減衰を招きます。 直径 1 φ、間隔 4 mm のケーブ ルA 4ｍについての自己インダクタンスの影響を計算した結果を下表に示します
。 この線の直流抵抗は約 0.2Ω 、スピーカーのインピーダンスは 8Ω （一定） としました 。
周波 数( kHz ) 10 20 50 100 200 Z L ＝2πｆ･L（Ω ） 0.25 0.50 1.26 2.51 5.03 位相差（度） - 1.7 - 3.5 - 8.6 - 17 - 31 透過率（％） 99.9 99.8 98.9 95.7 85.5 減衰( dB ) - 0.004 - 0.016 - 0.099 - 0.38 - 1.36
この表からわからわかるようにケーブルのインピーダンスは直流抵抗に比べ無視できない大きさとなります。しかし、これはまず位相遅れに効き、出力の減衰は100kHz
あたりまではあまり効いて来ません。実際にはスピーカーシステムのインピーダンスそのものも高域で大きく増加するので、減衰率はこれより少ないはずです。ということで、自己インダクタンスは超高域で微妙に影響を与える可能性は否定しませんが、少なくとも可聴周波数帯ではほとんど影響はないと言っていいと思います。なお、周波数が高周波領域に入ると、平行2芯線の場合いわゆるフィダー線効果
( 分布定数回路効果 ） で減衰はこの計算より少なくなります。この点についてはオーディオ雑学帳 8 分布定数回路を参照。ただし、ケーブル長が長くなると、例えば100 m とすると20kHz でも -3dB 程度の減衰が生じるので注意が必要です。自己インダクタンスを減らすため、4芯のスターカッド線というのもスピーカーケーブルに使われますが、定量的にどれ位減少するのかは簡単には計算できませんが、その原理から考え、それなりの効果は期待出来るでしょう。私自身もこのタイプのケーブルを使っています。
(5) 自己振動による損失：平行ケーブルに電流が流れると発生する磁場により、同方向電流の場合は吸引力、逆方向電流の場合は反撥力が働きます。従って、交流電流が流れているときは導線が振動し、位相遅れやエネルギー損失を生じる可能性があります。この現象によるエネルギー損失とその周波数依存性を理論的に見積もるのは、上記の(1) 、( 2) 、( 3)の場合に比べ難しく現時点では適当な理論式が見つかりません。最近のスピーカーケーブルの宣伝文句にこの現象をいかに抑えるかを強調したものも多いようですが、私の知る限り、実際にどの程度のロスがあり、それをどの程度抑えられるかを定量的に論じたり、測定で示したという例は見当たらず、測定不可能な微小効果だと思います
逆に、それだからこそ、耳で聞いて初めてわかるという神がかり的議論が横行する原因ともいえます。
この効果を抑えるには、コードの被覆材に出来るだけ強く （高弾性率の） 重い材料を使うとか、平行線の間隔を離してやるとかが考えられます。
追記 自己振動の効果をモデルを使って計算してみました。その結果、樹脂や合成ゴムなどの絶縁体にしっかり固定された平行2芯ケーブルの場合、自己振動によるエネルギー損失は多めに見積もっても、直流抵抗によるジュール熱損失のなんと1億分の一程度で、まったく問題にならないことがわかりました。詳しい計算はここ。
この他、磁場中で導線が、スピーカーからの音などの影響で、振動することによって発生する誘導起電力によるノイズあるいは混変調歪が考えられます。これは、自作アンプやスピーカーなどで、しっかり固定していない配線が、トランスやスピーカーからの磁力線の影響下で振動する場合、その線を含む閉回路内の磁束量が変化しマイクロフォニックノイズまたは混変調歪の原因となるものですが、スピーカーケーブルの場合、行き帰り2本の線が一体となって振動する場合は誘導起電流は打ち消しあって流れず問題になりません。2本の線の間隔が振動する場合は、上の計算のようにその振幅はきわめて小く、磁場も地球磁場くらいしか働かないので全く気にする必要はありません。
（大きめに見積もっても、これまた信号電流の1億分の１程度です）
( 6 ) その他 渦電流損失による高域の減衰なども考えられますが、可聴周波数帯では殆ど問題にならないはずです。
実際の測定値ですが、ネット検索で2例見つけました。
(1)（データはここをクリック） これを見ると、4ｍのケーブルでは100kHz まではほとんどフラットで、可聴周波数内では、スピーカーケーブルにトーンコントロール効果など期待できないことがわかります。また、高域の減衰はほとんど自己インダクタンスの影響として説明できる大きさです（ケーブルの電磁気学参照）。
( 2) データ（ｐｄｆ）はここ これ はPA （構内放送など） 用のプロ仕様のスターカッドケーブルです。肝心の測定条件が明記していないのですが、前後の関係から、長さが200ｍ、負荷
８Ω （一定） と思われます。長 さ が200ｍ くらいになっても可聴周波数帯では減衰はなく周波数特性はフラットです。ただし、100kHz付近にLC共振と思われるピークが観測され注意が必要です。
MHz以上の高周波信号、ディジタル信号を伝える同軸ケーブルの伝送特性は全く違う原理
( 分布定数回路） で考える必要があります 。
なお、以上の解析は正確にいうと、アンプの出力端子からスピーカーのターミナルまでをつなぐケーブルの信号伝達特性について述べたものであり、この他、アンプとの相性
（ちょっと漠然とした表現ですが） により音が変わるという話しがあります。これについては、やはりオーディオ雑学帳
6.アンプ・ケーブル・スピーカーの相性で取り上げています。
また、CDプレーヤーとアンプをつなぐコネクトケーブル、ＣＤのトランスポートとADCをつなぐディジタルケーブルの交換によっても音が変わるという話もあるようですが、これらの場合、回路のインピーダンス、信号の周波数が違うのでスピーカーケーブルとは別に論じなければなりません。これについては、オーディオ雑学帳
インターコネクトケーブルとディジタルケーブルを見てください。
また、電源ケーブルの交換によって音が変わるという話もあります。はなはだ怪しいですが、ケーブルの伝送特性に関する上記の解析については同じことがいえます。ただ、電源ケーブルの場合はノイズの混入なども問題になるようで別の要因も考える必要があるようです。電源ノイズの問題については我が家の例を調べた結果を雑学帳 10 電源とノイズに掲載してあります。
以上の解析から結論として言えることは、
i ) 低音域への影響として、直流抵抗による電磁制動力の低下を招かないために、出来るだけ直流抵抗が小さいことが望ましい。当然太い線を短く使うことが原則である。表皮効果を避けるため
細線を束ねた多芯線の方が望ましいがあまり効果はなく、むしろ柔らかく扱いやすいと言う観点から多芯線を選べばよい。もっとも、ダンピングの効いた音は嫌いという人は、その逆で細い線を使えばよい。また、真空管アンプを使っている人は、もともと真空管アンプはダンピングファクターが小さいので
（ 10 以下 ） 細い線でもかまわない。
ii） 高音域への影響としては、表皮効果、自己インダクタンスによる高域信号の減衰が考えられる。ただし、通常家庭で使用する5 m 以下の長さでは可聴周波数帶の上限20kHzでの減衰は0.1dB以下でとても人間の耳で聴き分け出来るような差は生じません。なお、10m以上の長いケーブルの場合については、ケーブルの電磁気学のページに詳しく書いているので参考にして下さい。
iii） 2線間の磁力による幅方向の振動の影響はごく微小で問題にならない。
iv） スピーカーケーブルの 信号伝達特性 は太さを含めた構造できまり、使用している材質には依存しない。普通の無酸素銅で十分で、タフピッチ銅でも問題ない。
このように見てくると、物理特性から見て必要にして十分な
（直流抵抗が小さく、100kHz くらいまでフラットな） 特性をもったケーブルは、最初の表のＡや、それに近い普通のＡＣケーブルでも容易に実現可能です。逆に、変に凝ったケーブルは、物理特性を悪くし、一見 （一聴？） 聴きやすい音にしている可能性があります。というわけで、ケーブル類については、信頼出来るメーカー
（主要なデータを公表していることが必要）
のこのあたりの価格帯で上記の物理特性の解析を参考に、合理的と思う製品を決め、後はあれこれ迷わず、本来の音楽を楽しむことをお勧めします。
左右のスピーカコードの長さについて、短かれば短いほどいいというのは直流抵抗がそれだけ小さくなるのでそのとおりです。アンプがスピーカの中央にないときはどうすべきか？やはり同じ長さにすることを推奨します。その理由は、ダンピング因子を左右スピーカーでそろえるためです。直流抵抗値の項で述べたようにケーブルの長さが異なると見掛けのダンピングファクターが結構変わります。もっともダンピングファクターは20程度あれば充分とも言われていますので気休め程度かもしれません。なお、超高域ではインダクタンスにより位相の回転角が少し変わりますが、これは聴く位置を１，２mmずらした位の差しか生じないので問題はありません。同じ長さにした場合の余ったコードの処理ですが、巻いておいても大丈夫です。リングにすると大きなインダクタンスになりそうな気がしますが、そもそも、コイルのインダクタンスとは電流が作る磁場の逆起電力が原因なので、行き帰りの並行2芯線をリング状にしてもリング内部の磁場は打ち消しあいインダクタンスとはなりません。
さらに忘れてはならないことは、ターミナルでの接触抵抗です。古いケーブルで素線の表面の金属光沢が失われている場合は、端を数センチ切断し被覆をはがすかサンドペーパーで磨くなどしてきれいにし、多芯線の場合は少し捩ってはみ出す素線がないように注意し、出来るだけ強く圧着するのが基本ですが、電気についての経験がないと以外と変なつなぎ方をしている場合もあるようです。自信がなければ、少し高くなると思いますが、必要な長さを予め計っておき、両端にターミナル接続用の金具などを装着したケーブルを使うのもいいかもしれません。
最後に一つ、あえて言いたいことは、抵抗の原因によって音質が変わる、つまり、OFC
（無酸素銅） の音だと かPCOCC （単結晶銅） の音 , さらには銀線の音などというものはあり得ません。それにもかかわらず、ケーブルの広告などで線材に何を使っているかが重視されているのはなぜか？
おそらく、純粋な材料を使えば純粋な音がする、銀を使えばいぶし銀のような音がするといえばイメージ的に訴える所があるからでしょう。それに対し、インダクタンスがどうのこうのといっても難し過ぎてピンとこないのではないでしょうか？
要するに、金属が持つイメージを利用して心理効果に訴える作戦なのでしょう。線材を変えた時の効果についてはオーディオ雑学帳 5.導線の材質でも取り上げています。
追記2 ：銅を超高純度にすると、どういう効果があるかについてはここをご覧下さい。
また、オーディオ雑学 帳 1.ケーブル線材についての３つの迷信でも取り上げています。
追記 Audio FAN という Webサイトの掲示板 （すでに閉鎖されています） にこのページとスピーカーケーブルについての要約を投稿したところ約2週間の間に200件近くの応答があり、この問題についての関心の深さを実感しました。その応答の一部を再録します。ここをクリックしてください。
それでも何故高価なケーブルを求める人がいるのか？ について、オーディオ雑学帳 ９ 心理効果とブラインドテスト でとりあげました。
右図はディジタルレコーディング （ CD ） の原理図です。横軸は時間、縦軸は音声に対応する電気信号の電圧を示します。黒い曲線が元の音声シグナルで、ディジタル化とは時間軸を1/44100秒に分割し
（サンプリング） 、その間の電圧値を16ビットの二進数 （0〜65536 ) で表し記録します （量子化） 。この場合、44100/2 Hz=22kHzより高い周波数の情報は記録されません。再生するときはD/Aコンバータで電圧に戻します。このときD/Aコンバータから直接出てくる電圧は 図の赤線 のようにギザギザの電圧でこれがこのままスピーカーで再現されたら『ギザギザ』した聞きづらい音になるはずです。
（ただし、右の図は極端に誇張して書いてあり
16ビットで量子化するとパソコン画面では完全になめらかな曲線となります。詳しいことはこちらを見て下さい） また音楽CD用に特化されたD/Aコンバータ （ DAC ) ではスムージング回路も内蔵されており、滑らかな変化になりますが元の信号に近づくわけではありません。このとき生じる原音との違いを量子化歪み （雑音） と言います。最近のディジタル信号処理技術の進歩により、CDのディジタル信号を横軸 , 縦軸ともに細分化し （図の青線） ディジタル段階で信号をより平滑にする方法がいろいろ開発されています。私の
DENON のプレーヤー もALPHA プロセッサと称する信号補間技術を使い8倍サンプリング20bit相当の精度で音を再現しているそうです。ただし、この場合でも、もちろんCD化する際にもともと失われていた、20kHz 以上の信号が復活するわけではありません。
これに対し、最近売りだされている、SACD
（ Super Audio CD ） 、 ネット配信で得られるハイレゾリューションソース （例え ば194kHz ,24bit） などは記録段階でハイサンプリング化を行っているので、高域再生能力や量子化歪は大幅に向上しています。
といっても、本来耳には聴こえない20kHz 以上の信号が改善されているだけなので、実際に聴いて違いがわかるかどうかは疑問です。 （詳しいことは 、オーディオ雑学帳 3『高域再生はどこまで必要か？』 に書いてあります。）
ところで、CDプレーヤーにもずいぶん高価な高級機があります。これらは、大体回転部分など機械的精度を高くし、重量も大きいものです。しかし、もしあなたがパソコンの使用者ならちょっと考えてみてください。パソコン付属のチャチなCDドライブで読み取ったデータでも殆どエラーなしで読み取れます。この場合、単にハード的に誤りが無いのではなく、誤り訂正機能によりエラーを訂正しています。実は音楽CDの場合も、かなり強力な誤り訂正機能があり、ディジタル信号を読み取る時のミスは殆ど考えなくてよく、実際、色々な実験でそのことは確かめられています。
（ オーディオ雑学帳2『CDの誤り訂正について』 参照） むしろ、読み取った信号を如何に処理するか、つまり電子回路技術
( 主 にDAコンバータの性能 ） が重要なわけです。もちろん、可動部がチャチだと故障しやすく、それに見合った電子回路部もチャチである可能性が高いのでお勧めできませんが。いずれにしても、CDプレーヤー選択のポイントは機械部でなく信号処理技術や電子回路技術で判断すべきです。
蛇足ながら、ＣＤも再生中は回転していますが、アナログレコード時代に問題になった回転むらも関係ありません。もしあなたが、CDの再生がアナログLPと同じように、読み取った瞬間瞬間のディジタルデータをアナログ電圧に変換しているものと理解しているならそれは全くの誤りです。ここに詳しく説明していますが、CDでは読み取ったデータは誤り訂正符号などと一緒に、一旦バッファーメモリに記憶して処理しこれを水晶発振器からのクロック信号に基づきＤＡ変換器に送っています。つまり、時間軸の管理は水晶発振器で正確に行っているのでディスクの回転むらは再生音に直接関係しません。また、水晶発振器の精度を上げるとディジタル信号の時間間隔が正確になり音質が改善されるという話もありますが、定量的に解析すると、実際に聴いて違いがわかるほどの効果は期待出来ません（ここを参考）。このように見ると、回転・読み取り部
（ CDトランスポート） とDAC部を分離したいわゆるセパレート型にするメリットはほとんど無くDAC部以降の性能がよいものであれば一体型のCDプレーヤで十分です。
i Pod 携帯音楽プレーヤーの元 祖 はSonyのウオークマンですが、デジタル化に出遅れ、現在はApple社製のiPodが主流となっています。私も、第二世代といわれるハードディスクタイプのiPod （ 20 GBタイプ ) から使い始め、現在は2012年モデルのiPod touch （ 32GB ) を愛用しています。通常はCDの音源を圧縮して使用します。標準圧縮方式は、下のディジタルBS放送にも使われている、MPEG-2 AACという方式で、CD数百枚分が詰め込める容量を持つ優れものです。あまりに大量のデータが入るので、聴きたい曲を探し出すのが大変ですが、アップル社が提供する
iTunes というソフトで分類やプレイリストを作って ( 自動 ) 転送する方式なので少し慣れると比較的簡単に聴きたい曲を選び出すことが出来ます。他機種と比較したことはないのですが、選択の要はコンピュータソフトを含めた使い勝手の良さにあると思います。音質の方はまずまずといったところです。
なお、iPodをいい音で聴くためには、イヤホンを少しいいのと取り替えることをお薦めします。
特に、最近のiPodに付属しているEarPodsというイヤホンはイヤパッドを使わないので耳とのフィットが調整出来ず、少なくとも私にとっては残念ながらいい音では聴けません。 現在 （ 2017年5月 ） 、私が使っているのは、Audio-
Technica 製 ATH - CKS990で、空気漏れが少なく重低音までよく再生し 、中高音がクリアで気に入っています。ただし、適当なイアパッドを付けないと空気漏れが激しく低音がほとんど聴こえなくなるので注意が必要です。
最近、家で音楽を聴く時の音源として、テレビの音楽番組のDVD録画を聴く （見る？） 時間がもっとも長いように思います。この場合も音声は、現有のステレオシステム （アンプはAVアンプ） で聴いています。映像付で音を聴くのはオーディオ道にとっては邪道だと言う人もいるようですが、本来音楽は演奏家を前にして聴衆とともに聴くもので、スタジオで部分録音したソースを編集したものが中心のCDのほうが邪道ではないでしょうか？
最近急激に普及しつつあるHDD&DVD
（またはBlu-rayDisk） レコーダーは以前のビデオテープによる録画にくらべ格段に便利で、かつ音質もCD並みと良く近い将来、家庭での音楽鑑賞はこの方法が主流になると思っています。すでに、我が家では数百枚のCDがLPレコードと同様過去の遺物になりつつあります。なお、BSテレビを録画して楽しむノーハウ「BSエアチェックの薦め」もご覧下さい。
ちなみに、現在のデジタルテレビの音声信号の規格は以下の通りです。
NHK のディジタル放送： かって のBモードステレオ （ 48kHz 16bit） に相当するディジタル信号を、MPEG-2 AAC方式で圧縮しているようです。 5.1chサラウンド放送もあり、その音質は気になるところですが、圧縮音の音質を決める伝送ビットレートなど、詳細はあまり知られていないようです。そこで、NHKへ直接問い合わせた結果を別ページに掲載しておきます。
結論的には、2chステレオ放送でも、5.1chサラウンド放送でも、BモードPCM放送に遜色ない音質を保っているということのようです。とはいっても、5.1chサラウンド放送を2chステレオで聴くと、多くの情報を失うことになるので、
AVアンプと組み合わせ5.1ch で聴くことをお薦めします。その方がより高い臨場感が得られるといってもいいでしょう。
ただし、CDにもいい録音とそうでないのがあるように、音楽番組も国内収録のクラシック番組はまず安心して聴けますが、海外収録のものはばらつきが多くベルリンフィルの演奏などもせっかくの良い演奏が音質がもう一つでがっかりさせられることもあります。
現在ではテレビ放送を録画するにはハードディスク+DVD （またはBlu-rayDisk） レコーダーを使うのが一般的ですが、これはそれ以前のビデオテープレコーダーに比べ、大変便利な機能を満載した『優れもの』です。その機能の一端を紹介しますと。
まず、一般的 にDVD録画/録音が従来のテープ方式に比べ優れている点は(1)収納スペースが大幅に節約できる。(2)再生の際瞬時に曲の頭出しが出来る。当然巻き戻し操作は不必要。(3)画質・音質の劣化がない。といったところでしょうか。かんじんの画質/音質はどうかというと、DVDレコーダーの場合、画像･音声の品位
（データ圧縮率） が任意に設定可能 で （ただし設定可能範囲は機種依存） 、目的によって色々な品位での録画/録音が可能です。音楽番組を録画する場合は音質重視で非圧縮リニアPCM録音が可能です。
さて、HDD内臓の機種が優れている点はその編集能力です。
多岐にわたるので私が音楽番組を現有の装置 （ TOSHIBA RD - S302 ) に録画編集する方法を紹介します。
まず、やるべきことは録画/録音の品質設定です。普通の音楽会は2時間強で休憩時間を除けば実質2時間以内になると思いますがこれを1枚のDVD-R ( 4.7GB ) に記録するために音声はリニアＰＣＭ、画像は4.0Mbｐs と音質優先の初期設定にしておきます。 ( 音声をリニアＰＣＭにすると画質も最高品位でしか録画できない機種が多いので注意！）
実際の録画はほとんどディジタルBSテレビ （ハイビジョン放送を含む） の録画予約でハードディスクに記録します。なお、その時見たいときは追っかけ再生が可能なので録画が始まって後、始めから見られます。
後で再生するとき、曲の区切り点や休憩時間の前後に印を付けておきます
（これをチャプター区切りをいっています） 。こうして録画した番組をDVD-R （又 はDVD-RAM ) に記録するときは編集機能を使って、メディアに記録可能な長さ範囲内で、必要な部分 （チャプター） を取り出しダビングします。この時少々面倒ですがタイトルなどを付けることも出来ます。
HDD ＆ブルーレイレコーダー
AVアンプのところで紹介したように、最近5.1ch サラウンド放送など多チャンネル音源が容易に手に入ります。これを録画・再生するにはDVDレコーダーでは役不足で、ブルーレイレコーダーが必要となります。といっても、最近のレコーダーはほとんどブルーレイディスク対応になっていますが、これを有効に使うにはAVアンプが必要なので、こちらも手に入れる必要があります。
オーディオラック Topへ
オーディオラックにも随分高価なものがあり、振動による悪影響を避けるため必要だといわれています。確かにアナログプレーヤーと真空管アンプを使っていた時代は振動に極めて敏感でありラックにも細心の注意を払う必要がありました。 しかし、CDプレーヤーと半導体アンプを使う場合、外部から伝わる振動がCDプレーヤーやアンプを通し音質に与える影響は極めて小さく、心配する必要はありません。これについては無音のCDを用いた実験を行なって確かめてみました。ただ、どんなラックでもいいかというとそうでなく、例えば側板や背板に薄いベニヤ板などが使ってあると共振を起こす可能性があり悪影響を与えます。したがって、オーディオラックは単純な棚形式の物がよく、強度や重量はそれほど気にすることはありません。
言い換えれば、ラックの影響は振動が電気系を通じて生じるのではなく、CDラックや一般の家具と同じように、それ自身の振動に注意すればよいいうことです。もちろん、オーディオラックはスピーカーに近い場合が多いのでより細心の注意が必要です。
現有オーディオ AV システム と選択理 由 Topへ
以上は各コンポーネントについて、なるべく具体的な数値を挙げ定量的な議論になるよう心がけてきましたが、実際にどのような製品を買ったらいいのかについては一切言及していません。それは、私自身それほど製品についての知識が豊富でなく、また肝心の試聴も行なっていませんので、やむ得ないことと思っています。
以下のシステムは、自分自身が使っているコンポーネントですから、当然自分の考えに沿ったものであり、スピーカーなどは試聴もしています。選択に当ってのプリンシプルは、各機器について、ある価格帯までは価格に比例した性能が期待できるがそれ以上になるとあまり画期的な向上は期待できない臨界価格というものがあると考えています。そこが狙い目になるわけですが、問題は、これがどれ位の価格になるかであり、私の感じでは、大雑把に、CDプレーヤー,アンプ,スピーカ （ 1本 ） が各10万位ではないかと思っています。また、スーパー （サブ） ウーファーをうまく使うことが臨場感ある音楽再生を得るコツではないかと思っています。
なお、このサイトを見て、私も殆んど同じようなシステムを使っているというメールをいくつか頂戴しました。皆さん、技術屋さんで、ここら辺が技術面からアプローチした場合の一つの解ではないかと密かに思っています。
また、ここに、時計の購入と比較してオーディオ製品の選択の基準を論じたコラムを掲載しています。

Another Fraud on Iran : No Legislation on Dress of Religious Minorities
Maurice Motamed , the representative of the Iranian Jewish community in Iran ’s parliament , has strongly denied the rumors started by Canada ’s National Post that the Iranian legislature has passed a law requiring members of religious communities to wear identifying badges .
The report was also denied on Montreal radio by Meir Javedanfar , Middle East Analyst and the Director for the Middle East Economic and Political Analysis Company .
The National Post was founded by Conrad Black and has been owned by CanWest since 2003 , * is not a repository of expertise about Iran .
It is typical of black psychological operations campaigns that they begin with a plant in an out of the way * newspaper that is then picked up by the mainstream press .
Once the Jerusalem Post picks it up , then reporters can source it there , even though the Post has done no original reporting and has just depended on the National Post article , which is extremely vague in its own sourcing ( to “ human rights groups ” ) .
The actual legislation passed by the Iranian parliament regulates women ’s fashion , and urges the establishment of a national fashion house that would make Islamically appropriate clothing .
There is a vogue for “ Islamic chic ” among many middle class Iranian women that involves , for instance , wearing expensive boots that cover the legs and so , it is argued , are permitted under Iranian law .
The scruffy , puritanical Ahmadinejad and his backers among the hardliners in parliament are waging a new and probably doomed struggle against the young Iranian fashionistas .
( The Khomeinists give the phrase “ fashion police ” a whole new meaning ) .
There is nothing in this legislation that prescribes a dress code or badges for Iranian religious minorities , and Maurice Motamed was present during its drafting and says nothing like that was even discussed .
The whole thing is a steaming crock .
In fact , Iranian Jewish expatriates themselves have come out against a bombing campaign by the US or Israel against Iran .
There are still tens of thousands of Jews in Iran , and expatriate Iranian Jews most often identify as Iranians and express Iranian patriotism .
I was in Los Angeles when tens of thousands of Iranians immigrated , fleeing the Khomeini regime .
I still remember Jewish Iranian families who suffered a year or two in what they thought of as the sterile social atmosphere of LA , and who shrugged and moved right back to Iran , where they said they felt more comfortable .
This affair is similar to the attribution to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of the statement that “ Israel must be wiped off the map . ”
No such idiom exists in Persian , and Ahmadinejad actually just quoted an old speech of Khomeini in which he said “ The occupation regime over Jerusalem must vanish from the page of time . ”
Of course Ahamdinejad does wish Israel would disappear , but he is not commander of the armed forces and could not attack it even if he wanted to , which he denies .
I had a very disturbing short email correspondence with a reporter of a major national newspaper who used the inaccurate “ wiped off the face of the map ” quote .
When challenged , he said it was “ carried by the news wires and is well known ” or words to that effect .
I pointed out that the “ quote ” was attributed to a specific speech and that the statement was inaccurately translated .
When challenged further he alleged that his trusted translator in Tehran affirmed that Ahmadinejad had said the phrase .
When that was challenged , he reported that the translator said that anyway he had said something like it .
When I pointed out that the translator was either lying or lazy , the reporter took offense that I had insulted a trusted colleague !
I conclude that this reporter is attached to the phrase .
He complained about being challenged by “ bloggers ” and said he was tempted to stop reading “ blogs . ”
So this is how we got mire in the Iraq morass .
Gullible and frankly lazy and very possibly highly biased reporters on the staffs of the newspapers in Washington DC and New York .
And they criticize bloggers .
On how Iran is not actually any sort of military threat to Israel , see the op-ed at the Star Ledger by Thomas Lippman and myself .
Lippman is a veteran Washington Post correspondent who covered the Iraq War .
Note : I had corrected the para in our op - ed that referred to the “ wiped off the map quote ” but somehow an earlier draft got sent out accidentally .
Since the article instances it as an unlikely hypothetical , no harm done , I think .
Antonia Zerbisias has more on the Benador connections of this story .
Same agency as got up the Iraq War .

It 's about time !
Reported a couple of hours ago on CherryFlava - Google Maps has switched on the light in darkest Africa .
Darkest , of course , because up till now we have been a fairly insubstantial white blob in the world 's most popular online mapping service
This is important why ?
Well , it 's free of course .
And Google Maps has this nifty little interface where you can plugin and geomap any point ... gratis .
Companies like MapIt and others who have been hoarding this service for a small fortune must be quaking in their map - making boots .
( Apologies for singling out MapIt , but last time I got a quote for some substantial geo-mapping , it worked out cheaper to hand - sketch my crinkly old Book of the Road ! )
Expect to see a proliferation of Google Maps chatter in the near future :
Companies will add buttons to their websites where you can autozoom to a GoogleMap .
Sales forces will start GooglePinning their customers .
Property websites will be scrambling for developers as consumers start route - planning their Sunday house shopping .
Car GPS manufacturers will be scrambling for sales people ( you did know Google Maps can display on your cellphone ? )
It 's opened a whole can of mashups ( check out the link to the left to be really impressed ) .
The world as we know it ...
It 's a big event in our fledgling Internet country .
Just how it rolls out will remain to be seen .
The detail is not quite there - Google seems to have got the main streets right , but nothing to the level of detail they have for the States .
We 'll get there ...
In the mean time ... start playing .
The robot will go on sale in mid-September
The one - metre tall humanoid Wakamaru robot is being marketed as a mechanical house - sitter and secretary .
Japanese manufacturer Mitsubishi Heavy Industries expects the first robots to go on sale in September .
" This is the opening of an era in which human beings and robots can co-exist , " the company said .
The company says the robot can watch over homes while the owners are away , alerting them to possible burglaries .
It can also apparently help monitor the condition of a sick person .
And according to Mitsubishi , the robot can act as a secretary , recording notes and appointments and reminding owners of them with well - timed announcement .
The Wakamaru weighs 30kg ( 66 lb ) and is expected to cost 1.58 m yen ( US $ 14,300 ) .
Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries says it is the first robot with communication ability to be sold for use in the house .
It is powered by rechargeable batteries and moves around on wheels , Japan 's Kyodo news agency reports .

The Ethics of Scambaiting Most decent people who stumble across this site are initially amused by the antics but then start to feel some pangs of conscience - sure its funny but maybe its not very * nice * to string them along like that .
After all , surely they wouldnt be doing it unless they had to etc
Over time there have been some excellent answers to this question so it was decided to collate these together .
1 . Surely no one believes it when they get one of these letters ?
It often comes as a surprise when you hear of someone who actually believed that some ex-presidents son wanted their help to rescue the family fortune .
In February 2004 , Nigerian Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo - Iweala said :  In Nigeria , we are always amazed that anyone could be so stupid as to respond to such an offer . 
The fact is that many people do believe these letters  enough to make 419 crime quite a lucrative money earner .
It has been estimated that there are well over 250,000 scammers involved in 419 scams worldwide and that they reap in over US $ 1.5 billion annually .
The average victim pays out US $ 20,000 .
People who already know that its a scam tend not to get taken in .
But there are so many variations from help me get this dead mans money out of the country before the nasty government confiscates it to  I m dieing .
Please look after my children when I m gone that it is quite easy for someone who does not know to get sucked in .
And of course once the scammers have their claws into their victim they use every trick they know to make them pay more and more until there is nothing left .
ScamPatrol comes across between 15 - 20 victims per week , many of who have already sent money at the time they were warned .
Sadly , many of those are already so convinced by the story that they refuse to believe the warnings and continue to contact the scammers .
2 . But only people who are greedy and a bit dishonest themselves would get sucked in .
After all most of the letters require you to pass yourself off as a relative on legal documents so they deserve what they get .
Many of the early letters did state either that person x ( usually a foreign national ) had died without relatives and the corrupt government would confiscate this money if person Y ( the victim ) doesnt impersonate a relative to claim the money .
Another variation was that the money had been obtained by over - invoicing oil contracts and they needed help to sneak it out of the country .
But usually these letters had a disclaimer to the effect of , " This is a completely legitimate transaction .
It will be carried out legally , and you will be protected from any breach of the law . "
This was to reassure more honest victims that everything was above board and legal .
Now letters come in hundreds of different formats  just check out the Surplus Letters Forum !
There are the well - known next - of - kin letters , the orphan scams , repentant dying sinner needs help giving fortune away to charity , tsunami victim donation appeals , fake cheque scams , wash - wash , anti-scam scams ( been a victim of 419 crime ?
Well get your money back for you  at a price ! ) and more .
Good , well - meaning people get tricked .
Consider this woman : From : XXX XXX Jennings < [ email protected ] >
To : Amanda Fairheart - Smythe
Date : Tue , 7 Dec 2004 12:09:16 - 0600 ( Central Standard Time ) Dear Amanda Fairheart - Smythe , I wish I had received this email over 3 years ago .
This man has stolen all that I had saved and money that I borrowed .
I heard from his Mother (? ) telling me a sad story that she was dying from Aids and wanted me to take her children as my own when she died .
She had set up an Inheritance account and put it in my name .
How stupid could I have been ?
What I sent was to cover legal fees , legal documents , etc ...
The money was never sent here .
I have heard in the last couple of days from the bank and have found out that Kwesi Bandermann and others are thieves .
Why did it take over 3 years to find this out ?
I would never put your informants life in danger .
My life is in danger now as well as my family .
I have received threats this week .
I am so afraid now and do n't know what to do .
How did you know that Kwesi Bandermann was expected to arrive here by plane ?
He did not arrive and I pray to God he does n't .
How did you get this email address ?
Only 2 people had it .
It was Mr. Richard Meddings and Kwesi Bandermann .
I can tell you the whole story if you need it .
Sincerely ,
XXX XXX Jennings
All she wanted to do was adopt some children whose mother had died of AIDS .
She was scammed over 3 years and lost vast amounts of money .
Greedy ?
I dont think so .
Also consider the vast number charity scams .
Less than 2 days after the tsunami killed over 200,000 people in Asia on Boxing Day 2004 , scam letters were being circulated .
People responded to these not because they were greedy but because they were generous and wanted to help those in trouble .
3 . People would n't send them money if they did n't have it to spare .
Again , this is false .
Those who fall for these scams believe they are about to get millions of dollars .
Compared to such huge sums what is $ 20 - 60,000 ?
They see it as a 100 % risk free investment that will pay off within days or weeks .
Many of the victims take out personal loans , re-mortgage their homes , sell possessions , borrow from family and friends , and more to send money to these scammers .
When the money is gone and the scam finishes they are left with crippling debt .
I am a pastor in United Arab Emirates and am also a victim of them .
I am poor and hardly feed my family with my meager earnings .
I received an email on 28 Feb 2001 from a person called " Shan Lee Shun " saying that he is the adopted son of a Japanese widow who left huge wealth .
He informed that this lady made a will to divide a part of her wealth to many humanitarian organizations and churches world wide and my name is also included in that .
My portion he said was $ 1.6 million .
He sent some documents to ' prove ' that and said that the money is invested with a GLOBAL SECURITIES AND COURIER COMPANY in Amsterdam and I was invited to visit Amsterdam to get this transaction done .
Foolishly believing this I went to Amsterdam but before going they said that a handling charge of $ 18,000 should be given but I had not even $ 500 with me .
When I told about this to a friend , trusting me , he gave this money by acquiring a loan from his bank on the promise that I would return this amount soon .
I sent this to them to transfer the money to account in UAE .
Then they informed me that in order to release the amount I should produce a Drug Clearance Certificate .
For that they said that $ 50000 was required .
Still believing this , I told another friend of mine and he offered to help me by acquiring a loan from the bank .
With this amount I went to Amsterdam where they took the money from me , gave me a ' certificate ' and sent me back along with some bank transfer ' receipts ' of money to my account .
Later on I came to know that this was fraud and I got cheated .
Since then I am in a very difficult situation that I cannot even feed my children well or send them properly to school .
I am paying back the amount every month with almost all of my earnings and still I need to pay a big amount which is left .
I just pray to God to settle my debt .
I have complained once to the Amsterdam Police and no action has been taken by them .
God bless you for all what you are doing to help these kind of victims .
Yours sincerely Pastor John C 04/12/03 4 .
They wouldnt send much .
After a couple of times they would realise that they re being duped before they lose too much money .
It would be nice if that was the case .
However , the most successful of these criminals are very good at what they do .
Plus , it gets to a point where the victim thinks  Ive come so far and paid so much , surely it this is the last payment .
The victim becomes trapped into a never - ending spiral of fees and setbacks each costing more and more money .
There are documented cases of victims from a number of different countries who have paid out millions to these scammers .
Some of them are still convinced that the money they were promised a share of exists .
Investors hit twice in scams , court told  over $ 2 million Nigerian Money Scammers Claim a Major Victim - $ 320,000 5 .
But the scammers are only trying to get ahead & feed their families .
If the West had n't raped their country of its wealth they would n't have to do this .
Funnily enough , this is the argument most often used by the Nigerian lads and their supporters .
Recent lad visits to the forum show that this is a prevailing justification for their scamming .
Basically the argument goes something like this : 1 . Nigeria was a happy and peaceful country until the west came along .
2. Western companies , such as Halliburton and Shell , bribed their way into the country and proceeded to strip Nigeria of its assets leaving the inhabitants poverty stricken and struggling to survive .
3 . Therefore the West is responsible and now it is payback time .
Lad to Janne Pekkala ( Baiter ) : Ok , I do n't realy call it cheating , most times the smart person become victorious .
Some body has to pay what we call retribution From what Africa went through during the Slave trade era
The west took all our resourses , Manpower , and our cultural and traditional wares Great acheivements
Some body will pay some how what your lineage owed
This fails to take into account several very basic facts and concepts : 
There is a culture in Nigeria that esteems those who can make money without working .
One moderator of our forum , Old Coaster , grew up in Nigeria and notes :
In the 18th century , European traders sat in hulks and trading posts at the mouths of the Oil Rivers , Badagry and other sites and were well used to the ridiculous amounts demanded by Nigerian traders for Palm Oil , Ivory and Slaves .
Serious negotiation was involved and people like John Holt are on record complaining about the difficulty of dealing with the locals I grew up in Nigeria long before oil was discovered in the Niger Delta .
The culture of Southern Nigeria has always admired those who can make money without working and I have scam letters going back to the 1950's .
Us Old Coasters became increasingly irritated with the outrageous prices demanded by traders for Nigerian Craft work as the tourist business increased and naive tourists ( usually Americans ) paid the initial prices asked which could be up to 20 times the going price elsewhere .
The somewhat " jack the lad " culture of southern Nigeria combined with the stupidity of foreigners showed how easy it was to make money from the white mugus and intelligent scammers soon developed the 419 scams , initially via fax and then via the internet .
Children raised in this culture soon learn that scamming is acceptable  especially if you are successful .
A Nigerian member of this forum wrote :
The attitude of the family is largely dependent on the degree of success their chum has with scamming , if the lads been on it for 3 yrs and only has a fairly used car to show , he 's a failure and no - good ... but if he 's built a couple of houses and cruises around in an X5 , all hail the king !
They even give him a chieftaincy title in his hometown !!! 
Using internet cafes costs money .
Those poor starving Nigerians who cant afford to feed their family also cant afford to use internet cafes . 
It is the better educated Nigerians who are able to speak some English .
While we may laugh at the way they mangle it ( how well can you write in another language ? ) they wouldnt be able to speak it at all if they werent somewhat better off than many of the rest of their countrymen .

Scams do not target Westerners .
They target anyone with money .
In this thread one of the 419eater moderators , Lew_Skannen replies to this claim with a list of some of the victims that he has personally spoken to :
1 . Thai women , catering assistant in Bangkok - lost about £ 20,000 of money borrowed from family and employer .
When she told the scammer she had no money he told her to go borrow some .
2. Saudi Arab - $ 130 K
3. Egyptian - sick wife - lost $ 10 K
4. Egyptian - $ 7 K
5. Black American woman - student - lost $ 2K
6. Black American woman - single mother - lost about $ 10 K but was saved from losing another $ 20 K by a timely phone call .
7. Korean guy - Lost $ 1000 +
8. Mexican woman - reasonably wealthy family I think - lost $ 120 K
9. Polynesian woman - $ 5 K
10 - Colombian man - $ 500 only .
 Successful scammers make a lot of money out of it .
If they were really doing this to right past wrongs then the money would be used to assist the poor .
But this money doesnt get distributed to the poor .
It goes straight into their own pockets .
The money that their victims have borrowed to fund this business deal and will spend years paying back goes on supporting a lifestyle that very few others in Nigeria can enjoy .
In the course of this business I have purchased several luxury cars and built many large houses which I rent out .
Believe you me my friend , an American sucker is born every hour .
Take you for instance if you had any money you would have lost it .
The only thing keeping you safe is your poverty .
You should thank God for that ! 
Many countries are poor and many countries have come off second best from colonialism but Nigeria has a huge amount of valuable natural resources .
There is more than enough to drag it out of poverty .
However corruption is a colossal problem - Nigeria is rated as the second most corrupt country in the world ( after Bangladesh ) and that corruption is right through the whole of the society  from the top down .
Nigeria will not be able to escape what some see as the legacy of colonialism until this problem is dealt with .
As long as it is tolerated , or worse encouraged , by the majority of people then they will continue to struggle as a poor nation , stigmatized by a reputation for corruption and scamming .
6 . Those pictures with the signs & poses are degrading .
How can you make them do that ?
They have a choice and they could ( and sometimes do ) choose not to send a picture .
There are no trunk boxes with $ 20 million that they must get out of the country .
They are simply doing it to extort money out of the victim .
If they believe that holding a silly sign or posing with a fish on their head is going to get them some easy money from a gullible victim then they will do what it takes .
They are criminals .
Actually there are a couple of benefits from asking for photos with signs .
One , of course , is the humor aspect .
Another excellent benefit is that now some scammers are becoming wary of any requests for signs and are dropping legitimate victims as soon as they ask for some kind of photograph .
This is always a good thing !
7 . Okay , so they are trying to get money out of people .
That s a crime but it not like its fatal !
Sorry guys , actually it can be .
Numerous victims of scammers have committed suicide or been murdered due to these scams .
One particularly nasty type of scam involves getting a victim to travel to the scammers country , usually Nigeria , South Africa or to Amsterdam , with large amounts of cash to finalize the transaction .
The victim is then kidnapped , often beaten and tortured and sometimes killed .
This is not a rare event .
It has happened numerous times .
At the time of writing this FAQ the latest known victim was a 29 year old Greek man , George Makronalli , who traveled to South Africa as part of a 419 scam .
He was then kidnapped and killed when his family refused to pay the ransom .
A day later , police found George 's body in Durban .
Both his legs and arms were broken and he had been set alight - probably while he was still alive .

Even if the scam does not cost the victim their life often it can strip them of everything they have worked for and hold dear .
Many victims end up losing their homes , retirement or education savings , businesses and jobs , and their professional or personal credibility .
All they are left with is large debts that they have no way of repaying .
The tangible cost of fraud crime is easily translated into dollar amounts .
Less easily measured , and perhaps the most exacting cost of all , is the severe emotional impact of fraud crime on many of its victims .
Fraud crime is a personal violation .
Although there is no serious physical injury many victims of con-men speak of the betrayal as the psychological equivalent of rape .
Their trust in their own judgment , and their trust in others , is often shattered .
They may have hesitated to tell family members , friends , or colleagues about their victimization for fear of criticism .
Family members and business associates may even have been financially exploited at their urging , resulting in increased feelings of guilt and blame .
The dread becomes immeasurable , unrelated to specifics , just an all encompassing blanket of depression .
Fraud often evokes the following feelings or emotional reactions among its victims : self - doubt , shock , disbelief
societal condemnation and indifference ( the attitude that victims of fraud deserve what they get as a result of their own greed and stupidity )
isolation ( when victims suffer their losses in silence rather than risking alienation and blame from family members , friends , and colleagues )
anger , resentment , and a sense of betrayal toward the offender for taking advantage of them especially if they were someone they knew
frustration with criminal justice professionals
shame , embarrassment , and guilt if they feel they contributed to their own or others ' victimization
fear for their financial security
increased concern about their personal safety and well - being or that of their family .
Some of the same physiological and long - term emotional effects experienced by victims of violent crimes are also experienced by fraud victims such as :  feeling of terror or helplessness
 rapid heart rate
 hyperventilation
 panic
 inability to eat or sleep
 loss of enjoyment of daily activities
 depression Short - term effects on victims include : preoccupation with the crime ( thinking about it a great deal , talking about it constantly , replaying the crime , wondering what they could have done differently , etc . )
inability to concentrate or perform simple mental tasks
concern that other people will blame them for what has happened
increased strain on personal relationships ( even to the extent of divorce or withdrawal of support )
In the extreme , fraud crimes have led some victims to attempt or succeed in committing suicide .
One of these was Leslie Fountain who committed suicide by setting himself alight after he was cheated by an internet scam .

As you can see , 419 scams are about more than just pick - pocketing a handful of small change from victims .
The scammers ruin lives .
They use every trick in the book to get as much money as possible out of their victims .
They do not care about the people they scam or the effect it has on them .
They dupe the generous and the greedy alike .
No matter what a persons motivation for answering a 419 letter nobody deserves to be put through the kind of hell that these scum have waiting for their victims .
And no scammer deserves to profit from lying and stealing .
That is why we have no problem with baiting .
Every scammer baited , every lad who poses with a sign for a baiter , every false form filled in , every fake bank taken down means that less victims are scammed .
We keep the scammers busy with safe targets .
We occupy them and waste their time .
Hopefully some will decide its not worth it and get an honest job .
Others may get caught in a sting .
Many of the members on the 419eater.com forum are also active on other forums that assist the victims , such as ScamPatrol.org
FraudAid.com
Scamwarners.com
These members have seen first hand the profound effects that are experienced by people who have been scammed .
Some of them deal with hundreds of victims a year .
They know all too well the suffering of the victims .
Any sympathy they might have once had for the criminals has evaporated when faced with the day to day grim reality of the suffering inflicted on innocent men and women who have had the misfortune to get caught up in a 419 scam .
Please dont offend them by siding with the scammers .
Posts that question the ethics of scam baiting , call baiters racists , try to justify the scams or call victims greedy will usually result in a polite request to use the search button before posting .
Continue to post and you may find their patience stretched .
8 . What can I do to help ?
There are a couple of key things you can do to help .

Make sure that your family and friends are 419 safe .
Nothing would be more gut - wrenching than to spend hours baiting and shutting down fake banks just to find out old Aunty Enid has fallen for a scam and sent her retirement savings off to Nigeria !  Bait !
The more baiters the better as it keeps the scammers busy .

Have fun when you bait .
The more you mess around with a lad the more likely hell be suspicious of the next new victim reply that lands in his in box .

Keep alert for scammers details .
Things such as account numbers , physical addresses , fake bank web addresses , ccd lists of other e-mail addresses and so on can be very helpful .
We have a team of dedicated fake bank killers who like to meet new fake banks .
9 . Is n't scambaiting and / or this site racist ?
Our guidelines clearly set out that racism is not permitted here .
For those who doubt our sincerity , heres some evidence to back it up :
* We bait the scammers that come to us .
Often that is via seeding a guestbook that has obviously been harvested by scammers before .
Some baiters pick up scammers from the surplus letters forum here at Eater , and some find them through publicly available lists of known scammers , such as urgentmessage.org or similar sites .
Some baiters choose to bait scammers that approach them on message boards , dating sites , or selling sites such as Ebay or Craigslist .
None of these sources differentiate between colour , race or ethnic origin , so we have no way of knowing what their characteristics are  the only thing we know for sure , or care about at all , is that they are scammers .
*
The scammers can choose to be whatever race , colour or ethnic origin they like , and baiters usually have no way of knowing whether they are telling the truth .
Scammers lie  its in their job description , and they have to be good at it or they dont make any money .
The scammers will rarely tell the truth about anything and will try to avoid sending a picture of themselves  they use magazines and image sites on the internet to harvest pictures of people to conceal their true identity .
We have no way of knowing whether the scammer is sending a picture of someone who shares their ethnic background or race , or whether they are telling the truth about any personal details .
*
Yes , a lot of the trophies and pictures you will see here are of people who are from , or claiming to be from , Nigeria .
There are a lot of Nigerian scammers , as 5 minutes  research on the internet will tell you .
As we often reitierate here , that does not mean that all scammers are Nigerian , nor that all Nigerians are scammers .
The vast majority of Nigerians are law - abiding citizens , and we know that a good many of them are appalled at the reputation that widespread scamming has inflicted on their country .
We share their disgust .
*
White scammers exist and we bait them .
Scammers claim to be from all over the world , and there are indeed scammers all over the world .
Many of the love / dating scammers purport to be white Russian women .
We have no idea whether they are , in the same way that we have no idea if someone claiming to be a black Nigerian actually is what he / she claims to be , but the chances are that we are baiting a significant number of white European , East European or Russian love scammers .
We also bait a number of cheque scammers who say they are from China , and charity scammers who purport to be from all over the world , including Asia , Indonesia ( especially after the tsunami ) , or the US ( after the Katriona hurricane notably ) .
We have no way of knowing their race , colour or ethnic origin , and it is immaterial to us .
*
We have long - standing members who are Nigerian , and also receive comments from Nigerian visitors to the site .
Not one of our long - standing Nigerian members has complained that the ethos of the site is racist .
One of our Nigerian members was a mod until recently  it defies belief to say that he would have agreed to moderate the site if he thought 419 Eater or scambaiting was racist .
*
We have an active moderation team who keep a close eye on posts , and will delete or edit any that infringe Eater policy .
Individual posts are reported for racism from time to time , and they are always acted on speedily .
The person posting it will be censured immediately .
We have banned people for using racist usernames , linking to racist sites , and in one instance we banned a member solely because we discovered that they also belonged to a white supremacist site .
They had not posted anything racist or linked their site , so it was not for show .
They were banned because they were a member of a racist site and therefore not someone we wanted on Eater .
Eaters anti-racism policy is sincere .
We are genuinely offended by the accusation that we are racist , hence this effort to persuade you that we are not .
If you have read this far , thank you , and we hope that you will take some time to read the site , and make up your own mind based on what you see .
This site has a lot of stuff that is fun and frivolous , but some things are serious  the efforts we make to hurt scammers and protect the innocent are testament to that , and just as serious is our intolerance of bigotry .
Article by The Cheshire Cat with additional information by Eight .
Studies show that you can bring about a dream in another person .
One way is by holding an open bottle of perfume under the sleeper 's nose .
Another is by whistling .
A third way is by blowing air across the sleeper 's face with a fan .
Someone else can also affect the content of a sleeper ’s dream .
For example , turning on a light produces happier dreams .
And darkening an already bright room can induce nightmares .
What would happen if I was prevented from dreaming ?
In a study conducted by Dr William Dement , a professor of psychiatry at Stanford University , it was found that dream deprivation produces anxiety , irritability , an inability to concentrate , paranoia , a ravenous appetite , depression , and even suicidal thoughts .
The study was very simple .
Volunteers were assigned beds in a laboratory .
Researchers observed them closely for five nights .
Each time a subject 's rapid eye movements indicated they were starting to dream ( REM sleep ) , the researchers would wake them up and keep them from dreaming .
It seems that it only takes a few days of dream deprivation before the symptoms begin to occur .
Why ca n’t I remember all of a dream ?
How much of a dream we remember depends upon how soon we awaken after the dream .
In one study , sleeping subjects were awakened while they were dreaming in REM sleep .
Other sleeping subjects were awakened 15 minutes after they were in REM sleep .
In 152 out of 191 cases , the subjects awakened during REM sleep remembered they were dreaming and could recall a great deal of content of their dreams .
Hardly any of the subjects awakened 15 minutes after their REM sleep could remember dreaming at all .
If you ’re awakened during or shortly after REM sleep , you ’re probably more likely to remember more of your dream .

The functional language that ’s right under your nose
Recently I ’ve been getting an itch to learn a functional programming language .
I ’ve made a couple attempts on Lisp over the years , with mixed results ; I can write fairly basic Common Lisp , and hack on Emacs a bit , but I ’ve never advanced much beyond that .
I ’d been looking at some of the trendy , popular functional languages ( well , popular among certain circles ) like Haskell , OCaml and Erlang , when I remembered that I already knew a functional language .
In fact , part of the reason why I was hired at my current job was to write in it .
And , as I browsed through a discussion of functional languages on reddit , it was literally right under my nose .
Yup , I ’m talking about JavaScript .
Digression : stupid things people say about languages
Programming languages tend to be a bit like religions : people get attached to them , develop unshakable faith in them and are all too willing to wish hellfire and damnation on heretics who wo n’t see the light .
As a result , they tend to spew out misconceptions about other programming languages in much the same way that a Protestant fundamentalist goes around saying Catholics are idolaters .
For example , a lot of folks who are n’t card - carrying members of the Church of Python ( blessed be Guido and all His works ) like to go around saying that Python is n’t “ really ” an object - oriented programming language , because you have to use self .
Now , this argument really does n’t make any sense ; when defining a method on a class , the first parameter to it is self , and inside the method you reference attributes of the class instance you ’re working with as self .
this and self .
that and so on and so forth .
The reason behind this is simple : it explicitly establishes variable scope ( think about it : take away the self , and you get things like foo = 3 — is that the attribute foo of the class instance , or is it a variable local to the method ?
Using self .
foo = 3 for the former case and foo = 3 for the latter does away with the ambiguity ) .
Plenty of other languages do this ; for example , Java uses this and Ruby uses @ .
Nobody tries to argue that Java or Ruby are n’t “ really ” object - oriented because of that ;
Python goes a little further and requires you to explicitly list self as an argument to the method , but Python people like being explicit .
If being explicit about scoping means Python is n’t really object - oriented , then being explicit about the types of variables and function return values means Java does n’t really have a type system .
A lot of people will also say horrible things about JavaScript , because despite being a really interesting language , lots of people do n’t like JavaScript ( well , to be perfectly honest , lots of people do n’t like the available implementations of JavaScript and , to be really honest , lots of people particularly do n’t like the available implementations of one API that ’s used a lot in JavaScript ) .
For example , I ’ve seen people try to argue that JavaScript is n’t “ really ” object - oriented because you do n’t define classes using a class keyword .
JavaScript uses prototype - based inheritance , rather than class - based inheritance , but it is still a thoroughly object - oriented language .
Anyway , the whole point of these examples is to show that lots of people say silly wrong things about programming languages all the time , and mostly it ’s got more to do with some agenda they ’re pushing than with anything remotely resembling reality .
One of the things people might tell you is that JavaScript is n’t a functional language .
They ’re right , but only for certain values of “ functional ” .
What makes functional programming ?
If we want to be pedantic about it ( and if you know me , you know I always want to be pedantic ) , there are a few things which characterize “ pure ” functional programming :
Obviously , everything is accomplished by calling functions .
There are no “ standalone ” lines of code — the program starts by calling a function , which calls a function , and so on .
Depending on what the program does , it may eventually terminate , or it may simply continue running indefinitely .
In any case , everything takes place inside a function body .
There is no global state and , to be perfectly pure , there are no global variables .
Values can be passed into functions , but those values come from other functions , either as return values or as arguments passed from one function to another .
But there is no “ global scope ” ; each function has only a local scope to work with ( even closures ; their scope is just a bit wider and more long - lived than everybody else ’s ) .
There are no “ side effects ” .
This is a consequence of the lack of global scope or state ; since a function ca n’t “ see ” much , if anything , beyond its local scope ( again , closures are a weird case ) , there is no way for a function to modify anything that is n’t handed to it .
This kind of pure functional style has some definite advantages :
It can be easier to debug , since you can just walk up the stack to see what was called and with what arguments ; this makes it simpler to pinpoint where bad data came from .
It can be easier to write unit tests for , since each function can be called on its own and requires only its argument set ; there ’s no need for fixtures or any other environment setup .
It can be easier to refactor , since you can muck about with the internals of a given function and , so long as you do n’t change its signature , be reasonably assured that you have n’t mysteriously broken something else .
It makes multi- threaded programming a little bit easier , because you do n’t have to worry about things in Thread A modifying bits of program state that Thread B needs to work with ( notice that I say “ a little bit easier ” and qualify “ state ” to “ program state ” — if the program is , say , doing database access , it ’s still possible that one thread could modify important data , it ’s just that the data is external to the program ) .
But a lot of this is academic ; there are n’t a whole lot of pure functional languages , and when people talk about doing “ functional programming ” in real - world situations they ’re rarely talking about pure functional programming .
Common Lisp , for example , is n’t a pure functional language , even though Lisp is the patriarch of the functional language family .
And OCaml , which is one of the darlings of the trendy functional programming world these days , also is n’t purely functional .
General mish - mash languages
Plenty of languages also support “ multi- paradigm ” programming ; Python and Ruby , for example , both allow you to bounce around between procedural programming , object - oriented programming and functional programming , using each style wherever it best suits what you need to do .
Generally these languages offer a few important features :
Functions are first - class objects and can be the return values of , or arguments to , other functions .
Not having this feature in a language makes functional programming of any sort diffcult , if not impossible ( Java and C# people : imagine a world where you could just get a real reference to a method instead of doing indirection with delegates ) .
The language supports closures .
This is a tricky topic to explain correctly , but the essence of closures is that you can , for example , have code which generates and returns a function , and which magically “ closes ” up certain values from the enclosing scope and keeps references to them for use by the returned function , even when they would normally go out of scope before the returned function is called .
The language usually — but not always — provides the ability to define “ anonymous ” functions .
These are functions which are not defined by name , but which can be conjured up “ on the fly ” whenever a function needs to be passed in somewhere .
JavaScript has all three of these features : it supports closures , functions are first - class objects and you can define anonymous functions .
This means that , in addition to doing procedural or object - oriented programming , you can easily do functional JavaScript programming .
The case for functional JavaScript
And there are a lot of times where you need JavaScript to be functional , even if you ’re not used to thinking of it in those terms .
Consider this example snippet of code , which — if you were using the YUI toolkit — would set up an event listener for clicks on an HTML element with an id of ‘ myelem ’ :
YAHOO . util .
Event .
addListener ( ' myelem ' , ' click ' , function ( e ) { alert ( " You clicked the ' myelem ' element . " ) ; } ) ;
This is obviously an extremely simple example , but notice three things :
This is a function call .
The final argument is a function .
Not only is it a function , it ’s an anonymous function .
If you ’ve ever done any serious JavaScript programming , you were probably slinging functions — both named and anonymous — around all the time .
Especially when you ’re setting up event listeners or specifying more general callbacks , it ’s just the most natural way to do things , but I ’ve noticed that very few people , even people who write JavaScript day in and day out , realize that what they ’re doing is a form of functional programming .
And that four - letter word that ’s on everybody ’s lips these days — you know the one I ’m talking about — certainly encourages a functional programming style .
For example , when making a remote call with the Dojo toolkit , a couple of the arguments to dojo.io. bind are functions , and a large number of useful examples use anonymous functions defined on the spot .
YUI ’s asyncRequest expects an object as one of its arguments , and several of the attributes of that object are , well , functions .
Prototype ’s Ajax .
Request ( damn , I had to say it ; why ’d they have to put “ AJAX ” in the name ? ) expects , among the other arguments to its constructor , an object , at least one of the attributes of which is a function .
And , of course , Prototype and JQuery are very heavily functional ( JQuery , from what I ’ve seen of it , much more so ) ; very nearly everything you do with them is a direct function call , and lots of the functions you ’re calling can take functions as arguments .
In other words , once you start looking for it , you ’ll start seeing functional programming everywhere in JavaScript .
So ?
You ’re probably wondering if there ’s a point to all of this , and I ’m not sure there is .
Based on what I ’ve been seeing on a few noteworthy programming - oriented news sites , functional programming is enjoying a bit of a renaissance right now , and I know I ’m not the only one with an itch to play around in a functional language .
But that itch often takes the form of working with an entirely new language , requiring you to spend time not only learning the concepts , syntax and standard library , but also getting a development environment set up for it : an IDE , any compilers , interpreters or runtime environments for the language , standard libraries … just getting the tools you need to play with the language can be a major time sink .
Excuse me ?
Someone , on behalf of FOX News , reportedly gave terrorist organizations $ 2 m that the terrorists now say they used to buy weapons to kill Israelis ?
FOX says " it 's possible " money was paid to terrorists ?
And the Bush administration , they were heavily involved in this effort to free the FOX reporters - were they aware that someone was paying off terrorists ?
Were they the ones who arranged the payment ?
This is abominable if true .
Palestinian terror groups and security organizations in the Gaza Strip received $ 2 million from a United States source in exchange for the release of Fox News employees Steve Centanni and Olag Wiig , who were kidnapped here last summer , a senior leader of one of the groups suspected of the abductions told WND .
The terror leader , from the Gaza - based Popular Resistance Committees , said his organization 's share of the money was used to purchase weapons , which he said would be utilized " to hit the Zionists . "
He said he expects the payments for Centanni and Wiig 's freedom will encourage Palestinian groups to carry out further kidnappings .
Officials associated with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas ' Fatah party and its security organization , the Preventative Security Services , confirmed to WND money was paid for the release of the Fox News reporters .... the money was used to purchase weapons .
" We used 100 percent of the money for one precise goal – our war against the Zionists , " the Committees leader said .
He said weapons purchased included rockets .
" Regarding the others ( the Dugmash clan of the Committees ) who received the money , I can tell you one thing is very clear – this went also to be used against the Zionists .
I can't say every cent went to buy bombs , maybe it also went to pay for salaries , smuggling , buying shelter . " ....
A spokeswoman for Fox News Channel told WND she could not provide an official statement about whether Fox was aware of money paid to free its two employees .
A source at Fox told WND many parties were involved with the freedom of Centanni and Wiig , including the U.S. government , and that it was possible money was paid .
Ironically , this news comes on the heels of the leak of an internal FOX memo saying " Be On The Lookout For Any Statements From The Iraqi Insurgents ... Thrilled At The Prospect Of A Dem Controlled Congress . "
Funny , but I bet the terrorists will be even more thrilled at the prospect of FOX News having given them $ 2 m .
Part 1 introduced the myth and looked at the buzz behind Linux .
Here in Part 2 , I 'll take apart a second argument given for moving Mac OS X to a Linux kernel :
Linux ' Performance
Performance comes through optimization .
The fastest cars on the road have specialized tires , huge engines , and throw out every unnecessary pound of weight to make them light , fast and zippy .
They 're optimized , but only for speed .
If you 've ever driven a super elite sports car , you 'll probably remember how uncomfortably cramped they are , how few kids you can cram in the back seat , and how there 's no real stereo system or air conditioning .
One of Linux ' primary advantages is its flexibility in optimization .
You can build a tiny Linux or a supercomputer monster Linux .
You can tailor Linux to serving webpages or database requests , or to run a PVR , PBX , or a PDA .
The only thing Linux has had real trouble with is capturing the consumer desktop market .
No major hardware vendors are currently pushing Linux as a real Windows replacement ; few even offer a token product .
At least for now , Linux ' strengths have been applied elsewhere .
That makes it difficult to make clear and substantial comparisons between Mac OS X , which is sold almost exclusively as a friendly desktop , and Linux , which has been profitable , popular , and optimized for nearly everything but use a friendly desktop .
So what 's the basis for saying that Linux has a much faster kernel than Mac OS X's ?
According to Mark Stephens ( writing as Robert X Cringely ) :
" Why would Apple want a new kernel ?
Speed .
Quite simply , a monolithic kernel like the one used in Linux or most of the other Open Source Unix clones is inherently two to three times faster for integer calculations than the Mach microkernel presently used in OS X 10.4 .
That 's why the world has n't embraced xServes , for example , because for simple web or database service they are slower and serve fewer users . "
His sweeping generalization is wrong on many counts : he 's been duped by the Mac OS X Microkernel Myth , he makes a wild stab into fiction by referring to integer calculations , and he mismingles speculation about the Xserve 's mindshare with his unsupported assumptions about performance .
He does prove a great point however : speaking confidently from your gut can make what you say sound convincing even if you do n't have any facts .
It 's called truthiness .
Where did Cringely get his gut feeling that a different kernel would be , not just potentially somewhat faster , but " inherently " several times faster ?
No doubt from a couple of highly publicized benchmark tests comparing Mac OS X systems with Linux servers .
In each case , those doing the benchmarks had little understanding of how Mac OS X works or how to optimize its performance , but did use optimizations for Linux .
Sound suspicious ?
This calculator implements a normal - order evaluator for the untyped lambda - calculus with shortcuts .
Shortcuts are distinguished constants that represent terms .
An association between a shortcut symbol and a term must be declared before any term that contains the shortcut could be evaluated .
The declaration of a shortcut does not cause the corresponding term to be evaluated .
Therefore shortcut 's term may contain other shortcuts -- or even yet to be defined ones .
Shortcuts make programming in lambda - calculus remarkably more convenient .
Besides terms to reduce , this lambda - calculator accepts a set of commands , which add even more convenience .
Commands define new shortcuts , activate tracing of all reductions , compare terms modulo alpha - conversion , print all defined shortcuts and evaluation flags , etc .
Terms to evaluate and commands are entered at a read - eval - print - loop ( REPL ) " prompt " -- or " included " from a file by a special command .
Examples
First we define a few shortcuts : ( X Define %c0 ( L f ( L x x ) ) ) ; Church numeral 0 ( X Define % succ ( L c ( L f ( L x ( f ( c f x ) ) ) ) ) ) ; Successor ( X Define * %c1 ( % succ %c0 ) ) ( X Define * %c2 ( %succ %c1 ) ) ( X Define % add ( L c ( L d ( L f ( L x ( c f ( d f x ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ;
Add two numerals ( X Define % mul ( L c ( L d ( L f ( c ( d f ) ) ) ) ) ) ; Multiplication ( %add %c1 %c2 )
REPL reduces the term and prints the answer : ( L f ( L x ( f ( f ( f x ) ) ) ) ) .
( X equal ? ( % succ %c0 ) % c1 ) ( X equal ? * ( % succ %c0 ) % c1 )
The REPL executes the above commands and prints the answer : #f and #t , correspondingly .
The second command reduces the terms before comparing them .
This all looks suspiciously like Scheme .
However , try the following two terms : ( % mul % c1 e ) and ( % mul % c0 e ) .
The evaluator reduces the first term to e and the second one to ( L f ( L x x ) ) , which is % c0 .
It must be stressed that in both terms e is a free variable .
We can therefore take the evaluation result as a proof that a left - multiplication by 1 leaves a term e intact , while left - multiplication by zero yields zero -- for all terms !
This is an algebraic result , a clear illustration of usefulness of lambda - calculus in logic and theorem - proof systems .
On the other hand , try to evaluate (* 1 e ) in Scheme with e being an unbound variable !
The title comments to the source code of the calculator explain the differences between a call - by - value evaluator such as Scheme , an applicative - order lambda - calculator , a normal - order evaluator such as Scheme 's macro- expander , and the present normal - order lambda - calculator .
Politics Nov 7 , 2006 Mock the Vote
A month after we asked our readers to create and photograph political campaign signs of their own making , here are our favorites .
We announce the winners of our Encyclopedia Brown for District Attorney contest .
A few years ago I attended a talk given by Ira Glass , host of NPR’s This American Life .
There was no unifying theme — he just sort of rambled on about a variety of things , even going so far as to rattle off his favorite programs , on both radio and TV .
( Fun fact : Ira Glass is a huge fan of Howard Stern . )
At the time , The West Wing was one of the hottest shows on television , and Glass spoke of it with a note of astonishment : “ I just ca n’t believe we ’ve gotten to this point where we ’re so disgusted and frustrated with actual politics that we have to create a second , fictitious government , where presidents and congressmen act on principle and every disagreement is spirited but respectful . ”
Of course , fictional characters have an advantage over reality when it comes to our democratically elected leaders :
They do n’t actually have to run for office .
Jed Bartlet was the POTUS long before The West Wing pilot ; on 2005 ’s short - lived Commander in Chief , Mackenzie Allen was elevated to the Presidency after her predecessor died on the operating table ; and on Battlestar Galactica — easily the most political show currently airing —
Secretary of Education Laura Roslin vaults to the highest office after robots exterminate 99.99 percent of the human race , which included the government .
Even Aragorn got to skip the primaries and go straight to the coronation .
For most , the idea of slugging it out with the Cylons sounds preferable to running the election gauntlet , especially in an era where the smear , the negative ad , and the politics of personal destruction are the first resorts , not the last .
And , let ’s face it :
Our fictitious heroes would probably be just as disinclined to run as you or I .
Were they real , angry Bob Ewell would probably hold a seat on the city council and humble Atticus Finch would be more concerned with raising his precocious children .
But because it ’s fun to imagine , we asked Morning News readers to create and photograph campaign paraphernalia for fictitious characters .
Amazingly , many of you did .
Here are our favorites .

Boston Globe editorial on RFID and privacy :
It ’s one of the cutest of those cute IBM Corp.
TV commercials , the ones that feature the ever - present help desk .
This time , the desk appears smack in the middle of a highway , blocking the path of a big rig .
” Why are you blocking the road ? ” the driver asks .
” Because you ’re going the wrong way , ” replies the cheerful Help Desk lady .
” Your cargo told me so . ”
It seems the cartons inside the truck contained IBM technology that alerted the company when the driver made a wrong turn .
It ’s clever , all right — and creepy .
Because the technology need n’t be applied only to cases of beer .
The trackers could be attached to every can of beer in the case , and allow marketers to track the boozing habits of the purchasers .
Or if the cargo is clothing , those little trackers could have been stitched inside every last sweater .
Then some high - tech busybody could keep those wearing them under surveillance .
If this sounds paranoid , take it up with IBM .
The company filed a patent application in 2001 which contemplates using this wireless snooping technology to track people as they roam through ” shopping malls , airports , train stations , bus stations , elevators , trains , airplanes , rest rooms , sports arenas , libraries , theaters , museums , etc . ”
An IBM spokeswoman insisted the company is n’t really prepared to go this far .
Patent applications are routinely written to include every possible use of a technology , even some the company does n’t intend to pursue .
Still , it ’s clear somebody at IBM has a pretty creepy imagination .

For an idea to spread , it needs to be sent and received .
No one " sends " an idea unless :
a. they understand it
b. they want it to spread
c. they believe that spreading it will enhance their power ( reputation , income , friendships ) or their peace of mind
d. the effort necessary to send the idea is less than the benefits
No one " gets " an idea unless :
a. the first impression demands further investigation
b. they already understand the foundation ideas necessary to get the new idea
c. they trust or respect the sender enough to invest the time
This explains why online ideas spread so fast but why they ’re often shallow .
Nietzsche is hard to understand and risky to spread , so it moves slowly among people willing to invest the time .
Numa Numa , on the other hand , spread like a toxic waste spill because it was so transparent , reasonably funny and easy to share .
Notice that ideas never spread because they are important to the originator .
Notice too that a key dynamic in the spread of the idea is the capsule that contains it .
If it ’s easy to swallow , tempting and complete , it ’s a lot more likely to get a good start .
But that does n’t mean that there ’s no role for mystery or ideas that unfold over time .
In fact , the unmeasurable variable here is style .
Howard Dean ’s ideas spread at the beginning –not because of the economic ramifications of his immigration policy , but because of the factors above .
The way they were presented fit into the worldview of those that spread them .
A key element in the spread of ideas is their visual element .
iPods and visual styles spread faster in the real world than ephemeral concepts .
Pictures and short jokes spread faster online because the investment necessary to figure out if they ’re worth spreading is so tiny .
And of course , plenty of bad ideas spread .
Panic , for instance , is a superbad idea at all times , but it spreads faster than most .
That ’s because spreading an idea is rarely a thoughtful , voluntary act .
Instead , it is near the core of who we are , and we often do it without thinking much about the implications .

Every so often an idea comes along that has the potential to change the game .

Every so often an idea comes along that has the potential to change the game .
When it does , you find yourself saying – “ Sheesh , of course that was going to happen .
Why did n’t I predict it ? ”
Well , I did n’t predict this happening , but here it is , happening anyway .
In short , Alexa , an Amazon - owned search company started by Bruce Gilliat and Brewster Kahle ( and the spider that fuels the Internet Archive ) , is going to offer its index up to anyone who wants it .
Alexa has about 5 billion documents in its index – about 100 terabytes of data .
It ’s best known for its toolbar - based traffic and site stats , which are much debated and , regardless , much used across the web .
OK , step back , and think about that .
Anyone can use Alexa ’s index , to build anything .
But wait , there ’s more .
Much more .
Anyone can also use Alexa ’s servers and processing power to mine its index to discover things – perhaps , to outsource the crawl needed to create a vertical search engine , for example .
Or maybe to build new kinds of search engines entirely , or … well , whatever creative folks can dream up .
And then , anyone can run that new service on Alexa ’s ( er…Amazon ’s ) platform , should they wish .
It ’s all done via web services .
It ’s all integrated with Amazon ’s fabled web services platform .
And there ’s no licensing fees .
Just “ consumption fees ” which , at my first glance , seem pretty reasonable .
( “ Consumption ” meaning consuming processor cycles , or storage , or bandwidth ) .
The fees ?
One dollar per CPU hour consumed .
$ 1 per gig of storage used .
$ 1 per 50 gigs of data processed .
$ 1 per gig of data uploaded ( if you are putting your new service up on their platform ) .
In other words , Alexa and Amazon are turning the index inside out , and offering it as a web service that anyone can mashup to their hearts content .
Entrepreneurs can use Alexa ’s crawl , Alexa ’s processors , Alexa ’s server farm … .
the whole nine yards .
Does this change the game ?
Because I was embargoed and could not really talk to anyone about this , I have not had a chance to talk to folks who are smarter than me about this .
So my analysis is limited to my imagination .
And that itself is limited by the pricing structure – I do not know if using this service will be cheaper for developers and entrepreneurs than rolling their own .
But I can only imagine that indeed it is , or Amazon would not be doing this .
So what has been a jealously guarded secret – the contents of the entire index – is now available to anyone who wants it ( of course , this assumes Alexa ’s index is comparable to the big guys – honestly , I have no idea ) .
The costs are modest – a few thousand bucks to process the entire web , Gilliat told me .
How might that change the game ?
You guys are smarter than me – what do you think ?
I am quite sure this means that Yahoo and Google will have to stare hard at their own ( somewhat limited ) search services and APIs , and think what they might do to compete , that much is certain .
And if this starts to gain traction , all of a sudden , Amazon is a major search player , right next to Yahoo , Google , MSN , and IAC .
A9 + Alexa+web services= hmmmm ….
Again , what do you think ?
Will this be like A9 , a groundbreaking development that fails to get traction with a wider audience ?
Or might this just start something ?

Want to start a startup ?
Get funded by Y Combinator .
October 2006
( This essay is derived from a talk at MIT . )
Till recently graduating seniors had two choices : get a job or go to grad school .
I think there will increasingly be a third option : to start your own startup .
But how common will that be ?
I 'm sure the default will always be to get a job , but starting a startup could well become as popular as grad school .
In the late 90s my professor friends used to complain that they could n't get grad students , because all the undergrads were going to work for startups .
I would n't be surprised if that situation returns , but with one difference : this time they 'll be starting their own instead of going to work for other people's .
The most ambitious students will at this point be asking :
Why wait till you graduate ?
Why not start a startup while you 're in college ?
In fact , why go to college at all ?
Why not start a startup instead ?
A year and a half ago I gave a talk where I said that the average age of the founders of Yahoo , Google , and Microsoft was 24 , and that if grad students could start startups , why not undergrads ?
I 'm glad I phrased that as a question , because now I can pretend it was n't merely a rhetorical one .
At the time I could n't imagine why there should be any lower limit for the age of startup founders .
Graduation is a bureaucratic change , not a biological one .
And certainly there are undergrads as competent technically as most grad students .
So why should n't undergrads be able to start startups as well as grad students ?
I now realize that something does change at graduation : you lose a huge excuse for failing .
Regardless of how complex your life is , you 'll find that everyone else , including your family and friends , will discard all the low bits and regard you as having a single occupation at any given time .
If you 're in college and have a summer job writing software , you still read as a student .
Whereas if you graduate and get a job programming , you 'll be instantly regarded by everyone as a programmer .
The problem with starting a startup while you 're still in school is that there 's a built - in escape hatch .
If you start a startup in the summer between your junior and senior year , it reads to everyone as a summer job .
So if it goes nowhere , big deal ; you return to school in the fall with all the other seniors ; no one regards you as a failure , because your occupation is student , and you did n't fail at that .
Whereas if you start a startup just one year later , after you graduate , as long as you 're not accepted to grad school in the fall the startup reads to everyone as your occupation .
You 're now a startup founder , so you have to do well at that .
For nearly everyone , the opinion of one 's peers is the most powerful motivator of all — more powerful even than the nominal goal of most startup founders , getting rich . [ 1 ]
About a month into each funding cycle we have an event called Prototype Day where each startup presents to the others what they 've got so far .
You might think they would n't need any more motivation .
They 're working on their cool new idea ; they have funding for the immediate future ; and they 're playing a game with only two outcomes : wealth or failure .
You 'd think that would be motivation enough .
And yet the prospect of a demo pushes most of them into a rush of activity .
Even if you start a startup explicitly to get rich , the money you might get seems pretty theoretical most of the time .
What drives you day to day is not wanting to look bad .
You probably can't change that .
Even if you could , I do n't think you 'd want to ; someone who really , truly does n't care what his peers think of him is probably a psychopath .
So the best you can do is consider this force like a wind , and set up your boat accordingly .
If you know your peers are going to push you in some direction , choose good peers , and position yourself so they push you in a direction you like .
Graduation changes the prevailing winds , and those make a difference .
Starting a startup is so hard that it's a close call even for the ones that succeed .
However high a startup may be flying now , it probably has a few leaves stuck in the landing gear from those trees it barely cleared at the end of the runway .
In such a close game , the smallest increase in the forces against you can be enough to flick you over the edge into failure .
When we first started Y Combinator we encouraged people to start startups while they were still in college .
That 's partly because Y Combinator began as a kind of summer program .
We 've kept the program shape — all of us having dinner together once a week turns out to be a good idea — but we 've decided now that the party line should be to tell people to wait till they graduate .
Does that mean you can't start a startup in college ?
Not at all .
Sam Altman , the co-founder of Loopt , had just finished his sophomore year when we funded them , and Loopt is probably the most promising of all the startups we 've funded so far .
But Sam Altman is a very unusual guy .
Within about three minutes of meeting him , I remember thinking " Ah , so this is what Bill Gates must have been like when he was 19 . "
If it can work to start a startup during college , why do we tell people not to ?
For the same reason that the probably apocryphal violinist , whenever he was asked to judge someone 's playing , would always say they did n't have enough talent to make it as a pro .
Succeeding as a musician takes determination as well as talent , so this answer works out to be the right advice for everyone .
The ones who are uncertain believe it and give up , and the ones who are sufficiently determined think " screw that , I 'll succeed anyway . "
So our official policy now is only to fund undergrads we can't talk out of it .
And frankly , if you 're not certain , you should wait .
It 's not as if all the opportunities to start companies are going to be gone if you do n't do it now .
Maybe the window will close on some idea you 're working on , but that wo n't be the last idea you 'll have .
For every idea that times out , new ones become feasible .
Historically the opportunities to start startups have only increased with time .
In that case , you might ask , why not wait longer ?
Why not go work for a while , or go to grad school , and then start a startup ?
And indeed , that might be a good idea .
If I had to pick the sweet spot for startup founders , based on who we 're most excited to see applications from , I 'd say it 's probably the mid-twenties .
Why ?
What advantages does someone in their mid-twenties have over someone who 's 21 ?
And why is n't it older ?
What can 25 year olds do that 32 year olds can't ?
Those turn out to be questions worth examining .
Plus
If you start a startup soon after college , you 'll be a young founder by present standards , so you should know what the relative advantages of young founders are .
They 're not what you might think .
As a young founder your strengths are : stamina , poverty , rootlessness , colleagues , and ignorance .
The importance of stamina should n't be surprising .
If you 've heard anything about startups you 've probably heard about the long hours .
As far as I can tell these are universal .
I can't think of any successful startups whose founders worked 9 to 5 .
And it 's particularly necessary for younger founders to work long hours because they 're probably not as efficient as they 'll be later .
Your second advantage , poverty , might not sound like an advantage , but it is a huge one .
Poverty implies you can live cheaply , and this is critically important for startups .
Nearly every startup that fails , fails by running out of money .
It 's a little misleading to put it this way , because there 's usually some other underlying cause .
But regardless of the source of your problems , a low burn rate gives you more opportunity to recover from them .
And since most startups make all kinds of mistakes at first , room to recover from mistakes is a valuable thing to have .
Most startups end up doing something different than they planned .
The way the successful ones find something that works is by trying things that do n't .
So the worst thing you can do in a startup is to have a rigid , pre-ordained plan and then start spending a lot of money to implement it .
Better to operate cheaply and give your ideas time to evolve .
Recent grads can live on practically nothing , and this gives you an edge over older founders , because the main cost in software startups is people .
The guys with kids and mortgages are at a real disadvantage .
This is one reason I 'd bet on the 25 year old over the 32 year old .
The 32 year old probably is a better programmer , but probably also has a much more expensive life .
Whereas a 25 year old has some work experience ( more on that later ) but can live as cheaply as an undergrad .
Robert Morris and I were 29 and 30 respectively when we started Viaweb , but fortunately we still lived like 23 year olds .
We both had roughly zero assets .
I would have loved to have a mortgage , since that would have meant I had a house .
But in retrospect having nothing turned out to be convenient .
I was n't tied down and I was used to living cheaply .
Even more important than living cheaply , though , is thinking cheaply .
One reason the Apple II was so popular was that it was cheap .
The computer itself was cheap , and it used cheap , off - the - shelf peripherals like a cassette tape recorder for data storage and a TV as a monitor .
And you know why ?
Because
Woz designed this computer for himself , and he could n't afford anything more .
We benefitted from the same phenomenon .
Our prices were daringly low for the time .
The top level of service was $ 300 a month , which was an order of magnitude below the norm .
In retrospect this was a smart move , but we did n't do it because we were smart .
$ 300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us .
Like Apple , we created something inexpensive , and therefore popular , simply because we were poor .
A lot of startups have that form : someone comes along and makes something for a tenth or a hundredth of what it used to cost , and the existing players can't follow because they do n't even want to think about a world in which that 's possible .
Traditional long distance carriers , for example , did n't even want to think about VoIP .
( It was coming , all the same . )
Being poor helps in this game , because your own personal bias points in the same direction technology evolves in .
The advantages of rootlessness are similar to those of poverty .
When you 're young you 're more mobile — not just because you do n't have a house or much stuff , but also because you 're less likely to have serious relationships .
This turns out to be important , because a lot of startups involve someone moving .
The founders of Kiko , for example , are now en route to the Bay Area to start their next startup .
It 's a better place for what they want to do .
And it was easy for them to decide to go , because neither as far as I know has a serious girlfriend , and everything they own will fit in one car — or more precisely , will either fit in one car or is crappy enough that they do n't mind leaving it behind .
They at least were in Boston .
What if they 'd been in Nebraska , like Evan Williams was at their age ?
Someone wrote recently that the drawback of Y Combinator was that you had to move to participate .
It could n't be any other way .
The kind of conversations we have with founders , we have to have in person .
We fund a dozen startups at a time , and we can't be in a dozen places at once .
But even if we could somehow magically save people from moving , we would n't .
We would n't be doing founders a favor by letting them stay in Nebraska .
Places that are n't startup hubs are toxic to startups .
You can tell that from indirect evidence .
You can tell how hard it must be to start a startup in Houston or Chicago or Miami from the microscopically small number , per capita , that succeed there .
I do n't know exactly what 's suppressing all the startups in these towns — probably a hundred subtle little things — but something must be . [ 2 ]
Maybe this will change .
Maybe the increasing cheapness of startups will mean they 'll be able to survive anywhere , instead of only in the most hospitable environments .
Maybe 37signals is the pattern for the future .
But maybe not .
Historically there have always been certain towns that were centers for certain industries , and if you were n't in one of them you were at a disadvantage .
So my guess is that 37 signals is an anomaly .
We 're looking at a pattern much older than " Web 2.0 " here .
Perhaps the reason more startups per capita happen in the Bay Area than Miami is simply that there are more founder - type people there .
Successful startups are almost never started by one person .
Usually they begin with a conversation in which someone mentions that something would be a good idea for a company , and his friend says , " Yeah , that is a good idea , let 's try it . "
If you 're missing that second person who says " let 's try it , " the startup never happens .
And that is another area where undergrads have an edge .
They 're surrounded by people willing to say that .
At a good college you 're concentrated together with a lot of other ambitious and technically minded people — probably more concentrated than you 'll ever be again .
If your nucleus spits out a neutron , there 's a good chance it will hit another nucleus .
The number one question people ask us at Y Combinator is :
Where can I find a co-founder ?
That 's the biggest problem for someone starting a startup at 30 .
When they were in school they knew a lot of good co-founders , but by 30 they 've either lost touch with them or these people are tied down by jobs they do n't want to leave .
Viaweb was an anomaly in this respect too .
Though we were comparatively old , we were n't tied down by impressive jobs .
I was trying to be an artist , which is not very constraining , and Robert , though 29 , was still in grad school due to a little interruption in his academic career back in 1988 .
So arguably the Worm made Viaweb possible .
Otherwise Robert would have been a junior professor at that age , and he would n't have had time to work on crazy speculative projects with me .
Most of the questions people ask Y Combinator we have some kind of answer for , but not the co-founder question .
There is no good answer .
Co-founders really should be people you already know .
And by far the best place to meet them is school .
You have a large sample of smart people ; you get to compare how they all perform on identical tasks ; and everyone 's life is pretty fluid .
A lot of startups grow out of schools for this reason .
Google , Yahoo , and Microsoft , among others , were all founded by people who met in school .
( In Microsoft 's case , it was high school . )
Many students feel they should wait and get a little more experience before they start a company .
All other things being equal , they should .
But all other things are not quite as equal as they look .
Most students do n't realize how rich they are in the scarcest ingredient in startups , co-founders .
If you wait too long , you may find that your friends are now involved in some project they do n't want to abandon .
The better they are , the more likely this is to happen .
One way to mitigate this problem might be to actively plan your startup while you 're getting those n years of experience .
Sure , go off and get jobs or go to grad school or whatever , but get together regularly to scheme , so the idea of starting a startup stays alive in everyone 's brain .
I do n't know if this works , but it can't hurt to try .
It would be helpful just to realize what an advantage you have as students .
Some of your classmates are probably going to be successful startup founders ; at a great technical university , that is a near certainty .
So which ones ?
If I were you I 'd look for the people who are not just smart , but incurable builders .
Look for the people who keep starting projects , and finish at least some of them .
That 's what we look for .
Above all else , above academic credentials and even the idea you apply with , we look for people who build things .
The other place co-founders meet is at work .
Fewer do than at school , but there are things you can do to improve the odds .
The most important , obviously , is to work somewhere that has a lot of smart , young people .
Another is to work for a company located in a startup hub .
It will be easier to talk a co-worker into quitting with you in a place where startups are happening all around you .
You might also want to look at the employment agreement you sign when you get hired .
Most will say that any ideas you think of while you 're employed by the company belong to them .
In practice it 's hard for anyone to prove what ideas you had when , so the line gets drawn at code .
If you 're going to start a startup , do n't write any of the code while you 're still employed .
Or at least discard any code you wrote while still employed and start over .
It 's not so much that your employer will find out and sue you .
It wo n't come to that ; investors or acquirers or ( if you 're so lucky ) underwriters will nail you first .
Between t = 0 and when you buy that yacht , someone is going to ask if any of your code legally belongs to anyone else , and you need to be able to say no . [ 3 ]
The most overreaching employee agreement I 've seen so far is Amazon's .
In addition to the usual clauses about owning your ideas , you also can't be a founder of a startup that has another founder who worked at Amazon — even if you did n't know them or even work there at the same time .
I suspect they'd have a hard time enforcing this , but it 's a bad sign they even try .
There are plenty of other places to work ; you may as well choose one that keeps more of your options open .
Speaking of cool places to work , there is of course Google .
But I notice something slightly frightening about Google : zero startups come out of there .
In that respect it 's a black hole .
People seem to like working at Google too much to leave .
So if you hope to start a startup one day , the evidence so far suggests you should n't work there .
I realize this seems odd advice .
If they make your life so good that you do n't want to leave , why not work there ?
Because , in effect , you 're probably getting a local maximum .
You need a certain activation energy to start a startup .
So an employer who 's fairly pleasant to work for can lull you into staying indefinitely , even if it would be a net win for you to leave . [ 4 ]
The best place to work , if you want to start a startup , is probably a startup .
In addition to being the right sort of experience , one way or another it will be over quickly .
You 'll either end up rich , in which case problem solved , or the startup will get bought , in which case it it will start to suck to work there and it will be easy to leave , or most likely , the thing will blow up and you 'll be free again .
Your final advantage , ignorance , may not sound very useful .
I deliberately used a controversial word for it ; you might equally call it innocence .
But it seems to be a powerful force .
My Y Combinator co-founder Jessica Livingston is just about to publish a book of interviews with startup founders , and I noticed a remarkable pattern in them .
One after another said that if they 'd known how hard it would be , they would have been too intimidated to start .
Ignorance can be useful when it's a counterweight to other forms of stupidity .
It 's useful in starting startups because you 're capable of more than you realize .
Starting startups is harder than you expect , but you 're also capable of more than you expect , so they balance out .
Most people look at a company like Apple and think , how could I ever make such a thing ?
Apple is an institution , and I 'm just a person .
But every institution was at one point just a handful of people in a room deciding to start something .
Institutions are made up , and made up by people no different from you .
I 'm not saying everyone could start a startup .
I 'm sure most people could n't ; I do n't know much about the population at large .
When you get to groups I know well , like hackers , I can say more precisely .
At the top schools , I 'd guess as many as a quarter of the CS majors could make it as startup founders if they wanted .
That " if they wanted " is an important qualification — so important that it 's almost cheating to append it like that — because once you get over a certain threshold of intelligence , which most CS majors at top schools are past , the deciding factor in whether you succeed as a founder is how much you want to .
You do n't have to be that smart .
If you 're not a genius , just start a startup in some unsexy field where you 'll have less competition , like software for human resources departments .
I picked that example at random , but I feel safe in predicting that whatever they have now , it would n't take genius to do better .
There are a lot of people out there working on boring stuff who are desperately in need of better software , so however short you think you fall of Larry and Sergey , you can ratchet down the coolness of the idea far enough to compensate .
As well as preventing you from being intimidated , ignorance can sometimes help you discover new ideas .
Steve Wozniak put this very strongly :
All the best things that I did at Apple came from ( a ) not having money and ( b ) not having done it before , ever .
Every single thing that we came out with that was really great , I 'd never once done that thing in my life .
When you know nothing , you have to reinvent stuff for yourself , and if you 're smart your reinventions may be better than what preceded them .
This is especially true in fields where the rules change .
All our ideas about software were developed in a time when processors were slow , and memories and disks were tiny .
Who knows what obsolete assumptions are embedded in the conventional wisdom ?
And the way these assumptions are going to get fixed is not by explicitly deallocating them , but by something more akin to garbage collection .
Someone ignorant but smart will come along and reinvent everything , and in the process simply fail to reproduce certain existing ideas .
Minus
So much for the advantages of young founders .
What about the disadvantages ?
I 'm going to start with what goes wrong and try to trace it back to the root causes .
What goes wrong with young founders is that they build stuff that looks like class projects .
It was only recently that we figured this out ourselves .
We noticed a lot of similarities between the startups that seemed to be falling behind , but we could n't figure out how to put it into words .
Then finally we realized what it was : they were building class projects .
But what does that really mean ?
What 's wrong with class projects ?
What 's the difference between a class project and a real startup ?
If we could answer that question it would be useful not just to would - be startup founders but to students in general , because we'd be a long way toward explaining the mystery of the so - called real world .
There seem to be two big things missing in class projects : ( 1 ) an iterative definition of a real problem and ( 2 ) intensity .
The first is probably unavoidable .
Class projects will inevitably solve fake problems .
For one thing , real problems are rare and valuable .
If a professor wanted to have students solve real problems , he'd face the same paradox as someone trying to give an example of whatever " paradigm " might succeed the Standard Model of physics .
There may well be something that does , but if you could think of an example you'd be entitled to the Nobel Prize .
Similarly , good new problems are not to be had for the asking .
In technology the difficulty is compounded by the fact that real startups tend to discover the problem they 're solving by a process of evolution .
Someone has an idea for something ; they build it ; and in doing so ( and probably only by doing so ) they realize the problem they should be solving is another one .
Even if the professor let you change your project description on the fly , there is n't time enough to do that in a college class , or a market to supply evolutionary pressures .
So class projects are mostly about implementation , which is the least of your problems in a startup .
It 's not just that in a startup you work on the idea as well as implementation .
The very implementation is different .
Its main purpose is to refine the idea .
Often the only value of most of the stuff you build in the first six months is that it proves your initial idea was mistaken .
And that 's extremely valuable .
If you 're free of a misconception that everyone else still shares , you 're in a powerful position .
But you 're not thinking that way about a class project .
Proving your initial plan was mistaken would just get you a bad grade .
Instead of building stuff to throw away , you tend to want every line of code to go toward that final goal of showing you did a lot of work .
That leads to our second difference : the way class projects are measured .
Professors will tend to judge you by the distance between the starting point and where you are now .
If someone has achieved a lot , they should get a good grade .
But customers will judge you from the other direction : the distance remaining between where you are now and the features they need .
The market does n't give a shit how hard you worked .
Users just want your software to do what they need , and you get a zero otherwise .
That is one of the most distinctive differences between school and the real world : there is no reward for putting in a good effort .
In fact , the whole concept of a " good effort " is a fake idea adults invented to encourage kids .
It is not found in nature .
Such lies seem to be helpful to kids .
But unfortunately when you graduate they do n't give you a list of all the lies they told you during your education .
You have to get them beaten out of you by contact with the real world .
And this is why so many jobs want work experience .
I could n't understand that when I was in college .
I knew how to program .
In fact , I could tell I knew how to program better than most people doing it for a living .
So what was this mysterious " work experience " and why did I need it ?
Now I know what it is , and part of the confusion is grammatical .
Describing it as " work experience " implies it 's like experience operating a certain kind of machine , or using a certain programming language .
But really what work experience refers to is not some specific expertise , but the elimination of certain habits left over from childhood .
One of the defining qualities of kids is that they flake .
When you 're a kid and you face some hard test , you can cry and say " I can 't " and they wo n't make you do it .
Of course , no one can make you do anything in the grownup world either .
What they do instead is fire you .
And when motivated by that you find you can do a lot more than you realized .
So one of the things employers expect from someone with " work experience " is the elimination of the flake reflex — the ability to get things done , with no excuses .
The other thing you get from work experience is an understanding of what work is , and in particular , how intrinsically horrible it is .
Fundamentally the equation is a brutal one : you have to spend most of your waking hours doing stuff someone else wants , or starve .
There are a few places where the work is so interesting that this is concealed , because what other people want done happens to coincide with what you want to work on .
But you only have to imagine what would happen if they diverged to see the underlying reality .
It 's not so much that adults lie to kids about this as never explain it .
They never explain what the deal is with money .
You know from an early age that you 'll have some sort of job , because everyone asks what you 're going to " be " when you grow up .
What they do n't tell you is that as a kid you 're sitting on the shoulders of someone else who 's treading water , and that starting working means you get thrown into the water on your own , and have to start treading water yourself or sink .
" Being " something is incidental ; the immediate problem is not to drown .
The relationship between work and money tends to dawn on you only gradually .
At least it did for me .
One 's first thought tends to be simply " This sucks .
I 'm in debt .
Plus I have to get up on monday and go to work . "
Gradually you realize that these two things are as tightly connected as only a market can make them .
So the most important advantage 24 year old founders have over 20 year old founders is that they know what they 're trying to avoid .
To the average undergrad the idea of getting rich translates into buying Ferraris , or being admired .
To someone who has learned from experience about the relationship between money and work , it translates to something way more important : it means you get to opt out of the brutal equation that governs the lives of 99.9 % of people .
Getting rich means you can stop treading water .
Someone who gets this will work much harder at making a startup succeed — with the proverbial energy of a drowning man , in fact .
But understanding the relationship between money and work also changes the way you work .
You do n't get money just for working , but for doing things other people want .
Someone who 's figured that out will automatically focus more on the user .
And that cures the other half of the class - project syndrome .
After you 've been working for a while , you yourself tend to measure what you 've done the same way the market does .
Of course , you do n't have to spend years working to learn this stuff .
If you 're sufficiently perceptive you can grasp these things while you 're still in school .
Sam Altman did .
He must have , because Loopt is no class project .
And as his example suggests , this can be valuable knowledge .
At a minimum , if you get this stuff , you already have most of what you gain from the " work experience " employers consider so desirable .
But of course if you really get it , you can use this information in a way that 's more valuable to you than that .
Now
So suppose you think you might start a startup at some point , either when you graduate or a few years after .
What should you do now ?
For both jobs and grad school , there are ways to prepare while you 're in college .
If you want to get a job when you graduate , you should get summer jobs at places you 'd like to work .
If you want to go to grad school , it will help to work on research projects as an undergrad .
What 's the equivalent for startups ?
How do you keep your options maximally open ?
One thing you can do while you 're still in school is to learn how startups work .
Unfortunately that 's not easy .
Few if any colleges have classes about startups .
There may be business school classes on entrepreneurship , as they call it over there , but these are likely to be a waste of time .
Business schools like to talk about startups , but philosophically they 're at the opposite end of the spectrum .
Most books on startups also seem to be useless .
I 've looked at a few and none get it right .
Books in most fields are written by people who know the subject from experience , but for startups there 's a unique problem : by definition the founders of successful startups do n't need to write books to make money .
As a result most books on the subject end up being written by people who do n't understand it .
So I 'd be skeptical of classes and books .
The way to learn about startups is by watching them in action , preferably by working at one .
How do you do that as an undergrad ?
Probably by sneaking in through the back door .
Just hang around a lot and gradually start doing things for them .
Most startups are ( or should be ) very cautious about hiring .
Every hire increases the burn rate , and bad hires early on are hard to recover from .
However , startups usually have a fairly informal atmosphere , and there 's always a lot that needs to be done .
If you just start doing stuff for them , many will be too busy to shoo you away .
You can thus gradually work your way into their confidence , and maybe turn it into an official job later , or not , whichever you prefer .
This wo n't work for all startups , but it would work for most I 've known .
Number two , make the most of the great advantage of school : the wealth of co-founders .
Look at the people around you and ask yourself which you 'd like to work with .
When you apply that test , you may find you get surprising results .
You may find you 'd prefer the quiet guy you 've mostly ignored to someone who seems impressive but has an attitude to match .
I 'm not suggesting you suck up to people you do n't really like because you think one day they 'll be successful .
Exactly the opposite , in fact : you should only start a startup with someone you like , because a startup will put your friendship through a stress test .
I 'm just saying you should think about who you really admire and hang out with them , instead of whoever circumstances throw you together with .
Another thing you can do is learn skills that will be useful to you in a startup .
These may be different from the skills you 'd learn to get a job .
For example , thinking about getting a job will make you want to learn programming languages you think employers want , like Java and C ++.
Whereas if you start a startup , you get to pick the language , so you have to think about which will actually let you get the most done .
If you use that test you might end up learning Ruby or Python instead .
But the most important skill for a startup founder is n't a programming technique .
It 's a knack for understanding users and figuring out how to give them what they want .
I know I repeat this , but that 's because it 's so important .
And it 's a skill you can learn , though perhaps habit might be a better word .
Get into the habit of thinking of software as having users .
What do those users want ?
What would make them say wow ?
This is particularly valuable for undergrads , because the concept of users is missing from most college programming classes .
The way you get taught programming in college would be like teaching writing as grammar , without mentioning that its purpose is to communicate something to an audience .
Fortunately an audience for software is now only an http request away .
So in addition to the programming you do for your classes , why not build some kind of website people will find useful ?
At the very least it will teach you how to write software with users .
In the best case , it might not just be preparation for a startup , but the startup itself , like it was for Yahoo and Google .

[ 1 ] Even the desire to protect one 's children seems weaker , judging from things people have historically done to their kids rather than risk their community 's disapproval .
( I assume we still do things that will be regarded in the future as barbaric , but historical abuses are easier for us to see . )
[ 2 ] Worrying that Y Combinator makes founders move for 3 months also suggests one underestimates how hard it is to start a startup .
You 're going to have to put up with much greater inconveniences than that .
[ 3 ] Most employee agreements say that any idea relating to the company 's present or potential future business belongs to them .
Often as not the second clause could include any possible startup , and anyone doing due diligence for an investor or acquirer will assume the worst .
To be safe either ( a ) do n't use code written while you were still employed in your previous job , or ( b ) get your employer to renounce , in writing , any claim to the code you write for your side project .
Many will consent to ( b ) rather than lose a prized employee .
The downside is that you 'll have to tell them exactly what your project does .

How Ants Find Food
Many species of ants communicate with their nest - mates using chemical scents known as pheromones .
Pheromones can be used in many ways by ants and other animals ( including humans ) , but we are most interested in how ants use pheromones to direct each other through their environment --- this particular task is closely related to the problem of directing the flow of information through a network .
Consider a colony of ants that is searching for food .
Casual observation of an ant colony will reveal that ants often walk in a straight line between their anthill and the food source .
The concept of an " army " of ants marching in file has permeated popular culture , and most people who live in ant - friendly locations ( nearly every human - friendly place in the world ) have seen this particular behavior first - hand .
Marching in a straight line , which is usually the shortest route , seems like an obvious solution to the problem of efficient food transportation , and we might pass it off as uninteresting .
Photo by Harold Thimbleby --- used without permission
Of course , we humans would do the same thing , and in fact we do march in lines along direct routes when we travel in groups as caravans .
When we look down at a line of ants from above , we might simply think " so what ? "
But we have huge brains compared to ants , along with extraordinarily complicated visual systems ( over 25 % of the human brain is devoted to vision ) , and we also have a more elevated view of the terrain .
Even with these advantages , efficient route - finding , especially through an environment that is full of obstacles , is not an easy task for us .
Given ants ' comparatively simpler brains , we cannot pass their collectively intelligent route - finding off as trivial .
So how do they do it ?
Suppose that an ant colony starts out with no information about the location food in the environment .
The human strategy in this case would be to send out a " search party " to comb the surrounding area --- the scouts who find food can bring some back to the home - base and inform the others about where the food is .
Ants do search for food by walking randomly , which is similar to the human " combing " approach , but two issues prevent ants from implementing a human - style search party directly .
First , how can an ant - scout , upon discovering food , find its way back to the nest ?
Second , even if a scout makes it back to the nest , how can it inform the other ants about the food 's location ?
The answers lie in a clever use of pheromones .
To solve the " finding home " problem , each ant leaves a trail of pheromone as it looks for food .
In the following example pictures , the pheromone trail left by each wandering ant is shown in transparent red .
When an ant finds food , it can follow its own pheromone trail back to the nest --- this is similar to leaving a trail of bread crumbs through the woods to find your way back home .
On the way back to the nest , the ant solves the " telling others " problem by laying down more pheromone , creating a trail with an even stronger scent .
In the following picture , ant A reaches the food first and then follows its own trail back to the nest , while the other three ants keep wandering .
When other ants run into a trail of pheromone , they give up their own search and start following the trail .
In the following picture , ant D discovers the double - strength trail left by ant A and starts to follow it .
Ant C encounters the single - strength trail left by D and follows that trail , which will eventually lead to A 's trail as well .
Ant B eventually discovers its own route to the food source that is completely disconnected from the routed used by A .
If a pheromone trail leads an ant back to the nest with empty jaws , it turns around and follows the trail in the opposite direction .
Once an ant reaches the food , it grabs a piece and turns around , following the same trail back to the nest .
On the way back , an ant reinforces the trail by laying down more pheromone .
In the following picture , ant C joins A's trail but follows it it the wrong direction , reaching the nest empty - jawed .
Ant B follows its own trail back to the nest --- it never comes in contact with the more direct trail that the other ants are using .
A and D carry food back to the nest along the established route .
Once they reach the food , they grab a piece and turn around , following the same trail back to the nest .
On the way back , they reinforce the trail by laying down more pheromone .
We have explained how ants find food in the first place , but how do they find the shortest route to the food ?
One more detail helps to answer this question : ants prefer to follow the trails with the strongest pheromone scent .
Shorter routes between the nest and the food are completed faster by each ant that takes them .
For example , if ant X is traveling along a 10 - meter path to the food repeatedly , and ant Y is traveling along a different 20 - meter path repeatedly , ant X will make twice as many trips in an hour as ant Y .
Thus , ant X will lay twice as much pheromone on its trail as ant Y .
Given the choice , ants will prefer the strongly - scented 10 - meter path over the more weakly - scented 20 - meter path .
The following picture demonstrates this point .
When B deposits food at the nest and sets out for another trip , it discovers the strongly - scented path used by the other ants and abandons its own path .
At this point , all four ants are using the path discovered by ant A to carry food between the source and the nest .
Over time , many paths between the nest and the food are explored , but the scent on shortest path is reinforced more than the other paths , so it quickly becomes the most popular path , and soon all of the ants walk in file along it .
Simple Rules
The ant approach to route - finding is quite different from the way humans navigate their environment .
We would visually study the environment as a whole and try to " plan " the best route ahead of time .
Of course , the ant method has advantages over our " high level " approach .
For example , the ant method works fine in complete darkness .
When it comes to navigating without visual cues , humans are comparatively helpless .
The ant method can be distilled into simple rules followed by each member of the colony :
Condition : Action :
Not carrying food
not on pheromone trail walk randomly
lay pheromone
Not carrying food
on pheromone trail follow pheromone trail
lay more pheromone Reach home without food
on pheromone trail turn around
follow trail in opposite direction Reach food pick up food
turn around
follow trail in opposite direction Carrying food follow trail
lay more pheromone Reach home with food deposit food
turn around
follow trail in opposite direction More About Ants
As we go on to describe MUTE 's ant - inspired message routing scheme , we will leave real - world ant behavior behind us .
However , there is a wealth of information about natural ants and their behavior online , including : Optimal Behavior of Ants
Pheromone Biology
http://www.antnest.co.uk
http://www.antcam.com
Simplifying Nature
Though the table of " Simple Rules " above is relatively easy to understand , it still contains seven rules , which is not as simple as we might like .
Also , there is a bit of sub - optimal behavior lurking : an empty - jawed ant may follow a pheromone trail in the wrong direction , all the way back to the nest .
Of course , when an empty - jawed ant reaches the nest , it turns around and eventually makes its way back to the food , but this is still a wasted trip .
The problem seems to be the lack of directionality in the trail , and it is certainly difficult to represent direction when all you have to work with are spots of chemical scents .
In the world of networking programs , we are not limited to directionless trail markers .
By adding direction to the trail markers , we actually get a much simpler set of rules
Suppose that we augment the ants with two types of pheromone instead of just one , and suppose that we give these pheromones directionality .
The first pheromone can be thought of as a " this way home " marker , and we will call it a home - finding pheromone .
The second pheromone will be the food - finding pheromone , and it points in the direction of the food source .
When ants leave the nest in search of food , they walk randomly , leaving trails of home - finding pheromone as they go .
When an ant finds food , it picks up a piece and follows its home - finding trail back to the nest , leaving a trail of food - finding pheromone as it goes .
If a wandering ant ever encounters a food - finding trail , it follows that trail to the food source , leaving more home - finding pheromone as it goes .
This simple modification reduces the complexity of our rule set :
Condition : Walk : Mark Ground With : Not carrying food on food - direction trail , or randomly otherwise home - direction pheromone Carrying food on home - direction trail food - direction pheromone Painting Arrows in the Forest
This mechanism is similar to the way humans might navigate a forest by painting colored arrow markers on tree trunks .
For example , blue arrows might mean " this way to the lake , " and yellow arrows might mean " this way to the lodge . "
If you walk away from the lodge in search of the lake , you can paint backward yellow arrows as you go along .
On your way back from the lake , you can follow your yellow arrows home while painting backward blue arrows .
The key point here is that you always know how to get to where you are coming from , though you may not know how to get where you are going .
If you get to a tree trunk that has already been painted , you simply add your own arrow , even if it contradicts an existing arrow .
After many people have traveled between the lodge and the lake using this method , there will be many arrows painted throughout the forest --- many trees will bear multiple , contradictory arrows .
When trying to find your way back to the lodge , how do you interpret a tree trunk that bears ten yellow arrows ?
There are many possible strategies , but the simplest might be to just obey the majority of the arrows , since they probably point down the more direct paths ( recall that direct paths are faster , so they receive more traffic ) .
( This navigation technique was presented only as an example and not as a suggestion .
Please do not paint arrows in the forest . )
How MUTE Routes Messages
In a network , we do not have ants looking for food or hikers trying to find their way between the lodge and the lake .
Instead , we have messages that need to travel from a sender to a recipient .
Since MUTE users are anonymous , none of the nodes in the network know exactly where to find a particular recipient ( or , more precisely , which computer a particular recipient is using ) .
Like ants that are unaware of the overall environment layout , MUTE messages must be directed through the network using only local clues .
Each MUTE node maintains connections to several " neighbors " in the network , and these neighboring connections are used for message passing .
Suppose that MUTE node X receives a message from Alice to Bob through node Y , one of its neighbors .
X may have no information clues about where Bob is in the network .
However , upon receiving this message , node X learns something about Alice : it learns that messages from Alice come through node Y .
In the future , if node X ever receives a message to Alice , it can send it back through node Y using this clue .
Regardless of what X learns about Alice , it still has no information about Bob .
The best strategy here , using ants as inspiration , is to " send ants in all directions " , or to send a copy of the message on to each one of X's neighbors ( what we will call " broadcasting " the message ) .
One of the neighbors may have more information about which direction Bob is in .
If none of the nodes in the network have clues about Bob 's location , they will all broadcast the message to their neighbors .
If Bob exists in the network , this technique will eventually find him .
Notice that throughout the search for Bob , the message has been leaving a trail of clues about Alice .
If the message reaches Bob , and then Bob sends back a response , the response can follow these clues on a rather direct path back to Alice .
As the response is routed to Alice , it leaves a trail of clues that can be used to route future messages from Alice back to Bob .
Other nodes can make use of these clues too .
For example , if the owner of node X sends a message to Bob , the message will travel on a rather direct route using the existing clues .
Looking at these example diagrams , we can see that MUTE 's routing mechanism is quite similar to the technique of " Painting Arrows in the Forest " presented earlier .
Each node can be thought of as a tree , and each neighbor connection can be thought of as a path between neighboring trees .
Each node maintains a collection of arrows , and each arrow says something like " To get to Bob , use this path . "
In these diagrams , we follow the blue arrows backward to find Bob .
We can also think of each message leaving a " scent " as it travels through the network .
Messages from Alice leave Alice 's scent , and we can follow this scent when sending messages to Alice .
The darker arrows in these diagrams represent messages , while the faded arrows can be thought of as the scent left by messages .
For more information about how MUTE implements ant - inspired routing , see the MUTE Technical Details page .
Routing Clues and Privacy
In terms of anonymity , the notion of " clues about Alice " sounds scary .
Keep in mind that all of these " clues " are just local hints that will not enable anyone to directly pinpoint Alice in the network .
A node 's routing clue essentially tells it , " my neighbor knows more about Alice than I do . "
Of course , none of the nodes have a good measure of how much they know about Alice , so the fact that a particular neighbor knows more gives a node little extra information .
For example , none of the nodes along a path between Alice and Bob know enough to conclude that " my neighbor is Alice . "
The quality of the forecast provides information about the probability of the respective weather forecast arriving .
In general , our weather forecasts distinguish between the three categories of short - , medium - and long - term weather forecasts .
Forecast quality of short - term forecasts - weather forecast
Short - term forecasts or weather forecasts can be found here in the respective weather month .
The short - term forecasts are more detailed in the weather patterns such as wind , rainfall and center of gravity , temperature , sun or cover .
These weather forecasts range from 1 to 7 days , with the forecasting quality being very high for day 1 and lower for day 7 .
Things are different with stable weather conditions - here , too , a high forecasting quality can be given for day 1 , which , for example , does not drop as much until day 7 as it does in uncertain weather conditions .
Short - term forecasts are marked with the term weather forecast .
The following table explains by way of example how the progress of the forecasting quality can look .
Forecast quality of medium - term forecasts - weather forecasts
Medium - term weather forecasts are issued whenever a likely weather event is imminent but not yet certain - thus giving a rough trend beyond the 7th day which direction the weather is more likely to take .
In the medium - term weather forecast , the detailed forecasts are rather rough and mainly refer to which weather phenomena can occur .
The rough approach increases the forecasting quality compared to the detailed short - term forecast .
These medium - term forecasts are marked with weather forecasts .
The following table explains by way of example how the progress of the forecasting quality can look .
Forecasting quality of long - term forecasts - weather trend
Long - term weather trends are usually found in the season forecasts , or each month receives at the beginning of the long - term weather trend , which is updated at certain intervals .
Long - term forecasts or weather trends are controversial in meteorology , as the probability of arrival is often called into question .
Long - term forecasts are extremely crude and include only basic weather trends .
This rough grid again increases the forecasting quality compared to the medium and short - term forecasts .
These long - term weather forecasts are marked with weather trend .
The following table explains by way of example how the progress of the forecasting quality can look .
Weather trend
In addition , there are weather trends that can extend over a much longer period .
The weather trends deal exclusively with the temperature trend ( too warm / too cold ) and the possible precipitation behavior ( too wet / too dry ) .
The weather trend is part of our weather trends in the form of long - term forecasts of the respective weather models ( experimental basis ! ) .

As a wise accountant once told me ( i.e. my CPA mother ) , all financial decisions should be first weighed against one thing : The Pillow Test .
What do bedding and money have in common you might be wondering at this point .
I had the same question , when I first heard it , but after many years of managing my own personal finances , I have come to fully understand and appreciate its simplicity .
The Pillow Test is a simple measure of a person ’s capacity for handling risk .
Plainly put , if a new financial transaction is going to cause a person to lose sleep , the investment or venture is most likely not worth the time , regardless of its potential .
This measure of one ’s tolerance for risk is not only a litmus test for going into new transactions ; it can also serve as a wake up call for getting out of transactions .
In other words , if money woes are creating sleepless nights , it might be time to consider unwinding some financial risk , because the best test is how well you rest .

BAGHDAD – Death squads from the Ministry of Interior posing as Iraqi police are killing more people than ever in the capital , emerging evidence shows .
The death toll is high  in all 1,536 bodies were brought to the Baghdad morgue in September .
The Health Ministry announced last month that it will build two new morgues in Baghdad to take their capacity to 250 bodies a day .
Many fear a government hand in more killings to come .
The U.S. military has revealed that the 8th Iraqi Police Unit was responsible for the Oct. 1 kidnapping of 26 Sunni food factory workers in the Amil quarter in southwest Baghdad .
The bodies of 10 of them were later found in Abu Chir neighborhood in the capital .
Interior Minister Jawad al - Bolani announced he is suspending the police unit from official duties and confining it to base until an investigation is completed .
But sections of the ministry appear responsible for the abductions and killing .
Ministry of Interior vehicles were used for the kidnapping in this case , and most men conducting the raid wore Iraqi police uniforms , except for a few who wore black death squad “ uniforms , ” witnesses told IPS .
The leader of the police unit is under house arrest and faces interrogation for this and other crimes , according to an official announcement .
“ It is for sure that they did it , ” one of the victim ’s neighbors told IPS on condition of anonymity .
“ The tortured bodies were found the second day .
They came in their official police cars ; it is not the first time that they did something like this .
They do it all over Baghdad , and we hope they will get proper punishment this time . ”
Men of the police unit , meanwhile , do not face imminent punishment .
“ They are going to be rehabilitated and brought back to service , ” director - general of the Iraqi police Adnan Thabit told IPS .
The Iraqi Islamic Party , the largest Sunni party , blamed militias with ties to the government and the U.S. military .
“ The Iraqi Islamic Party asks how could 26 people , women among them , have been transported from Amil to Abu Chir through all those Iraqi and U.S. Army checkpoints and patrols , ” it said in a statement .
The U.S. military has denied any involvement in the killings .
Gen .
Yassin al - Dulaimi , deputy minister for the interior , has said on Iraqi television several times that death squads are composed mainly of Iraqi police and army units .
His comments reflect differing allegiance and agendas even within the Shia bloc .
Dulaimi has been trying for long to expose the organized criminal gangs that have been controlling the ministry since its formation  a formation that was overseen by U.S. authorities .
Dulaimi says he does not believe that the Shia Badr organization , a large , well - armed and - funded militia , has complete control over his ministry .
But most residents of Baghdad believe that Badr has complete control over the Baghdad Order Maintenance police force , and use this force to carry out sectarian murders .
This force is one of several official security teams in Baghdad .
The force is led by Mehdi al - Gharrawi , who also led similar security units during the U.S. - led attack on Fallujah in November 2004 .
“ All criminals who survived the Fallujah crisis after committing genocide and other war crimes were granted higher ranks , ” Maj . Amir Jassim from the Ministry of Defense told IPS .
“ I and many of my colleagues were not rewarded because we disobeyed orders to set fire to people ’s houses [ in Fallujah ] after others looted them . ”
Jassim said the looting and burning of homes in Fallujah during the November siege was ordered from the Ministries of Interior and Defense .
“ Now they want to do the same things they did in Fallujah in all Sunni areas so that they ignite a civil war in Iraq , ” said Jassim , referring to the Shia - dominated ministries .
“ A civil war is the only guarantee for them to stay in power , looting such incredible amounts of money . ”
Another official with the Ministry of Defense , Muntather al - Samarraii , told IPS that both Iran and “ collaborators ” within the Ministry of Interior are to blame for the widespread sectarian killings .
“ I have lists of thousands of corruption cases from within my ministry , and other files to expose to the world , ” he said , “ but the world is not listening .
When it does , I am afraid it is going to be too late . ”
A police officer in Samarraii ’s office , speaking on condition of anonymity , told IPS that he believed that murderers would not be punished for their crimes .
“ They will reward them , believe me , and give them higher ranks , ” he said .
“ This is a country that will never stand back on its feet as long as these killers are in power .
And the Americans are supporting them by allowing their convoys to move during curfew hours . ”
While there is little evidence of direct U.S. involvement , questions have arisen over what the U.S. forces have done  or not done  to encourage such killings .
A UN human rights report released September last year held Interior Ministry forces responsible for an organized campaign of detentions , torture , and killings .
It reported that special police commando units accused of carrying out the killings were recruited from Shia Badr and Mahdi militias and trained by U.S. forces .
Retired Col. James Steele , who served as adviser on Iraqi security forces to then - U.S. ambassador John Negroponte , supervised the training of these forces .
Steele was commander of the U.S. military advisory group in El Salvador 1984 - 86 , while Negroponte was U.S. ambassador to nearby Honduras 1981 - 85 .
Negroponte was accused of widespread human rights violations by the Honduras Commission on Human Rights in 1994 .
The Commission reported the torture and disappearance of at least 184 political workers .
The violations Negroponte oversaw in Honduras were carried out by operatives trained by the CIA , according to a CIA working group set up in 1996 to look into the U.S. role in Honduras .
The CIA records document that his “ special intelligence units , ” better known as “ death squads , ” comprised CIA - trained Honduran armed units that kidnapped , tortured , and killed thousands of people suspected of supporting leftist guerrillas .

A note from the editors :
This article , a fascinating glimpse into the strange desires of mid-2000s web designers , is now obsolete .
A few weeks ago , while walking through the beautiful Sussex countryside , I decided I wanted to find a way to automate text - wrapping around images with irregular outlines .
Article Continues Below
Seriously , I need to get out more .
This article is the result of that ramble through the hills .
The concept#section2
The concept is simple .
We want to create a series of “ sandbag ” div s that we ’ll lay over our image ; it will be these sandbags and not the actual image that the text will flow around .
But we do n’t really want to do that ourselves : we want to get PHP to do it for us .
Step 1 : Working out the size of the sandbags #section3
We ’ll begin by creating an array with the sizes and positions of our “ perfect ” sandbags .
Our “ perfect ” sandbags would be only 1 px high to allow for the smoothest text flow ; working these out manually would be absurd , so let ’s find a technique that works !
Our sample image , which we want to right - align , currently looks like this :
Our sample image , with left - aligned text .
Looking at our image , I know how I ’d size up the sandbags by eye , and that ’s exactly what we ’re going to do with PHP .
We scan along from left to right , if we hit a transparent pixel we think “ ooh , let ’s go a bit further ; ” if we hit a solid pixel we say “ righto , that ’s where that sandbag needs to be . ”
Then we ’ll go down to the next row of pixels and repeat this process until we hit the bottom of the image .
To put it a tad more technically , we want a loop that scrolls through the Y axis , starting at 0 and finishing at the height of the image .
For each row , we ’ll scroll through the X axis , starting at 0 and ending at the width of the image .
Each time we hit a transparent pixel , we ’re going to add 1 to the array for that row .
When we hit a non-transparent pixel , we ’re going to break out of our X loop and go to the next row of pixels .
To put it even more technically , that translates to the following code ( line wraps marked » — Ed. ) :
<? php$image = imagecreatefrompng ( ' an_image.png ' ) ; $ width = imagesx ( $ image ) ; $ height = imagesy ( $ image ) ; for ( $ y=0 ; $y < $ height ; $ y++ ) { $ imagemap [ $y ] = 0 ; for ( $ x=0 ; $x < $ width ; $ x++ ) { $ c = imagecolorsforindex ( $ image , » imagecolorat ( $ image , $ x , $y ) ) ; if ( $ c [ ' alpha ' ] < 127 ) { break ; } else { $ imagemap [$y ] ++ ; } } } ?>
Phew — surely that ’s one of the hardest bits out of the way .
The imagecolorsforindex function here is great is n’t it ?
It returns an array of the red , green , blue , and alpha components .
If the alpha component of any given pixel is less than 127 , then the pixel is n’t fully transparent .
Positioning our bags#section4
The CSS we ’re using is pretty minimal .
However it turns out that Internet Explorer does n’t like having a div only 1 px high , so we need a little bit of trickery .
To keep IE happy with our 1 px high sandbags we use the following CSS :
. sandbag - right { border : 0 ; padding : 0 ; font - size : 0 ; margin : 0 0 - 1px 0 ; height : 2 px ; float : right ; clear : right ; background : red ; }
By setting the font - size to zero , we can achieve 2 px - high div s .
If we then throw in a negative bottom margin of 1px before IE really notices what ’s going on , we can make them appear to be 1 px high .
Bingo .
( The red background is just so we can see the sandbags at this stage ; we ’ll be removing this later . )
Laying down the sandbags #section5
We ’ve now got everything in place , so let ’s create those sandbags .
This requires a simple foreach loop through our $ imagemap array .
To get the width of our sandbag , we need to remember it ’s not the value we ’ve already calculated that we want , as that ’s actually the size of the empty space next to the sandbag .
The actual width of our sandbag is the width of the image minus the value in our array .
We ’re going to use the printf function to echo our sandbags into a template .
This will make things neater in the long run .
( line wraps marked » — Ed. )
<?php$sandbagTemplate = '
' ; foreach ( $ imagemap as $ position => $ blankPixels ) { $ sandbagWidth = $ width -$ blankPixels ; printf ( $ sandbagTemplate , $sandbagWidth ) ; }?>
Step 1 : The text - wrap so far .
You can check out the code for step one .
Step 2 : Too much of a good thing … #section6
Now we have an array that lets us generate a perfect series of sandbags .
After a bit of testing , we see , somewhat annoyingly , that Opera seems to be the only browser in which these “ perfect ” sandbags work as expected .
In most other browsers , we find that our text disobediently overlaps our sandbags .
I tried playing around with various margin sizes , but this just did n’t cut the mustard .
Finally , I reluctantly concluded that we needed less - perfect sandbags .
Bigger than 1 px .
But how big ?
Well , let ’s leave that up to the user .
I found that 10 px to 50 px seemed to work quite well , but it may well vary , so we ’ll leave it flexible in the function .
Although we ’ve found out how to trick IE into allowing us to have those 1 px - high sandbags , there ’s not really much point if they do n’t work , and our function becomes much neater if we enforce a 2 px - high minimum .
It was upsetting to lose this neat trick , but I took a deep breath and disallowed 1 px - high sandbags from the function .
( Do n’t be sad , this knowledge will come in handy later on . )
Less than perfect #section7
Now we want to loop through that “ perfect ” array we generated earlier .
If we have a sandbag height of 10 px , we would want to look at the array in clusters of 10 , taking the largest sandbag from each cluster and then outputting that value into a new array .
Of course , rather than using a constant number , we ’ll just use our variable $ sandbagHeight .
The largest sandbag from each section is actually the one with the smallest value in the array ( as the array represents the transparent dead space and not the actual sandbag ) , so we ’ll use the handy PHP function min to return the lowest value from the array .
The resulting loop looks like this :
for ( $ i=0 ; $i < count ( $imagemap ) ; $ i = $ i+$sandbagHeight ) { for ( $ x=0 ; $x < $ sandbagHeight ; $ x++ ) { $ b = $x + $ i ; if ( isset ( $ imagemap [ $ b ] ) ) { $ section [ $b ] = $ imagemap [ $b ] ; } } $ sandbag [ ] = min( $ section ) ; unset ( $ section ) ; }
We also need to set the height of each sandbag .
We ’ll do that by adding it to our sandbag template ( line wraps marked » — Ed. ) :
$ sandbagTemplate = '
';
We ’re going to want the possibility of adding some extra padding above the first sandbags and below the last sandbag , and we can easily isolate the first and last item of the array and append an additional style to these as required .
If we now use our $ sandbag array instead of our $ imagemap array to generate the sandbags we get the following :
Step 2 : Sandbags sans our sample image .
You can see how the code is looking in step two .
Step 3 : Placing the image behind the sandbag#section8
We ’re on the homestretch now .
We ’ve got the sandbags .
All we need to do now is stick the image behind them .
What could be simpler ?
All we do is … ur … no , wait … we just …
… oh .
Oh dear .
This was meant to be the easy bit , and looking at it now it turns out it ’s quite a big hill .
I ’d always just imagined I ’d either a ) be able to just give the surrounding div a background image or b ) actually use an img .
The problem is , the second we give the surrounding div a specific size in order to give it a background image , the text starts to wrap around the div .
It overpowers our sandbags .
The same goes for putting an img in there .
I tried playing around with z - index layers , but every time I thought it was going to work , it fell apart in one browser or another .
For the longest time , this had me utterly stumped .
We ’ve got our sandbags and they work … it ’s just we ca n’t seem to put anything else in front of our sandbags without destroying their functionality …
Using what we ’ve got#section9
… so let ’s not put anything else in front of the sandbags .
This is where some radical thinking comes in .
Let ’s use the actual sandbags themselves .
Why not just give each sandbag the same background image and position that background image relative to each sandbag ’s position .
Does it work ?
Oh yes it does .
Step 3 : Sandbags with the sample image in place .
Here ’s the code for step three .
Step 4 : Adding a pseudo alt attribute # section10
We ’ve now got a working function , but we have to accept that we ’ve lost a little bit of accessibility in doing this .
Fear not , we can add pseudo alt and title attributes to the image .
We ’ll set these from the function , and put this new variable in an outer div as a title .
We ’ll also throw it in there as a hidden span before the first sandbag .
That way if we turn off the stylesheet we get our alt text , and if we hover over anywhere on the image we get our title attribute .
We ’re also going to add a no-repeat to the background , which means we never get the top of the image repeating again in the final sandbag .
Our stylesheet now looks like this :
.sandbagImage span { display : none ; }.sandbagRight { border : 0 ; padding : 0 ; font - size : 0 ; margin : 0 0 0 25 px ; float : right ; clear : right ; background : no -repeat ; }</style >
When we create the outer div we ’re going to use the following code give us the option of including an alt attribute :
if ( $alt != '' ) { echo '
‘ ; } ‘ . $ alt . ” ; } else { echo ‘
( You do n’t need to see the code for this , as it ’s a minor tweak . )
Step 5 : Keeping Safari happy #section11
There ’s a fight brewing here between two browser “ constraints ” that face us here .
In Safari , that “ no - repeat ” we added does n’t work where there is negative background positioning , and so if the final sandbag is too big , we get the top of the image repeating in the final sandbag .
That ’s not good .
So what we can do is calculate the size of each sandbag as we add it to the array .
The final time the variable is set will be the size of the final sandbag .
We do that by adding a simple “ count ” to our second loop :
for ( $ i=0 ; $i < count ( $ imagemap ) ; $ i = $ i+$sandbagHeight ) { for ( $ x=0 ; $x < $ sandbagHeight ; $ x++ ) { $ b = $x + $ i ; if ( isset ( $ imagemap [ $ b ] ) ) { $ section [ $b ] = $ imagemap [ $b ] ; } } $ sandbag [ ] = min( $ section ) ; $ finalSectionSize = count ( $ section ) - 1 ; unset ( $ section ) ; }
Step 4 : Safari - friendly sandbags .
Take a look at the code for step four .
Keeping IE happy # section12
But we still can’t drop that no -repeat .
Why not ?
Well …
Let ’s suppose we have an image that is 121 px high , split into 10 px - high sandbags .
Our final sandbag is going to be 1 px high .
But as we know , in Internet Explorer we can’t have 1 px high div s without some CSS hacking .
If we give the final sandbag a negative bottom margin , we ’re then going to have to go through a palaver of adding an extra “ fake ” sandbag to re-establish our bottom margin if required .
We do n’t want to do this .
That no -repeat still needs to be there because in this situation it could result in the top row of pixels in the image being repeated at the bottom .
Aaaand the code for step five .
Step 6 : Allowing for left - alignment #section13
The function as I ’ve explained it only allows for right aligning .
To left - align , we have to keep a few simple things in mind :
The CSS for our sandbags should float and clear left , not right .
When looping through our initial array we work from right to left , so we start at the width of the image and end at 0 , subtracting from x each time instead of adding to it .
The x axis of the background position is always 0 px .
I wo n’t walk through these steps , but …
Our final function # section14
… we can combine everything together into one final glorious function including the option for left - alignment , our last few bits of cross - browser fixing , and some error checking .
The final function is simple to call ( line wraps marked » — Ed. ) :
<?php alignedImage ( ' an_image.png ' , ' right ' , » ' A right aligned blob ',30 ) ; ?>
You can see the code for the final function : step six .
Yay !
Concept programming is about finding good representations of concepts .
One important consequence for tools is that you need extensible programming languages , because there is no fixed set of concepts .
Discussions about the design of XL highlight this extensibility a lot , because this is what distinguishes XL from languages such as C++ or Ada .
Several Lisp programmers pointed out that Lisp was already an extensible language , and concluded that I was merely reinventing the wheel .
More precisely , I got the following comments , which I think deserve some better answer than the previous one I wrote :
Anyone writing a language today who is n't familiar with Scheme , Haskell , and ML may as well throw in the towel right now .
LISP runs as fast as C++ , and has extensive support of programmed transformation of code .
Those that do not use LISP are condemned to reinvent it .
Badly .
I would advise any person who wants to develop their own language to take a good look at LISP first .
You may not need a new language , but even if you do -- you will have a bunch of great ideas to start with .
You can bend Lisp to be what you want it to be , which is largely why we Lispers well love it .
I suggest you catch up a bit on what Common Lisp can actually do , rather that spouting stuff that sounds like it's based on a CS101 class taught in Scheme that did n't even cover macros .
You know what 's better than Lisp ?
A better Lisp .
Be sure to explain exactly what you mean when you say that XL is " more extensible than Lisp " .
Hey , why reinvent the wheel ?
A dog might not be able to walk past a tree without pissing on it , but I would hope that a software developer could do better than that ...
Reinventing the wheel is not a bad thing
To a large extent , designing a programming language and methodology today , like most of engineering , involves a lot of wheel reinvention .
This is not a bad thing .
Most people would be vastly unhappy if the designers of the Boeing 747 had said : " Let 's not reinvent the wheel , we 'll use the same old trusted design Romans used for their charriots " .
A similar line of reasoning is " Lisp ( or some other language ) can do it , so why bother ? "
Well , assembly language can do everything .
The reason we invent higher language designs is because we can't write large programs in assembly without making mistakes , or within a reasonable amount of time .
The limit is not the language , it is the programmer .
That is what concept programming focuses on .
Concept programming in Lisp
Concept programming is not restricted to a particular language .
The first demonstration of a concept - programming tool was Moka , which is Java - based .
Similarly , you can do concept programming in Lisp .
Furthermore , Lisp already has all the attributes it takes to build concept representations at various levels of abstraction .
Of all existing programming languages , Lisp might be one of the closest to the ideal .
In particular , Lisp programmers are used to not mixing levels of abstraction ( like having pointers in the middle of a high - level algorithm ) , and are used to using multiple methods to extend the language ( like modifying the parser , adding macros , doing program rewriting , etc ) .
All of this is good for concept programming .
For instance , integrating new concepts such as objects in Lisp ( CLOS ) was much easier than in C ( C++ or Objective - C ) .
To me , Lisp is an important validation of the idea that language extensibility is a key to long - term survival .
If past history is any indication , 20 years down the road , people are likely consider Java a language of the past , and to have replaced it with fancier languages .
But they will probably still use something they call Lisp .
However , that Lisp might be as remote from today 's Lisp as Common Lisp is from a 1970 's implementation .
The point here is that Lisp is a language that evolves , whereas most other languages die a slow death .
Yet Lisp is far from perfect .
At its most fundamental level , it is full of tiny concept casts .
For instance , the names " car " and " cdr " ( and I realize there are more modern names for the first element or tail of a list ) are taken from the name of registers on some long forgotten computer model .
Fundamentally , an addition in Lisp is represented as (+ 1 2 ) ; this is the output of the infix parsers .
Similarly , Prolog extensions to Lisp such as Schelog or Poplog require the use of a Lispish syntax which only a mother or Lisp user could love :-)
A different approach to reflexion
For Lisp programmers , the main differences between XL and Lisp will not be extensibility .
It will be day to day syntax and concepts .
On the extensibility front , XL implements reflection very differently than Lisp .
Lisp has a very simple yet effective reflective model :
Programs are represented by a single data type , lists .
There is a direct , 1 - to - 1 relationship between internal program representation and standard program syntax : (+ 1 2 ) is the syntax for a program segment adding integers 1 and 2 , as well as the syntax for a list representing that program .
is the syntax for a program segment adding integers 1 and 2 , as well as the syntax for a list representing that program .
Lists are directly executable , without a programmer - visible translation step .
Meta - programming is achieved by generating lists and then executing them immediately , so meta - programs are generally embedded in the program itself .
XL has a more convoluted , but more powerful and user - friendly meta- programming scheme :
Programs are represented by an object - oriented parse - tree ..
The user - visible syntax hides the structure of the parse tree , and looks much like most Algol - derived languages .
Meta -programming occurs as part of an explicit translation process .
Meta -programs are distinct from the programs they manipulate , and behave as reusable language extensions .
The XL model is slightly more complicated conceptually , but has a few benefits :

2 ) The administration ’s tax cuts favor the rich , no matter how you look at it .
About 87 percent of tax benefits go to the 14 percent of households with incomes above $ 100,000 .
Households with incomes below $ 75,000 -- three - quarters of all households -- get just 5 percent of those benefits .
3 ) Bush signed the largest corporate tax break package in two decades , $ 136 billion .
After World War II , corporations paid half the cost of running the federal government .
Today , they pay 7 % .
4 ) The price of gas doubled under Bush .
The top oil companies earned $ 25 billion during the quarter that Hurricane Katrina struck compared to $ 50 billion for all of 2004 .
Former Exxon - Mobil , CEO , Lee Raymond got a $ 400 million exit package .
5 ) The Republican Congress has voted against every minimum wage increase , except the one linked to getting rid of the estate tax for the rich .
The real income of the average American household has fallen five years in a row .
6 ) House Republicans chopped education programs by $ 14.3 billion -- the highest cuts ever .
College tuition has increased 34 percent since Bush took office .
7 ) Since 2001 , average monthly health care premiums have risen from $ 342 to $ 603 .
Annual deductibles have doubled .
Today 46 million Americans ( including 8.4 million children ) have no health insurance , an increase of 6 million since Bush took office .
8 ) The Senate approved the biggest bankruptcy law in a quarter of a century .
Republicans voted AGAINST protecting senior citizens , the seriously ill , military members , veterans , and employees .
9 ) In 1983 , the Greenspan Commission put Social Security measures in place that created a $ 1.7 trillion surplus in the system .
This administration borrowed against and cut that to $ 153 billion while blaming citizens for not dying young enough .
10 ) In 2005 , Americans paid $ 4.3 billion in withdrawal fees at ATM ’s and $ 16 billion to credit card companies in late fees alone .
Republicans have suggested no remedies .
Nomi Prins is a senior fellow at the public policy center Demos and author of Other People 's Money and Jacked : How " Conservatives " are Picking your Pocket ( Whether you voted for them or not ) .
HALF a billion dollars spent buying back hundreds of thousands of guns after the Port Arthur massacre had no effect on the homicide rate , says a study published in an influential British journal .
The report by two Australian academics , published in the British Journal of Criminology , said statistics gathered in the decade since Port Arthur showed gun deaths had been declining well before 1996 and the buyback of more than 600,000 mainly semi-automatic rifles and pump-action shotguns had made no difference in the rate of decline .
The only area where the package of Commonwealth and State laws , known as the National Firearms Agreement ( NFA ) may have had some impact was on the rate of suicide , but the study said the evidence was not clear and any reductions attributable to the new gun rules were slight .
Yours , Mine and Ours
For the last couple of years , I have been managing my weblog with a desktop content management tool called CityDesk , made by Fog Creek Software .
This fine product has suited me very well .
Most blogs serve their content with a scripting language , dynamically generating pages from a database , with all article editing taking place in a web browser .
That approach does n't work so well for me .
First of all , I prefer to serve my content as static HTML .
More importantly , I tend to write full - length articles , so I prefer to write my content in something stronger than an HTML textarea .
So for me , CityDesk is a good piece of software .
It has templates and a basic scripting language and a simple built - in word processor and tools to manage my links .
However , I stopped using CityDesk a couple of months ago ( Sorry Joel ! ) .
Sometime later in this article I intend to make some sort of a point , but for now I want to tell the story of the tool I now use to manage my weblog .
ESBMA
Like I said , CityDesk is great , but a few things about it kept bugging me :
CityDesk 's built - in text editing facilities are n't quite strong enough for me .
I want to write my articles in a full - featured word processor .
CityDesk stores all content in a Jet database .
I work at SourceGear , a vendor of version control tools .
I want my content stored in a version control system .
So I decided to write my own content management tool .
I call it ESBMA , which stands for " Eric Sink 's Blog Management App " .
( The astute reader will realize now that this is not an article about how to choose cool names for products . )
ESBMA is 8,469 lines of C# code designed to manage a weblog exactly the way I want , including the following features :
Static HTML output :
When publishing my site , ESBMA generates static HTML pages .
Templates ( based on the old " pages with holes " concept ) make it easy to change the general layout of the site .

Integration with Microsoft Word : ESBMA has no built - in facilities for editing articles .
Instead , all my writing takes place in Microsoft Word .
When I double - click an article for editing , it launches Word with the proper document open .
When I publish my site , it uses the scriptability features of Word to save each article as HTML .
Then it cleans that resulting HTML and processes it as necessary to generate the pages of my weblog .

Integration with SourceGear Vault : ESBMA stores all my content under version control .
Naturally , I used my own product .
Since the Vault client libraries are in C# , this was pretty simple .

Management and pseudo - scripting : Like CityDesk , ESBMA the ability to manage links ( even when things move ) .
It also has very basic facilities for variables , loops and conditionals .

Integration with Amazon :
When I want to recommend a book , ESBMA can use web services calls to retrieve information from Amazon .
It can automatically insert my Amazon Affiliate ID into product links .

Integration with Haloscan :
For articles where I want to allow comments , I can easily tell ESBMA to add Haloscan links at the bottom of an item .

CityDesk import :
A utility program was used to read all the content from my CityDesk file and convert everything to ESBMA 's formats , keeping all the paths the same .
: A utility program was used to read all the content from my CityDesk file and convert everything to ESBMA 's formats , keeping all the paths the same .
Easy publish : I click one button and type a password and ESBMA uploads all new content to my web server .
The connection is tunneled through ssh for security .
For me , this is the best blogging tool in the world .
A different perspective
For anybody other than me , ESBMA is one of the worst pieces of software ever written :
ESBMA has no installer .
It has never been run by anyone but me .
It has never been run outside the Visual Studio debugger .
Every time I want to work on my blog , I open ESBMA.sln and hit F5 .
ESBMA has no documentation .
When I forget how to do something , I look up the answer in the source code .
Until quite recently , the only way to change the title of an article was to exit the app and manually edit an XML file .
One day I got tired of doing that so I added a dialog box with a text field .
The CityDesk importer is n't even close to being usable for other people .
It handles only the CityScript features that I needed and ignores the rest .
It has hard - coded stuff that doctors the imported content in ways that make sense only for me .
ESBMA publishes to my web server by invoking rsync tunneled through ssh .
Cygwin ( with the rsync and ssh packages , of course ) must be installed , and it must be installed in a specific path , because that path is hard - coded somewhere in the ESBMA source code .
ESBMA communicates with Microsoft Office ( just Word , actually ) in a couple of different ways .
It requires Office 2003 .
It will not work with any other word processor .
It will not work with any previous version of Microsoft Office .
It will [ almost certainly ] not work with any future version of Microsoft Office unless I change the code .
Oh yeah , and ESBMA crashes if the Primary Interop Assemblies for Word are not installed .
The same basic story applies for integration with Vault .
ESBMA works with Vault 3.1 .
It wo n't work with Vault 3.0 and it's not gonna work with Vault 4.0 without extra effort .
It does n't work with any other source control tool .
ESBMA sometimes crashes when I delete an article .
I 'm not sure why .
I just do n't worry about it .
ESBMA supports HTML templates , but there is no built - in facility for managing or editing them .
When I want to tweak the template for my site , I usually do something like this :
Open a Cygwin bash shell
cd /cygdrive/c/Documents and Settings / Eric Sink / Local Settings / Application Data/ESBMA/working/wf_0
vi template.
html
Oh , and ESBMA does n't create a default template .
When I create a new site , I have to manually create template .
html in the right place .
If I do n't , ESBMA will crash .
When ESBMA is performing a long operation , it does n't show a progress bar .
Or a wait cursor .
It does n't even repaint the window .
Until the operation is done , the app looks like it is hung .
So ESBMA has lots of problems , but they do n't really bother me very much .
Every once in a while I fix a bug .
Mostly I just avoid them , since I know where they all are .
Actually , this is my third attempt to write my own blogging tool .
The first two attempts failed because I took the time to consider the needs of other people .
Instead of building the perfect tool just for ME , I got distracted thinking about how I could turn my blogging tool into a business venture .
This time I succeeded .
I built a blogging tool which works perfectly for me .
It wo n't work for anybody else .
For other people , it is not merely " user unfriendly " , it is " user hostile " .
My blogging tool is an example of " MeWare " .
Yours , Mine and Ours
I claim here that there are three categories of software :
MeWare :
The developer creates software .
The developer uses it .
Nobody else does .
: The developer creates software .
The developer uses it .
Nobody else does .
ThemWare :
The developer creates software .
Other people use it .
The developer does not .
: The developer creates software .
Other people use it .
The developer does not .
UsWare : The developer creates software .
Other people use it .
The developer uses it too .
For completeness , I suppose I should probably mention the obvious fourth category :
NobodyWare : The developer creates software .
Nobody uses it .
Coming up with examples of NobodyWare will be left as an exercise for the reader . :-)
Observations about ESBMA and CityDesk
As I said , ESBMA is an example of MeWare .
I wrote it " just for me " .
I have no other users , therefore I have none of the challenges which arise when developing software for other people .
I consider the concept of MeWare to be somewhat new .
Simply put , MeWare happens today because today 's developer tools are so amazing .
I would never have written ESBMA if I had to do it in C against the Win32 API .
Software development is really expensive .
Typically , the costs of developing software are recovered by convincing lots of people to use it and collecting money from [ or through ] those users [ directly or indirectly ] .
When software is developed for a single user , the opportunities to recover the development costs are dramatically reduced .
So MeWare only makes sense when the development costs are very low .
I was able to create ESBMA for myself because coding with C# and Visual Studio is an extremely productive experience .
In contrast to ESBMA , its predecessor CityDesk is an example of UsWare .
CityDesk is a shrinkwrap product of Fog Creek .
It was developed by Joel Spolsky .
He uses it to maintain his website .
Other people use it too .
To any objective eye , the difference between CityDesk and ESBMA is obvious .
CityDesk is polished and easy to use .
ESBMA is user hostile , sometimes gratuitously so .
At this point some reader who is familiar with CityDesk is screaming , " Wait !
You ca n't use CityDesk as an example of a good product .
CityDesk is a failed product .
Joel has n't released a new version in 42 years and he never responds to questions about it anymore ! "
OK , fine .
Joel himself seems to admit that CityDesk has n't been the big seller he hoped it might be .
However , the success or failure of CityDesk is n't relevant to my point .
Which reminds me , I promised you I would make a point , did n't I ?
OK , here it is :
The gap between developer and user can be enormous .
It 's a canyon , and it takes serious effort to cross it .
If in fact CityDesk is to be considered an unsuccessful product , I claim that its failure is an issue of marketing , not an issue of product quality .
People who use CityDesk love it .
It is elegant and extremely easy to use .
I daresay it is the leading application in its market niche .
The problem is that there just are n't very many people in that niche .
In the world of content management , the war between Web - based solutions and thick clients is over -- the Web apps won .
There just are n't many people like me who want a single user desktop content management system that generates static HTML .
In other words , CityDesk did a great job crossing the canyon , only to find out that there were n't very many people standing over there .
Consider what would happen if I decided to take ESBMA up to the next level , across the canyon , from MeWare to UsWare .
I would have to make it work as well for other people as it works for me .
I would have to fix all the problems described above , plus dozens more I did n't even mention .
Off the cuff , I estimate that an UsWare version of my blogging app would be ten times more effort than the MeWare version I have now .
And of course , it would be marketing suicide , since I would be competing with the well established CityDesk for the affections of the six remaining people on earth who care about apps like this .
It 's All about the Users
So let 's face it -- MeWare is n't actually very interesting .
Aside from the occasional outlier like myself , nobody is developing MeWare .
All of us are developing software on behalf of other people .
Whether your software is commercial or open source , it 's all about the users .
Why do we develop software for other people ?
Because they need software , and they are not developing it for themselves , for only two reasons I can think of :
They do n't develop their own software because they simply do n't know how .
They do n't develop their own software because they are too busy doing other things .
In either case , the users are expecting us to create software on their behalf .
They expect us to see things from their perspective , to value the things that they think are important .
This is hard .
The Challenges of ThemWare
The detachment between developer and user is greatest in the case of ThemWare .
I create software .
Somebody else uses it .
I do not .
This creates three challenges that I want to highlight :
1. Maybe I do n't even know how to use my software .
In this situation , I work all day creating dialog boxes and toolbars , but I do n't actually know what to do with them .
Several years ago I worked as a developer of data visualization tools for scientists .
Our software could take data and create pretty pictures like contour plots and line graphs and colorized grids .
I took physics and chemistry in college , but that does n't make me a scientist .
I really never knew how to use the software I was developing .
I could tell you the arcane details of how our macro language worked , but I could n't tell you what a Fast Fourier Transform is .
I still can't .
So I could never make our software do anything interesting , but our customers could make amazing pictures with it .
2. Maybe I do n't understand the people who use my software .
The people who use my software are not like me .
They 're in another field .
I'm a software programmer , but those people were trained in auto mechanics or interior decorating or dentistry .
I do n't know how they see the world .
Understanding their perspective does n't come naturally for me at all .
I can illustrate this situation with a real - life example that I face quite regularly .
The SourceGear web site has a " store " which allows our customers to purchase licenses for our products .
This store is a piece of software , and I am the developer responsible for it .
However , I never actually use it .
Obviously I never buy a copy of my own software .
( I was tempted to once .
It was the last day of the month and our sales were about a hundred bucks shy of our monthly goal .
I was so tempted to whip out my credit card and place an order for one copy of Vault . )
Anyway , this store is ThemWare , and I do n't think I understand Them .
We sell our products to developers , and I understand developers just fine .
But many companies funnel all purchasing through a department which is dedicated to that purpose .
Apparently there is some sort of impedance mismatch between me and the folks in those purchasing departments , because people keep coming to our store and buying the wrong thing .
One of our products is called SourceOffSite .
The current version is 4.1 , but we do still continue to sell the 3.5 version for people who prefer not to upgrade .
( Starting with version 4.0 , the SourceOffSite requires the .NET Framework , and not everybody wants to install it . )
Anyway , version 4.1 and version 3.5 require different kind of serial numbers .
When you come to our store , it 's important that you buy the correct version .
So the store tries very hard explain the situation .
The information is at the top of the order form .
In red .
After you fill out the order form , you are reminded again , just to be sure .
But so far , the canyon between me and Them still looks big .
We get email basically every day from somebody who just bought SourceOffSite and then discovered that their newly purchased 4.1 serial number will not work with their 3.5 server .
It is only a slight exaggeration to say that everybody who comes to buy 3.5 licenses does it wrong .
My next version of the SourceGear store needs to have an additional verification step for people in purchasing departments who are trying to buy SourceOffSite .
When the purchaser places an order for SourceOffSite , they will see a message like this :
Please go ask the developer to confirm which version they want .
To prove that you actually spoke with a developer , ask them for the answer to the following question :
â€¢ " Virtual memory " is :
1 . An upcoming technology for recording TV shows
2 . A feature of your computer
3 . A piece of jargon from Star Trek
3 . Maybe I do n't even like the people who use my software .
There are six billion people on the planet .
I can't be expected to be fond of all of them .
I am one of the few software developers in central Illinois who does not work for State Farm Insurance .
State Farm is one of the largest insurance companies in the world .
Their headquarters is in Bloomington , just an hour or so down the road from us here in Champaign .
The sheer size of State Farm is simply amazing .
This company is monstrous , like the Borg from Star Trek , assimilating every IT resource in the area .
They employ thousands upon thousands of programmers , all of whom are busily working on software which will be distributed to countless insurance agent drones scattered all over the nation .
Even though Bloomington is a small city of perhaps 100,000 people , Microsoft has an office in Bloomington because State Farm is their largest non-government customer .
I can't imagine working at State Farm .
I do n't even like insurance agents .
Every day I would go to the office and build software to help insurance agents be more efficient in their ongoing efforts to annoy me .
The temptation for sabotage would be overwhelming .
The Consequences of ThemWare
In terms of the size of the canyon , ThemWare is probably the worst possible scenario .
If I am building software that I do n't use and do n't know how to use for people I do n't understand or even like , how good is my software going to be ?
I probably see every feature in terms of how difficult it will be to implement , rather than how valuable it will be for my users .
I probably find myself wanting to label or document the features using my jargon instead of theirs .
I probably create features that are tedious or unintuitive for my users .
I can't imagine why the user interface I designed does n't make sense to them .
ThemWare is hard .
The Challenges of UsWare
The situation with UsWare is n't quite as bad .
I create software .
Other people use it .
So do I .
Unlike the situation with ThemWare , I as a developer actually have at least one thing in common with my users :
We both use my software .
This suggests that we probably have even more things in common .
Perhaps we can even understand each other .
The Best Dogfooding Story Ever
The common expression for using your own software is " eating your own dogfood " .
Sometimes this term gets verbed by simply calling it " dogfooding " .
If you 'll indulge me briefly , I 'd like to tell you what I think is the best dogfooding story ever .
However , it 's not a software story .
It 's a woodworking story .
The primary machine tool in any well - equipped woodshop is a table saw .
Basically , it 's a polished cast iron table with a slot through which protrudes a circular saw blade , ten inches in diameter .
Wood is cut by sliding it across the table into the spinning blade .
A table saw is an extremely dangerous tool .
My saw can cut a 2 - inch thick piece of hard maple with no effort at all .
Frankly , it 's a tool which should only be used by someone who is a little bit afraid of it .
It should be obvious what would happen if a finger ever came in contact with the spinning blade .
Over 3,000 people each year lose a finger in an accident with a table saw .
A guy named Stephen Gass has come up with an amazing solution to this problem .
He is a woodworker , but he also has a PhD in physics .
His technology is called Sawstop .
It consists of two basic inventions :
He has a sensor which can detect the difference in capacitance between a finger and a piece of wood .
He has a way to stop a spinning table saw blade within 1/100 of a second , less than a quarter turn of rotation .
The videos of this product are amazing .
Slide a piece of wood into the spinning blade , and it cuts the board just like it should .
Slide a hot dog into the spinning blade , and it stops instantly , leaving the frankfurter with nothing more than a nick .
Here 's the spooky part : Stephen Gass tested his product on his own finger !
This is a guy who really wanted to close the distance between him and his customers .
No matter how much I believed in my product , I think I would find it incredibly difficult to stick my finger in a spinning table saw blade .
Unbelievable !
Back to the problems with UsWare ...
I think dogfooding is one of the most important things a developer can do .
Nothing gets you closer to the perspective of your users than becoming one of them .
But UsWare still has challenges .
Your users are still probably not exactly like you .
Recently , this very issue has been discussed with respect to Microsoft 's dogfooding of Team System .
People wonder if Microsoft is going to end up creating a set of developer tools that are useful only for software companies .
This is a valid concern .
There are far more companies out there that produce software simply as a means toward producing something else , like jets or laundry detergent .
Those companies probably do n't work exactly the way software companies do .
SourceGear DiffMerge
With UsWare , there is a tendency to get stuck in the following path of logic :
I use the software .
I understand it .
So everyone else understands it too , right ?
I have this problem with the SourceGear DiffMerge tool that comes bundled with Vault .
This app can be used to help perform a three - way merge .
The basic operation is fairly complex , so the tool needs to do a great job presenting a user interface which is easy to understand .
Apparently , it does not .
I helped designed the tool , so it always makes perfect sense to me .
So , when users have trouble understanding it , I have a tendency to suddenly become Basil Fawlty , the rude English hotel manager played by John Cleese :
User : I do n't get it .
Basil Fawlty :
It 's perfectly simple .
There are three files being displayed on your screen and we should n't have to label which one is which because it seems perfectly obvious to us and so it is not the software which is defective here but rather , its user .
Thank you so much , good day .
Unfortunately , very shortly after this happened the first time , one of SourceGear 's developers walked into my office :
SourceGear Developer : Hey Eric , you know that DiffMerge tool we ship ?
I do n't get it .
Basil Fawlty : Right !
Apparently I 'm the one who is defective here then .
Manuel !
It is more or less impossible for me to design a user interface that I do n't understand , but it is all too simple for me to design one that other people do n't understand .
Rant : Flagged messages in Mozilla Thunderbird
Another problem with UsWare is the case where I the developer design and optimize features for the way I use them , forgetting the my users might be using them differently .
For an example of this , I 'm going to switch places and cite a case where I am the user .
My favorite email client is Mozilla Thunderbird .
I like it very much , except I wish that flagged messages would work the way they do in Outlook .
Every time I see a new release , I have high hopes that flagged messages will finally work the way I expect .
Last week I upgraded to the new 1.5 release , and once again , I was disappointed .
Thunderbird supports flags , but it cannot search for flagged messages or filter views with flag as one of the criteria .
Bottom line : Thunderbird has flags , but they seem to be mostly for show .
They look nice , but they are n't very useful .
I assume that Thunderbird is UsWare .
In other words , I assume that all Thunderbird developers actually use Thunderbird as their mail client .
I am forced to conclude that the Thunderbird developers just do n't use flags the way I do .
My Blindspot about Visual Studio integration with Vault
Let me tell you about another UsWare problem we 've experienced at SourceGear .
First , a little background :
Oversimplifying , there are basically two ways to use a version control system .
You can use a standalone application , or , you can integrate the features directly into the Visual Studio IDE .
Here 's the problem :
You see , I hate using source control integration within Visual Studio .
Our product does include this feature , but I never use it .
In fact , right now most of the people at SourceGear do n't use it .
However , a clear majority of our customers do .
This little canyon causes problems .
Sometime in the last year or so , the painfully obvious truth hit me like a ton of bricks :
Our users want integration .
We have always explained things to our customers somewhat like this :
Our standalone client application is the primary way to access the Vault server .
Our Visual Studio integration client is available , but it offers fewer features and somewhat lower performance .
But this is exactly the opposite of what they want .
Most people do n't want a standalone source control application .
Some of our customers have never even launched it .
They just want source control features to show up in all the right places in their IDE .
The key thing to notice is that IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment .
If you are reading this and wondering how I could miss something so obvious , then perhaps I have convinced you how easy it is to find a canyon between you and your users .
Here at SourceGear , most of us are software developers , and we use Visual Studio .
We build version control tools for software developers , most of whom are using Visual Studio .
Obviously , we eat our own dogfood by using our own product as our version control system for the entire team .
Nobody could possibly be more similar to their customers than we are , right ? :-)
I have known all along that most of our users want integration .
But I guess I never let it really sink in .
Sometimes my thoughts about our product strategy have been better aligned with the way I use the product , rather than with the way our customers use it .
Anyway , integration is getting a lot more air time among the developers at SourceGear .
On several occasions , we have changed our plans to allow us to give a higher priority to integration .
We are trying to cross the canyon between us and people who only use our product within Visual Studio , and other IDEs as well :
Several months ago we released a very early preview of an Eclipse plugin for Vault .
Work on this project is continuing and will be available later this year .
On January 30 th , we released the first preview of support for integration with Dreamweaver .
, we released the first preview of support for integration with Dreamweaver .
Vault 4.0 will include an all new Visual Studio integration client for use with Visual Studio 2005 .
We get it .
A lot of our attention right now is being spent trying to make sure that people can enjoyably use Vault in the IDE they prefer .
And by the way , once we get the new Visual Studio integration client working , I will be using it . :-)
Meeting these Challenges
So ThemWare is hard is because our users are nothing like us .
And UsWare is hard because we keep assuming our users are exactly like us when they 're not .
This is the point in the article when you are expecting me to suddenly reveal a pearl of great wisdom on how to solve these canyon problems .
Sorry , but our time is up . :-)
You see , this article is the essay version of a talk I am presenting to the Jacksonville .NET User Group .
Right about now is the point where I will be out of time .
If I had left time for a really good answer to this problem then I would n't have had time to for my John Cleese imitation , which I can assure you was far more effective in person than it was in print .
However , although I can't offer give a good answer to this problem , I have just enough time for something flippant and trite :
Listen to your users
And be transparent .
Let yourself be accountable for listening to your users .
The main reason SourceGear did a Dreamweaver plugin is because we have a public support forum where dozens of people asked us to do one .
This is one of our most common feature requests .
How could we ignore them ?
Your users have things to say .
Stop telling them how great your software is and listen to them tell you how to make it better .

The quintet 's debut album , The Silence in Black and White , has sold more than 500,000 copies since its release last year , and the group has appeared on ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live and been on MTV's TRL .
The five young men from Dayton , Ohio , are living the rock - and - roll dream – but they took a highly unconventional path to get there .
The band achieved its popularity without any real radio or TV airplay , a feat unheard - of a few years ago .
They are n't signed to a major label , and they do n't want to be .
They do n't need industrial - strength marketing campaigns or heavy rotation .
What they have is MySpace , a community Web site that converts electronic word of mouth into the hottest marketing strategy since the advent of MTV .
Massively popular , MySpace is nominally a social networking site like Friendster , but nearly 400,000 of the site 's roughly 30 million user pages belong to bands .
The rest belong mostly to teens and twentysomethings who attend the groups ' shows , download their songs , read their blogs , send them fan mail , and enthusiastically spread the word .
As it happens , the man behind this phenomenon is working his way through the Warped Tour crowd like a rock star himself .
Everyone seems to know Tom Anderson .
A laid - back 29 - year - old in a plaid shirt and baseball hat , he can hardly take three paces before he 's asked to autograph a shoe , a T - shirt , or in one case a naked back .
No wonder :
His photo shows up at the top of every MySpace user 's " friends " list .
As the first friend of every MySpace member , Anderson may be one of the most popular humans on the planet .
And in the entertainment universe that MySpace is helping to create , friends count .
" This generation is growing up without having ever watched programmed media , " says Courtney Holt , head of new media and strategic marketing at Interscope , one of the first labels to embrace MySpace .
" They do n't think in terms of the album , and they do n't think in terms of a TV schedule .
They think in terms of TiVo , P2P , AOL , and of course MySpace .
We 're just going to have to adapt . "
To focus on corporate finances , though , is to miss a larger point .
The real economic beneficiaries of MySpace are the ambitious young musicians in Pomona and around the country who are creating a new , life - size kind of stardom .
Over the past couple years , MySpace and other community sites , like purevolume.com , have launched a number of acts : Fall Out Boy , My Chemical Romance , Relient K , and Silverstein , among others .
Relient K , which plays earnest pop punk with an understated Christian message , has sold more than 500,000 albums in 12 months .
My Chemical Romance 's last album sold more than 1 million copies .
These artists have discovered what could be the first serious business model for music in the post - Napster era .
The old way of doing things , which counted on a few blockbusters to finance dozens of expensive failures , is yielding little besides a decline in major label revenue .
By contrast , " MySpace bands , " as the site 's publicist refers to them , keep production and promotion costs as low as possible .
They give away their best two or three songs as downloads or streams and use social networking and email blasts to reach an audience hungry for new music .
Converts become zealots , more than making up for any lost CD revenue through sales of concert tickets , T - shirts , messenger bags , hoodies , posters , and bumper stickers .
With little fanfare , these groups are creating a new middle class of popular music : acts that can make a full - time living selling only a modest number of discs , on the order of 50,000 to 500,000 per release .
For this generation of musicians , the mass market and the hit - making apparatus it supports are relics of a bygone age .
The new reality is that their audience is n't listening to radio or vegging out in front of MTV .
The audience is online .
Tom Anderson was n't much interested in the Web when he graduated from UC Berkeley in 1997 with a double major in English and rhetoric .
He moved to San Francisco and started an alternative rock band called Swank .
It barely lasted a year , and hardly anyone noticed when it broke up .
Still , the experience left a deep mark on Anderson .
There was a stark division between rock haves and have - nots .
Bands were either on magazine covers and all over the radio or completely invisible .
" I saw how hard it was for even really talented bands to reach an audience , " he says .
At the time he was standing right in the middle of the dotcom boom .
Like a lot of people , he thought the Internet could change the way bands connected with their fans .
" I just did n't know how , " he says .
But Anderson 's interests extended beyond the Internet or music .
After a long trip to Taiwan , he returned to California in 1999 to pick up a master 's in film studies at UCLA .
During his first week at school , he was in the computer lab checking his class schedule when he saw an ad for Matchmaker.com .
" I logged on to find a girl , " he says .
" But I wound up being more intrigued by the idea that people could connect over the Net for all kinds of reasons . "
Anderson finished the two - year UCLA program in a year .
After graduating , he intended to return to Asia .
But first he needed money .
Walking through his Los Angeles neighborhood one day , he saw a flyer promising $ 20 to anyone who answered the ad .
A week later , he showed up at a nondescript office building in Santa Monica for what turned out to be a one - on - one focus group .
The interviewer , who worked for an online storage startup called Xdrive Technologies , was so impressed with her subject that she hired him as a copywriter .
Anderson figured he'd be at Xdrive for three weeks , just long enough to earn plane fare to Singapore .
It did n't work out that way .
Anderson hit it off with Chris DeWolfe , Xdrive 's VP of sales and marketing .
" Tom was so obviously full of smart ideas , I wanted to work more closely with him , " says DeWolfe , now CEO of MySpace .
By mid-2001 , the two had left Xdrive to form their own marketing company , Response Base Marketing .
The next year , they sold the business to eUniverse for $ 3.3 million .
They continued to run the company , but they were already looking for a new challenge .
In the spring of 2003 , Anderson started thinking about online connections again , particularly social networking sites .
He believed that services like Friendster , which was just beginning to catch on , were stifling creativity when they could be encouraging it .
Users ' homepages all looked alike ; Anderson imagined something much more fluid and customizable .
He also realized that social networking needed to accommodate groups as well as individuals – teams looking for players , professionals looking for work , filmmakers looking for a crew , bands looking for an audience .
Finally , Anderson decided to broach the subject with DeWolfe .
He barged into his office : " Dude , we 've got to talk .
I 've been thinking about Friendster . "
For Eron Bucciarelli , the earnest , mop-headed drummer of Hawthorne Heights , a degree in communications from Ohio's University of Dayton seemed like a dead end .
His heart was in punk rock : first grunge , then hardcore and death metal .
In 2001 , he took a job with the local cable company and joined an unsigned pop punk quintet called A Day in the Life , after the Beatles song of the same name .
The members devoted themselves to the band , playing at every opportunity .
It was grueling : lousy venues , seedy hotels , and long road trips .
" We went on tour every weekend , " Bucciarelli explains .
" We 'd pack up the van right after work on Friday , play a show that night in Pittsburgh , play the next night in Philly , wind up in Delaware somewhere on Sunday , and then drive all night to get back to Dayton by Monday morning . "
Before long , the punishing regime of day jobs and weekend tours took its toll .
A brief flirtation with the indie label Drive - Thru Records fizzled .
The band 's lead singer , J. T. Woodruff , was disenchanted and exhausted ; he had two jobs and attended night school .
When the bassist quit , the other members were ready to follow his lead .
But Bucciarelli would n't let go .
He convinced his bandmates to hire another bass player , and they continued under a new name : Hawthorne Heights .
" We used to tellpeople it was because we liked Nathaniel Hawthorne , " he laughs , " but that 's bullshit .
We just thought it sounded cool . "
The band decided to reinvent itself along more commercially viable lines .
" We agreed this would be our last shot , " he says .
" We did n't want to be in our late 20s playing some Elks hall .
We 'd be geezers . "
The first element in need of overhaul , they decided , was the music .
A Day in the Life played pop punk built on catchy guitar riffs .
" We dropped the classic rock influence and added breakdowns and screaming , " he says .
It pushed their sound closer to the post - punk genre known as screamo .
Bucciarelli saw the potential of online communities to build an audience for the new band .
" I knew that Web sites like purevolume.com , which had just started , would be better than radio at introducing us to the kind of people who might listen to our music . "
He took the band into a jerry - built studio and recorded a two - song demo .
When he posted the tracks on purevolume.com , they got thousands of downloads before Hawthorne Heights had even played in front of a live audience .
Then , following advice from Getsigned.com , Bucciarelli started pitching labels with their new sound .
It was n't clear that his hard work would pay off .
Drive - Thru did n't like the new direction .
A few other companies asked them to come out to California to play a showcase , but they could n't afford the trip .
Victory Records , a thriving indie label known for successfully marketing marginal acts , sent a form letter .
" It basically said , ' Do n't call us , we 'll call you , ' " he says .
Bucciarelli was n't so easily put off .
He guessed the email address of Victory president Tony Brummel and sent a message reminding him that Hawthorne Heights was available .
" I basically told him Drive - Thru was interested and he should move fast , " he says .
The tactic worked .
Brummel called the next day and asked the band to come to Chicago to play for him and some other people at the label .
" We were in heaven , " Bucciarelli recalls .
They arrived at Victory 's office several hours early on one of the coldest days of the year .
" The back window on our van was broken , " Bucciarelli recalls , " so we sat huddled together for warmth until Tony showed up to let us into the Victory studio . "
They set up , and 20 or so people from the label trickled in .
" The studio was big , " Bucciarelli says .
" It could have fit 100 people , but they all stood in back . "
They played five songs .
Guitarist Casey Calvert was so nervous he nearly puked into the microphone .
When they finished , Brummel thanked them .
He said he'd be in touch and left the room .
The band drove the six hours back to Dayton in anguished silence .
" We thought they hated us , " Bucciarelli says .
" Then Tony called the next day and told us to get ready to sign a contract . "
Hawthorne Heights could now record an album .
But who would buy it ?
When Anderson laid out his ideas for DeWolfe in the spring of 2003 , he described an online service unlike anything on the Web .
It would , he said , be the ultimate social hub : part Friendster , part Blogger , part MP3.com , part craigslist .
" The idea was that if it was a cool thing to do online , you should be able to do it on MySpace , " he says .
That summer , he and DeWolfe pitched the idea to eUniverse ( later renamed Intermix Media ) , which agreed to provide startup capital in exchange for majority interest .
The pair hired a team of five programmers and set to work .
DeWolfe , who had a lot of connections to the Los Angeles creative community , solicited suggestions from bands , artists , and other creative types .
At first , growth was slow .
A small but fervent community of musicians and club kids , many from the LA area , latched onto the site as a way to promote their music and stay in touch with fans .
The site encouraged creativity to the point of chaos .
For MySpace 's mostly young demographic , their pages were multimedia outgrowths of their jackets , lockers , and notebooks – a place for band stickers , poems , personality quizzes , R-rated photos , and anything else HTML allows .
In September , around the time Hawthorne Heights was sending its demo to Victory , MySpace exploded .
The magnitude of the growth hit Anderson when he flew to San Francisco to see a late - season baseball game .
The night before , Anderson had indulged in his obsessive habit of checking the rankings for MySpace .
" Over the course of just a few days we 'd gone from the 30,000th most popular site to the 3,000th , " he says .
Sitting in SBC Park watching the Giants beat the Dodgers , he looked around the stadium , taking in the 40,000 cheering fans .
It struck him that approximately that many people were now signed up on MySpace .
" Until then , we were getting maybe 500 new users a day , " he says .
By October they were getting 10,000 new users a day .
The Victory contract was a morale boost for Hawthorne Heights , but it did n't do much to improve the group 's financial situation .
" We cut a very , very different deal than we would have gotten with a major , " Bucciarelli says .
In fact , the band received a paltry advance .
" We got about $ 5,000 , and that immediately went to pay off our minivan . "
But Bucciarelli was n't looking for a big check .
" We could have gotten a million dollars up front and all lived large for a while , " he says , " but we 'd have spent the rest of our careers trying to recoup . "
That 's the way many contracts work :
Any label 's outlay associated with a band – from studio time to radio promotions – is billed against the band 's advance .
Hawthorne Heights kept costs low from the beginning .
They spent around $ 20,000 on recording and another $ 5,000 on a video .
And because Victory budgets a fraction of what the majors do on marketing and promotion , Hawthorne Heights needed a cheap way to build demand for their June 2004 album release .
So that spring they began posting a few songs on MySpace , which was becoming a hub for the indie music community .
Fans began to find them .
By the time the album came out , " we had 20,000 friends in our MySpace network , " Bucciarelli says .
But the bandmates were lavishing attention on them .
On tour , each musician would spend four to five hours online every day , answering emails and " adding " new friends .
( MySpace users must approve each person who requests to be added as a friend . )
The fans loved it .
" They can't believe they 're actually getting a response .
You 've got a fan for life . "
MySpace is also overflowing with devoted fans .
Since mid-2004 , the number of unique visitors has grown from 2 million a month to roughly 22 million .
Keeping up with that rate of expansion has n't been easy .
Bandwidth costs are enormous , as are the programming challenges posed by scaling the site 's features to accommodate the growing traffic .
At last count , the company had 125 employees .
" It 's crazy , " Anderson says .
" It seems like we 're always moving into larger office spaces . "
Anderson and DeWolfe will roll out a wireless version of the site by the end of the year , and they recently launched a video service that hosts some 2,000 clips – for starters .
The operation is also expanding overseas .
" We have 700,000 members in the UK alone , and that 's without a British domain , " Anderson notes .
After England , he has his sights set on Australia , New Zealand , and Scandinavia .
Even as MySpace has emerged as a platform for small - time bands to make a living , it is gaining credibility as a promotional venue for larger acts as well .
Last spring , Interscope used the site to debut new albums by established artists including Beck , the Black Eyed Peas , and Nine Inch Nails .
All three had the biggest first - week sales of their careers .
For the moment , artists like Kanye West and Coldplay have fewer friends on their MySpace pages than Hawthorne Heights .
" But that does n't mean we do n't have pages , " says Ted Mico , VP of strategic marketing at Capitol , Coldplay 's label .
" We ca n't afford not to , " Mico says , noting that , by maintaining a presence on the site , artists can use MySpace to stay in the public eye between major releases .
Today the record business – tomorrow the rest of the entertainment industry .
Network television is catching on ; NBC debuted The Office , its docu-comedy series , as a Web cast on MySpace in March , and a group devoted to the Fox series The O.C. boasts nearly 90,000 members .
The latest Cameron Crowe movie , Elizabethtown , has its own page , and a fan group for the Filipino super - featherweight boxer Manny Pacquiao has more than 23,000 members , some of whom can be counted on to show up at his bouts .
Going mainstream has its downside , of course .
MySpace thrives on a sense of immediacy and community .
The spirit is independent , even rebellious .
Maybe that 's why there was a noticeable backlash when the deal with News Corp. was announced .
How cool can a Web site owned by Rupert Murdoch be ?
Parody profiles of Murdoch have sprung up , and conspiracy theories abound , such as the false rumor posted on Slashdot that News Corp. would own the copyrights to songs hosted on the site .
Meanwhile , public ownership is likely to impinge on the service 's laissez - faire culture .
For instance , a surprisingly brazen market in illicit goods and services flourishes in the " groups " section of the site ( " sex for drugs anyone ? … san fernando valley … " ) .
And while Anderson and DeWolfe ban profiles posted by users under the age of 14 , they can't sift through millions of new pages every month – or keep users from lying about their ages .
But whether MySpace ultimately succeeds or fails is beside the point .
Its dramatic emergence is the first conclusive evidence of a new era in which the distance between audience and artist is greatly diminished .
Companies that flourish will be those that can navigate the changed topography .
J. T. Woodruff does n't need a road map .
At a recent Warped stop in Cleveland , Hawthorne Heights lead singer is sitting on a cooler at the band 's merchandise table , hawking bumper stickers , pins , and a dozen different T - shirt designs .
" Best deal on the tour ! " he cries .
" Five bucks for five stickers ! "
His girlfriend hands up products from behind the table while Woodruff bargains with a blond kid in a T - shirt that reads Kiss me : I 'm punk .
It 's a living .
And there 's not a bodyguard in sight .

Brain death by dull cubicle
You always knew that dull , boring cubicles could suck the joy out of work , but now there 's evidence that they can change your brain .
Not mentally or emotionally , no , we 're talking physical structural changes .
You could almost say , " Dull , lifeless work environments cause brain damage . "
I said " almost " , because it depends on your definition of brain damage .
What the research suggests is that in unstimulating , unenriched , stressful environments , the brain STOPS producing new neurons ( more on that later ) .
But it 's only been the last few years that scientists have finally realized that the human brain can build new neurons .
For most of the previous century , it was believed that we were born with all the neurons we 'd ever have .
Scientists who believed in and studied the idea of " neurogenesis " were dismissed , criticized , ignored .
But Princeton 's Elizabeth Gould has picked up the neurogenesis ball and run with it .
She is almost single - handedly changing the face of neuroscience and psychology .
From a fascinating article in the new print issue of Seed Magazine ( my new favorite ) :
" Eight years after Gould defied the dogma of her field and proved that the primate brain creates new cells , she has gone on to demonstrate that the structure of the brain is incredibly influenced by one 's surroundings . "
One of the most interesting ( and , in hindsight , " doh ! " ) discoveries was that one of the main reasons researchers kept finding NO evidence of new neuron development in their test primates is because they kept them in an environment which shut that process down .
In other words , it was the caged - living that stopped the neurogenesis process .
By giving her animals a rich , natural enviornment , Gould " flipped the switch " back on , allowing their brains to work normally , and sure enough -- the happier , more stimulated animals showed a DRAMATIC increase in neurogenesis as well as dendrite density .
One summary :
" Complex surroundings create a complex brain . "
[ One interesting and beautiful back story - - researcher Fernando Nottebohm had showed earlier that neurogenesis was necessary for bird songs .
" To sing their complex melodies , male birds needed new brain cells .
In fact , up to 1 % of the neurons in the bird 's song center were created anew , every day . "
Of course , his work was dissed as irrelevant .
I mean , come on , these are bird brains .
" Avian neurogenesis was explained away as an exotic adaptation ... " ]
So , back to cubicles .
The key to Gould 's demonstration of neurogenesis ( where virtually all other primate studies had failed ) was the stimulating environment .
Cages stopped neurgenesis , which she describes as " The neurons stop investing in themselves . "
She links caged environments with stress , and stimulating natural environments as less stressful , so there is a big assumption here that a dull , boring , unstimulating cube life is also stressful ( for the brain , anyway - - it does n't mean the work itself is stressful ) .
But she did n't just throw them in a natural environment ... she also made sure they had a lot of opportunities for play .
And perhaps very importantly -- frequent rotation and introduction of new toys .
I 've always wondered why in every game company I worked for ( or anyplace with " creatives " ) , it was assumed and encouraged that people made elaborate virtual worlds out of their workspace , but in non -game / creative workplaces , not so much .
While this is often allowed in the cubes of non -game programmers , for the most part it 's only the young hipster startups that consider this a primary , essential element of their corporate culture .
[ Apparently those ping - pong tables and games in those web startups were more than just examples of bubble / VC excess . ]
With Gould 's work , it would seem , we should not only be allowing employees to , say , decorate their cube , but we should be encouraging it at every turn AND take steps to make frequent changes to the area .
( And by " changes " , I do n't mean rotating demotivation posters ) .
For too many places I 've worked , a new " official policy poster " or some new HR thing is about all the stimulating change we got .
( That , and the increasingly emphatic signs posted in the coffee / kitchen area about " your mother does n't work here , it 's up to US to keep it clean !!! " )
It would appear that blowing your own mind on a regular basis is not just a good idea , it 's a key part of neurogenesis .
One of the conclusions she came to is that " learning heals the brain . "
And again , we are n't talking emotionally or psychologically , we 're talking physical structures .
She believes that even those who have been in a stressful environment can undo much of the damage by not just removing the stress , but actively introducing enriching and stimulating things .
Experiencing and learning new things is literally exercise for the brain !
That 's so cool .
The implications of her work are of course much deeper and more significant than just " dull and / or stressful work environments with low stimulation suppress neurogenesis , which means less or no new brain cells . "
There are all kinds of social implications as well , although she points out that like most scientists , she does not want to see her work " twisted for political purposes " .
But it does mean that the work we are all doing to help our users learn and grow and develop ( and kick ass ; ) is a lot more meaningful than just good customer support .
Remember , when WE say " passionate users " , we mean the kind of passion that inspires people to spend time learning and getting better at whatever it is they 're passionate about .
So it would seem that it might not be a huge stretch to say :
Passionate users grow more brain cells !
Apparently all work and no play makes Jack not just dull , but dumber .
So do n't forget to have fun ...

As an alternative to cubicles housing induhviduals , my employer has , in a sort of development hot - house they call an ADC , these hexagonal pods which house 6 developers per pod .
On the walls there are whiteboards you can draw on , and in the middle is a smallish round table useful for quick meetings .
Initially people seemed to greet the pods with suspicion , but quickly people have ended up personalising their individual corners , and each pod takes on a character that defines the team that works there .
It 's a sort of happy medium between the isolation of the individual pod and the exposure of an open - plan office .
Compared to an open - plan office , it 's a great idea .
I actually suffer from over - exposure in an open - plan .
I can't think when people are looking over my shoulder .

Similar research apparently found growth in the hippocampus of London taxi drivers , learning " The Knowledge " ( all the streets ) has an observable effect on memory structures .
Re. the cubicle , PeopleWare is a good read on the negative effects of interuptions : oddly I find that pair programming focuses attention on the task in hand , shutting out the background noise , a little like the cocktail party effect ?
And cubicle conversations , in the words of Mr. Bateson , reminds me of a story :)
Imagine an experiment in which rats are being raised in a series of five boxes .
In the first box , you have a single rat , raised the usual ( sterile ) way .
In box two , you have a rat raised the same way , except that it is given toys to * play * with ( my emphasis ) .
In box three , same idea , except that the rat 's toys are changed every week .
Box four , same idea , changed toys , but there are several rats growing up together .
In box five , you have several rats , rich toys , but each rat is removed from the cage every day and lovingly stroked for 15 minutes .

The more I read about the toxicity / productivity - drain of cubicles ... makes me wonder what office planner has been taking all the crazy pills ?!?
Is there any evidence * for* cubes , besides cost / space savings ?
Ken - how about a sixth set of rats , that get to choose their most ideal / productive environment possible ?

Yes , it is a shameless semi-self - plug .
But , it qould please you to know this : Open Spaces really do open minds .
As far as people looking over my shoulder while I am working , I never have to worry about that .
All of us understand our responsibilities .
And yes , there are occasions when one or the other digresses , but then it is just restricted to that .
A digress .
I believe open - plan spaces help keep a check on such digressions .
Plus , if I need to talk to someone , I do n't need to look across cubicles , they are simply there for me . :)

What freakish timing !
In about 30 minutes , I 'll be heading into my office for the last time .
We 're moving to a new space today ... one full of plain white walls and no foosball tables .
We 'll have to see what we can do to spruce it up right away !

Could explain why autocratic , bureaucratic , dictatorial , communistic societies , companies , and countries ultimately fail and creative , open , and entrepreneurial endeavors thrive .
It explains a lot about history , evolution , and society in general .

So true !
I used to think that making my work - space " pretty " was just frivolous and showed lack of focus ... but since I prettifed my desk , my focus has actually been enhanced !

And rotating toys is such a simple thing to do , yet it inspires great play from the kids .

This is one of the reasons I feel I love living abroad ( currently in Japan , but have been elsewhere ) .
When back in the states , usually , a trip to the grocery store or post office wo n't do anything to blow my mind .
However , when living abroad , even the most routine tasks can be filled with mind blowing unexpected first experiences .
Just the fact that everything is conducted in a foreign language alone is enough to keep my brain happy !
If I was back in my hometown I 'm sure I would need to seek outside stimulation more proactively !
Good stuff .

I was thinking about this more yesterday and I started wondering what a study on the opposite extreme would look like : is there a point at which too much stuff ( clutter ) becomes mind - numbing ?
It would be really interesting to know if there was an optimum amount of stimulation for growing brain cells -- honestly , I think my home office is probably across the line .
There are a lot of toys in this room !

This reminds me of how my current programming environment is .

I wonder if this can be expanded to cover a company 's " brain " i.e. in the beginning as a startup the environment is stimulating , but as the company matures and gains the systems and processes to service its customers , the company 's environment becomes stale , lifeless and bureaucratic .

Just as plants need food , water and sun to grow and regenerate ... So do us as human beings .
Our brains yes , but our 5 senses need the additional stimuli to help jump - start / signal our connected brains to regenerate / create additional cells .
Colors , sounds , shapes and so much more play an important role in our continuing development until we expire .
Great subject matter and I totally agree with the articles that followed ...

As a middle school teacher , I 'm aware of the principles you 're talking about .
The amount people learn and retain is roughly proportional to the degree of their participation in the learning process .
That 's one reason why I think reading blogs and articles like yours can help us all keep our minds fresh .

Some years have passed , so I can talk about this now .
Many many moons ago , I started dating this very cool girl .
We hit it off right away , had lots in common , she was smart , agressive , cool and funny .
And hot .
Really hot .
So we dated for a while , which became a year , then nearly two .
I figured she was it .
We worked together on decisions , but I followed my passions and she followed hers - both career professionals , both creative , and both ready to kick this town for a Carribean cottage if the thought ever struck us .
Adventure .
Romance .
Lots of Sex .
All was right with my world .
So I did what I figured I should do - I went out shopping for a diamond ring .
That was the biggest mistake I ever made .
I can't really put my finger on the exact change , but over the years , I 've cometo summarize it this way : I went from being the guy she loved and wanted to marry to the guy who did n't match up with her fantasy about getting married , in about 24 hours .
She started acting as if I was completely incapable of making any decisons on my own , in spite of the evidence to the contrary .
She criticized everything I did .
She tried to make me look like some idiot , Homer Simpson type .
Now , I 'm not splitting atoms in the basement or anything , but I was Fulbright kid for a year and graduated cum laude , and I have a tendency to avoid dumb shit like telemarking scams , computer viruses , STD 's and , well , white slavery rings .
Let 's just say I 'm no Homer .
Then the wedding planning started , and HO LEE SHIT .
We were doing alright , for sure , but she had put together about a 45 K day for us in a matter of a week or two .
When I objected to some ridiculous expense ( bunting ? WTF ? ) , I was told I was wrong , or " did n't know what I was talking about " and , unless I wanted a big fight , I shut up right there .
Trust me , when I balked at the cost of flowers , I was nearly decapitated .
Nearly all of this , I was told , was " What she always wanted " .
Well , I always wanted 15 playboy bunnies oiled up on a water bed in the horniest state known to womankind , which I think might have actually cost LESS , but I was pretty sure it was n't going to happen .
I hit the ceiling when I saw the guestlist .
225 . I barely know 225 people , let alone want to feed them and watch them get drunk while my savings account cries to me over the phone " You have ZERO dollars and 22 cents " .
Who is this ?
That ?
A bartender you know ?
I do n't even LIKE that girl !
One night , I told her this :
You know what , you 're going to have about as much fun , possibly more , if I do n't show up at this thing .
She laughed .
So I bailed .
Yup , I packed my shit and hit the door , a good 4 months prior to the date of my pre-planned , ever - priced , heavily adorned demise .
I called it off , packed my shit and left .
And I have never looked back .
Oh , we had a big talk .
It was about as much fun as you 'd expect .
I got my hair blown back for an hour or so , but I was already numb .
She 'd been yelling at me about this and that for so long , I could n't tell anymore when she was mad or not .
Maybe the hardest part was that I was having incredible sucess , in lots of things , while all this was happening .
Musically , professionaly - things were really coming together for me .
And she could n't be pleased .
In the end , it 's her loss , but I 've always wondered what the fuck she was thinking .
The moral to this story ?
Engagement Ring - $ 3800.00 ( never got it back ) Non-Refundable Deposits - $ 5200.00 ( all my money ) Moving Expenses - $ 750.00 Being Single again - Priceless .
Every Wednesday is Tip Day .
This Wednesday : Tips …for using Ziploc bags .
For years , I hesitated to use Ziploc bags .
I ’ve always loved them , but it seemed very wasteful to buy a bunch of plastic bags , especially because so often they 'd just be thrown away .
( I knew I would never be one of those people who will wash and re-use Ziploc bags . )
Then , when we moved , we made a big run to a discount store to stock up on all sorts of supplies : cleaners , trash bags , light - bulbs , and Ziploc bags .
We bought all sizes : the prototypical “ sandwich ” size , the cunning , small “ snack ” size , the gallon , and my favorite , the two - gallon .
With all those Ziploc bags in the house , I caved .
I could n’t resist all that handiness .
Now I use Ziploc bags all the time .
Some suggestions :
1 . Whenever I get a new electronic gizmo , I start a special Ziploc bag for it .
I label the bag with the name of the device ( “ Vaio laptop , " “ digital camera ” ) and the date .
Inside the bag , I put all wires , disks , manuals — all the paraphernalia that come with a new piece of equipment .
I keep all these bags in one large box in a closet .
I rarely need this stuff , but when I do , I know exactly where to find it .
Also , if I get rid of the device , I can also get rid of the associated equipment .
No more mysterious power cords that I 'm scared to toss .
2 . I kept messing up travel toiletry bags , because bottles of sunscreen or saline solution would explode and coat the inside with goo .
Now I use Ziploc bags when I travel .
Not very elegant , but they do the job , and if something spills , I can just get a new bag instead of trying to scrub toothpaste off the interior of a proper toiletry bag .
3 . My pet peeve is toys that do n’t come with their own container .
The loose pieces fly everywhere and drive me crazy .
Now , I swoop down the moment a new toy is opened and make a labeled Ziploc bag to keep together the many pieces of the Barbie hairdressing set , the Legos that build a hospital , the puzzling yet clearly highly educational set of scarves and clips that my parents gave us .
4 . Anything that scatters needs a Ziploc bag .
Open packages of picture - hanging nails ; magic markers , Q - Tips after I stepped on the Q - Tip container and crushed it …anything .
5 . I made a “ fun bag ” for the Little Girl — a Ziploc bag filled with small toys to grab whenever we head out the door to a restaurant , a friend ’s house , a car trip .
That way , we always have a bunch of interesting things to divert her .
Now , as it happens , someone recently gave the Big Girl a zippy , clear backpack , so I ’ve transferred the fun bag from a Ziploc into the backpack ; it looks so much more fun .
But the Ziploc bag worked just as well .
6 . I have a bunch of labeled little Ziploc bags filled with keys : “ spare keys to my office , ” “ key to turn off the alarm , ” etc .
There ’s nothing more aggravating than an unidentified key , and I was having trouble figuring out a simple way to keep them labeled and organized .
7 . It may seem redundant to have several grades of Ziploc bags , but it ’s far more satisfying to use them when the size is right ( and I know that I , at least , am far more likely to keep up an organizational system that feels satisfying ) .
Nothing ’s worse than an overstuffed plastic bag that wo n’t seal properly , or a big plastic bag that takes up far more room than needed , for the handful of binder clips or thumbtacks it holds .
No , I ’m not in the pay of Ziploc .
And I have to admit , using the bags still feels illicit — especially the fancy ones with the zip - top .
But I imagine that the sense of indulgence is part of the reason I love them so much .
Ditch the ' Experts '
Grading pundits and prognosticators :
More famous = less accurate .
( FORTUNE Magazine ) -
You have been a world - class sap for years .
Why ?
For listening to the economic and political forecasts of experts .
We in the media have been irresponsible fools for reporting those forecasts .
And the experts themselves ?
Delusional egomaniacs -- and maybe even con artists .
I did n't always think this way .
But I 've been reading a book that marshals powerful evidence to make this case .
For all of us in the world of business , economics , and capital markets -- a world that often turns on the judgments of experts -- the question is whether we 're brave enough to face these uncomfortable facts .
The book is Expert Political Judgment : How Good Is It ? How Can We Know ? by Philip E. Tetlock , a professor at the University of California at Berkeley .
It summarizes the results of a truly amazing research project :
Over seven years Tetlock got a wide range of experts and nonexperts to answer carefully constructed questions about the likelihood of specific future events .
He ended up with a staggering 82,361 forecasts , expressed in quantifiable form and thus able to be analyzed deeply .
His definition of " political judgment " included plenty of topics that you and I would call economic , such as government spending and national economic performance .
Tetlock then cranked all those numbers through every kind of statistical thresher , flail , and grinder you can imagine , and the result was clear : Experts do n't actually exist .
Specifically , experts were no better than nonexperts at predicting the future .
They were n't even as good as computer programs that merely extrapolate the past .
The best experts could not explain more than 20 % of the variability in outcomes , but crude algorithms could explain 25 % to 30 % , and sophisticated algorithms could explain 47 % .
Consider what this means .
On all sorts of questions you care about -- Where will the Dow be in two years ?
Will the federal deficit balloon as baby - boomers retire ?-- your judgment is as good as the experts ' .
Not almost as good .
Every bit as good .
Which is not to say that experts are no different from you and me .
They 're very different .
For example , they 're much more confident in their predictions than nonexperts are , though they obviously have no reason to be .
For example , the members of the American Political Science Association predicted in August 2000 that a Gore victory was a slam dunk .
Experts can also give far more reasons for their predictions than nonexperts can .
Their vast erudition lets them explain at daunting length why something will or wo n't happen .
Not that all those reasons make the forecasts one bit better .
The question that screams out from the data is why the world keeps believing that " experts " exist at all .
In large part , the answer is human nature .
We desperately want to believe the world is not just a big game of dice , that things happen for good reasons and wise people can figure it all out .
It may not be so ; a school of researchers known as radical skeptics presents impressive evidence that the world is totally random , or at least that we humans are eternally unable to figure it out .
But most of us can't bear to believe that , so we cling to the notion of experts .
Another part of the answer is especially troubling for the media .
The awfulness of Tetlock 's experts was almost uniform whether they had doctorates or bachelor 's degrees , lots of experience or little , access to classified data or none .
He found but one consistent differentiator : fame .
The more famous the experts , the worse they performed .
And of course it 's those of us in TV , radio , newspapers , magazines , and on the web who bestow that fame .
We 're now reaching a deeper answer to the question of why experts persist .
The media like experts , the more confident the better , though Tetlock found that more confident means less reliable .
The media like them because you , the consumers of media , like them .
Experts like to appear in the media because it pays .
Tetlock 's conclusion : " The three principals -- authoritative - sounding experts , the ratings - conscious media , and the attentive public -- may thus be locked in a symbiotic triangle . "
It 's never too late for a good New Year 's resolution , so I propose that in the coming year , whenever any of us read or hear an expert opinion , or publish one , or issue one , we ask ourselves whether Tetlock might be onto something with this quietly withering conclusion about all of us in that triangle : " It is tempting to say they need each other too much to terminate a relationship merely because it is based on an illusion . "

Previously I wrote about 14 Reasons to Become More Conscious .
Now let ’s explore the how .
What does it mean to become more conscious ?
It is the progressive realization of conscious mastery over your mind .
The challenge is that it takes consciousness to grow consciousness .
But you need n’t worry about this because you already have the seed .
Think of it like fire .
You have a flame , and you want to turn that flame into a huge blaze .
How do you do it ?
You add fuel .
The following list includes examples of how you can add fuel to your flame of consciousness to become a raging inferno of consciousness .
Well , OK , the analogy sort of falls apart there , but you get the idea .
So here are 10 ways to raise your consciousness :
1. Truth
Truth raises your consciousness .
Falsehood lowers it .
First , accept the truth .
Whatever you ’re afraid to know lowers your consciousness .
Step on the scale to see how much you weigh .
Have a long talk with your spouse about the status of your relationship .
Take a deep look at your career .
In every case accept the outcome .
Do n’t just acknowledge the current status and dismiss it .
Really accept it as the truth .
Think about what it means for this to be true .
Also accept your feelings about the truth , whether you like them or not .
Secondly , speak the truth .
If honesty is a challenge for you , it ’s because you are n’t being honest enough with yourself .
Lies you tell others are shadowed by lies you tell yourself .
Take note of those areas where you feel incapable of genuine honesty , and dig deep enough to find out why .
You ’ll find that you uncover a part of yourself you ’ve been unwilling to accept .
You do n’t lie about the parts of yourself you accept 100 % .
The more you ’re able to accept and speak the truth , the more conscious you become .
Raise your consciousness by uncovering and dumping all traces of falsehood from your life .
Allow this to be a gradual process .
As your consciousness increases , genuine honesty will come more easily to you .
Yes , there may be consequences when you switch from lies and half - truths to the full truth , but highly conscious people know that crossing that bridge is well worth the effect .
A short - term adjustment is nothing compared to the joys of living honestly and openly .
It ’s so much easier and less stressful to be yourself and allow others to do the same .
Not everyone will appreciate the real you , especially if they ’ve grown accustomed to a false version , but that wo n’t matter once you accept and appreciate yourself .
2. Courage
Courage raises your consciousness .
Cowardice lowers it .
Courage is the gatekeeper between unconscious growth and conscious growth .
As long as you remain on the unconscious side , life will keep throwing problems at you until you step up and take charge .
When you face your fear , the fear vanishes , and problems transform into opportunities .
But when you run from your problems , your fear only grows .
A powerful guiding principle to adopt is , “ Whatever I fear , I must face . ”
The more fears you face down , the more conscious you become .
As you master this lesson , eventually courage becomes less necessary .
Once you develop the courage to face any fear life throws at you , you stop attracting so many fear - based experiences into your life .
This is why courage is the dividing line between unconscious growth and conscious growth .
The mastery of courage gives you the power to decide how you ’ll grow instead of being a victim of the whims of fate .
3. Compassion
Compassion raises your consciousness .
Cruelty lowers it .
A great way to become more conscious is to search for signs of unconscious cruelty and disconnection in your life .
This can be very difficult to do since it also requires courage .
We naturally resist facing our own cruelty , but it ’s there just waiting to be uncovered .
Compassion is the root of unconditional love , a feeling of connectedness with everything that exists .
Do you feel connected to yourself ?
To others ?
To animals ?
To all living things ?
To everything that exists ?
The more you develop this connection , the more conscious and aware you become .
4. Desire
Desire raises your consciousness .
Apathy lowers it .
When you get clear about what you want , such as by setting a goal , you raise your consciousness .
Clarity focuses your mind and gives you the power to think and act intelligently .
You can feel this effect whenever you think about something you definitely want .
On the other hand , when your desire is unclear , your consciousness is muddled .
Your thoughts lack focus and direction , and you merely spin your wheels .
Strive to become more clear about what you truly desire most , and your consciousness will expand .
5. Attention
Attention raises your consciousness .
Distraction lowers it .
Improving your ability to concentrate will make you more conscious .
Pick up a rock and give it your full and complete attention , and notice what happens .
But allow your mind to be riddled with distractions , and your consciousness will sink .
A distracted mind is a powerless mind .
Meditation is a great way to practice attention and concentration .
Sit quietly , breathe deeply , and focus your mind as you do your best to tune out distracting thoughts .
This is simple to learn , but it can take a lifetime to master .
6. Knowledge
Knowledge raises your consciousness .
Ignorance lowers it .
First and foremost , know thyself .
Think deeply about your life , and keep a journal to record your thoughts .
Ask questions to which you do n’t know the answer , and then search for those answers .
Look around you as well , and soak up knowledge like a sponge .
Interact with your environment with a sense of curiosity and wonder .
Study it .
Learn from it .
Experiment with it .
Strive to understand reality , including your role in it , as accurately as possible .
The more accurate your beliefs about reality are , the more conscious you become .
7. Reason
Reason raises your consciousness .
Irrationality lowers it .
Logic is a powerful tool of consciousness when used correctly .
It lends structure and substance to thought .
However , the great challenge of logic is the avoidance of false assumptions .
A single false assumption can throw off a lifetime of otherwise logical conclusions .
So challenge all of your beliefs , and never have too much certainty about those that rest on clouds .
8. Conscious people
Conscious people raise your consciousness .
Unconscious people lower it .
Seek out others you perceive to be at a higher level of consciousness than you are .
Talk to them , ask questions , and enjoy their presence .
Allow their ideas and awareness to infect you , and you ’ll find yourself expanding in all directions .
You ’ll become more honest , more courageous , more compassionate , and so on .
But spend time with people at a lower level of consciousness , and you ’ll gradually sink to their level .
Their thoughts will infect you as well , causing you to become more dishonest , more fearful , more apathetic , etc .
Strive to find a balance between spending time with those who raise your consciousness vs. spending time with those you can help .
Learn from those who are a little more conscious , and help those who are a little less conscious than you .
In this manner you serve the highest good of all , expanding consciousness everywhere .
9. Energy
Energy raises your consciousness .
Disease lowers it .
Take care of your physical body , for it is your primary means of interacting with the world .
Energy gives you an ongoing flow of vital life experiences .
But without energy you starve your consciousness .
Eat with an awareness of what you ’re consuming .
Exercise with an awareness of how you ’re affecting your body and mind .
Before putting anything in your body , consider its effect on your energy , not just in the short term but in the long term as well .
Always ask yourself , “ Will this produce energy or disease ? ”
10 . Intention
The intention to raise your consciousness raises it .
The intention to lower your consciousness lowers it .
Consciousness has the capacity to self - expand or self - contract , just as you have the capacity to grow or to commit suicide .
In any given moment , you have the freedom of choice .
By genuinely voicing the intention ( or by offering the prayer ) , “ I intend to become more conscious and aware , ” you will initiate the expansion of your consciousness .
Holding the intention to improve in any of the previous nine areas will yield a similar effect .
Alternatively , you are perfectly free to lower your consciousness at any time .
While it ’s unlikely you would choose to do so directly , you can achieve the same effect indirectly by lowering your performance in any of the previous nine areas .
By choosing to lie , to succumb to fear , to commit acts of cruelty , to remain ignorant , and so on , you put out the intention to lower your consciousness .
And in so doing , you initiate a process that will attract more falsehood , fear , cruelty , ignorance , etc. into your life .
Every thought you hold serves to either expand or contract your consciousness .
There is no neutral .
So choose wisely .

An Introduction to Using Patterns in Web Design by Ryan Singer , October 5 2004
The biggest challenge for web designers is the unthinkably huge number of possible ways to solve any given problem .
We usually do n't think of this because we have our habits and traditions to fall back on , but there are literally billions of possible pixel combinations for each page we make .
There is a better way to manage this vast complexity than by making big decisions up front and hoping for the best .
To make better sites — sites that are functional , beautiful , and " usable " — we have to break our design problems up into small independent chunks based on the real issues within our requirements .
Christopher Alexander , who came up with this stuff , calls these chunks patterns .
I 'm going to show you how to sidestep your habits and assumptions and use patterns to make better design decisions .
A lot of fancy stuff has been written about patterns .
To be simple and clear in this introduction , I 'll just call them chunks .
Step one : List your bits
Start by making a list of all the specific bits that must fit together for the web page to succeed as a whole .
By " bits " I mean any kind of design consideration .
So this includes what info the page should get across , what actions it should support , important attitudes of the users , and so on .
Do not prioritize , group , or categorize .
If you start by grouping and organizing you 'll just end up with your original habits and preferences in the end .
Here are the bits for a " My Account " page that I recently designed :
Company info Insurance info for company My ( current user ) info Other users on this account My sales rep contact info Current account plan Link to change search preferences Date account was created People rarely view or change insurance info Any user can edit anything except other users ' info Changing password is the most likely action People might come here to change search preferences ( which are on a separate page )
Do this on paper if you 're working on your own .
It 's faster .
Step two :
Figure out which bits relate to each other
Some bits affect each other ( like 7 and 12 ) while others are pretty independent ( 1 and 9 ) .
Some bits will work out better if you think of them together and some bits will be the same regardless of the others .
Put the bits into chunks based on whether they impact each other — not based on any conceptual or graphic ideas .
A : 1 , 10
B : 2 , 9 , 10
C : 3 , 10 , 11
D : 4 , 10
E: 5
F : 6 , 10
G : 7 , 12
H : 8
Let 's look at C for example :
3 . My ( current user ) info
10 .
Any user can edit anything except other user 's info
11 . Changing password is most likely action
The password ( 11 ) is part of the user info ( 3 ) and this can all be edited ( 10 ) .
Notice we 're not building down from our assumptions .
We 're building up from what we know for sure .
Step three : Prioritize
Decide which chunks are most important from a functional perspective .
In other words , decide which chunks matter most to people .
It is n't necessary to reorder the whole list .
Just figure out which chunks are the most important and group them loosely :
Most important : C , A , G , E
Necessary : B , D , F
Nice to have : H
Step four : Design each chunk
Since we grouped all the directly related bits into chunks , we can design the chunks independently without worrying about conflicts .
This idea is the heart of Alexander 's patterns ( which I 'm calling chunks ) .
You can get them right on their own and then fuse them together .
Start with the high priority chunks and move down :
Sketch C Sketch A Sketch G
The blinky lines around G satisfy 12 by showing that it should stand out .
( " 12 . People might come here to change search preferences " ) .
Sketch E Sketch B
In my shorthand I 've indicated that the link " Show / hide insurance info " will show or hide the block below it with Javascript .
This satisfies 9 ( " People rarely view or change insurance info " ) .
Sketch D
This chunk can be duplicated for each additional user .
Sketch F Sketch H
Notice how the above sketches use scale and weight to show priority .
These decisions will guide you in the next step .
Step five :
Put the chunks together
After the chunks are sketched , piece them together into a whole .
Think about the constraints that went into the sketches .
Think about priority .
Think about balance .
Do your design thing .
Here I did two phases .
First the rough layout :
Does this remind you of a wireframe ?
Next I did a loose sketch to guide my HTML prototype :
Step six :
Make it real
When you build the real thing you sometimes see that what worked on paper just is n't quite right on screen .
In the final design I shifted the Company data ( A ) around for better balance and switched the sidebar ( E , F , H ) from the left to the right .
I could tweak these chunks independently because they were designed independently .
Have a look at the result :
So much for chunks
In this article I treated patterns in a very simplified way , as chunks .
You might be wondering well what are patterns then ?
Patterns play a significant role in architecture , urban planning , and recently software design .
In all of these cases a pattern is a way of dealing with a system of interacting forces .
When you find that you often design a sidebar for helpful notes , details and references , you 're using a pattern .
The interacting forces are the requirements of those little bits and how they relate to the main content , and the sidebar is the best way to deal with them .
For more on design patterns , see the links below or Google away .

Following various comments
I 've made about deficiencies in technology marketing and my disagreement with Doc Searl 's provocations , I 've been rightly harassed into prescribing some solutions to my complaints .
So I give you Geek Marketing 101 .
It is so named because I see amongst many geeks a pervasive misunderstanding and consequent distrust of what marketing is , and a failure to recognise that much technology marketing is no longer geek to geek since complex products are increasingly being bought by non-geeks .
Of course , these observations are equally applicable to geek to geek and non -geek businesses .
Marketing is a combination of elements that creates the environment in which it is possible to meet a customer need ( starting right back at product development ) .
Promotion and sales are just sub-sets of marketing .
Successful technology marketing must translate the creations of the uncommunicative into the needs of the untechnical .
Spin is not good marketing .
Lucid two - way communication is .
Reductive marketing that simplifies ideas does not undersell your complex creation .
It facilitates an entree to your world .
You can't have passionate users until they start using
Think of the " product " in terms of what it does , not how it does it .
You may be interested in the latter , but your users generally are n't .
Portable computer memory is not a difficult concept to enunciate , yet flash drive and USB drive nomenclature is predicated on technological aspects not the actual function .
Long words confuse , do n't they ?
Think of the " product " in terms of what most people will be happy doing with it and not in the myriad possibilities it offers .
You may think speed and multiple settings are hot , but outside the lab such attributes may not provide the greatest satisfaction .
Simple , intuitive interfaces will .
Regular people do n't read the manual .
It 's too big ( see 5 ) , too complicated ( see 3 ) and thus incomprehensible .
It 's not that people are averse to science and technology - they 're averse to being made to feel helpless .
The demand for books that simplify science is huge the world over .
Your manual is marketing .
In the absence of all of the above , your users inevitably need help .
A technical support department speaking in non-technical , hand - holding language transforms their purchase from waste of money to life - enhancing boon and is the greatest marketing tool you have .
Do n't allow your misguided prejudices about advertising and snake - oil to infect your approach and damage sales .
People hate hype , spin and unfulfilled expectations .
They do not hate having their needs met ( see 1 ) .
They 're not Luddites , but nor are they geeks - that 's what you 're paid to be .
However , they often hate how technology products make them feel because blinding with science is as bad as baffling with bullshit .
As the conversations develop , the users comprehend your products better and you better understand their needs .
With increased confidence , they utilise more and more of your geekiness and , with increased awareness , you are better able to adapt to their behaviours .
They feel more warmly about geeks and you may get the chance to buy them a drink .
That does n't sound so bad , does it ?

At SxSW a few weeks ago I spoke about starting a side business instead of quitting your job ( audio in MP3 ) .
Build something on the side .
Give it a go and see what happens .
The constraint of less time will help you focus on what ’s important .
If there ’s something there , then take it to the next step .
It ’s hard to point to a business that launched huge and has been successful .
Most of the big winners in our industry started really small and grew big over time .
eBay , Craigslist , Yahoo , Google — these were all started on the side .
They were n’t funded up , hyped up , and launched huge .
They started really small and grew organically .
One of the real benefits of starting a side business is obscurity .
To be more specific , failing in obscurity .
When people talk about business they do n’t like to talk about failure .
But in business you ’ll fail more than you ’ll succeed .
So it ’s worth talking about .
The beauty of starting a side business is that you can fail in obscurity .
Many people worry that they ’ll languish in obscurity .
Do n’t worry about having a great idea that no one knows about .
Worry about having a bad idea that everyone knows about .
When no one knows about you you can make mistakes quietly .
Learn at your own pace .
Fail without the fear of failure .
Failing in obscurity helps protect your ego and you ’ll need your ego later on when you are successful .
Confidence is vital to success and if you fail big on your first try it ’s going to take years for your ego to recover .
Fail small now so you can succeed big later .
So embrace obscurity .
It ’s your friend .
Launch small , make mistakes in the shadows , get better , and then seek out the spotlight when you ’re ready .
My jaw dropped when I heard that presidential candidate Clinton dismissed the unified opinion of every economist on the planet and supported the gas tax rebate .
The rebate is John McCain ’s proposal .
I think that proves both of them are unqualified to be president .
Obama is n’t much better when it comes to sorting out economic policy from pandering , although he did avoid that particular landmine .
So I decided to start my own political party .
I call it the Economics Party .
There ’s no paperwork involved , and you do n’t even have to stop being a Democrat or Republican or whatever to join .
The Economics Party wo n’t have its own candidates .
All we ’ll do is agree to vote for the candidate with the best long term economic policy , according to the consensus of leading economists .
The Economics Party would ignore superstition in its decisions .
Here are a few things I think would end up on the platform , assuming most leading economists agree :
- Withdraw from Iraq
- More aggressive energy policy ( back off on ethanol )
- More sane tax policies
- Limited government
- Legalize doctor assisted suicide
- Keep abortion legal
- Decriminalize marijuana
- Strong education policy
We ’d make some exceptions for humanitarian reasons .
For example , if a natural disaster hits a poor part of the country , it might be cheaper to let everyone die , but you have to put life ahead of money at some point .
The platform might look Libertarian , but it has differences .
For example , a Libertarian might be opposed to the government making people wear motorcycle helmets .
The Economics Party would just look at the likely higher cost of insurance in a helmet - free world and decide on that basis .
I do n’t know which way it would come out .
The Economics Party would be committed to changing its policy recommendation whenever the facts warranted .
We ’re pro flip - flop when it makes sense .
In other words , our brains function properly .
If thirty or forty million people join the Economics Party , all major candidates would have to start paying attention to the consensus of economists .
At the very least , voters would become more aware of what the leading economists think makes sense .
That seems like a good thing .
Are you in ?
But the country ’s G.D.P. grew 8 percent in 2005 , according to the International Monetary Fund , and is predicted to increase by 12 percent this year .
Cotton and other agricultural products have traditionally been the engines of the economy here , but the new growth comes largely because Sudan has substantially increased its crude oil production to 512,000 barrels a day — a drop compared with Saudi Arabia ’s or Iran ’s , but enough to bring billions of dollars to a country that until recently was one of the poorest on earth .
“ Oil and real estate investment , primarily in urban areas , is really what ’s driving the economy , ” said Michael Kevane , an associate professor of economics at Santa Clara University .
“ There ’s no doubt about that . ”
The boom is also strengthening the government ’s hand at home .
Over the past few years , Mr. Bashir has been on an infrastructure binge , pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into roads , bridges , power plants , hospitals and schools , projects that tend to boost any government ’s popularity .
Mr. Bashir seems to desperately need it , with many people across the country , not just in Darfur , openly rebelling against his rule .
Mr. Bashir , an army general , seized power in 1989 through a military coup , and among the biggest beneficiaries of these boom times have been his troops .
Ms. Mahdi said more than 70 percent of the government ’s share of oil profits is spent on defense .
A government priority is to manufacture guns and ammunition domestically , in case external supplies are cut off .
Despite all the new materialism , Sudan still marches to a martial tune .
Army officers enjoy special status , foreign visitors must register with the police and schoolchildren are required to wear camouflage uniforms to class .
But the boom is changing much about society , from the careers people pursue , to the music they listen to , even what they eat .
The traditional meal of ful , a bean stew eaten for breakfast and lunch , is giving way to kebabs , yogurt , hamburgers and hot dogs .
According to polls , tens of millions of Americans believe that the government was behind the 9/11 attacks .
But 2 more conspiracy theories were pretty well debunked recently .
(1) That the government shot down United Flight 93 .
(2) That the air force was ordered to “ stand down ” on 9/11 .
Michael Bronner , a producer of the movie United 93 , asked for the NORAD 9/11/01 transcripts , & published excerpts in Vanity Fair .
He actually provides sound clips — here .
It seems that NORAD was unable to track or intercept any of the planes before they crashed .
At one point they believed that the White House was targeted , and , incredibly , the air force planes were unable to find the White House :
Nasypany : “ Goddammit !
I ca n’t even protect my N.C.A. [ National Capital Area ] . ”
[ A ] dramatic chase towards the White House continues .
Two more problems emerge : the controllers canâ€™t find the White House on their dated equipment , and they have trouble communicating with the Langley fighters .
CITINO : 15 miles .
One - five â€¦ noise level please â€ ¦
It ’s got to be low .
Quit 2 - 6 , when able say altitude of the aircraft.â€ ¦
Did we get a Z - track [ coordinates ] up for the White House ?
HUCKABONE : They ’re workin’ on it .
CITINO : Okay .
Hey , what ’s this Bravo 0 - 0 - 5 [ unidentified target ] ?
FOX : We ’re trying to get the Z - point .
Weâ€ ™re trying to find it .
HUCKABONE : I do n’t even know where the White House is .
Conspiracy theorists still have some material to work with , though .
On 9/11/01 there was a NORAD hijacking exercise , which seems to have caused some confusion when the real hijackings occurred :
BOSTON CENTER : Hi. Boston Center T.M.U. [ Traffic Management Unit ] , we have a problem here .
We have a hijacked aircraft headed towards New York , and we need you guys to , we need someone to scramble some F - 16s or something up there , help us out .
POWELL : Is this real - world or exercise ?
BOSTON CENTER : No , this is not an exercise , not a test .
WATSON : What ?
DOOLEY : Whoa !
WATSON : What was that ?
ROUNTREE : Is that real - world ?
DOOLEY : Real - world hijack .
WATSON : Cool !
FOX : I ’ve never seen so much real - world stuff happen during an exercise .
NASYPANY : This is what I got .
Possible news that a 737 just hit the World Trade Center .
This is a real - world .
â €” Is this explosion part of that that we ’re lookin’ at now on TV ?
â €” Yes .
â €” Jesus â€ ¦
â €” And thereâ€™s a possible second hijack alsoâ€ ” a United Airlines â€ ¦
â €” Two planes ?â€ ¦
â €” Get the f*ck out â€ ¦
â € ” I think this is a damn input , to be honest .
The last line â€ ” “ I think this is a damn input ” â€ ” is a reference to the exercise , meaning a simulations input .
Also surprising is ( 1 ) that the terrorists knew to turn off the planes ’ transponders , and ( 2 ) that this succeeded in making the planes invisible to NORAD .
The Vanity Fair article suggests that civilian air traffic controllers had a better understanding of what was going on than did NORAD ; even talking to each - other on the phone might have cleared up the confusion , but this did n’t happen .
No conspiracy theory is necessary to make the anti-imperial argument : Â ethics aside , a government that can’t find the president ’s house during an attack should n’t be abroad shaking up hornets ’ nests .

" The Saudis are very happy with oil at $ 55 per barrel , but they 're also nervous , " a Western diplomat in Riyadh told me in May , referring to the price that prevailed then .
( Like all the diplomats I spoke to , he insisted on speaking anonymously because of the sensitivities of relations with Saudi Arabia . )
" They do n't know where this magic line has moved to .
Is it now $ 65 ?
Is it $ 75 ?
Is it $ 80 ?
They do n't want to find out , because if you did have oil move that far north . . . the chain reaction can come back to a price collapse again . "
High prices can have another unfortunate effect for producers .
When crude costs $ 10 a barrel or even $ 30 a barrel , alternative fuels are prohibitively expensive .
For example , Canada has vast amounts of tar sands that can be rendered into heavy oil , but the cost of doing so is quite high .
Yet those tar sands and other alternatives , like bioethanol , hydrogen fuel cells and liquid fuel from natural gas or coal , become economically viable as the going rate for a barrel rises past , say , $ 40 or more , especially if consuming governments choose to offer their own incentives or subsidies .
So even if high prices do n't cause a recession , the Saudis risk losing market share to rivals into whose nonfundamentalist hands Americans would much prefer to channel their energy dollars .
A concerted push for greater energy conservation in the United States , which consumes one - quarter of the world 's oil ( mostly to fuel our cars , as gasoline ) , would hurt producing nations , too .
Basically , any significant reduction in the demand for oil would be ruinous for OPEC members , who have little to offer the world but oil ; if a substitute can be found , their future is bleak .
Another Western diplomat explained the problem facing the Saudis : " You want to have the price as high as possible without sending the consuming nations into a recession and at the same time not have the price so high that it encourages alternative technologies . "
From the American standpoint , one argument in favor of conservation and a switch to alternative fuels is that by limiting oil imports , the United States and its Western allies would reduce their dependence on a potentially unstable region .
( In fact , in an effort to offset the risks of relying on the Saudis , America 's top oil suppliers are Canada and Mexico . )
In addition , sending less money to Saudi Arabia would mean less money in the hands of a regime that has spent the past few decades doling out huge amounts of its oil revenue to mosques , madrassas and other institutions that have fanned the fires of Islamic radicalism .
The oil money has been dispensed not just by the Saudi royal family but by private individuals who benefited from the oil boom -- like Osama bin Laden , whose ample funds , probably eroded now , came from his father , a construction magnate .
Without its oil windfall , Saudi Arabia would have had a hard time financing radical Islamists across the globe .
For the Saudis , the political ramifications of reduced demand for its oil would not be negligible .
The royal family has amassed vast personal wealth from the country 's oil revenues .
If , suddenly , Saudis became aware that the royal family had also failed to protect the value of the country 's treasured resource , the response could be severe .
The mere admission that Saudi reserves are not as impressively inexhaustible as the royal family has claimed could lead to hard questions about why the country , and the world , had been misled .
With the death earlier this month of the long - ailing King Fahd , the royal family is undergoing another period of scrutiny ; the new king , Abdullah , is in his 80's , and the crown prince , his half - brother Sultan , is in his 70's , so the issue of generational change remains to be settled .
As long as the country is swimming in petro - dollars -- even as it is paying off debt accrued during its lean years -- everyone is relatively happy , but that can change .
One diplomat I spoke to recalled a comment from Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani , the larger - than - life Saudi oil minister during the 1970's : " The Stone Age did n't end for lack of stone , and the oil age will end long before the world runs out of oil . "
Until now , the Saudis had an excess of production capacity that allowed them , when necessary , to flood the market to drive prices down .
They did that in 1990 , when the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait eliminated not only Kuwait 's supply of oil but also Iraq's .
The Saudis functioned , as they always had , as the central bank of oil , releasing supply to the market when it was needed and withdrawing supply to keep prices from going lower than the cartel would have liked .
In other words , they controlled not only the price of oil but their own destiny as well .
" That is what the world has called on them to do before -- turn on the taps to produce more and get prices down , " a senior Western diplomat in Riyadh told me recently .
" Decreasing prices used to keep out alternative fuels .
I do n't see how they 're able to do that anymore .
This is a huge change , and it is a big step in the move to whatever is coming next .
That 's what 's really happening . "
Without the ability to flood the markets with oil , the Saudis are resorting to flooding the market with promises ; it is a sort of petro- jawboning .
That 's why Ali al - Naimi , the oil minister , told his Washington audience that Saudi Arabia has embarked on a crash program to raise its capacity to 12.5 million barrels a day by 2009 and even higher in the years after that .
Naimi is not unlike a factory manager who needs to promise the moon to his valuable clients , for fear of losing or alarming them .
He has no choice .
The moment he says anything bracing , the touchy energy markets will probably panic , pushing prices even higher and thereby hastening the onset of recession , a switch to alternative fuels or new conservation efforts -- or all three .
Just a few words of honest caution could move the markets ; Naimi 's speeches are followed nearly as closely in the financial world as those of Alan Greenspan .
I journeyed to Saudi Arabia to interview Naimi and other senior officials , to get as far beyond their prepared remarks as might be possible .
Although I was allowed to see Ras Tanura , my interview requests were denied .
I was invited to visit Aramco 's oil museum in Dhahran , but that is something a Saudi schoolchild can do on a field trip .
It was a " show but do n't tell " policy .
I was able to speak about production issues only with Ibrahim al - Muhanna , the oil ministry spokesman , who reluctantly met me over coffee in the lobby of my hotel in Riyadh .
He defended Saudi Arabia 's refusal to share more data , noting that the Saudis are no different from most oil producers .

THE ugly little mid-summer war that has just ended in Lebanon spilled over into the parliaments , streets , television studios and dinner parties of Europe .
By and large , Israel got the worst of it .
The Council of Europe said that Israel 's response to Hizbullah 's cross- border attacks was “ disproportionate ” and accused Israel of “ indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets ” .
Romano Prodi , Italy 's prime minister , called Israel 's reaction “ excessive ” .
In Norway , Jostein Gaarder , the author of “ Sophie 's World ” , accused Israel of ethnic cleansing and murdering children , and said that the Jewish state had forfeited its right to exist .
In many capitals , anti-war protesters marched under Hizbullah flags .
When Britain 's Tony Blair tried to explain things from Israel 's point of view — and failed to call for an immediate ceasefire — his political stock took another tumble .
Mr Gaarder was prodded into a half - hearted apology .
But the truth is that , far from being extreme , these criticisms of Israel convey the mood of millions of Europeans , rooted in what polls suggest is a hardening attitude .
A YouGov poll in Britain , taken in the first two weeks of the conflict , found 63 % of respondents saying that the Israeli response to Hizbullah 's attack was “ disproportionate ” ; a similar German poll had 75 % saying so .
Such reactions reflect a wider European view of Israel that contrasts sharply with America's .
In a Pew Global Attitudes survey earlier this year , far more Europeans sympathised with the Palestinians than with Israel ( see chart ) .
These findings come on top of a European Union poll in 2003 that had 59 % of Europeans considering Israel as a greater menace to world peace than Iran , North Korea and Pakistan .
Why has Europe become so reflexively anti-Israel , just when America has become so reflexively pro-Israel ?
Europe has no equivalent of America 's powerful AIPAC Israeli lobby , and it also has a disgruntled ( and growing ) Muslim population .
But neither is enough to explain all the difference in attitude .
Indeed , many Muslims in Europe now feel beleaguered and can only dream of wielding AIPAC 's clout .
Some Americans blame rising anti-Semitism in Europe , which they also attribute in part to its growing Muslim population .
But there is a difference between being anti-Semitic and being anti-Israel .
And in any case , it is not obvious that anti-Semitism is a big factor .
In central Europe , for example , there seems to be both greater anti-Semitism and more support for Israel .
And some polls suggest that more Americans think Jews have “ too much influence ” in their country than do Europeans .
It is also often the right in Europe , linked with anti-Semitism in the past , that is most supportive of Israel today .
Britain 's Conservative Party , for instance , not always known for its admiration of Jews or Israel , is now the most pro-Israel party .
In Italy , which invented fascism , Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia and Gianfranco Fini 's formerly neo-fascist National Alliance , are more pro-Israel than the government .
In Spain , the centre - right opposition was highly critical of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero , the Socialist prime minister , when he donned an Arab headscarf to show solidarity during the Lebanon war .
Countries that were most culpable in the Holocaust tend to be stauncher supporters of Israel — especially Germany .
What was then West Germany became the main financial backer of the new Jewish state six decades ago , with a first payment of $ 865 m in 1952 .
Aid continued throughout the 1960s , long before America became Israel 's main source of outside support .
This week 's decision to commit German troops to the peacekeeping force in Lebanon also reflects past guilt .
If the right ( and the Germans ) are doing penance , the left , which now controls many of Europe 's chanceries , and certainly much of its media , feels a sense of betrayal — which is why many now attack Israel with all the zeal of the convert .
Until the 1960s European socialists championed the cause of the Jews and Israel .
Mid-century socialists saw anti-Semitism and fascism as products of the right , so they became instinctively pro-Israel .
In the 1950s it was left - wing French governments that provided Israel with nuclear power and a modern air force .
This changed with the six - day war in 1967 , when Israel launched a pre-emptive strike to defeat the Jordanian , Egyptian and Syrian forces that seemed about to invade .
It was a stunning victory , but it led to the occupation of the West Bank , Gaza and Sinai .
To European socialists , who had rallied to the underdog Israel in 1967 , the Palestinians were now the oppressed and displaced .
Israel came to be seen as a neo - colonial regional superpower , not the plucky survivor of the Holocaust keeping powerful neighbours at bay .
In the decades after 1967 Israeli politics also changed .
The Labour Party , which had largely ruled Israel since 1948 , began to lose ground to right - wing parties , notably Likud .
European left - wingers , who had idealised Golda Meir 's Israel as a pioneering socialist collective of happy kibbutzniks , were shocked by what they saw as the militarisation and racism of Menachem Begin 's Israel — and they began a romance with the Palestinians instead .
This change can be chronicled over nearly a century in such liberal papers as Britain 's Guardian .
Chaim Weizmann , the first president of Israel , played a vital role in fostering the Guardian 's early advocacy of Zionism and Israel , but the paper is now one of Israel 's harshest critics .
The BBC , a bastion of the soft left establishment , has also been criticised for its bias against Israel , not least during the latest war .
Attitudes to America have also clouded European views , especially on the left .
As Israel has drawn closer to America in the past few decades , the left 's antipathy towards the behemoth of capitalism has spilled into dislike of Israel .
Public opinion in Turkey , the one Muslim country that was once pro-Israel , has turned against it in parallel with its turn against America , especially over the war in Iraq .
Emanuele Ottolenghi , an expert on Israel and Europe at Oxford University , argues that “ Europeans see Israel as the embodiment of the demons of their own past . ”
The European Union is supposed to have traded in war , nationalism and conflict for love , peace and federalism .
But Israel now reminds Europeans of darker forces and darker days .
Could attitudes change ?
It seems unlikely , not least because Israel is now so stridently critical of the Europeans , especially of their media .
In this area , at least , the transatlantic gap is widening .
SHANGHAI , Oct. 12 — China is planning to adopt a new law that seeks to crack down on sweatshops and protect workers ’ rights by giving labor unions real power for the first time since it introduced market forces in the 1980’s .
The move , which underscores the government ’s growing concern about the widening income gap and threats of social unrest , is setting off a battle with American and other foreign corporations that have lobbied against it by hinting that they may build fewer factories here .
The proposed rules are being considered after the Chinese Communist Party endorsed a new doctrine that will put greater emphasis on tackling the severe side effects of the country ’s remarkable growth .
Whether the foreign corporations will follow through on their warnings is unclear because of the many advantages of being in China — even with restrictions and higher costs that may stem from the new law .
It could go into effect as early as next May .
The COVID - 19 pandemic is affecting the lives of people around the world , but those in developing countries are likely to suffer the most in the face of this global crisis .
At the Center for International Development ( CID@Harvard ) , we see this as a call to action .
We are responding quickly in the following ways to implement solutions : we are collecting funding information ; we are connecting researchers , foundations , and policymakers to channel our resources ; and we are sharing the most up - to - date work of our experts to ensure it is reaching those who need it most .
SCIENTISTS have confirmed what fans of John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever have known all along : men with the best dance moves have the most sex appeal .
The finding lends support to the idea that dancing is a way to show off high quality genes and good health - both indicators of a top quality mate .
Charles Darwin was the first to suggest that dance was a courtship signal in animals , but there had been no studies of the relation of dance and genetic or physical quality in humans until now .
Alex Selby and Oliver Riordan , two mathematicians , with the help of a couple of computers , have shared a £ 1 m prize by solving the " Eternity " puzzle .
The puzzle was like an enormously difficult jigsaw .
There were 209 pieces , all different , but all made from equilateral triangles and half - triangles , as in the example on the left .
( All the pieces had the same total area as 6 triangles . )
The puzzle was to fit them together into the almost - regular 12 - sided figure aligned to a triangular grid , shown on the right .

The prize was announced when the puzzle hit the market in June 1999 .
It would go to the first correct solution submitted .
However , no solutions would be opened until September 2000 .
Until then , no - one would know for sure whether a winning solution had already been sent in .
In July 1999 , Alex was given a copy for his birthday by his brother .
" I did n't really think about it until November , " he says .
At that point , two friends came round , sneakily typed the pieces into his computer while he was out , and got him interested in it .
Oliver was then in the US , but when he returned in January , Alex recruited him to help with the puzzle .
It seemed that , putting pieces in by hand , one was likely to get stuck after about 150 pieces .
They found an internet discussion group on Eternity , where some people had already found ways of placing 206 or 207 of the 209 pieces .
" That was interesting , because it suggested the puzzle might be both doable and not yet done , " says Alex .
Of course , there was no guarantee that someone else had n't already solved it without posting to the group .
By 1 February , someone on the group announced a 208 - piece partial solution .
" Not only that - it had a piece - shaped hole , though not the right piece , of course .
If he could repeat that 1000 times , he would probably get a solution . "
By now it seemed that other solvers were getting close to a solution .
In fact , it turned out much later that one puzzler , Guenter Stertenbrink , had had a 208 - piece partial solution by September 1999 !
Alex and Oliver submitted their tiling on May 15th , but had to wait until September before they knew that it was the first .
Guenter is the only other puzzler known to have found a solution .
The puzzle 's inventor , Christopher Monckton , had created the puzzle by starting with a much larger set of pieces , and fitting them into the grid until it was full .
" Of course , this made it easy for him to find a tiling , since he had so many extra pieces to choose from , " says Alex .
" Effectively he 's planting a solution .
When he had filled up the shape , he threw away the pieces he had n't used , and the ones that were left formed the puzzle . "
Monckton had thought the money safe for a long time : " He thought the sheer size of Eternity would make it intractable . "
Indeed , exhaustively searching all possibilities would take so long that the fastest computer would have taken many millions of years to find a solution this way .
Yet Alex and Oliver took less than seven months to solve it , using mathematical analysis and computer searching .
So how did they do it ?
Unexpected bonus
They calculated that the large number of pieces would , suprprisingly , make the puzzle easier to solve rather than harder .
Monckton had run computer searches on much smaller versions of the puzzle , which convinced him that it would get harder as it got bigger .
For the cases he examined this was true , but Alex and Oliver realised that as the puzzle grew , it would get harder up to some critical size , after which it would start to get easier again .
Why does the critical size arise ?
Let 's see first why one should expect a large enough puzzle to have solutions at all .
Suppose there are N pieces in all .
We can imagine dividing the board into N rough areas and trying to put one piece in each , but not worrying if they overlap a bit .
We know the number of ways of choosing which piece to put in which area : it 's ( 1 × 2 × 3 × ... × N ) , usually written N !
For each piece , there is a number of triangles round its edge where it might overlap with another piece .
Indeed , the probability of it not overlapping might be some very small number , say p .
And we have a complete solution only if none of the tiles overlap , whose probability is a tiny pN .
On average , therefore , the number of solutions will be N ! ( pN ) .
When N is fairly small , N ! ( pN ) will be small - far less than 1 - and there are probably no solutions , other than the one planted by the inventor .
But N ! is a function that grows faster than kN for any fixed k ( in fact , nearly as fast as NN ) .
This means that however small p is , as N grows large enough N ! ( pN ) will grow above 1 and more and more solutions will appear .
The critical size happens when the expected ( average ) number of solutions is 1 .
This explanation by reference to probabilities may seem a little unsatisfactory at first .
Surely there either is a solution or there is n't ?
But the same comment applies in any situation we think of as probabilistic ( either the coin will come down heads or it wo n't ) .
Probability is just a measure of our lack of knowledge .
There might be some systematic reason why some tilings will be impossible , but if there is n't , the probabilistic estimate of how many solutions exist will ( probably ! ) be a reasonable one .
Bigger means easier
They calculated the critical size was about 70 pieces .
An Eternity puzzle this size would be essentially impossible to solve , so it is not surprising that Monckton 's searches did not get this far .
The actual puzzle , with 209 pieces , was far beyond this critical size .
Its level of difficulty would be critically determined by how well - behaved the shapes of the pieces turned out to be .
" It seemed it would be just possible to solve , with a lot of work , " says Oliver .
" We thought the pieces must have been carefully designed to make it very , very difficult , without being impossible .
But it turns out the inventor was just lucky - or perhaps unlucky . "
The pair estimate that there are probably about 1095 solutions , more than the number of subatomic particles in the universe .
" That might sound like a lot of solutions , but there are far , far more non-solutions , " says Oliver .
In other words , the puzzle is much too large to solve by an exhaustive search .
The fastest computer would take millions of years to find even one solution by this method .
This would still be true even if there were many more solutions , as there may well be .
" Our estimate was on the low side compared with some others , which were more like 10120 . "
Why , then , does the problem get easier as the size grows ?
Alex explains : " For a region of the critical size , c say , we expect one solution .
That 's an average : some regions will have more solutions and be easier to tile , others will have none .
If the number of pieces N is bigger than c , we are free to put in the first ( N - c ) pieces in many different ways .
Some of the resulting tiling problems will be much easier than average .
If we can identify the easy ones , we only have to look at those . "
Why did Monckton miss this idea ?
" He was n't looking at it in a mathematical way at all .
In fact , he said he did n't expect a mathematician to solve it . "
Unhelpful hints
At the same time as Eternity , Monckton released various smaller puzzles .
Solving any of these allowed one to send off for one of various " hints " , showing where on the Eternity grid particular pieces were in Monckton 's solution .
Alex points out that these would not have been any help at all .
" Suppose you 're going fishing , and you know that in the Atlantic there is one fish per cubic mile , and in the Pacific there are two fish per cubic mile .
Then you 'll fish in the Pacific rather than the Atlantic .
If someone throws one extra fish into the Atlantic , it wo n't make any difference .
With total fish stocks of 1095 or more , one fish more or less is neither here nor there . "
In fact , if solvers had been required to use the hints , the puzzle would have become much harder .
If you are building up a solution by carefully slotting in pieces one by one , small holes in the middle of the region to be tiled will enormously increase the number of constraints .
" Having to fit in with pieces in the middle of the board would be crippling . "
Good and bad pieces
Knowing there are lots of solutions does n't give us much idea where to look for them , but we did get one clue : the approach must be to try to identify what kinds of positions are easier to tile when only a few pieces are left .
Then we will try to find a way to generate such positions , and whenever we get one , we will do an exhaustive search from it for a complete solution .
You can compare trying to fit the pieces into the grid with loading packages into the boot of a car .
Some of the packages are awkwardly shaped , and you usually put those ones in first , keeping the nicer shapes till later when you have less room for manoeuvre .
In the same way , some Eternity pieces will be better than others when you 've placed most of the pieces and want to fill up the space that 's left .
Unlike the car - packing case , though , it 's not easy to tell which pieces are good just by looking at them .
One might expect that the pieces with the most convex , least knobbly shape will be best , and indeed it turns out that this is mainly true .
But to get a handle on such a vast problem , Alex and Oliver needed much more accurate information about just how valuable different pieces were .
Their plan was to collect this information by running exhaustive searches to tile small regions of the board with subsets of the Eternity pieces .
Using the knowledge gained from this , they would try to build up a tiling piece by piece , always trying to leave themselves with as good a collection of pieces in hand as possible .
Going back to the car - boot analogy : as you put things in , you 're not only trying to keep the nice packages till last ; you 're also trying to ensure that , at each stage , the space that 's left is as sensible a shape as you can arrange .
Similarly , some shapes of Eternity region will be easier to tile than others , but again , it 's not always obvious which ones .
At the same time as identifying good and bad pieces , Alex and Oliver intended to try to identify good and bad regions .
Of course , they could not examine all possible region shapes , but they collected data about what features made a region good or bad .
For example , they looked at how many corners a region 's boundary had , and tried to work out how much harder each corner made it to tile .
Exhausting work
Since they were going to have to run many exhaustive searches of small regions , the first challenge was to write a fast and efficient solver program that would find all tilings of a given region of a moderate size with a given set of pieces .
One useful idea in writing the solver was the idea of always branching on the most constrained site first .
This can be explained by yet another reference to packing a car boot .
If , at a particular point , you have an awkward - shaped corner to fill up , you will probably look first for a package that will make efficient use of that corner .
The solver used a similar principle : at each stage , it scanned the whole region to find which site could be tiled in the fewest ways .
Then it would try all the possibilities for that site .
Another important feature of a good solver is the ability to discard as many untilable positions as possible at an early stage .
Of course the search will find that the position is impossible , but that takes time .
If a large number of positions can be eliminated early on , it will make the solver much faster .
Their innovation here was to look at the shape of the boundary .
Oliver expands :
" We looked at all possible shapes of path in the triangular grid of length 11 , and for each one checked if it could occur as part of a tiling - roughly , if it could be tiled on both sides .
We stored that information in a table , and when we examined a position , the first thing we did was to check every subpath of its boundary of length 11 against our table . "
Suppose you start tiling by fitting pieces together in the grid , until all but , say , 24 of the pieces have been used .
The position that remains consists of two things : the region that has yet to be tiled , whose size is that of 24 pieces - note that all the pieces have the same area - and the particular 24 pieces still available .
We 'll refer to these together as an endgame position .
The resulting puzzle is small enough to search exhaustively , but unfortunately is extremely unlikely to have any solutions .
( If it does , you 've solved the puzzle and you can go home ! )
A different , random selection of 24 pieces is no more likely to be able to tile the region .
Oliver and Alex generated a large number of such size - 24 endgame positions , using the computer to put tiles down using their solver 's boundary checker and a small amount of look - ahead to make sure it did n't get stuck too early .
They kept the regions from these positions , but ignored the pieces .
Instead of the actual 24 pieces left in each case , they asked the solver to tile the region using a random subset of 90 of the original 209 Eternity pieces .
In each case , they then did an exhaustive search to find all tilings of the region using any 24 of the 90 pieces .
" By giving yourself extra pieces , you make the problem easier , so that you can begin to find some solutions " , says Oliver .
" The expected number of solutions is multiplied by 90 choose 24 , which is a huge factor , for a much smaller increase in the amount of work . "
Getting the parameters
From the results of these searches , they planned to find just how useful each piece was , and how much a tiling problem was affected by features of the boundary such as corners .
To do this they had to make a priori assumptions about what kinds of effects they were looking for .
For example , they assumed that the probability of being able to tile a region with a particular set of pieces varied independently with each piece in the set .
Each piece would have an associated probability , and to get the overall probability you simply multiply together all the individual probabilities .
Similarly , the probability would depend exponentially on the number of corners in the region 's boundary ( and on certain other properties of the boundary ) .
The problem now was to estimate values for the probabilities ( for the pieces ) , and the exponential factor for boundary corners ( and similarly for other boundary features ) , using the data from the exhaustive searches of the size - 24 regions .
They proceeded as follows :
Obviously , if we knew the probabilities for the pieces and boundary features , then given a particular set of pieces , we could calculate the probability of tiling a given region .
What we need at the moment , though , is the opposite : for a fairly large data set we know how often we succeeded in tiling a number of regions ; from this we want the piece probabilities .
A well - known theorem in probability theory , Bayes 's Theorem , gives a formula for the probability - of - A - given - B in terms of the probability - of - B - given - A .
If we assume that , in the absence of any data , all models ( i.e. guesses about the piece probabilities ) are , in some sense , " equally likely " , then Bayes 's Theorem allows us to find how any model 's probability is affected by the data .
The formula given by Bayes 's Theorem might not be easy to apply in practice .
The pair had to adjust their probabilistic model to make the calculations more tractable .
Of course , the trick is to choose adjustments which make only a negligibly small difference to the result , but give a big payoff in computation time .
This part of the procedure - finding a likelihood that could actually be calculated - was the most challenging and interesting , because in principle , calculating each likelihood depended on adding a huge and impracticable number of terms .
They circumvented this problem by arranging for this sum to be calculable by a far more manageable short - cut .
Finally , when we can calculate how likely any set of piece probabilities is , we have to maximise this likelihood over all possible sets of probabilities !
This may seem even more implausible : when one could invent an unbounded number of trial sets of probabilities , how do we find the likeliest one ?
In general this would indeed be a sticky ( though not necessarily impossible ) problem .
However , for a certain class of functions , called convex functions , this maximisation problem can be solved efficiently .
The likelihood function of the piece probabilities that Alex and Oliver obtained was thoroughly nice and convex , so they were able to use standard methods to find the set of piece probabilities that was likeliest to be correct .
If they had done their calculation with too small a data set , the results would have been fairly random .
How would they know when they had looked at enough positions that the resulting parameters could be trusted ?
They took a simple approach to this : they divided their searches into two sets , and did separate calculations for each .
Only when the two calculations gave similar answers for most or all of the 209 pieces were they satisfied that the sample was big enough .
Putting the data to work
They now had a set of probabilities expressing how useful each piece was in tiling a region the size of 24 pieces .
Unfortunately , using exactly the same values on larger regions was not likely to work , so they needed similar values for tiling larger regions .
( They could not use the same method as for size 24 , since the exhaustive searches would take too long . )
They modified the size - 24 values for tiling progressively larger and larger regions .
For example , for a size - 25 region , they tried to arrange that the parameters gave the same predicted chance of a tiling as placing a piece and calculating the probability using the parameters they already had for size - 24 regions .
" Our procedure for this step was n't very good , " admits Alex .
" That was one of the things we were trying to improve when we were so rudely interrupted by the computer announcing that it had found a solution . "
Having decided on the model parameters for sizes up to 209 , they had a score for every position .
They used these scores to do a version of a standard " breadth - first search " which remembered good positions and investigated them further .
" To start with , you find the most constrained site , and find all the ways to tile it .
You keep the best , say , 1000 positions at time 1 , and throw the rest away .
Then you look at all the children of those positions : that 's to say , in each one , you find the most constrained site and look at all the ways to tile that site .
Of the resulting positions at time 2 , you again keep the best 1000 and throw the rest away . "
As well as calculating the score for the position , they used the length - 11 boundary information that they had calculated for the solver to avoid keeping provably untilable positions , and used a little lookahead .
" This is a really nice search method , " says Alex .
" It 's a standard method in computer science , called beam search , but all the same I was surprised how well it worked for this problem . "
The performance is improved by increasing the number of positions kept ( the " width " ) from 1000 to a much larger number .
" We were using a width of about 10,000 on the run that found the solution , although we have since tried widths up to 1,000,000 and they seem to be better . "
A lucky break
By this point they were confident of finding a solution ; it was just a matter of when .
When the computer announced that it had found one , though , Alex at first suspected a mistake .
" From our estimate of the number of solutions , we did n't think the program had much chance as it stood .
On average , it would have needed to run for years before it found a solution .
Of course , there might be more solutions than we thought , but even so , extensive runs since for longer periods have n't found any more solutions .
It looks as if we were lucky . "
Oliver was away for the weekend when the solution came up : " Alex came round and told me it had found a solution while I was away .
I did n't believe him - I thought he was having me on . "
Without such a piece of luck , how much longer would it have taken them to find a solution ?
Alex says it is difficult to estimate : " The algorithm was constantly improving .
For example , we were working on improving our scoring method for regions larger than 24 pieces .
And the main speed - up would have come from using more computers : we were near the point of enlisting more computers when the solution appeared .
If I had to make a guess , I 'd say it would have been about two months . "
Would this have been in time to claim the prize ?
" Nope .
Guenter Stertenbrink sent in his solution just six weeks after ours . "
Finally , how do the pair intend to use their new - found wealth ?
Oliver will use his share to buy a house , " but I do n't know where or when " .
At present he is a research fellow in Cambridge while his girlfriend lives in Germany , " which is a long commute " .
Alex has no definite plans .
" But I 'm sure the money will come in handy . "
Monckton is already planning a successor puzzle , Eternity 2 , with another headline - grabbing prize for the first solution , but Alex and Oliver have no plans to compete this time .
" A second time round , it would n't be interesting enough to spend another six months on , " Alex says .
That sounds like good news for other would - be solvers .

Overview : Optimize what needs optimizing
You can only know what makes your program slow after first getting the program to give correct results , then running it to see if the correct program is slow .
When found to be slow , profiling can show what parts of the program are consuming most of the time .
A comprehensive but quick - to - run test suite can then ensure that future optimizations do n't change the correctness of your program .
In short :
Get it right .
Test it 's right .
Profile if slow .
Optimise .
Repeat from 2 .
Certain optimizations amount to good programming style and so should be learned as you learn the language .
An example would be moving the calculation of values that do n't change within a loop , outside of the loop .

Sorting
Sorting lists of basic Python objects is generally pretty efficient .
The sort method for lists takes an optional comparison function as an argument that can be used to change the sorting behavior .
This is quite convenient , though it can significantly slow down your sorts , as the comparison function will be called many times .
In Python 2.4 , you should use the key argument to the built - in sort instead , which should be the fastest way to sort .
Only if you are using older versions of Python ( before 2.4 ) does the following advice from Guido van Rossum apply :
An alternative way to speed up sorts is to construct a list of tuples whose first element is a sort key that will sort properly using the default comparison , and whose second element is the original list element .
This is the so - called Schwartzian Transform , also known as DecorateSortUndecorate ( DSU ) .
Suppose , for example , you have a list of tuples that you want to sort by the n-th field of each tuple .
The following function will do that .
def sortby ( somelist , n ) : nlist = [ ( x[n ] , x ) for x in somelist ] nlist. sort ( ) return [ val for ( key , val ) in nlist ]
Matching the behavior of the current list sort method ( sorting in place ) is easily achieved as well :
def sortby_inplace ( somelist , n ) : somelist [ : ] = [ ( x[n ] , x ) for x in somelist ] somelist. sort ( ) somelist [ :] = [ val for ( key , val ) in somelist ] return
Here 's an example use :
>>> somelist = [ ( 1 , 2 , ' def ' ) , ( 2 , - 4 , ' ghi ' ) , ( 3 , 6 , ' abc ' ) ] >>> somelist.sort ( ) >>> somelist [ ( 1 , 2 , ' def ' ) , ( 2 , - 4 , ' ghi ' ) , ( 3 , 6 , ' abc ' ) ] >>> nlist = sortby ( somelist , 2 ) >>> sortby_inplace( somelist , 2 ) >>> nlist == somelist True >>> nlist = sortby ( somelist , 1 ) >>> sortby_inplace(somelist , 1 ) >>> nlist == somelist True
From Tim Delaney
From Python 2.3 sort is guaranteed to be stable .
( to be precise , it 's stable in CPython 2.3 , and guaranteed to be stable in Python 2.4 )
Python 2.4 adds an optional key parameter which makes the transform a lot easier to use :
# E.g. n = 1 n = 1 import operator nlist.sort( key=operator.itemgetter(n ) ) # use sorted ( ) if you do n't want to sort in - place : # sortedlist = sorted ( nlist , key=operator.itemgetter (n ) )
Note that the original item is never used for sorting , only the returned key - this is equivalent to doing :
# E.g. n = 1 n = 1 nlist = [ ( x[n ] , i , x ) for ( i , x ) in enumerate ( nlist ) ] nlist.sort ( ) nlist = [ val for ( key , index , val ) in nlist ]
String Concatenation
The accuracy of this section is disputed with respect to later versions of Python .
In CPython 2.5 , string concatenation is fairly fast , although this may not apply likewise to other Python implementations .
See ConcatenationTestCode for a discussion .
Strings in Python are immutable .
This fact frequently sneaks up and bites novice Python programmers on the rump .
Immutability confers some advantages and disadvantages .
In the plus column , strings can be used as keys in dictionaries and individual copies can be shared among multiple variable bindings .
( Python automatically shares one - and two - character strings . )
In the minus column , you can't say something like , " change all the 'a 's to ' b 's " in any given string .
Instead , you have to create a new string with the desired properties .
This continual copying can lead to significant inefficiencies in Python programs .
Avoid this :
s = " " for substring in list : s += substring
Use s = " " . join ( list ) instead .
The former is a very common and catastrophic mistake when building large strings .
Similarly , if you are generating bits of a string sequentially instead of :
s = " " for x in list : s += some_function ( x )
use
slist = [ some_function ( elt ) for elt in somelist ] s = " " .join ( slist )
Avoid :
out = " < html > " + head + prologue + query + tail + " < /html > "
Instead , use
out = " < html > %s%s%s%s</html > " % ( head , prologue , query , tail )
Even better , for readability ( this has nothing to do with efficiency other than yours as a programmer ) , use dictionary substitution :
out = " < html > % ( head ) s % ( prologue ) s %( query ) s % ( tail ) s</html > " % locals ( )
This last two are going to be much faster , especially when piled up over many CGI script executions , and easier to modify to boot .
In addition , the slow way of doing things got slower in Python 2.0 with the addition of rich comparisons to the language .
It now takes the Python virtual machine a lot longer to figure out how to concatenate two strings .
( Do n't forget that Python does all method lookup at runtime . )
Loops
Python supports a couple of looping constructs .
The for statement is most commonly used .
It loops over the elements of a sequence , assigning each to the loop variable .
If the body of your loop is simple , the interpreter overhead of the for loop itself can be a substantial amount of the overhead .
This is where the map function is handy .
You can think of map as a for moved into C code .
The only restriction is that the " loop body " of map must be a function call .
Besides the syntactic benefit of list comprehensions , they are often as fast or faster than equivalent use of map .
Here 's a straightforward example .
Instead of looping over a list of words and converting them to upper case :
newlist = [ ] for word in oldlist : newlist.append(word.upper ( ) )
you can use map to push the loop from the interpreter into compiled C code :
newlist = map ( str.upper , oldlist )
List comprehensions were added to Python in version 2.0 as well .
They provide a syntactically more compact and more efficient way of writing the above for loop :
newlist = [ s.upper ( ) for s in oldlist ]
Generator expressions were added to Python in version 2.4 .
They function more - or - less like list comprehensions or map but avoid the overhead of generating the entire list at once .
Instead , they return a generator object which can be iterated over bit - by - bit :
iterator = ( s.upper ( ) for s in oldlist )
Which method is appropriate will depend on what version of Python you 're using and the characteristics of the data you are manipulating .
Guido van Rossum wrote a much more detailed ( and succinct ) examination of loop optimization that is definitely worth reading .
Avoiding dots ...
Suppose you can't use map or a list comprehension ?
You may be stuck with the for loop .
The for loop example has another inefficiency .
Both newlist . append and word .upper are function references that are reevaluated each time through the loop .
The original loop can be replaced with :
upper = str.upper newlist = [ ] append = newlist .
append for word in oldlist : append ( upper ( word ) )
This technique should be used with caution .
It gets more difficult to maintain if the loop is large .
Unless you are intimately familiar with that piece of code you will find yourself scanning up to check the definitions of append and upper .
Local Variables
The final speedup available to us for the non- map version of the for loop is to use local variables wherever possible .
If the above loop is cast as a function , append and upper become local variables .
Python accesses local variables much more efficiently than global variables .
def func ( ) : upper = str.upper newlist = [ ] append = newlist .
append for word in oldlist : append ( upper ( word ) ) return newlist
At the time I originally wrote this I was using a 100MHz Pentium running BSDI .
I got the following times for converting the list of words in /usr / share / dict / words ( 38,470 words at that time ) to upper case :
Version Time ( seconds ) Basic loop 3.47 Eliminate dots 2.45 Local variable & no dots 1.79 Using map function 0.54
Initializing Dictionary Elements
Suppose you are building a dictionary of word frequencies and you 've already broken your text up into a list of words .
You might execute something like :
wdict = {} for word in words : if word not in wdict : wdict [ word ] = 0 wdict [ word ] += 1
Except for the first time , each time a word is seen the if statement 's test fails .
If you are counting a large number of words , many will probably occur multiple times .
In a situation where the initialization of a value is only going to occur once and the augmentation of that value will occur many times it is cheaper to use a try statement :
wdict = {} for word in words : try : wdict [ word ] += 1 except KeyError : wdict [ word ] = 1
It 's important to catch the expected KeyError exception , and not have a default except clause to avoid trying to recover from an exception you really can't handle by the statement ( s ) in the try clause .
A third alternative became available with the release of Python 2.x. Dictionaries now have a get ( ) method which will return a default value if the desired key is n't found in the dictionary .
This simplifies the loop :
wdict = {} get = wdict .
get for word in words : wdict [ word ] = get ( word , 0 ) + 1
When I originally wrote this section , there were clear situations where one of the first two approaches was faster .
It seems that all three approaches now exhibit similar performance ( within about 10 % of each other ) , more or less independent of the properties of the list of words .
Also , if the value stored in the dictionary is an object or a ( mutable ) list , you could also use the dict .
setdefault method , e.g .
4 wdict.setdefault(key , [ ] ).append( new_element )
You might think that this avoids having to look up the key twice .
It actually does n't ( even in python 3.0 ) , but at least the double lookup is performed in C .
Another option is to use the defaultdict class :
from collections import defaultdict wdict = defaultdict ( int ) for word in words : wdict [ word ] += 1
Import Statement Overhead
import statements can be executed just about anywhere .
It 's often useful to place them inside functions to restrict their visibility and / or reduce initial startup time .
Although Python 's interpreter is optimized to not import the same module multiple times , repeatedly executing an import statement can seriously affect performance in some circumstances .
Consider the following two snippets of code ( originally from Greg McFarlane , I believe - I found it unattributed in a comp.lang .
python python-list@python.org posting and later attributed to him in another source ) :
def doit1 ( ) : import string #### ## import statement inside function string .
lower ( ' Python ' ) for num in range ( 100000 ) : doit1 ( )
or :
import string ###### import statement outside function def doit2 ( ) : string.lower ( ' Python ' ) for num in range ( 100000 ) : doit2 ( )
doit2 will run much faster than doit1 , even though the reference to the string module is global in doit2 .
Here 's a Python interpreter session run using Python 2.3 and the new timeit module , which shows how much faster the second is than the first :
>>> def doit1 ( ) : ... import string ... string.lower ( ' Python ' ) ... >>> import string >>> def doit2 ( ) : ... string.lower ( ' Python ' ) ... >>> import timeit >>> t = timeit . Timer ( setup= ' from __main__ import doit1 ' , stmt='doit1 ( ) ' ) >>> t.timeit( ) 11.479144930839539 >>> t = timeit . Timer ( setup= ' from __main__ import doit2 ' , stmt='doit2 ( ) ' ) >>> t.timeit( ) 4.6661689281463623
String methods were introduced to the language in Python 2.0 .
These provide a version that avoids the import completely and runs even faster :
def doit3 ( ) : ' Python'.lower ( ) for num in range ( 100000 ) : doit3 ( )
Here 's the proof from timeit :
>>> def doit3 ( ) : ... ' Python'.lower ( ) ... >>> t = timeit . Timer ( setup= ' from __main__ import doit3 ' , stmt=' doit3 ( ) ' ) >>> t.timeit( ) 2.5606080293655396
The above example is obviously a bit contrived , but the general principle holds .
Note that putting an import in a function can speed up the initial loading of the module , especially if the imported module might not be required .
This is generally a case of a " lazy " optimization -- avoiding work ( importing a module , which can be very expensive ) until you are sure it is required .
This is only a significant saving in cases where the module would n't have been imported at all ( from any module ) -- if the module is already loaded ( as will be the case for many standard modules , like string or re ) , avoiding an import does n't save you anything .
To see what modules are loaded in the system look in sys.modules .
A good way to do lazy imports is :
email = None def parse_email ( ) : global email if email is None : import email ...
This way the email module will only be imported once , on the first invocation of parse_email ( ) .
Data Aggregation
Function call overhead in Python is relatively high , especially compared with the execution speed of a builtin function .
This strongly suggests that where appropriate , functions should handle data aggregates .
Here 's a contrived example written in Python .
import time x = 0 def doit1 ( i ) : global x x = x + i list = range ( 100000 ) t = time .
time ( ) for i in list : doit1 ( i ) print " %.3f " % ( time.time ( ) - t )
vs .
import time x = 0 def doit2 ( list ) : global x for i in list : x = x + i list = range ( 100000 ) t = time .
time ( ) doit2 ( list ) print " %.3f " % ( time.time ( ) - t )
Here 's the proof in the pudding using an interactive session :
>>> t = time . time ( ) >>> for i in list : ... doit1 ( i ) ... >>> print " %.3f " % ( time.time ( ) - t ) 0.758 >>> t = time . time ( ) >>> doit2 ( list ) >>> print " %.3f " % ( time.time ( ) - t ) 0.204
Even written in Python , the second example runs about four times faster than the first .
Had doit been written in C the difference would likely have been even greater ( exchanging a Python for loop for a C for loop as well as removing most of the function calls ) .
Doing Stuff Less Often
The Python interpreter performs some periodic checks .
In particular , it decides whether or not to let another thread run and whether or not to run a pending call ( typically a call established by a signal handler ) .
Most of the time there 's nothing to do , so performing these checks each pass around the interpreter loop can slow things down .
There is a function in the sys module , setcheckinterval , which you can call to tell the interpreter how often to perform these periodic checks .
Prior to the release of Python 2.3 it defaulted to 10 .
In 2.3 this was raised to 100 .
If you are n't running with threads and you do n't expect to be catching many signals , setting this to a larger value can improve the interpreter 's performance , sometimes substantially .
Python is not C
It is also not Perl , Java , C++ or Haskell .
Be careful when transferring your knowledge of how other languages perform to Python .
A simple example serves to demonstrate :
% timeit.py -s 'x = 47 ' 'x * 2 ' loops , best of 3 : 0.574 usec per loop % timeit.py -s 'x = 47 ' 'x << 1 ' loops , best of 3 : 0.524 usec per loop % timeit. py -s 'x = 47 ' 'x + x ' loops , best of 3 : 0.382 usec per loop
Now consider the similar C programs ( only the add version is shown ) :
#include < stdio.h > int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { int i = 47 ; int loop ; for ( loop=0 ; loop < 500000000 ; loop ++ ) i + i ; return 0 ; }
and the execution times :
% for prog in mult add shift ; do < for i in 1 2 3 ; do < echo -n " $ prog : " < /usr / bin / time ./$ prog < done < echo < done mult : 6.12 real 5.64 user 0.01 sys mult : 6.08 real 5.50 user 0.04 sys mult : 6.10 real 5.45 user 0.03 sys add : 6.07 real 5.54 user 0.00 sys add : 6.08 real 5.60 user 0.00 sys add : 6.07 real 5.58 user 0.01 sys shift : 6.09 real 5.55 user 0.01 sys shift : 6.10 real 5.62 user 0.01 sys shift : 6.06 real 5.50 user 0.01 sys
Note that there is a significant advantage in Python to adding a number to itself instead of multiplying it by two or shifting it left by one bit .
In C on all modern computer architectures , each of the three arithmetic operations are translated into a single machine instruction which executes in one cycle , so it does n't really matter which one you choose .
A common " test " new Python programmers often perform is to translate the common Perl idiom
while ( <>) { print ; }
into Python code that looks something like
import fileinput for line in fileinput.input ( ) : print line ,
and use it to conclude that Python must be much slower than Perl .
As others have pointed out numerous times , Python is slower than Perl for some things and faster for others .
Relative performance also often depends on your experience with the two languages .
Use xrange instead of range
This section no longer applies if you 're using Python 3 , where range now provides an iterator over ranges of arbitrary size , and where xrange no longer exists .
Python has two ways to get a range of numbers : range and xrange .
Most people know about range , because of its obvious name .
xrange , being way down near the end of the alphabet , is much less well - known .
xrange is a generator object , basically equivalent to the following Python 2.3 code :
def xrange ( start , stop=None , step=1 ) : if stop is None : stop = start start = 0 else : stop = int ( stop ) start = int( start ) step = int ( step ) while start < stop : yield start start += step
Except that it is implemented in pure C .
xrange does have limitations .
Specifically , it only works with int s ; you cannot use long s or float s ( they will be converted to int s , as shown above ) .
It does , however , save gobs of memory , and unless you store the yielded objects somewhere , only one yielded object will exist at a time .
The difference is thus :
When you call range , it creates a list containing so many number ( int , long , or float ) objects .
All of those objects are created at once , and all of them exist at the same time .
This can be a pain when the number of numbers is large .
xrange , on the other hand , creates no numbers immediately - only the range object itself .
Number objects are created only when you pull on the generator , e.g. by looping through it .
For example :
xrange(sys.maxint ) #
No loop , and no call to .next , so no numbers are instantiated
And for this reason , the code runs instantly .
If you substitute range there , Python will lock up ; it will be too busy allocating sys. maxint number objects ( about 2.1 billion on the typical PC ) to do anything else .
Eventually , it will run out of memory and exit .
In Python versions before 2.2 , xrange objects also supported optimizations such as fast membership testing ( i in xrange ( n ) ) .
These features were removed in 2.2 due to lack of use .
Re-map Functions at runtime
Say you have a function
class Test : def check ( self , a , b , c ) : if a == 0 : self.str = b*100 else : self.str = c *100 a = Test ( ) def example ( ) : for i in xrange ( 0,100000 ) : a.check ( i , " b " , " c " ) import profile profile.run ( " example ( ) " )
And suppose this function gets called from somewhere else many times .
Well , your check will have an if statement slowing you down all the time except the first time , so you can do this :
class Test2 : def check ( self , a , b , c ) : self.str = b*100 self.
check = self.check_post def check_post ( self , a , b , c ) : self.str = c *100 a = Test2( ) def example2 ( ) : for i in xrange ( 0,100000 ) : a.check ( i , " b " , " c " ) import profile profile.run ( " example2 ( ) " )
Well , this example is fairly inadequate , but if the ' if ' statement is a pretty complicated expression ( or something with lots of dots ) , you can save yourself evaluating it , if you know it will only be true the first time .
Profiling Code
The first step to speeding up your program is learning where the bottlenecks lie .
It hardly makes sense to optimize code that is never executed or that already runs fast .
I use two modules to help locate the hotspots in my code , profile and trace .
In later examples I also use the timeit module , which is new in Python 2.3 .
The advice in this section is out of date .
See the separate profiling document for alternatives to the approaches given below .
Profiling
There are a number of profiling modules included in the Python distribution .
Using one of these to profile the execution of a set of functions is quite easy .
Suppose your main function is called main , takes no arguments and you want to execute it under the control of the profile module .
In its simplest form you just execute
import profile profile.run ( ' main ( ) ' )
When main ( ) returns , the profile module will print a table of function calls and execution times .
The output can be tweaked using the Stats class included with the module .
From Python 2.4 , profile has permitted the time consumed by Python builtins and functions in extension modules to be profiled as well .
A slightly longer description of profiling using the profile and pstats modules can be found here ( archived version ) :
http://web.archive.org/web/20060506162444/http://wingware.com/doc/howtos/performance-profiling-python-code
The cProfile Module
The `cProfile` module is an alternative to profile written in C that generally runs much faster .
It uses the same interface .
Trace Module
The trace module is a spin - off of the profile module I wrote originally to perform some crude statement level test coverage .
It 's been heavily modified by several other people since I released my initial crude effort .
As of Python 2.0 you should find trace .py in the Tools / scripts directory of the Python distribution .
Starting with Python 2.3 it's in the standard library ( the Lib directory ) .
You can copy it to your local bin directory and set the execute permission , then execute it directly .
It 's easy to run from the command line to trace execution of whole scripts :
% trace .py -t spam .py eggs
In Python 2.4 it 's even easier to run .
Just execute python -m trace .
There 's no separate documentation , but you can execute " pydoc trace " to view the inline documentation .
Visualizing Profiling Results
RunSnakeRun is a GUI tool by Mike Fletcher which visualizes profile dumps from cProfile using square maps .
Function / method calls may be sorted according to various criteria , and source code may be displayed alongside the visualization and call statistics .
Currently ( April 2016 ) RunSnakeRun supports Python 2.x only - thus it cannot load profile data generated by Python 3 programs .
An example usage :
runsnake some_profile_dump.prof
Gprof2
Dot is a python based tool that can transform profiling results output into a graph that can be converted into a PNG image or SVG .
A typical profiling session with python 2.5 looks like this ( on older platforms you will need to use actual script instead of the - m option ) :
python -m cProfile -o stat.prof MYSCRIPY .PY [ ARGS ...] python -m pbp.scripts.gprof2dot -f pstats -o stat . dot stat.prof dot - ostat.png - Tpng stat.dot
PyCallGraph pycallgraph is a Python module that creates call graphs for Python programs .
It generates a PNG file showing an modules 's function calls and their link to other function calls , the amount of times a function was called and the time spent in that function .
Typical usage :
pycallgraph scriptname.py
PyProf2CallTree is a script to help visualize profiling data collected with the cProfile python module with the kcachegrind graphical calltree analyser .
Typical usage :
python -m cProfile -o stat.prof MYSCRIPY .PY [ ARGS ...] python pyprof2calltree.py - i stat.prof -k
ProfileEye is a browser - based frontend to gprof2dot using d3.js for decluttering visual information .
Typical usage :
python -m profile -o output . pstats path / to / your / script arg1 arg2 gprof2dot -f pstats output.pstats | profile_eye --file-colon_line-colon-label - format > profile_output.html
SnakeViz is a browser - based visualizer for profile data .
Typical usage :
python -m profile -o output . pstats path / to / your / script arg1 arg2 snakeviz output.

When I am talking on forums or to some of my students , from time to time I realize that I have gotten so used to expecting a certain vocabulary and certain concepts to be known to others that it is n’t even funny .
In German we call this being betriebsblind , which basically means nothing more than expecting everyone to know what you know ( at least to a certain extent ) , because the knowledge is so essential for what you do every day .
The concept of Thread - Safety definitely belongs into this category for me , as I usually have to force myself to explain it and its implications to my students new to parallel programming , because it seems so trivial .
Unfortunately , it is not .
Therefore , I will spend the rest of this article trying to explain what Thread - Safety means , why it is important and also highlight some ways to achieve it without throwing your performance out of the window .
I would also like to issue the usual warning to my more advanced readers : the beginning of this article is most definitely not for you , the end may be worth checking out as well :P .
What is Thread - Safety ?
One of the defining properties of threads is , that multiple threads have access to the same address space .
Therefore , they are able to write to the exact same memory location at the same time .
I have explained why this is a problem in one of my earlier articles about mutual exclusion , therefore I can use the short version here :
Writing to the same memory location from multiple threads at the same time without any form of protection is like playing Russian Roulette : you may survive at first , but sooner or later you run out of luck and the results are disastrous .
You may quote me on that 8 ) .
For a more thorough explanation , please read the former article .
Now that we have this part established , the rest is easy :
Thread - safe code is basically any code that can be called from multiple threads concurrently without breaking .
Or phrased differently : if your code does not access the same memory location from multiple threads without protection , it is most likely thread - safe .
We can have thread - safe functions , thread - safe objects or thread - safe programs , although the usage of the term is most common when talking about functions .
So much for the easy part .
The difficult part is actually spotting these accesses to the same memory location in your code and fixing them without loosing too much performance .
But contrary to what some message - passing fans may want you to believe , this is not impossible .
My students usually get it right after we have shown it to them in their programs once or twice .
And with experience you will notice the little voice in the back of your head that warns you about it every time you want to write to a shared variable or call a function that may not be thread - safe .
And if you do n’t want to bet your career on little voices ( probably a smart move on your part ) , let ’s not forget about the high quality tools that are available to help you with this as well , e.g. the Intel Thread - Checker or the Sun Data Race Detection Tool .
I have had very good experiences with the former tool and as soon as I find some time I will also try out the second one ( especially since it is free – on the other hand the Intel tool is very reasonably priced as well , especially for universities ) .
How - to Achieve Thread - Safety
OK , so there are ways to reliably find the dangerous spots in your code .
What do we do , once we have found them ?
Lets say we have isolated a function that is not thread - safe because it was written at a time when parallelism was not an issue .
We have multiple ways to deal with it , some of which are highlighted in the following list :
Put a big , fat lock right at the start of the function and unlock it at the end of the function .
This is the easy solution , because it is doable in every threading system I know and it always works .
Unfortunately , it is also the one which may cost you the most performance , since only one thread can carry out the function at the same time now .
On the other hand , I have written the magic word may in the last sentence not without a reason : if the function is only rarely called , that big , fat lock may not be a problem for performance at all .
Your profiler will tell you , especially if it knows about parallelism .
Put one or many smaller locks in the function around the data that actually need protection .
This finer grained approach may work better than the one sketched above , especially when there are only a few places in the function that actually need protection and there are larger areas that are thread - safe and can be carried out concurrently .
It may also turn out to be a bad idea ( TM ) , because setting and unsetting the locks also takes some time , even when there is no contention .
As you can see by my repeated usage of the fine word may , there is no way to know which technique is better without taking a look at the actual code , all I am telling you here are just ideas which may or may not work .
Protect the data instead of the code .
No , I am not senile ( yet ) , this is actually a different advice than the one I just gave you .
Instead of protecting a small region of code with a lock where critical data is accessed , associate a lock with the critical data in question .
This may allow you to use two different locks for the same region of code but when working on different data , allowing concurrent execution by multiple threads .
An example :
When you have written a function that multiplies each element of an array by two , you can associate a different lock to different arrays , allowing two threads to carry out the function concurrently when working on two different arrays .
Use atomic operations to change the data that need protection .
The availability of these operations varies from system to system , e.g. POSIX Threads does not have them at all , OpenMP gives you the possibility to mark certain simple operations on plain old data - types as atomic via the atomic - directive and in Java you can declare certain variables as atomic and all operations involving that variable will be carried out atomically .
Check the documentation of your parallel programming system of choice and if you have atomic operations , it is most likely a good idea to use them ( gosh , I cannot believe I wrote that whole bullet point without using may even once ! :) )
Change your functions to only work on thread - private data .
This may sound harder than it actually is , but many times shared data are not really necessary .
Even if they may seem necessary , there is little trick that can change this quite often : delegate the shared data to the caller of the function , which passes it in as a parameter ( most likely a pointer or a reference in C++ ) and document that the caller is responsible for protecting that data before the function is called .
This may sound not like a solution , but rather like a delegation of the whole problem .
But considering that the caller may have more knowledge about the present state of the program and its data , it makes a whole lot of sense .
As an example , the caller may know , that no other thread presently calls that function with the same data and therefore no protection from concurrent access is necessary .
Of course , the moment you employ this last technique , the function is not thread - safe anymore , so make really sure to document this properly !
It also changes the interface of the function , which may not be doable for your particular case .
Further Reading
If you want to know more about thread - safety and related topics , I wholeheartedly recommend what I like to call the POSIX Threads Bible by David Butenhof – Programming with POSIX Threads .
Or if you are more into Java , I hear Java Concurrency in Practice is a very good read .
I have not really found a great book on Thread - Programming with C# – the best one appears to be Programming C# , although it contains only a single chapter on threaded programming .
If you find a better one , please let me know .
All of them contain useful information on Thread - Safety as well .
Summary
This closes my little trip into the world of Thread - Safety .
I hope to have brought across , that Thread - Safety is a challenging problem , but can be managed with a little experience and the right tools .
I also tried to show you some techniques , that may ( that was the last time I used that verb for today , I promise : P ) be useful to achieve Thread - Safety for your code .
The name - patron of my old high - school Wilhelm Ostwald had a famous maxim , which can be ( roughly ) translated into English like this :
Good theory must soon become practical .
That is how its value can be seen .
Following this spirit , I am planning on writing a followup article on this topic , explaining how the techniques introduced here may ( guess I lied : twisted : ) be used to make the rand ( ) - function thread - safe ( and explain in the process , why its performance often sucks in multi- threaded code ) .
P.S. : This essay was sponsored by the word may , thanks for listening ! 😉
They mugged Jack Murtha , and the voters , Thursday morning .
As the House Democratic caucus voted to install Rep. Steny Hoyer in the number - two leadership spot , over at the liberal Huffington Post they were running a large picture of Speaker Nancy and Hoyer making nice for the cameras , in a let ’s - join - hands photo - op veritably oozing with phoniness .
The headline cited Pelosi ’s message : " We Made History Now Let ’s Make Progress for the American People . "
It ’s like reading the front page of Pravda , circa 1936 : " Ten - Year Plan Over - Fulfilled ! " over a photo of the Soviet hierarchy posed against the backdrop of the Kremlin .
Back in the half - forgotten days of the Cold War era , Kremlinologists  remember them ?
 used to carefully monitor the subtleties of these joint appearances : where one official stood , and in relation to whom , supposedly revealed the hidden struggle for power among the inner leadership .
Published photos in particular signaled the rise and fall of political fortunes : which is why the Soviets went to the extraordinary lengths of altering photographic evidence that gave comfort to their ideological enemies , literally airbrushing Leon Trotsky and other prominent heretics out of existence .
In this spirit , then , examine the CNN photo of Nancy ’s coronation and notice its composition : Rahm Emanuel to the left of her , Hoyer to her right  a veritable Praetorian Guard that is little short of menacing .
The former torpedoed antiwar candidates in the primary and snubbed them in the general election , while the latter defeated antiwar leader Jack Murtha  frowning in the background  for majority leader on the strength of a smear campaign of extraordinary proportions .
Are the men surrounding Madam Speaker an honor guard , or a police escort ?
Who ’s in charge here ?
Arrayed against Murtha was a united front of the Democratic Party establishment , from a George Soros - backed " liberal " consumer - complainer group to an anonymously run YouDontKnowJack.org , featuring replays of the infamous Abscam tapes .
In the video , Murtha rejects an offer of a bribe while FBI agents disguised as wealthy Arabs  the Borat - style mustaches are a riot  try to lure him into a compromising position , without much success .
Murtha was completely exonerated in a subsequent investigation  but that did n’t stop the smear brigade from surfacing this age - old sludge .
To hear some Democrats , adherents of an ideology that revolves around the pork barrel , denounce Murtha as " corrupt " is the ultimate in unintentional humor .
Aside from the hypocrisy , however , there is the rather more interesting aspect of this contest as a clash of political cultures .
The gruff , regular - guy congressman from Pennsylvania , a longtime friend of the military ( and especially veterans ) , is a typical bring - home - the - bacon congressman of the Democratic breed ; not everyone can be Ron Paul .
Hammered for calling the " anti-corruption " rules favored by Pelosi " crap , " Murtha might have answered that Hoyer calls for a relaxation of the rules involving foreign junkets sponsored by " nonprofit " " educational " organizations  i.e. , foreign lobbyists .
Go here for a fascinating breakdown of their respective campaign contributors , which seems to debunk the popular idea that the War Party is simply the voice of the armaments industry .
And I would note an intriguing detail : Hoyer has an unusually high total contribution coming from " ideological " and " single - issue " groups .
Unfortunately , there was n’t time to debunk the smears and engage the Hoyerites in a full - fledged debate : the knifing of Murtha was done quickly , in the dark  a secret ballot of the Democratic caucus , and then that phony photo - op .
As their mandate lies bleeding on the floor
The Great Realignment of 2006 lasted a little over a week before it turned into the Great Sellout .
It is a perfect illustration of how the War Party controls the leadership of both major parties and maintains its grip on the levers of power .
Given near - monopoly status on account of repressive ballot access laws in most states , the parties can thwart the popular will .
Given a mandate for peace , the Democratic Party leadership has effectively rejected it and reversed the election results .
Americans voted for peace , and they ’re going to get more war .
That ’s how our Bizarro democracy works , and all I can say is God bless Bizarro America , land of the duped and home of the cowed .
Back when the Democrats were AWOL on the Iraq issue , Murtha changed the debate over the war by coming out for a rapid American withdrawal .
His stance caused a sensation : here was a conservative Democrat , a veteran Marine , whose campaign chest is heavy with cash from the defense sector , surely no Dennis Kucinich  and he wants us out now !
Close to the military establishment , Murtha is seen to reflect opinion in the senior ranks that this war is unwinnable and likely to spread , stretching the fighting capacity of the world ’s last superpower to the breaking point .
His high - profile stance represented a threat and had to be smashed  as it was .
It is instructive to observe how readily supposedly " liberal " groups stabbed the antiwar movement in the back by fueling the " Murtha = corruption " meme : they caviled that the conservative Catholic congressman is anti-abortion and not exactly a San Francisco Democrat , either in style or substance .
With his blue - collar demeanor , Murtha is the exact opposite of the white - wine - and - brie crowd  i.e. , big business and the " labor " aristocracy  that mobilized around Hoyer .
As support for a quick exit from Iraq gathers strength among the public , the Washington elite draws closer together in defense of a failed policy , and the differences between the Democrats and Republicans begin to meet and merge .
In the face of a popular rebellion against the madness of our foreign policy , both wings of the War Party present a united front against the electoral onslaught .
Faced with the " choice " of John McCain versus Hillary Clinton in 2008 , both pro-war and avidly interventionist , where does the antiwar majority go ?
The choice between Hoyer and Murtha was clear .
While the loser is a hero to the antiwar movement , the victor was characterized by the Washington Monthly as follows :
" Hoyer has always advocated a more hawkish approach to national security than many Democrats .
In 1985 , he broke with his party to support funding for Reagan ’s MX missile , and in the 1990s pressured President Clinton to lift the arms embargo against Bosnian Muslims , and to intervene more aggressively in the Balkans .
Unlike Pelosi , he voted to authorize Bush to invade Iraq .
Then , last November , after Murtha  a longtime Pelosi ally who had run her whip campaign in 2000  called for an immediate withdrawal , Hoyer and Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( D - Ill. ) urged Pelosi not to join Murtha , arguing that doing so would hurt Democrats politically . "
I warned that this sellout would earn something of a record for swiftness , and I deeply regret being right .
Believe me , nothing would be better if we could hand the job over to the newly installed Democratic Congress and relax as they extricate us from the Iraqi quagmire .
Yet that clearly is not happening : instead , the Democrats , content with purely symbolic measures , are abstaining when it comes to Iraq , neither challenging the present policy of " stay the course " nor erecting any roadblocks to possible future escalation of the war .
Now we hear talk of a " final push , " a sudden increase in the number of troops to leave some sort of semi-permanent imprint on the chaos .
How many more have to die in order to save the face of the Washington know - it - alls ?
This once again underlines the basic principle at the heart of any peace movement worthy of the name : put not your trust in politicians .
The people voted to get us out of Iraq , and instead the Democrats will stand idly by  at best  while we get in deeper .
They can concentrate on extending the welfare state and wait for the Baker Commission to somehow magically come up with a comfortably " bipartisan " solution .
It is n’t going to happen .
The sellout continues apace , and you ca n’t say you were n’t warned .
Antiwar.com has n’t hesitated to say what is n’t popular and speak truth to power , especially when it comes to the complicity of both parties in taking us down the road to war .
We cannot rely on anything but a mass movement from below to end the war , and the mugging of Jack Murtha confirms it .
That ’s why the continuity of Antiwar.com is so important  and why you should join with hundreds of others in ensuring that we are able to carry on our work .
The response to our fundraising effort this week has been frankly atrocious , and I do n’t think I ’m amiss in thinking that this has much to do with the Democratic victory .
Many of our readers and supporters apparently believed this would inaugurate a new era of peace , the neocons would be driven out of the temple of democracy , and the troops would come home shortly afterward .
Now that they are beginning to realize this is nothing more than a pipe dream , they have a chance to redeem themselves .
We frankly cannot continue to operate Antiwar.com with the present level of contributions .
Unless you , our readers and supporters , come through with a massive show of support , we ’ll be forced to make huge cutbacks : more than half the staff will have to go , and we ’ll be left with a skeleton budget and the looming possibility of imminent closure .
It is n’t a pretty picture .
The complete defeat of the antiwar Democrats at the hands of the War Party contains a lesson that needs to be absorbed , but surely it implies that bedrock institutions like Antiwar.com are essential to the cause of peace .
We do n’t have any illusions of a quick victory in the battle to change American foreign policy .
We have been fighting the War Party since 1995 , so we have no inflated expectations in that regard .
It is a long , hard slog , and that ’s what this fundraising campaign has turned into : we ’re fighting the illusion that we can let the politicians take care of our problems all on their own , without any impetus or pressure from below .

The Constitution is the supreme law of the land , and any statutes inconsistent with the Constitution must yield .
The basic principle of our system of government means that no President , merely by assenting to a piece of legislation , can diminish the scope of the President 's constitutional power .
. . .
Just as one President may not , through signing legislation , eliminate the Executive Branch 's inherent constitutional powers , Congress may not renounce inherent presidential authority .
The Constitution grants the President the inherent power to protect the nation from foreign attack , and Congress may not impede the President 's ability to perform his constitutional duty . “ ( citations omitted ) .
When President Bush signed the reauthorization of the USA Patriot
Act this month , he included an addendum saying that he did not feel obliged to obey requirements that he inform Congress about how the FBI was using the act 's expanded police powers .
In order to execute the laws and defend the Constitution , the President must be able to interpret them .
The interpretation of law , both statutory and constitutional , is therefore an indispensable and well established government function .
. . .
The President 's power to interpret the law is particularly important when he is engaged in a task -- such as the direction of the operations of an armed conflict -- that falls within the special and unique competence of the Executive Branch .
From these facts , by which Montesquieu was guided , it may clearly be inferred that , in saying " There can be no liberty where the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person , or body of magistrates , " or , " if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers , " he did not mean that these departments ought to have no partial agency in , or no control over , the acts of each other .
His meaning , as his own words import , and still more conclusively as illustrated by the example in his eye , can amount to no more than this , that where the whole power of one department is exercised by the same hands which possess the whole power of another department , the fundamental principles of a free constitution are subverted .
This would have been the case in the constitution examined by him , if the king , who is the sole executive magistrate , had possessed also the complete legislative power , or the supreme administration of justice ; or if the entire legislative body had possessed the supreme judiciary , or the supreme executive authority .
The Republicans and Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee submitted detailed questions to the Bush Administration regarding the NSA program , and the DoJ 's responses to both the Democrats ' questions and its responses to the Republicans ' are now available .
There are numerous noteworthy items , but the most significant , by far , is that the DoJ made clear to Congress that even if Congress passes some sort of newly amended FISA of the type which Sen .
DeWine introduced , and even if the President " agrees " to it and signs it into law , the President still has the power to violate that law if he wants to .
Put another way , the Administration is telling the Congress -- again -- that they can go and pass all the laws they want which purport to liberalize or restrict the President 's powers , and it does not matter , because the President has and intends to preserve the power to do whatever he wants regardless of what those laws provide .
Question number ( 5 ) from the Committee Republicans asked " whether President Carter 's signature on FISA in 1978 , together with his signing statement , " meant that the Executive had agreed to be bound by the restrictions placed by FISA on the President 's powers to eavesdrop on Americans .
This is how the DoJ responded , in relevant part : Can that be any clearer for you - Congressmen , Senators , journalists ?
The President is bestowed by the Constitution with the unlimited and un-limitable power to do anything that he believes is necessary to " protect the nation . "
Thus , even if Congress passes laws which seek to limit that power in any way , and even if the President agrees to those restrictions and signs that bill into law , he still retains the power to violate it whenever he wants .
Thus , Sen. DeWine can pass his cute little bill purporting to require oversight , or Sen .
Specter can pass his , or they can do nothing and leave FISA in place .
None of that matters , because no matter what Congress or even the President do with regard to the law , the law does not restrict what the President can do in any way .
They are telling the Congress to its face that all of the grand debates it is having and the negotiations it is conducting are all irrelevant farces , because no matter what happens , the President retains unlimited power and nothing that Congress does can affect that power in any way .
The reality is that the Administration has been making clear for quite some time that they have unlimited power and that nothing -- not even the law -- can restrict it .
But here , they are specifically telling Congress that even if Congress amends FISA and the President agrees to abide by those amendments , they still have the power to break the law whenever they want .
As I have documented more times than I can count , we have a President who has seized unlimited power , including the power to break the law , and the Administration -- somewhat commendably -- is quite candid and straightforward about that fact .
I believe that even people who are aware of these facts have not really ingested or accepted the reality that we have an Administration that has embraced this ideology of lawlessness .
Yesterday , I received numerous e-mails from people asking why I had not written about this report from the Boston Globe , which reported :
The reason I did n't was because , as extraordinary as this signing statement is in one sense , it really reveals nothing new .
We really do have an Administration which believes it has the power to break all laws relating , however broadly , to defending the country .
It has said this repeatedly in numerous contexts and acted on those beliefs by breaking the law -- repeatedly and deliberately .
They are still breaking the law by , for instance , continuing to eavesdrop on Americans without the warrants required by FISA .
This is not theory .
The Administration is not saying these things as a joke .
We really do live in a country where we have a President who has seized the unlimited power to break the law .
That 's not hyperbole in any way .
It is reality .
And the Patriot Act signing statement only re-iterates that fact .
In response to the Republicans ' question ( number 27 ) about whether President is exceeding his power by not just executing the laws but also interpreting them , the DoJ said this :
The " unique competence of the Executive Branch , " to them , encompasses pretty much everything of any real significance , including what can be done to U.S. citizens on U.S. soil .
With regard to all such matters , the President not only executes the law , but interprets it , and Congress is without power to do anything to restrict the power in any way .
Here they are -- saying exactly this , again .
Put another way , the Administration has seized the power of Congress to make the laws , they have seized the power of the judiciary to interpret the laws , and they execute them as well .
They have consolidated within themselves all of the powers of the government , particularly with regard to national security .
This situation is , of course , exactly what Madison warned about in Federalist 47 ; it really is the very opposite of everything our Government is intended to be :
As usual , the most amazing aspect of all of this is not that the Administration is claiming these powers .
It is that even as it claims them as expressly and clearly as can be , the Congress continues to ignore it and pretend that it still retains power to restrict the Administration by the laws it passes .
And the media continues to fail in its duty to inform the country about the powers the Administration has seized , likely because they are so extreme that people still do not really believe that the Administration means what they are saying .
What else do they need to do in order to demonstrate their sincerity ?
DAMASCUS , Syria , Oct. 7 ( Reuters ) 
Swiss researchers have discovered the 100,000 - year - old remains of a previously unknown giant camel species in central Syria .
“ This is a big discovery , a revolution in science , ” said Jean - Marie Le Tensorer , a prehistory professor at the University of Basel .
“ It was not known that the dromedary was present in the Middle East more than 10,000 years ago . ”
He said it was about 12 feet tall , “ as big as a giraffe or an elephant . ”
Professor Tensorer , who has been excavating at the desert site in Kowm since 1999 , said the first large bones were found some years ago but were only confirmed as belonging to a camel after more bones from several parts of the same animal were recently discovered .
“ We found the first traces of a big animal in 2003 , but we were not sure it was a giant camel , ” he said .
GM , DaimlerChrysler , BMW Premiere Unprecedented Hybrid Technology

The state - of - the - art full hybrid system , whose components are being co-developed by General Motors Corp. , DaimlerChrysler and the BMW Group for production beginning next year , represents a major automotive industry milestone due to the unprecedented fully integrated combination of electric motors with a fixed - gear transmission .
As a result of its low - and high - speed electric continuously variable transmission ( ECVT ) modes , the system is commonly referred to as the 2 - mode hybrid .
However , the sophisticated fuel - saving system also incorporates four fixed gear ratios for high efficiency and power - handling capabilities in a broad variety of vehicle applications .
During the two ECVT modes and four fixed gear operations , the hybrid system can use the electric motors for boosting and regenerative braking .
In summary , the four fixed gears overlay two ECVT modes for a total of six operating functions :
- Input - split ECVT mode , or continuously variable Mode 1 , operates from vehicle launch through the second fixed gear ratio .
- Compound - split ECVT mode , or continuously variable Mode 2 , operates after the second fixed gear ratio .
- First fixed - gear ratio with both electric motors available to boost the internal combustion engine or capture and store energy from regenerative braking , deceleration and coasting .
- Second fixed - gear ratio with one electric motor available for boost / braking ,
- Third fixed - gear ratio with two electric motors available for boost / braking .
- Fourth fixed - gear ratio with one electric motor available for boost / braking .
- The result is trend - setting hybrid technology that provides superior fuel economy , performance and load carrying capability .
The full hybrid system being co-developed by General Motors , DaimlerChrysler and the BMW Group has an overall mechanical content and size similar to a conventional automatic transmission , yet this full hybrid transmission can operate in infinitely variable gear ratios or one of the four fixed - gear ratios .
A sophisticated electronic control module constantly optimizes the entire hybrid powertrain system to select the most efficient operation point for the power level demanded by the driver .
Key Advantages
When compared to conventional hybrid systems , this avant - garde hybrid technology , relying on both the ECVT modes and the four fixed gear ratios , provides advantages in combined ( city and highway ) fuel economy , dynamics and towing capability .
Traditional hybrid systems typically have only one torque - splitting arrangement and no fixed mechanical ratios .
These systems are often called " one- mode " hybrids .
Due to their less capable mechanical content , one - mode hybrids need to transmit a significant amount of power through an electrical path that is 20 percent less efficient than a mechanical path .
This requires usually substantial compromise in vehicle capability or reliance on larger electrical motors , which can create cost , weight and packaging issues .
General Motors , DaimlerChrysler and the BMW Group have conceived a full hybrid system featuring four fixed mechanical ratios , within the two ECVT modes , to reduce power transmission through the less efficient electrical path .
Consequently , the electric motors are more compact and less dependent on engine size .
This combination of two ECVT modes and four fixed gear ratios eliminates the drawbacks of one - mode hybrid systems to allow for efficient operation throughout a vehicle 's operating range , at low and high speeds .
It also allows for application across a broader variety of vehicles .
It is particularly beneficial in demanding applications that require larger engines , such as towing , hill climbing or carrying heavy loads .
Existing internal combustion engines can be used with relatively minimal alteration because the full hybrid system imposes no significant limitation on the size or type of engine .
It enables the three global automakers to package internal combustion engines with the full hybrid transmissions more cost - effectively and offer the fuel - saving technology across a wider range of vehicles .
Initial applications are suitable for front - engine , rear - and four - wheel - drive vehicle architectures , but the full hybrid system has the flexibility to be used in front - engine , front - wheel - drive architectures in the future as well .

Your Comments
Mr. Buford , a telecommunications analyst at Kraft Foods who works in the Chicago area , said he decided on a hybrid because he wanted to " go green , " although he added , " I was n't willing to make any of the trade - offs normally associated with a hybrid . "
He said he liked the way that the electric motor on his new car kicked in early during acceleration , at a speed range in which the V - 6 gasoline engine is relatively weak .
And its emissions of smog - forming pollutants are low , he said .
( The Environmental Protection Agency puts the hybrid and nonhybrid Accords in the same emissions category ) .
If sold at list price , the hybrid costs about $ 3,300 more than the V - 6 with no hybrid .
Mr. Buford said he was not sure if the gas savings would ever pay for the difference .
But in that price range -- about $ 30,000 -- many buyers are not looking for a car that is the cheapest to buy or to operate .
Mr. Buford said he expected that when he files his taxes next April , the purchase will cut his tax bill by about $ 600 .
The tax credit will begin to be phased out in 2006 .
The Accord hybrid is not alone in using technology for power ; the Toyota Highlander and the Lexus RX330 , two premium vehicles , both gained horsepower when they were produced as hybrids .
When Lexus created a hybrid version of the RX330 it kept the same 3.3 - liter engine , but to get across the idea that the hybrid had as much power as a vehicle with a 4 - liter engine it named it the RX400h .
In the Accord , the mechanism was simple .
Honda took the model with the 3.0 - liter V - 6 engine , which generates 240 horsepower , and added a 16 - horsepower electric system .
That is in contrast to the Civic , in which Honda pulled out the standard 1.7 - liter engine and replaced it with a 1.3 - liter engine when it made a hybrid version of the car .
Combined with the electric drive , the car 's horsepower remained roughly constant .
Consumer Reports called the hybrid portion of the Accord a " green turbocharger . "
The main benefit is in getting from zero to 60 miles per hour in 6.9 seconds , compared with 9.0 seconds for the basic four - cylinder model .
A Honda spokesman , Andrew Boyd , said the company already had hybrids that minimize fuel use , notably the Insight , for customers whose top priority was to save gasoline , and the Civic for customers who wanted a car that performs the same but uses less fuel .
Performance in the Civic hybrid is slightly lower than the original model , Mr. Boyd said , and as a result it gets 36 miles per gallon instead of 29 .

Many things here are shamelessly stolen from their works .
We are here to learn about GCC inline assembly .
What this inline stands for ?
We can instruct the compiler to insert the code of a function into the code of its callers , to the point where actually the call is to be made .
Such functions are inline functions .
Sounds similar to a Macro ?
Indeed there are similarities .
What is the benefit of inline functions ?
This method of inlining reduces the function - call overhead .
And if any of the actual argument values are constant , their known values may permit simplifications at compile time so that not all of the inline function ’s code needs to be included .
The effect on code size is less predictable , it depends on the particular case .
To declare an inline function , we ’ve to use the keyword inline in its declaration .
Now we are in a position to guess what is inline assembly .
Its just some assembly routines written as inline functions .
They are handy , speedy and very much useful in system programming .
Our main focus is to study the basic format and usage of ( GCC ) inline assembly functions .
To declare inline assembly functions , we use the keyword asm .
Inline assembly is important primarily because of its ability to operate and make its output visible on C variables .
Because of this capability , " asm " works as an interface between the assembly instructions and the " C " program that contains it .
GCC , the GNU C Compiler for Linux , uses AT&T / UNIX assembly syntax .
Here we ’ll be using AT&T syntax for assembly coding .
Do n’t worry if you are not familiar with AT&T syntax , I will teach you .
This is quite different from Intel syntax .
I shall give the major differences .
Source - Destination Ordering .
The direction of the operands in AT&T syntax is opposite to that of Intel .
In Intel syntax the first operand is the destination , and the second operand is the source whereas in AT&T syntax the first operand is the source and the second operand is the destination .
ie , " Op - code dst src " in Intel syntax changes to " Op - code src dst " in AT&T syntax .
Register Naming .
Register names are prefixed by % ie , if eax is to be used , write %eax .
Immediate Operand .
AT&T immediate operands are preceded by ’$ ’.
For static " C " variables also prefix a ’$ ’ .
In Intel syntax , for hexadecimal constants an ’h’ is suffixed , instead of that , here we prefix ’ 0 x ’ to the constant .
So , for hexadecimals , we first see a ’ $’ , then ’ 0 x ’ and finally the constants .
Operand Size .
In AT&T syntax the size of memory operands is determined from the last character of the op - code name .
Op - code suffixes of ’ b ’ , ’w’ , and ’l’ specify byte ( 8 - bit ) , word ( 16 - bit ) , and long ( 32 - bit ) memory references .
Intel syntax accomplishes this by prefixing memory operands ( not the op - codes ) with ’ byte ptr ’ , ’ word ptr ’ , and ’ dword ptr ’ .
Thus , Intel " mov al , byte ptr foo " is " movb foo , %al " in AT&T syntax .
Memory Operands .
In Intel syntax the base register is enclosed in ’ [ ’ and ’ ] ’ where as in AT&T they change to ’(’ and ’ ) ’.
Additionally , in Intel syntax an indirect memory reference is like section : [ base + index * scale + disp ] , which changes to section : disp ( base , index , scale ) in AT&T .
One point to bear in mind is that , when a constant is used for disp / scale , ’ $ ’ should n’t be prefixed .
Now we saw some of the major differences between Intel syntax and AT&T syntax .
I ’ve wrote only a few of them .
For a complete information , refer to GNU Assembler documentations .
Now we ’ll look at some examples for better understanding .
+------------------------------+------------------------------------+ | Intel Code | AT&T Code | +------------------------------+------------------------------------+
| mov eax , 1 | movl $ 1 , %eax | | mov ebx ,0 ffh | movl $ 0xff , %ebx | | int 80h | int $ 0x80 | | mov ebx , eax | movl %eax , % ebx | | mov eax , [ ecx ] | movl ( %ecx ) , %eax | | mov eax , [ ebx +3 ] | movl 3 ( %ebx ) , %eax | | mov eax , [ ebx +20h ] | movl 0x20 ( % ebx ) , %eax | | add eax , [ ebx+ecx * 2h ] | addl ( %ebx , %ecx,0x2 ) , %eax | | lea eax , [ ebx+ecx ] | leal ( %ebx , %ecx ) , %eax | | sub eax , [ ebx+ecx * 4h - 20h ] | subl - 0x20 ( % ebx , %ecx,0x4 ) , %eax | +------------------------------+------------------------------------+
The format of basic inline assembly is very much straight forward .
Its basic form is
asm ( " assembly code " ) ;
Example .
asm ( " movl %ecx %eax " ) ; /* moves the contents of ecx to eax */ __asm__ ( " movb %bh ( %eax ) " ) ; /* moves the byte from bh to the memory pointed by eax */
You might have noticed that here I ’ve used asm and __asm__ .
Both are valid .
We can use __asm__ if the keyword asm conflicts with something in our program .
If we have more than one instructions , we write one per line in double quotes , and also suffix a ’
’ and ’\t ’ to the instruction .
This is because gcc sends each instruction as a string to as ( GAS ) and by using the newline / tab we send correctly formatted lines to the assembler .
Example .
__asm__ ( " movl %eax , %ebx
\t " " movl $ 56 , %esi
\t " " movl %ecx , $ label ( %edx , %ebx , $4 )
\t " " movb %ah , ( %ebx ) " ) ;
If in our code we touch ( ie , change the contents ) some registers and return from asm without fixing those changes , something bad is going to happen .
This is because GCC have no idea about the changes in the register contents and this leads us to trouble , especially when compiler makes some optimizations .
It will suppose that some register contains the value of some variable that we might have changed without informing GCC , and it continues like nothing happened .
What we can do is either use those instructions having no side effects or fix things when we quit or wait for something to crash .
This is where we want some extended functionality .
Extended asm provides us with that functionality .
In basic inline assembly , we had only instructions .
In extended assembly , we can also specify the operands .
It allows us to specify the input registers , output registers and a list of clobbered registers .
It is not mandatory to specify the registers to use , we can leave that head ache to GCC and that probably fit into GCC ’s optimization scheme better .
Anyway the basic format is :
asm ( assembler template : output operands /* optional */ : input operands /* optional */ : list of clobbered registers /* optional */ ) ;
The assembler template consists of assembly instructions .
Each operand is described by an operand - constraint string followed by the C expression in parentheses .
A colon separates the assembler template from the first output operand and another separates the last output operand from the first input , if any .
Commas separate the operands within each group .
The total number of operands is limited to ten or to the maximum number of operands in any instruction pattern in the machine description , whichever is greater .
If there are no output operands but there are input operands , you must place two consecutive colons surrounding the place where the output operands would go .
Example :
asm ( " cld
\t " " rep
\t " " stosl " : /* no output registers */ : " c " ( count ) , " a " ( fill_value ) , " D " ( dest ) : " %ecx " , " %edi " ) ;
Now , what does this code do ?
The above inline fills the fill_value count times to the location pointed to by the register edi .
It also says to gcc that , the contents of registers eax and edi are no longer valid .
Let us see one more example to make things more clearer .
int a=10 , b ; asm ( " movl % 1 , % %eax ; movl % %eax , %0 ; " :" =r " ( b ) /* output */ :" r " ( a ) /* input */ :" %eax " /* clobbered register */ ) ;
Here what we did is we made the value of ’ b ’ equal to that of ’a ’ using assembly instructions .
Some points of interest are :
" b " is the output operand , referred to by %0 and " a " is the input operand , referred to by %1 .
" r " is a constraint on the operands .
We ’ll see constraints in detail later .
For the time being , " r " says to GCC to use any register for storing the operands .
output operand constraint should have a constraint modifier " = " .
And this modifier says that it is the output operand and is write - only .
There are two % ’s prefixed to the register name .
This helps GCC to distinguish between the operands and registers .
operands have a single % as prefix .
The clobbered register %eax after the third colon tells GCC that the value of %eax is to be modified inside " asm " , so GCC wo n’t use this register to store any other value .
When the execution of " asm " is complete , " b " will reflect the updated value , as it is specified as an output operand .
In other words , the change made to " b " inside " asm " is supposed to be reflected outside the " asm " .
Now we may look each field in detail .
The assembler template contains the set of assembly instructions that gets inserted inside the C program .
The format is like : either each instruction should be enclosed within double quotes , or the entire group of instructions should be within double quotes .
Each instruction should also end with a delimiter .
The valid delimiters are newline (
) and semicolon ( ; ) . ’
’ may be followed by a tab ( \t ) .
We know the reason of newline / tab , right ?.
Operands corresponding to the C expressions are represented by %0 , % 1 ... etc .
C expressions serve as operands for the assembly instructions inside " asm " .
Each operand is written as first an operand constraint in double quotes .
For output operands , there ’ll be a constraint modifier also within the quotes and then follows the C expression which stands for the operand .
ie ,
" constraint " ( C expression ) is the general form .
For output operands an additional modifier will be there .
Constraints are primarily used to decide the addressing modes for operands .
They are also used in specifying the registers to be used .
If we use more than one operand , they are separated by comma .
In the assembler template , each operand is referenced by numbers .
Numbering is done as follows .
If there are a total of n operands ( both input and output inclusive ) , then the first output operand is numbered 0 , continuing in increasing order , and the last input operand is numbered n - 1 .
The maximum number of operands is as we saw in the previous section .
Output operand expressions must be lvalues .
The input operands are not restricted like this .
They may be expressions .
The extended asm feature is most often used for machine instructions the compiler itself does not know as existing ;-) .
If the output expression cannot be directly addressed ( for example , it is a bit - field ) , our constraint must allow a register .
In that case , GCC will use the register as the output of the asm , and then store that register contents into the output .
As stated above , ordinary output operands must be write - only ; GCC will assume that the values in these operands before the instruction are dead and need not be generated .
Extended asm also supports input - output or read - write operands .
So now we concentrate on some examples .
We want to multiply a number by 5 .
For that we use the instruction lea .
asm ( " leal ( % 1 , % 1,4 ) , % 0 " : " =r " ( five_times_x ) : " r " ( x ) ) ;
Here our input is in ’x ’ .
We did n’t specify the register to be used .
GCC will choose some register for input , one for output and does what we desired .
If we want the input and output to reside in the same register , we can instruct GCC to do so .
Here we use those types of read - write operands .
By specifying proper constraints , here we do it .
asm ( " leal ( %0 , %0,4 ) , % 0 " : " =r " ( five_times_x ) : " 0 " ( x ) ) ;
Now the input and output operands are in the same register .
But we do n’t know which register .
Now if we want to specify that also , there is a way .
asm ( " leal ( % %ecx , %%ecx , 4 ) , % %ecx " : " =c " ( x ) : " c " ( x ) ) ;
In all the three examples above , we did n’t put any register to the clobber list .
why ?
In the first two examples , GCC decides the registers and it knows what changes happen .
In the last one , we do n’t have to put ecx on the c lobberlist , gcc knows it goes into x .
Therefore , since it can know the value of ecx , it is n’t considered clobbered .
Some instructions clobber some hardware registers .
We have to list those registers in the clobber - list , ie the field after the third ’ :’ in the asm function .
This is to inform gcc that we will use and modify them ourselves .
So gcc will not assume that the values it loads into these registers will be valid .
We shoud n’t list the input and output registers in this list .
Because , gcc knows that " asm " uses them ( because they are specified explicitly as constraints ) .
If the instructions use any other registers , implicitly or explicitly ( and the registers are not present either in input or in the output constraint list ) , then those registers have to be specified in the clobbered list .
If our instruction can alter the condition code register , we have to add " cc " to the list of clobbered registers .
If our instruction modifies memory in an unpredictable fashion , add " memory " to the list of clobbered registers .
This will cause GCC to not keep memory values cached in registers across the assembler instruction .
We also have to add the volatile keyword if the memory affected is not listed in the inputs or outputs of the asm .
We can read and write the clobbered registers as many times as we like .
Consider the example of multiple instructions in a template ; it assumes the subroutine _foo accepts arguments in registers eax and ecx .
asm ( " movl %0 , % %eax ; movl % 1 , % %ecx ; call _foo " : /* no outputs */ : " g " ( from ) , " g " ( to ) : " eax " , " ecx " ) ;
If you are familiar with kernel sources or some beautiful code like that , you must have seen many functions declared as volatile or __volatile__ which follows an asm or __asm__ .
I mentioned earlier about the keywords asm and __asm__ .
So what is this volatile ?
If our assembly statement must execute where we put it , ( i.e. must not be moved out of a loop as an optimization ) , put the keyword volatile after asm and before the ( ) ’s .
So to keep it from moving , deleting and all , we declare it as
asm volatile ( ... : ... : ... : ... ) ;
Use __volatile__ when we have to be verymuch careful .
If our assembly is just for doing some calculations and does n’t have any side effects , it ’s better not to use the keyword volatile .
Avoiding it helps gcc in optimizing the code and making it more beautiful .
In the section Some Useful Recipes , I have provided many examples for inline asm functions .
There we can see the clobber - list in detail .
By this time , you might have understood that constraints have got a lot to do with inline assembly .
But we ’ve said little about constraints .
Constraints can say whether an operand may be in a register , and which kinds of register ; whether the operand can be a memory reference , and which kinds of address ; whether the operand may be an immediate constant , and which possible values ( ie range of values ) it may have .... etc .
There are a number of constraints of which only a few are used frequently .
We ’ll have a look at those constraints .
Register operand constraint(r )
When operands are specified using this constraint , they get stored in General Purpose Registers ( GPR ) .
Take the following example : asm ( " movl % %eax , %0
" :" =r " ( myval ) ) ;
Here the variable myval is kept in a register , the value in register eax is copied onto that register , and the value of myval is updated into the memory from this register .
When the " r " constraint is specified , gcc may keep the variable in any of the available GPRs .
To specify the register , you must directly specify the register names by using specific register constraints .
They are : +---+--------------------+ | r | Register(s ) | +---+--------------------+ | a | %eax , %ax , %al | | b | %ebx , %bx , %bl | | c | %ecx , %cx , %cl | | d | %edx , %dx , %dl | | S | %esi , % si | | D | %edi , % di | +---+--------------------+
Memory operand constraint(m )
When the operands are in the memory , any operations performed on them will occur directly in the memory location , as opposed to register constraints , which first store the value in a register to be modified and then write it back to the memory location .
But register constraints are usually used only when they are absolutely necessary for an instruction or they significantly speed up the process .
Memory constraints can be used most efficiently in cases where a C variable needs to be updated inside " asm " and you really do n’t want to use a register to hold its value .
For example , the value of idtr is stored in the memory location loc : asm ( " sidt %0
" : :" m " ( loc ) ) ; Matching ( Digit ) constraints
In some cases , a single variable may serve as both the input and the output operand .
Such cases may be specified in " asm " by using matching constraints .
asm ( " incl % 0 " :" =a " ( var ) : " 0 " ( var ) ) ;
We saw similar examples in operands subsection also .
In this example for matching constraints , the register %eax is used as both the input and the output variable .
var input is read to %eax and updated %eax is stored in var again after increment .
" 0 " here specifies the same constraint as the 0th output variable .
That is , it specifies that the output instance of var should be stored in %eax only .
This constraint can be used :
In cases where input is read from a variable or the variable is modified and modification is written back to the same variable .
In cases where separate instances of input and output operands are not necessary .
The most important effect of using matching restraints is that they lead to the efficient use of available registers .
Some other constraints used are :
" m " : A memory operand is allowed , with any kind of address that the machine supports in general . " o " :
A memory operand is allowed , but only if the address is offsettable .
ie , adding a small offset to the address gives a valid address . " V " : A memory operand that is not offsettable .
In other words , anything that would fit the `m ’ constraint but not the `o’constraint .
" i " :
An immediate integer operand ( one with constant value ) is allowed .
This includes symbolic constants whose values will be known only at assembly time . " n " :
An immediate integer operand with a known numeric value is allowed .
Many systems cannot support assembly - time constants for operands less than a word wide .
Constraints for these operands should use ’ n ’ rather than ’ i ’. " g " :
Any register , memory or immediate integer operand is allowed , except for registers that are not general registers .
Following constraints are x86 specific .
" r " : Register operand constraint , look table given above . " q " : Registers a , b , c or d .
" I " : Constant in range 0 to 31 ( for 32 - bit shifts ) .
" J " : Constant in range 0 to 63 ( for 64 - bit shifts ) .
" K " : 0xff. " L " : 0 xffff. " M " : 0 , 1 , 2 , or 3 ( shifts for lea instruction ) .
" N " : Constant in range 0 to 255 ( for out instruction ) . " f " : Floating point register " t " : First ( top of stack ) floating point register " u " : Second floating point register " A " : Specifies the `a ’ or `d ’ registers .
This is primarily useful for 64 - bit integer values intended to be returned with the `d ’ register holding the most significant bits and the `a ’ register holding the least significant bits .
While using constraints , for more precise control over the effects of constraints , GCC provides us with constraint modifiers .
Mostly used constraint modifiers are
" = " : Means that this operand is write - only for this instruction ; the previous value is discarded and replaced by output data .
" & " : Means that this operand is an earlyclobber operand , which is modified before the instruction is finished using the input operands .
Therefore , this operand may not lie in a register that is used as an input operand or as part of any memory address .
An input operand can be tied to an earlyclobber operand if its only use as an input occurs before the early result is written .
The list and explanation of constraints is by no means complete .
Examples can give a better understanding of the use and usage of inline asm .
In the next section we ’ll see some examples , there we ’ll find more about clobber - lists and constraints .
Now we have covered the basic theory about GCC inline assembly , now we shall concentrate on some simple examples .
It is always handy to write inline asm functions as MACRO’s .
We can see many asm functions in the kernel code .
( /usr/src/linux/include/asm/*.h ) .
First we start with a simple example .
We ’ll write a program to add two numbers .
int main ( void ) { int foo = 10 , bar = 15 ; __asm__ __volatile__ ( " addl % %ebx , %%eax " :" =a " ( foo ) :" a" ( foo ) , " b" ( bar ) ) ; printf ( " foo + bar=%d
" , foo ) ; return 0 ; } Here we insist GCC to store foo in %eax , bar in %ebx and we also want the result in %eax .
The ’= ’ sign shows that it is an output register .
Now we can add an integer to a variable in some other way .
__asm__ __volatile__ ( " lock ;
" " addl %1,%0 ;
" : " =m " ( my_var ) : " ir " ( my_int ) , " m " ( my_var ) : /* no clobber - list */ ) ;
This is an atomic addition .
We can remove the instruction ’ lock ’ to remove the atomicity .
In the output field , " =m " says that my_var is an output and it is in memory .
Similarly , " ir " says that , my_int is an integer and should reside in some register ( recall the table we saw above ) .
No registers are in the clobber list .
Now we ’ll perform some action on some registers / variables and compare the value .
__asm__ __volatile__( " decl %0 ; sete % 1 " : " =m " ( my_var ) , " =q " ( cond ) : " m " ( my_var ) : " memory " ) ;
Here , the value of my_var is decremented by one and if the resulting value is 0 then , the variable cond is set .
We can add atomicity by adding an instruction " lock ;
\t " as the first instruction in assembler template .
In a similar way we can use " incl %0 " instead of " decl %0 " , so as to increment my_var .
Points to note here are that ( i ) my_var is a variable residing in memory .
( ii ) cond is in any of the registers eax , ebx , ecx and edx .
The constraint " =q " guarantees it .
( iii )
And we can see that memory is there in the clobber list .
ie , the code is changing the contents of memory .
How to set / clear a bit in a register ?
As next recipe , we are going to see it .
__asm__ __volatile__( " btsl % 1 , %0 " : " =m " ( ADDR ) : " Ir " ( pos ) : " cc " ) ;
Here , the bit at the position ’ pos ’ of variable at ADDR ( a memory variable ) is set to 1 We can use ’ btrl ’ for ’ btsl ’ to clear the bit .
The constraint " Ir " of pos says that , pos is in a register , and it ’s value ranges from 0 - 31 ( x86 dependant constraint ) .
ie , we can set / clear any bit from 0th to 31st of the variable at ADDR .
As the condition codes will be changed , we are adding " cc " to clobberlist .
Now we look at some more complicated but useful function .
String copy .
static inline char * strcpy ( char * dest , const char * src ) { int d0 , d1 , d2 ; __asm__ __volatile__ ( " 1:\tlodsb
\t " " stosb
\t " " testb % %al , % %al
\t " " jne 1b " : " =&S " ( d0 ) , " =&D " ( d1 ) , " =&a " ( d2 ) : " 0 " ( src ) , " 1 " ( dest ) : " memory " ) ; return dest ; }
The source address is stored in esi , destination in edi , and then starts the copy , when we reach at 0 , copying is complete .
Constraints " &S " , " &D " , " &a " say that the registers esi , edi and eax are early clobber registers , ie , their contents will change before the completion of the function .
Here also it ’s clear that why memory is in clobberlist .
We can see a similar function which moves a block of double words .
Notice that the function is declared as a macro .
# define mov_blk ( src , dest , numwords ) \ __asm__ __volatile__ ( \ " cld
\t " \ " rep
\t " \ " movsl " \ : \ : " S " ( src ) , " D " ( dest ) , " c " ( numwords ) \ : " %ecx " , " %esi " , " %edi " \ )
Here we have no outputs , so the changes that happen to the contents of the registers ecx , esi and edi are side effects of the block movement .
So we have to add them to the clobber list .
In Linux , system calls are implemented using GCC inline assembly .
Let us look how a system call is implemented .
All the system calls are written as macros ( linux/unistd.h ) .
For example , a system call with three arguments is defined as a macro as shown below .
# define _syscall3 ( type , name , type1,arg1, type2,arg2,type3,arg3 ) \ type name ( type1 arg1 , type2 arg2 , type3 arg3 ) \ { \ long __res ; \ __asm__ volatile ( " int $ 0x80 " \ : " =a " ( __res ) \ : " 0 " ( __NR_##name ) , " b " ( ( long ) ( arg1 ) ) , " c " ( ( long ) ( arg2 ) ) , \ " d " ( ( long ) ( arg3 ) ) ) ; \ __syscall_return ( type , __res ) ; \ } Whenever a system call with three arguments is made , the macro shown above is used to make the call .
The syscall number is placed in eax , then each parameters in ebx , ecx , edx .
And finally " int 0x80 " is the instruction which makes the system call work .
The return value can be collected from eax .
Every system calls are implemented in a similar way .
Exit is a single parameter syscall and let ’s see how it ’s code will look like .
It is as shown below .
{ asm ( " movl $ 1 , % %eax ; /* SYS_exit is 1 */ xorl % %ebx , % %ebx ; /* Argument is in ebx , it is 0 */ int $ 0x80 " /*
Enter kernel mode */ ) ; }
The number of exit is " 1 " and here , it ’s parameter is 0 .
So we arrange eax to contain 1 and ebx to contain 0 and by int $ 0x80 , the exit ( 0 ) is executed .
This is how exit works .
This document has gone through the basics of GCC Inline Assembly .
Once you have understood the basic concept it is not difficult to take steps by your own .
We saw some examples which are helpful in understanding the frequently used features of GCC Inline Assembly .
GCC Inlining is a vast subject and this article is by no means complete .
More details about the syntax ’s we discussed about is available in the official documentation for GNU Assembler .
Similarly , for a complete list of the constraints refer to the official documentation of GCC .
And of - course , the Linux kernel use GCC Inline in a large scale .
So we can find many examples of various kinds in the kernel sources .
They can help us a lot .

Einstein and Buddhism
I have begun suspecting that Einstein had either studdied Buddhism , or independantly arrived at many Buddhist conclusions on his own , or most probably both ( like me ) .
The following quotes of his tend to lead me to believe this :
A human being is part of the whole , called by us ' Universe ' ; a part limited in time and space .
He experiences himself , his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest -- a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness .
This delusion is a kind of prison for us , restricting us to our personal desires and affection for a few persons nearest us .
Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compasion to embrace all living creatures and the whole nature in its beauty .
Nobody is able to achieve this completely but striving for such achievement is , in itself , a part of the liberation and a foundation for inner security .
This is almost exactly the foundation of Buddhist thought .
And of course :
The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion .
The religion which is based on experience , which refuses dogmatism .
If there 's any religion that would cope the scientific needs it will be Buddhism �
What is it about viruses that engenders so much hair tearing ?
Are you sick of hearing about how we 're — the whole world of us — not prepared for the avian flu ?
A resurgence of Spanish Flu ?
This winter 's flu - of - the - month ( just four easy payments of $ 19.95 ! )
The next Mac virus ?
PANIC !!!!!!!!!!
So says the Mac mag - of - mags Macworld .
Now , we 're all supposed to run — not walk — out and buy anti-virus software because it 's so necessary .
I mean , six proof of concept viruses have been found since February .
An outbreak of the Mac flu that will slice , dice , and cobblerify your Mac is imminent .
After all , we 're panicking .
Remember when Mac virus software was actually necessary ?
I remember the last time that one of my computers got infested with a virus .
It was n't actually my computer .
It was the instructor 's computer in the CMU Intro to Programming lab ( yes , Wean 5419 for fellow alums ) .
It was the MPEG — no , wait , the MVOX — oh DARN , I do n't remember the name because it was frickin ' 1991 !
Since I do n't recall , I looked it up .
It was the MDEF A virus .
I got it from a pirate copy of PipeDream ( an early but VERY cool Mac game from Lucas Film Inc ) .
Remember MDEF ?
WDEF ?
Scores ?
No ?
The point is , it was 19 - frickin ' - 91 the last time anyone I knew had a Mac virus .
So what exactly are we supposed to be panicking about ?
Is OSX .
Macarena prevalent in the wild ?
Nope .
There are fewer than 49 infections worldwide .
Just like the other dangerous Mac viruses reported in the last 6 months .
Has OSX .
Macarena actually done any damage ?
Nope .
It was a " proof of concept " exploit .
Just like the others .
And it does n't do any damage , just propagates itself .
Is it hard to contain or remove ?
Nope .
Remind me why we are panicking again ?
We 're not .
The people who have anti-virus software already have it .
Any large installation should have it , without a doubt .
But you and me ?
I 'll wait for an actual threat , thanks .
It sounds too much like Symantec — and everyone else who can't assess actual risk — has a bad case of hyper - ventilating hypochondriac hysteria .
Either that , or they just want to sell more anti-virus software .
Seriously .
They ’re a shitty ad network that triggers popups , alert messages , and forced redirects on mobile devices .
Disgusting practices .
If you ’re getting redirected from ads on adnxs.com , that ’s them .
May 3 , 2011 at 11:05 pm | Posted in General | Comments Off on A Simple Math Problem
So recently a meme has been running around regarding a relatively simple math problem that confuses people due to a lot of mistaken teaching and mistaken remembering out there . 🙂
Further harming the issue is so - called “ learning ” sites like Purplemath which have incorrect information on them , and refuse to change in spite of the mistake being contrary to all basic rules of math , and not agreeing with the answers that Google and Wolfram Alpha generate .
Even more , some older graphing calculators are incorrectly programmed , and generate an answer of 1 , which many proponents of the 1 answer take as proof that they ’re right , even though far more advanced tools as linked above say otherwise .
( Not to mention , yet again , the basic rules of mathematics )
The recent problem in question is the following : 6/2( 1+2 ) , or 6 ÷ 2 ( 1+2 ) , depending on your symbol choice .
The correct answer is 9 .
Not 1 , not 7 , not anything else anyone comes up with when they make mistakes .
There are several sources of confusion with this problem – some teachers taught the order of operations incorrectly , while some students simply remember it wrong .
Others try to distribute the 2 inside the parentheses , thinking back to algebra , while others assume that implied multiplication is somehow stronger than regular multiplication1 .
I was taught PEMDAS , which stands for Parentheses , Exponents , Multiplication & Division , Addition & Subtraction .
However , some have taught or remember it as Multiplication and THEN Division , and Addition THEN Subtraction , which is wrong .
You do the M/D and A/S left to right , whichever comes first .
Wrong way :
6/2( 1+2 )
6/2*3
6/6
1
The distributing crowd is actually similar to the previous error as well .
They try to distribute , but they take only the 2 , instead of the entire 6/2 , or resulting 3 .
Wrong way :
6/2( 1+2 )
6/( 2+4 )
6/6
1
The final group start off fine , doing the parentheses first , but then leave it as 2 ( 3 ) , which is the same as 2*3 , and assume that somehow makes it stronger , when in fact they are identical .
Wrong way :
6/2( 1+2 )
6/2(3 )
6/6
1
If you fix all these issues , you get only one possible answer , 9 .
Right way :
6/2( 1+2 )
6/2*( 1+2 ) Remember , implied multiplication is still just multiplication !
6/2*3
3*3
9
If you distribute correctly , you can do this :
6/2( 1+2 )
3( 1+2 )
3*1 + 3*2
3 + 6
9
No matter how you do it , if you actually follow the rules correctly , you get 9 .

Craigslist.org owner Craig Newmark is n’t tempted to sell off his popular community classifieds site any time soon .
Even if it means billions of dollars are sitting on the table .
He seems keen to stay true to the not - for - profit - but - for - community “ not - solely - for - profit - but - for - community ” model he has used with the site .
I love Craigslist .
I have n’t paid for a classified ad in the past two years .
You can read his comments below or go to the original article link .
AMSTERDAM , Netherlands ( Reuters ) —
The founder of Craigslist.org , the free social networking and classifieds Web site , said on Thursday he is not interested in selling out , a few hours after social networking site MySpace was valued at $ 15 billion .
“ Who needs the money ?
We do n’t really care , ” Craig Newmark said in an interview at the Picnic ’06 Cross Media Week conference here .
“ If you ’re living comfortably , what ’s the point of having more ? ” Newmark said .
Just a few hours earlier , RBC Capital analyst Jordan Rohan said MySpace could be worth around $ 15 billion within three years , measured in terms of the value created for shareholders of its parent company , News Corp .
MySpace was acquired by Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corp. for $ 580 million less than a year ago .
It now boasts more than 90 million active users , against 10 million monthly users of craigslist .
Craigslist , despite its no - frills layout , gets more than four billion page views per month with just 22 employees .
Measured as a proportion of the number of employees , it claims to rank seventh amongst English language sites , behind Yahoo , AOL Time Warner , Microsoft , Google , eBay and News Corp .
Newmark said raising the money to subsequently give it away to good causes also did not interest him .
“ Finding a good cause is incredibly hard and time - consuming , ” he said , adding that he and Chief Executive Jim Buckmaster agree on not cashing in .
“ We both know some people who own more than a billion ( dollars ) and they ’re not any the happier .
They also need bodyguards , ” he said .
Craigslist is 25 percent owned by eBay after one of the shareholders who helped to set up the site in the 1990s sold his stake in 2004 .
Newmark declines to specify exactly who owns the remaining shares .

A new survey of religion in the USA finds four very different images of God — from a wrathful deity thundering at sinful humanity to a distant power uninvolved in mankind 's affairs .
Forget denominational brands or doctrines or even once - salient terms like " Religious Right . "
Even the oft - used " Evangelical " appears to be losing ground .
AMERICANS AND FAITH :
How we view God Believers just do n't see themselves the way the media and politicians — or even their pastors — do , according to the national survey of 1,721 Americans , by far the most comprehensive national religion survey to date .
Written and analyzed by sociologists from Baylor University 's Institute for Studies of Religion , in Waco , Texas , and conducted by Gallup , the survey asked 77 questions with nearly 400 answer choices that burrowed deeply into beliefs , practices and religious ties and turned up some surprising findings : • Though 91.8 % say they believe in God , a higher power or a cosmic force , they had four distinct views of God 's personality and engagement in human affairs .
These Four Gods — dubbed by researchers Authoritarian , Benevolent , Critical or Distant — tell more about people 's social , moral and political views and personal piety than the familiar categories of Protestant / Catholic / Jew or even red state / blue state .
For example : 45.6 % of all Americans say the federal government " should advocate Christian values , " but 74.5 % of believers in an authoritarian God do .
Sociologist Paul Froese says the survey finds the stereotype that conservatives are religious and liberals are secular is " simply not true .
Political liberals and conservative are both religious .
They just have different religious views . "
•
About one in nine ( 10.8 % ) respondents have no religious ties at all ; previous national surveys found 14 % .
The Baylor survey , unlike others , asked people to write in the names and addresses of where they worship , and many who said " none " or " do n't know " when asked about their religious identity named a church they occasionally attend .
•
The paranormal — beliefs outside conventional organized religion — is immensely popular .
Most people said they believe in prophetic dreams ; four in 10 say there were once " ancient advanced civilizations " such as Atlantis .
• " Evangelical " may be losing favor as a way Americans describe themselves .
About one in three Americans say they belong to denominations that theologians consider evangelical , but only 14 % of all respondents in the survey say this is one way they would describe themselves .
Only 2.2 % called it the single best term .
Top choices overall : " Bible - believing " ( 20.5 % ) or " born - again " ( 18.6 % ) .
" Any politician who really wants to connect with Christians should be looking at those terms , not vague abstractions like evangelical .
...
They need to tap into labels that have salience , " Baylor sociologist Kevin Dougherty says .
• Most Americans think their nearest and dearest are going to heaven .
The pearly gates open widest for family ( 75.3 % say they 'll get in ) and personal friends ( 69.3 % ) .
The survey did not ask whether people expect to go to heaven themselves .
• Religion - themed movies and books have a vast reach : 44.3 % of those polled saw Mel Gibson 's film The Passion of the Christ .
More than one in 10 of all surveyed say they spent $ 50 or more in the past month on items such as religious books , music and jewelry .
A closer look at what people read finds that 28.5 % of Americans say they 've read The Da Vinci Code .
Baylor also found 19 % , including 25 % of all U.S. women , have read the Rev. Rick Warren 's Christian handbook The Purpose - Driven Life , and 19 % overall have read at least one of the novels in the Left Behind apocalyptic fiction series .
These are part of the first wave of results from the random survey of Americans who completed and mailed in a 16 - page questionnaire .
Conducted in the fall of 2005 , the survey is a statistically representative sampling of the USA by age , gender and race .
The Baylor team will spend two years digging through the findings and releasing reports on subtopics such as civic involvement and volunteerism , then repeat the core questions in fall 2007 to track trends .
The research is funded by the John Templeton Foundation .
Frank Newport , editor in chief of the Gallup Poll , calls the analysis " intriguing .
Baylor was able to ask many more probing questions than the usual surveys . "
Others agree .
The Four Gods breakdown is helpful " if you are trying to understand religion 's impact on society by how people see themselves from the inside , not by observations from outsiders , " says John Green , a senior fellow at the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life .
God 's ' personality '
Baylor researchers determined the Four Gods breakdown by analyzing questions about God 's personality and engagement .
The survey asked respondents to agree or disagree with any of 10 descriptions of their " personal understanding of what God is like , " including phrases such as " angered by my sins " or " removed from worldly affairs . "
They could check off 16 adjectives they believe describe God , including words such as " absolute , " " wrathful , " " forgiving , " " friendly " or " distant . "
When USA TODAY asked people similar questions , it found views as varied as those of self - described fundamentalist Brian Snider of Madison , Ala. , and Marilyn McGuire , who says she sees God in every sunrise and sunset , flower and kitten at her home on Orcas Island near Seattle .
Snider , 46 , says God is " involved in the affairs of men at all times and he does judge us .
...
We still believe he is angry at sin . "
McGuire , in her late 60s and once an active Episcopalian , now rejects all dogma .
" I have my own system of what I think is true and sacred .
I try to keep myself peaceful and keep myself in a loving state . "
The four visions of God outlined in the Baylor research are n't mutually exclusive .
And they do n't include 5.2 % of Americans who say they are atheists .
( Although 91.8 % said they believe in God , some did n't answer or were n't sure . )
Still , says Baylor 's Christopher Bader , " you learn more about people 's moral and political behavior if you know their image of God than almost any other measure .
It turns out to be more powerful a predictor of social and political views than the usual markers of church attendance or belief in the Bible . "
Though 12.2 % overall say abortion is wrong in all circumstances , the number nearly doubles to 23.4 % for those who see an authoritarian God and slides to 1.5 % for followers of a distant God .
The four categories Highlights of Baylor 's analysis : • The Authoritarian God ( 31.4 % of Americans overall , 43.3 % in the South ) is angry at humanity 's sins and engaged in every creature 's life and world affairs .
He is ready to throw the thunderbolt of judgment down on " the unfaithful or ungodly , " Bader says .
Those who envision
God this way " are religiously and politically conservative people , more often black Protestants and white evangelicals , " Bader says .
" ( They ) want an active , Christian - values - based government with federal funding for faith - based social services and prayer in the schools . "
They 're also the most inclined to say God favors the USA in world affairs ( 32.1 % vs. 18.6 % overall ) .
• The Benevolent God ( 23 % overall , 28.7 % in the Midwest ) still sets absolute standards for mankind in the Bible .
More than half ( 54.8 % ) want the government to advocate Christian values .
But this group , which draws more from mainline Protestants , Catholics and Jews , sees primarily a forgiving God , more like the father who embraces his repentant prodigal son in the Bible , Froese says .
They 're inclined ( 68.1 % ) to say caring for the sick and needy ranks highest on the list of what it means to be a good person .
This is the group in which the Rev. Jeremy Johnston , executive pastor and communications director for his father 's 5,000 - member Southern Baptist congregation in Overland Park , Kan. , places himself .
" God is in control of everything .
He 's grieved by the sin of the world , by any created person who does n't follow him .
But I see ( a ) God ... who loves us , who sees us for who we really are .
We serve a God of the second , third , fourth and fifth chance , " Johnston says .
• The Critical God ( 16 % overall , 21.3 % in the East ) has his judgmental eye on the world , but he 's not going to intervene , either to punish or to comfort .
" This group is more paradoxical , " Bader says .
" They have very traditional beliefs , picturing God as the classic bearded old man on high .
Yet they 're less inclined to go to church or affiliate seriously with religious groups .
They are less inclined to see God as active in the world .
Their politics are definitely not liberal , but they 're not quite conservative , either . "
Those who picture a critical God are significantly less likely to draw absolute moral lines on hot - button issues such as abortion , gay marriage or embryonic stem cell research .
For example , 57 % overall say gay marriage is always wrong compared with 80.6 % for those who see an authoritarian God , and 65.8 % for those who see God as benevolent .
For those who believe in a critical God , it was 54.7 % .
• The Distant God ( 24.4 % overall , 30.3 % in the West ) is " no bearded old man in the sky raining down his opinions on us , " Bader says .
Followers of this God see a cosmic force that launched the world , then left it spinning on its own .
This has strongest appeal for Catholics , mainline Protestants and Jews .
It 's also strong among " moral relativists , " those least likely to say any moral choice is always wrong , and among those who do n't attend church , Bader says .
Only 3.8 % of this group say embryonic stem cell research is always wrong , compared with 38.5 % of those who see an authoritarian God , 22.7 % for those who see God as benevolent and 13.2 % who see God as critical but disengaged .
' God is the universe ' " I still believe in God , " says Joanne Meehl , 56 , of Barre , Mass. , who wrote a book in the mid-'90s called Recovering Catholics .
" But to me God is the universe , not as small as a ' He ' or a ' She ' but bigger than all of that . "
Humanity is on its own , she says .
" People who do wrong are punished in this world , not in the next .
This world is it . "
Some might question whether a survey by Baptist - affiliated Baylor has a conservative Protestant tilt .
For example , there 's no mention of communion or saints — central to Catholic believers .
Also , questions often used " church , " with no mention of synagogues or mosques .
But Baylor researchers say their testing finds people view the word as generic for " house of worship . "
" This work was done by well - respected sociologists of religion , " Green says .
" Baylor is becoming a leading evangelical university in the same way Notre Dame is a leading Catholic university , by doing first - rate objective social science . "
Rodney Stark , former president of the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion and part of the Baylor team , says : " We wanted to break from the past 30 years of narrow questions . " ' Do you believe in God ? '
Everyone says yes .
" If you ask ' Are you a Protestant , Catholic or Jew ? ' people do n't even know what denomination they are today or what the label means . "

How the Baylor Religion Survey was done :
The Gallup Organization contacted 3,702 potential respondents on behalf of Baylor University in fall 2005 and asked them to complete a 16 - page bookleton The Values and Beliefs of the American Public — A National Study .
The English - only survey included 77 questions with more than 350 possibleanswers .
More than 46 % of the surveys ( 1,721 ) were completed and returned .
The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points .
Michelangelo's fresco " La Creazione " depicts the making of man on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel .
But Americans have their own picture of God .
The most comprehensive national religion surveyto date , written and analyzed by sociologistsat Baylor University and conducted by Gallup , finds that Americans don?t see themselvesthe way the media , politicians or even religionexperts do .

Genetic trophy hunters , beware .
From Friday next week it will be illegal in the UK to covertly analyse someone ’s DNA .
The Human Genetics Commission ( HGC ) , which advises the UK government , says that such an act constitutes a “ gross intrusion ” on their privacy .
“ Until now there was nothing to stop an unscrupulous journalist from secretly taking an everyday object used by a public figure – for example , a coffee mug – get a DNA sample from it , have it analysed and then publish their genetic information , ” says Helena Kennedy , who chairs the HGC .

We 've got more to read right this way .
Spending more than we make
If you 're like most people , you 'll be giving your credit cards a healthy workout over the next few weeks .
So this is as good a time as any to consider a few harsh realities .
First off , the Center for American Progress , a liberal - minded think tank , has crunched data from the Federal Reserve and found that Americans for the first time owe more money than they make .
According to the center , average household debt levels topped average after - tax income by more than 29 percent as of this summer .
Moreover , the average family is now spending 14.4 percent of its disposable income on debt repayments -- the largest share since the Fed began collecting such data in 1980 .
" This is an unsustainable trend , " said Christian Weller , senior economist at the center .
" People simply can't borrow at the same rate they 've borrowed in the past . "
According to the Fed , total consumer credit debt , excluding mortgages , hit a record $ 2.4 trillion in September .
Factoring in mortgages , outstanding household debt soars to about $ 12.3 trillion .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
Average credit card interest rates were running about 13 percent last week .
But you never know .
That 's because credit cards are the only consumer product for which the terms of sale can change after you sign a contract .
Virtually all card agreements include language stipulating that the card provider can change the terms of the deal , including interest rates , " at any time for any reason . "
And as if that did n't seem sufficiently unfair for consumers , do n't forget the universal default provision .
This is an element of many card agreements that allows an issuer to jack up your rates if you miss a payment to another creditor -- even if you 've never been tardy with payments to the issuer in question .
" I think even a lot of the credit card companies find this indefensible , " said Linda Sherry , a spokeswoman for San Francisco 's Consumer Action .
" They just want to get more money out of you whenever they can . "
The American Bankers Association says such " risk - based pricing " allows more people to get credit .
" Outlawing this risk - management tool would have the effect of either restricting credit or raising the cost of credit for everyone , and we would oppose it , " the association said in a statement last year .
And then there are fees .
Card issuers will ding you for almost anything , from paying by phone to using your plastic overseas .
And if you 're ever late with a payment , forget it .
Late fees can run as high as $ 39 .
The federal Government Accountability Office said in a report last month that late fees averaged almost $ 34 last year , up more than 160 percent from $ 13 a decade ago .
The fee for exceeding your credit limit averaged about $ 31 in 2005 , up nearly 140 percent from $ 13 in 1995 .
The GAO also warned that mandatory disclosures by card issuers " have serious weaknesses that likely reduced consumers ' ability to understand the costs of using credit cards . "
It said card issuers ' disclosures are often " poorly organized , burying important information in text or scattering information about a single topic in numerous places . "
Moreover , " the design of the disclosures often made them hard to read , with large amounts of text in small , condensed typefaces and poor , ineffective headings to distinguish important topics from the surrounding text . "
All in all , the world of plastic is an uneven playing field .
This is something that should never be far from mind as you spend the next month or so probably running up your biggest credit card bills of the year .
" Every step of the way , the card companies are looking at you , " Sherry said .
" And they 're looking for ways they can charge you . "
Shifting gears : AAA mailed copies of its privacy policy this month to about 40,000 members in Northern California , Nevada and Utah .
They went to people who do n't get the association 's monthly magazine , which this summer presented readers with a published version of the policy .
Turns out the two versions are slightly but significantly different .
Both the new brochure and the magazine 's privacy policy say AAA routinely collects people 's names , addresses and phone numbers when they become members .
It also gathers more data , such as your driving record and property info , when you apply for insurance or submit a claim .
Both versions say AAA shares members ' data " with companies we have retained to provide services for us " and " as authorized by law . "
( Troubling as that may sound , the association says it does n't in fact share any data with marketers . )
The magazine version goes on to say that if you do n't want to receive marketing pitches from AAA , you can mail in an attached form or make your preference known online at AAA.com .
" This will apply to phone , mail and e-mail , " it says .
However , the newer brochure says that if you want to block phone and mail solicitations , you have to send a letter to AAA .
Going online will allow you to halt only electronic pitches , it says .
The reality is that it can all be done easily online , and you do n't have to send in a letter , which most consumers would n't bother doing .
Cynthia Harris , a AAA spokeswoman , acknowledged that all AAA members can opt out online .
But she said the association 's Web site is undergoing some changes , and no mention of the online opt - out was included in this month 's brochure because AAA did n't want there to be any confusion .
" It 's possible there might be some downtime when the opt - out feature would n't be available , " Harris explained .
It 's just as likely , though , that the online opt - out will be readily available .
Go there first .
I 've had several folks ask me what I think of Google Finance .
There 's already a fair amount of good commentary out there on the topic ( Bambi , TBAiT , Charlene , Matt , Publishing 2.0 , Blodget , and others ) , so I 'm going to answer this in a different way .
Warning :
This is long and not terribly flattering stuff that 's been under mild pressure for a few years now .
You see , I started at Yahoo ! back in 1999 as an engineer working on Yahoo !
Finance .
It was one of the sites I used most often back then , so it was a privilege to get my hands on it and really contribute in a meaningful way .
I spent roughly the next three years working with the good folks in our group , including Katie Stanton , who announced Google Finance a few days ago .
Katie was one of the best people we had in Yahoo !
Finance .
I was disappointed when she left Yahoo a few years back .
I remember chatting with her a few times when she decided to go back to work .
Trying to choose between Yahoo and Google , she asked for opinions .
How time flies ...
Last year I teased her a few times about Google Finance .
Of course , she denied that any such thing was in the works .
Since I knew it was in the works , I was n't surprised when it finally came out .
Nor was I surprised to see her affiliated with the product .
It clearly has a Yahoo !
Finance feel in several areas but with a distinctly Google flavor to it .
I have minor complaints about it , but I think it 's a good start aside from the fixed width home page .
Sadness
So why does this make Jeremy sad ?
It makes me sad because I end up thinking about how Yahoo !
Finance has stagnated for a long time .
It never really recovered from the pain of the dotcom crash .
So many of my old Finance coworkers have either left the company or moved on to other groups ( several moved into Search last year ) .
Heck , I encouraged many of them to get out !
There was a lack of leadership and , even more importantly , a serious LACK OF VISION .
It really disappointed me .
It makes me sad because virtually all of the new / innovative / cool features in Google Finance are things we talked about YEARS ago .
Many of them I 'd lobbied for repeatedly .
Some were even prototyped .
A ticker search that does n't suck .
Charts with overlays for news events .
Blog integration .
Featuring discussions more prominently .
RSS support .
Who 's gonna get " credit " for all that now ?
I 'm not gonna name names ( virtually none of them are around anymore anyway ) , but there was a real lack of leadership in Finance for long time and it really sucked the life out of the group .
Users noticed .
Finance employees noticed .
Other Yahoos noticed .
We all knew it .
And , frankly , I was glad to be out when I moved on ( and the next time and the time after that ) .
Over the years since leaving , I 've made pleas to numerous people in the Finance organization : engineers , product managers , engineering managers , editorial , and so on -- veteran employees and newbies alike .
Push into community more .
Get more into personal finance , not just the high - end Wall Street stuff .
Adopt blogging and syndication .
Get around to those chart improvements we 'd talked about .
Fix up the message boards .
( Remind me to tell the story of how they freaked out when I snuck RSS feeds out back in 2002 .
It took another TWO YEARS before someone re-did that work and finally shipped it .
But the RSS train had already left the station by that time . )
Radio silence .
Last year I started talking about Google Finance and they got a little excited .
They talked more about all the stuff they could maybe do .
Asked for some input ( again ) .
My hope was renewed for a while .
During all that time , I purposely did n't write anything here about my frustration and disappointment .
I 've been accused of using my writing in public as a instrument to instigate internal change at Yahoo .
I 've been accused of complaining in public before talking to folks internally .
So I tried to be a good Yahoo and give my suggestions to anyone who 'd listen .
On the other hand , people tell me they like reading my stuff because it's not sanitized corporate PR speak and I 'm not always painting a rosy picture of what goes on .
Instead , I tell it like it is -- from my point of view , of course .
Well , here we are .
As a company , we need to get better about facing this stuff , dealing with it , and get back to kicking ass .
But I have no idea how to make that happen .
Maybe this will result in some useful discussion somewhere .
There 's a light at the end of the tunnel .
All hope is not lost .
Unlike a small number of Google product launches , this one did n't blow the doors off .
It 's no Gmail or Google Maps .
Yahoo !
Finance is n't out of the game .
But I sure as hell hope this is a wake - up call !
On the flip side , Katie 's a kick - ass product manager and knows the Finance world very well .
I can only imagine what else they 're cooking up .
The clock is ticking .

2006 -09 - 18 Iraq A Marine Intel Officer in Al Anbar Shares Some Thoughts A Marine Intel Officer in Al Anbar Shares Some Thoughts
( Courtesy of former Cpl Denny Argall , USMC )
Via e-mail from a retired Army Colonel friend of mine .
I LOVED " The Best Chuck Norris Moment " but all of it is interesting .
Classification : UNCLASSIFIED
All : I havent written very much from Iraq .
There s really not much to write about .
More exactly , theres not much I can write about because practically everything I do , read or hear is classified military information or is depressing to the point that Id rather just forget about it , never mind write about it .
The gaps in between all of that are filled with the pure tedium of daily life in an armed camp .
So its a bit of a struggle to think of anything to put into a letter that s worth reading .
Worse , this place just consumes you .
I work 18 - 20 - hour days , every day .
The quest to draw a clear picture of what the insurgents are up to never ends .
Problems and frictions crop up faster than solutions .
Every challenge demands a response .
It s like this every day .
Before I know it , I cant see straight , because its 0400 and Ive been at work for twenty hours straight , somehow missing dinner again in the process .
And once again I havent written to anyone .
It starts all over again four hours later .
It s not really like Ground Hog Day , it s more like a level from Dantes Inferno .
Rather than attempting to sum up the last seven months , I figured Id just hit the record setting highlights of 2006 in Iraq .
These are among the events and experiences Ill remember best .
Continued from Page 4
Worst Case of Deja Vu -
I thought I was familiar with the feeling of deja vu until I arrived back here in Fallujah in February .
The moment I stepped off of the helicopter , just as dawn broke , and saw the camp just as I had left it ten months before - that was deja vu .
Kind of unnerving .
It was as if I had never left .
Same work area , same busted desk , same chair , same computer , same room , same creaky rack , same . . . everything .
Same everything for the next year .
It was like entering a parallel universe .
Home wasnt 10,000 miles away , it was a different lifetime .
Most Surreal Moment - Watching Marines arrive at my detention facility and unload a truck load of flex - cuffed midgets .
26 to be exact .
I had put the word out earlier in the day to the Marines in Fallujah that we were looking for Bad Guy X , who was described as a midget .
Little did I know that Fallujah was home to a small community of midgets , who banded together for support since they were considered as social outcasts .
The Marines were anxious to get back to the midget colony to bring in the rest of the midget suspects , but I called off the search , figuring Bad Guy X was long gone on his short legs after seeing his companions rounded up by the giant infidels .
Most Profound Man in Iraq - an unidentified farmer in a fairly remote area who , after being asked by Reconnaissance Marines ( searching for Syrians ) if he had seen any foreign fighters in the area replied  Yes , you . 
Worst City in al - Anbar Province - Ramadi , hands down .
The provincial capital of 400,000 people .
Killed over 1,000 insurgents in there since we arrived in February .
Every day is a nasty gun battle .
They blast us with giant bombs in the road , snipers , mortars and small arms .
We blast them with tanks , attack helicopters , artillery , our snipers ( much better than theirs ) , and every weapon that an infantryman can carry .
Every day .
Incredibly , I rarely see Ramadi in the news .
We have as many attacks out here in the west as Baghdad .
Yet , Baghdad has 7 million people , we have just 1.2 million .
Per capita , al - Anbar province is the most violent place in Iraq by several orders of magnitude .
I suppose it was no accident that the Marines were assigned this area in 2003 .
Bravest Guy in al - Anbar Province - Any Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technician ( EOD Tech ) .
Howd you like a job that required you to defuse bombs in a hole in the middle of the road that very likely are booby - trapped or connected by wire to a bad guy whos just waiting for you to get close to the bomb before he clicks the detonator ?
Every day .
Sanitation workers in New York City get paid more than these guys .
Talk about courage and commitment .
Second Bravest Guy in al - Anbar Province 
It s a 20,000 way tie among all the Marines and Soldiers who venture out on the highways and through the towns of al - Anbar every day , not knowing if it will be their last - and for a couple of them , it will be .
Best Piece of U.S. Gear - new , bullet - proof flak jackets .
O.K. , they weigh 40 lbs and arent exactly comfortable in 120 degree heat , but theyve saved countless lives out here .
Best Piece of Bad Guy Gear - Armor Piercing ammunition that goes right through the new flak jackets and the Marines inside them .
Worst E- Mail Message   The Walking Blood Bank is Activated .
We need blood type A+ stat . 
I always head down to the surgical unit as soon as I get these messages , but I never give blood  theres always about 80 Marines in line , night or day .
Biggest Surprise - Iraqi Police .
All local guys .
I never figured that wed get a police force established in the cities in al - Anbar .
I estimated that insurgents would kill the first few , scaring off the rest .
Well , insurgents did kill the first few , but the cops kept on coming .
The insurgents continue to target the police , killing them in their homes and on the streets , but the cops wont give up .
Absolutely incredible tenacity .
The insurgents know that the police are far better at finding them than we are .
- and they are finding them .
Now , if we could just get them out of the habit of beating prisoners to a pulp . . .
Greatest Vindication - Stocking up on outrageous quantities of Diet Coke from the chow hall in spite of the derision from my men on such hoarding , then having a 122 mm rocket blast apart the giant shipping container that held all of the soda for the chow hall .
Yep , you cant buy experience .
Biggest Mystery -
How some people can gain weight out here .
I m down to 165 lbs .
Who has time to eat ?
Second Biggest Mystery - if theres no atheists in foxholes , then why arent there more people at Mass every Sunday ?
Favorite Iraqi TV Show - Oprah .
I have no idea .
They all have satellite TV .
Coolest Insurgent Act -
Stealing almost $ 7 million from the main bank in Ramadi in broad daylight , then , upon exiting , waving to the Marines in the combat outpost right next to the bank , who had no clue of what was going on .
The Marines waved back .
Too cool .
Most Memorable Scene -
In the middle of the night , on a dusty airfield , watching the better part of a battalion of Marines packed up and ready to go home after six months in al - Anbar , the relief etched in their young faces even in the moonlight .
Then watching these same Marines exchange glances with a similar number of grunts loaded down with gear file past - their replacements .
Nothing was said .
Nothing needed to be said .
Highest Unit Re-enlistment Rate -
Any outfit that has been in Iraq recently .
All the danger , all the hardship , all the time away from home , all the horror , all the frustrations with the fight here - all are outweighed by the desire for young men to be part of a ' Band of Brothers ' who will die for one another .
They found what they were looking for when they enlisted out of high school .
Man for man , they now have more combat experience than any Marines in the history of our Corps .
Most Surprising Thing I Dont Miss - Beer .
Perhaps being half - stunned by lack of sleep makes up for it .
Worst Smell - Porta - johns in 120 degree heat - and that s 120 degrees outside of the porta - john .
Highest Temperature - I dont know exactly , but it was in the porta - johns .
Needed to re-hydrate after each trip to the loo .
Biggest Hassle - High - ranking visitors .
More disruptive to work than a rocket attack .
VIPs demand briefs and battlefield  tours ( we take them to quiet sections of Fallujah , which is plenty scary for them ) .
Our briefs and commentary seem to have no affect on their preconceived notions of whats going on in Iraq .
Their trips allow them to say that theyve been to Fallujah , which gives them an unfortunate degree of credibility in perpetuating their fantasies about the insurgency here .
Biggest Outrage - Practically anything said by talking heads on TV about the war in Iraq , not that I get to watch much TV .
Their thoughts are consistently both grossly simplistic and politically slanted .
Biggest offender - Bill OReilly - what a buffoon .
Best Intel Work - Finding Jill Carrolls kidnappers - all of them .
I was mighty proud of my guys that day .
I figured wed all get the Christian Science Monitor for free after this , but none have showed up yet .
Talk about ingratitude .
Saddest Moment - Having the battalion commander from 1st Battalion , 1st Marines hand me the dog tags of one of my Marines who had just been killed while on a mission with his unit .
Hit by a 60 mm mortar .
Cpl Bachar was a great Marine .
I felt crushed for a long time afterward .
His picture now hangs at the entrance to the Intelligence Section .
Well carry it home with us when we leave in February .
Biggest Ass - Chewing - 10 July immediately following a visit by the Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister , Dr. Zobai .
The Deputy Prime Minister brought along an American security contractor ( read mercenary ) , who told my Commanding General that he was there to act as a mediator between us and the Bad Guys .
I immediately told him what I thought of him and his asinine ideas in terms that made clear my disgust and which , unfortunately , are unrepeatable here .
I thought my boss was going to have a heart attack .
Fortunately , the translator couldnt figure out the best Arabic words to convey my meaning for the Deputy Prime Minister .
Later , the boss had no difficulty in convening his meaning to me in English regarding my Irish temper , even though he agreed with me .
At least the guy from the State Department thought it was hilarious .
We never saw the mercenary again .
Best Chuck Norris Moment - 13 May .
Bad Guys arrived at the government center in the small town of Kubaysah to kidnap the town mayor , since they have a problem with any form of government that does not include regular beheadings and women wearing burqahs .
There were seven of them .
As they brought the mayor out to put him in a pick - up truck to take him off to be beheaded ( on video , as usual ) , one of the bad Guys put down his machinegun so that he could tie the mayors hands .
The mayor took the opportunity to pick up the machinegun and drill five of the Bad Guys .
The other two ran away .
One of the dead Bad Guys was on our top twenty wanted list .
Like they say , you cant fight City Hall .
Worst Sound -
That crack - boom off in the distance that means an IED or mine just went off .
You just wonder who got it , hoping that it was a near miss rather than a direct hit .
Hear it every day .
Second Worst Sound -
Our artillery firing without warning .
The howitzers are pretty close to where I work .
Believe me , outgoing sounds a lot like incoming when our guns are firing right over our heads .
Theyd about knock the fillings out of your teeth .
Only Thing Better in Iraq Than in the U.S. - Sunsets .
Spectacular .
It s from all the dust in the air .
Proudest Moment 
It s a tie every day , watching my Marines produce phenomenal intelligence products that go pretty far in teasing apart Bad Guy operations in al - Anbar .
Every night Marines and Soldiers are kicking in doors and grabbing Bad Guys based on intelligence developed by my guys .
We rarely lose a Marine during these raids , they are so well - informed of the objective .
A bunch of kids right out of high school shouldnt be able to work so well , but they do .
Happiest Moment -
Well , it wasnt in Iraq .
There are no truly happy moments here .
It was back in California when I was able to hold my family again while home on leave during July .
Most Common Thought - Home .
Always thinking of home , of Kathleen and the kids .
Wondering how everyone else is getting along .
Regretting that I dont write more .
Yep , always thinking of home .
I hope you all are doing well .
If you want to do something for me , kiss a cop , flush a toilet , and drink a beer .
Ill try to write again before too long - I promise .
Semper Fi , A Marine Intel Officer in Al Anbar Shares Some Thoughts ( Courtesy of former Cpl Denny Argall , USMC ) Classification : UNCLASSIFIEDAll : I havent written very much from Iraq .
There s really not much to write about .
More exactly , theres not much I can write about because practically everything I do , read or hear is classified military information or is depressing to the point that Id rather just forget about it , never mind write about it .
The gaps in between all of that are filled with the pure tedium of daily life in an armed camp .
So its a bit of a struggle to think of anything to put into a letter that s worth reading .
Worse , this place just consumes you .
I work 18 - 20 - hour days , every day .
The quest to draw a clear picture of what the insurgents are up to never ends .
Problems and frictions crop up faster than solutions .
Every challenge demands a response .
It s like this every day .
Before I know it , I cant see straight , because its 0400 and Ive been at work for twenty hours straight , somehow missing dinner again in the process .
And once again I havent written to anyone .
It starts all over again four hours later .
It s not really like Ground Hog Day , it s more like a level from Dantes Inferno .
Rather than attempting to sum up the last seven months , I figured Id just hit the record setting highlights of 2006 in Iraq .
These are among the events and experiences Ill remember best .
Worst Case of Deja Vu -
I thought I was familiar with the feeling of deja vu until I arrived back here in Fallujah in February .
The moment I stepped off of the helicopter , just as dawn broke , and saw the camp just as I had left it ten months before - that was deja vu .
Kind of unnerving .
It was as if I had never left .
Same work area , same busted desk , same chair , same computer , same room , same creaky rack , same . . . everything .
Same everything for the next year .
It was like entering a parallel universe .
Home wasnt 10,000 miles away , it was a different lifetime .
Most Surreal Moment - Watching Marines arrive at my detention facility and unload a truck load of flex - cuffed midgets .
26 to be exact .
I had put the word out earlier in the day to the Marines in Fallujah that we were looking for Bad Guy X , who was described as a midget .
Little did I know that Fallujah was home to a small community of midgets , who banded together for support since they were considered as social outcasts .
The Marines were anxious to get back to the midget colony to bring in the rest of the midget suspects , but I called off the search , figuring Bad Guy X was long gone on his short legs after seeing his companions rounded up by the giant infidels .
Most Profound Man in Iraq - an unidentified farmer in a fairly remote area who , after being asked by Reconnaissance Marines ( searching for Syrians ) if he had seen any foreign fighters in the area replied  Yes , you .
Worst City in al - Anbar Province - Ramadi , hands down .
The provincial capital of 400,000 people .
Killed over 1,000 insurgents in there since we arrived in February .
Every day is a nasty gun battle .
They blast us with giant bombs in the road , snipers , mortars and small arms .
We blast them with tanks , attack helicopters , artillery , our snipers ( much better than theirs ) , and every weapon that an infantryman can carry .
Every day .
Incredibly , I rarely see Ramadi in the news .
We have as many attacks out here in the west as Baghdad .
Yet , Baghdad has 7 million people , we have just 1.2 million .
Per capita , al - Anbar province is the most violent place in Iraq by several orders of magnitude .
I suppose it was no accident that the Marines were assigned this area in 2003 .
Bravest Guy in al - Anbar Province - Any Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technician ( EOD Tech ) .
Howd you like a job that required you to defuse bombs in a hole in the middle of the road that very likely are booby - trapped or connected by wire to a bad guy whos just waiting for you to get close to the bomb before he clicks the detonator ?
Every day .
Sanitation workers in New York City get paid more than these guys .
Talk about courage and commitment .
Second Bravest
Guy in al - Anbar Province 
It s a 20,000 way tie among all the Marines and Soldiers who venture out on the highways and through the towns of al - Anbar every day , not knowing if it will be their last - and for a couple of them , it will be .
Best Piece of U.S. Gear - new , bullet - proof flak jackets .
O.K. , they weigh 40 lbs and arent exactly comfortable in 120 degree heat , but theyve saved countless lives out here .
Best Piece of Bad Guy Gear - Armor Piercing ammunition that goes right through the new flak jackets and the Marines inside them .
Worst E - Mail Message   The Walking Blood Bank is Activated .
We need blood type A+ stat . 
I always head down to the surgical unit as soon as I get these messages , but I never give blood  theres always about 80 Marines in line , night or day .
Biggest Surprise - Iraqi Police .
All local guys .
I never figured that wed get a police force established in the cities in al - Anbar .
I estimated that insurgents would kill the first few , scaring off the rest .
Well , insurgents did kill the first few , but the cops kept on coming .
The insurgents continue to target the police , killing them in their homes and on the streets , but the cops wont give up .
Absolutely incredible tenacity .
The insurgents know that the police are far better at finding them than we are .
- and they are finding them .
Now , if we could just get them out of the habit of beating prisoners to a pulp . . . Greatest Vindication - Stocking up on outrageous quantities of Diet Coke from the chow hall in spite of the derision from my men on such hoarding , then having a 122 mm rocket blast apart the giant shipping container that held all of the soda for the chow hall .
Yep , you cant buy experience .
Biggest Mystery -
How some people can gain weight out here .
I m down to 165 lbs .
Who has time to eat ?
Second Biggest Mystery - if theres no atheists in foxholes , then why arent there more people at Mass every Sunday ?
Favorite Iraqi TV Show - Oprah .
I have no idea .
They all have satellite TV .
Coolest Insurgent Act - Stealing almost $ 7 million from the main bank in Ramadi in broad daylight , then , upon exiting , waving to the Marines in the combat outpost right next to the bank , who had no clue of what was going on .
The Marines waved back .
Too cool .
Most Memorable Scene -
In the middle of the night , on a dusty airfield , watching the better part of a battalion of Marines packed up and ready to go home after six months in al - Anbar , the relief etched in their young faces even in the moonlight .
Then watching these same Marines exchange glances with a similar number of grunts loaded down with gear file past - their replacements .
Nothing was said .
Nothing needed to be said .
Highest Unit Re-enlistment Rate -
Any outfit that has been in Iraq recently .
All the danger , all the hardship , all the time away from home , all the horror , all the frustrations with the fight here - all are outweighed by the desire for young men to be part of a ' Band of Brothers ' who will die for one another .
They found what they were looking for when they enlisted out of high school .
Man for man , they now have more combat experience than any Marines in the history of our Corps .
Most Surprising Thing I Dont Miss - Beer .
Perhaps being half - stunned by lack of sleep makes up for it .
Worst Smell - Porta - johns in 120 degree heat - and that s 120 degrees outside of the porta - john .
Highest Temperature - I dont know exactly , but it was in the porta - johns .
Needed to re-hydrate after each trip to the loo .
Biggest Hassle - High - ranking visitors .
More disruptive to work than a rocket attack .
VIPs demand briefs and battlefield  tours ( we take them to quiet sections of Fallujah , which is plenty scary for them ) .
Our briefs and commentary seem to have no affect on their preconceived notions of whats going on in Iraq .
Their trips allow them to say that theyve been to Fallujah , which gives them an unfortunate degree of credibility in perpetuating their fantasies about the insurgency here .
Biggest Outrage - Practically anything said by talking heads on TV about the war in Iraq , not that I get to watch much TV .
Their thoughts are consistently both grossly simplistic and politically slanted .
Biggest offender - Bill OReilly - what a buffoon .
Best Intel Work - Finding Jill Carrolls kidnappers - all of them .
I was mighty proud of my guys that day .
I figured wed all get the Christian Science Monitor for free after this , but none have showed up yet .
Talk about ingratitude .
Saddest Moment - Having the battalion commander from 1st Battalion , 1st Marines hand me the dog tags of one of my Marines who had just been killed while on a mission with his unit .
Hit by a 60 mm mortar .
Cpl Bachar was a great Marine .
I felt crushed for a long time afterward .
His picture now hangs at the entrance to the Intelligence Section .
Well carry it home with us when we leave in February .
Biggest Ass - Chewing - 10 July immediately following a visit by the Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister , Dr. Zobai .
The Deputy Prime Minister brought along an American security contractor ( read mercenary ) , who told my Commanding General that he was there to act as a mediator between us and the Bad Guys .
I immediately told him what I thought of him and his asinine ideas in terms that made clear my disgust and which , unfortunately , are unrepeatable here .
I thought my boss was going to have a heart attack .
Fortunately , the translator couldnt figure out the best Arabic words to convey my meaning for the Deputy Prime Minister .
Later , the boss had no difficulty in convening his meaning to me in English regarding my Irish temper , even though he agreed with me .
At least the guy from the State Department thought it was hilarious .
We never saw the mercenary again .
Best Chuck Norris Moment - 13 May .
Bad Guys arrived at the government center in the small town of Kubaysah to kidnap the town mayor , since they have a problem with any form of government that does not include regular beheadings and women wearing burqahs .
There were seven of them .
As they brought the mayor out to put him in a pick - up truck to take him off to be beheaded ( on video , as usual ) , one of the bad Guys put down his machinegun so that he could tie the mayors hands .
The mayor took the opportunity to pick up the machinegun and drill five of the Bad Guys .
The other two ran away .
One of the dead Bad Guys was on our top twenty wanted list .

Always thinking of home , of Kathleen and the kids .
Wondering how everyone else is getting along .
Regretting that I dont write more .
Yep , always thinking of home .
I hope you all are doing well .
If you want to do something for me , kiss a cop , flush a toilet , and drink a beer .

1. Welfare recipients :
The overwhelming majority of people who receive aid from welfare programs do not receive it for more than a few months at a time .
Less than 20 % of recipients from one year are still on welfare the following year .
Almost everyone wants to be working and earning a living , it is only a small percentage of the population that is cheating the system .
A significant portion of people in this category are people that are mentally ill .
Are these people to blame for their own illness ?
( No ) .
Is the government to blame for kicking these people out of mental institutions and onto the streets where they commit crimes and strain our services ?
( Yes ) .
Another significant chunk is addicted to drugs .
And while you can clearly blame these people for the initial decision to take a drug , how many people in history have chosen to become addicted to a drug ?
While it is debatable whether these people are to blame for their addiction , there is no question that the government is to blame for failing to provide treatment for addicts and for things like the failed invasion of Afghanistan , which helped created the largest poppy crop in history .
A third large group of permanent welfare recipients ( or long - term recipients ) are divorced women with children .
Many of these women took the advice that many conservatives give them -- get married and become stay - at - home mothers .
But when nearly half of all marriages end in divorce ( many of them rightly so ) , what happens to the man and woman afterward ?
The man , on average , has a significant increase in his financial status .
He loses the cost of taking care of a full family and has no negative impact on his career .
Women , on the other hand , lose the primary income they had .
And since many of them had spent years cleaning house and raising children ( both valid and honorable jobs , by the way ) , they were n't spending time obtaining education and experience in the workforce .
So when they are forced , all of a sudden , to go find a job , they do n't have the skills , education or experience to get a good , high - paying job .
And the generally end up with custody of any children , including primary responsibility , in most cases , of paying for most of the bills related to the children .
This translate to a situation where welfare is not only an attractive option , for many it is the only option .
Sure , there is some blame to be laid on the woman who chooses her husband poorly , but the bigger blame is on a system that pushes women to make that choice .
In particular , a lot of the blame on this one can be laid at the feet of conservatives who push marriage like it is the solution to all problems , which it is n't .
2. Children : A large proportion of the recipients of welfare programs are children .
There is no valid argument that children are being irresponsible by receiving government assistance .
Similarly , there is no valid argument suggesting that a child should pay the penalty for the mistakes or problems of their parents .
3 . No real problem :
If we take the above categories out of the equation , we 're left with a really , really small percentage of the population that is cheating or defrauding the system .
Sure , there are some people that totally lack personaly responsibility and are living off the government .
But they are a lot less than 1 % of the population and less than 1 % of the budget , so they really are n't a significant societal problem .
Conservatives like to attack this group because they are defenseless and are an easy target , but they are n't something that causes any real damage to society .
4. Double standard : Conservatives are all about attacking poor people for lacking in personal responsibility , but they rarely , if ever , attack other groups for lacking in responsibility .
They generally oppose government investigations of people accused of corporate crime or ethical lapses in elected office ( unless they are Republicans ) .
They have no problem giving drug users stiffer prison sentences than multi-million dollar embezzlers .
The standard for conservatives is clear -- people who come from conservative groups do n't have to have personal responsibility , but people coming from liberal groups do .
5 . The real cost of welfare :
The programs we are talking about are really , really inexpensive .
All welfare programs for the poor add up to less than $ 200 billion .
Out of a budget of $ 2.7 trillion , we 're talking a relatively small percentage .
Welfare programs for the middle and upper classes , though , add up to nearly a trillion dollars .
If we eliminated every welfare program for the poor , you would not , in any way , notice the difference in your taxes , even if all of the money was refunded .
6 . Everybody gets help : Nobody is successful in America without the help of the government .
Schools , roads , national defense , police , fire fighters , clean air , clean water , safe food , minimum wage , etc. , etc. , -- everyone gets help along the way from the government .
Furthermore , almost everyone recieves help along the way from others , too -- family , friends , legacy enrollments , family inheritance , etc .
But some in society do n't have as much in the way of help from these other areas .
In order to make sure that there really is equality of opportunity in America -- something conservatives champion -- it is necessary , then , for the government to step in and help these people .
7. Learning to be poor : Nobody aspires to be poor .
Few people start out rich and become poor .
Poverty breeds poverty .
If you grow up in a poor household , you are unlikely to gain the knowledge needed to advance in soceity the same way people who grow up middle class or above .
If someone is poor and does n't know how to get out of poverty , how can they possibly teach skills and knowledge they do n't have to their children ?
And if you grow up poor and your parents do n't teach you the skills needed to advance in society , how can you be blamed for that fact ?
I 've worked with poor people and I 've been poor and there are a few things that are nearly universal amongst the poor .
Most poor people have low levels of education .
They do n't have the skills needed to make it through school .
They do n't have the basic skills needed to get even a basic job and keep it .
They do n't have interpersonal skills or many of the things that people refer to as " common sense . "
Many of them are illiterate or read significantly below adult level .
It 's not that they can't get these things , they certainly can , it 's that they do n't automatically have them and they do n't automatically know how to obtain them .
In fact , many people at the bottom of the ladder do n't know that they even need these skills .
If there is a guy in Georgia giving out a million dollars to every person who comes and asks him for it and you never hear about the guy , then you 'll never get your free million dollars .
And even if you do hear about him , if you do n't have any way to get to Georgia , you still wo n't get the money .
8. Morality : We have two million American prisoners in this country .
They all have food , shelter , clothing , and other basic needs met no matter what they do .
We have thousands of enemies of our country in custody , from the lowliest terrorist all the way up to Saddam Hussein -- they all have food , shelter , clothing and other basic needs met no matter what they do .
I do n't know too many conservatives who have a problem with this concept .
But the very same people have a big problem if we make sure that our own law - abiding citizens have food , shelter , clothing and other basic needs met .
We do n't currently do this for all of our poorest citizens and that is 100 % the fault of conservatives who are the people that block such programs .
So what these people are saying is that Saddam Hussein deserves more from our government than does a poor child who has dumb or lazy or mentally ill parents .
That 's immoral by any standard .
9 . Punishment fitting the crime :
The worst part of all this , as far as I 'm concerned , is the idea that conservatives want to punish people for committing a perceived crime with a punishment that is way out of proportion to the supposed offense .
Let 's say that someone is lazy .
Let 's say that they wo n't work no matter what you do to them .
Conservatives would basically advocate a passive death penalty for such a person .
They say no government benefits .
No guaranteed food .
No guaranteed shelter .
No guaranteed clothing .
No guaranteed health care , even in the worst - case scenarios .
Well what happens to human beings who are without food , shelter , clothing and basic medical care ?
They die .
Hunger and homelessness are not valid punishments for the violation of any law in the United States .
So why is it that conservatives argue that we should punish lazy people with hunger and homelessness .
And that 's giving them the benefit of the doubt that poor people actually are lazy ( something I do n't believe is true except in a few extreme cases ) .
We should not allow a form of punishment for something that is legal -- there is no law against laziness -- that is harsher than the penalty for things that are legal .
You could get drunk and drive and kill someone and not be forced to be hungry and homeless .
It 's the same concept as the people who argue that we should be able to shoot looters in times of disaster or crisis .
It is n't legal to shoot people for theft in normal times , why would it be legal when times are tough ?
Besides , there are no arguments that we should be able to shoot price gougers during times of crises and they are committing the exact same crime .
They are n't doing it out of deprivation or need , though , they 're doing it out of pure greed .
Similarly , we do n't punish lazy rich people , do we ?
When 's the last time you saw one of Sam Walton 's kids doing something useful for society ?
But they are certainly amongst the richest people in the world -- through no effort of their own .
We reward rich , lazy people .
We force poor , lazy people to live in homeless shelters and eat out of trash cans .
Now I 'm certainly a firm believer in personal responsibility .
I started out as one of these extremely poor people and made my way up the ladder with the help of welfare programs and financial aid .
Was it easy ?
Hell no .
It was incredibly difficult and I had to fight every step of the way against not only money and social expectations , but against my own learned instincts and lack of knowledge about how to make my way in the world .
Would I have made it without help from a lot of people along the way ?
Absolutley not .
Well , there are a lot of people who do n't get the help I got .
Do they choose to be poor , uneducated and on welfare .
Absolutely no way , but they do n't know how to make it on their own and if they do n't get the help , it is extremely difficult to make it .
Solution :
There really is n't a solution for welfare reform .
It is n't really an issue that needs a solution .
The programs we have work .
We could certainly increase funding and increase requirements for education and job training .
We could also remove the impediments to getting off welfare -- a ridiculously low minimum wage , a lack of universal health care , barriers to education and subsidized child care -- that would make welfare unnecessary , which should be the goal .
We are a long way from that goal , though , and are moving in the wrong direction .
The divided nature of our economy also hurts -- this is a great economy if you are rich , but not so great if you are poor or even middle class .
A return to the Clinton - styled economy would help everyone and help lessen the need for welfare and , at the same time , help more people take personal responsibility .
Judge arrested in Aruba case Fifth suspect in custody after U.S. teen 's disappearance Paul Van Der Sloot was arrested after being questioned by police as a witness over the weekend .

An Aruban judge , the father of a 17 - year - old suspect in the disappearance of an Alabama teenager , also has been arrested in the case , the island 's police commissioner said Thursday .
Prosecutors decided to keep Paul Van Der Sloot , 53 , in custody for questioning for 48 hours , Aruba Police Commissioner Jan Van Der Straten said .
Under Aruban law , if there is reasonable suspicion , the prosecutor 's office can order a suspect held as long as another 48 hours .
After that , a judge 's decision is required to keep a suspect in jail .
The legal system in Aruba , an autonomous member of the Kingdom of the Netherlands , is based partly on Dutch civil law .
The father was arrested at about 2 p.m. on suspicion of involvement in the disappearance of Natalee Holloway , an 18 - year - old from suburban Birmingham , Alabama , said prosecution spokeswoman Mariaine Croes .
" At this point he 's a suspect , " Croes said .
" There 's a reasonable suspicion that he knows something and is involved in the disappearance of Ms. Holloway . "
Police questioned him over the weekend in connection with the case .
A law enforcement source close to the investigation said at the time that the judge was interviewed as a witness .
He spent about five hours in the police station Saturday for questioning and was brought in again on Sunday while his wife , Anita , visited their 17 - year - old son , Joran .
Last week , an Aruban judge ruled that Paul Van Der Sloot could not visit his son in jail .
Earlier , authorities had searched Van Der Sloot 's home , seizing two cars and removing bagfuls of evidence .
Anita Van Der Sloot said Thursday her husband 's arrest is " ridiculous . "
" It hurts because my husband gave 15 years of his integrity to this island , and that this could happen is so bizarre . "
" I do n't understand , and I know a lot of people do n't understand , what 's going on , " she said .
" I 'm very angry , but I will hold up . "
" I have to because I believe in my husband , I believe in my son , " she said .
" It will all will be fine . "
She said she met with Joran for about 40 minutes Thursday before receiving word that police were at her home to arrest her husband .
Her son is " doing fine , " she said .
" I know he 's innocent , and he knows he 's innocent . "
Family ' relieved ' Natalee Holloway 's aunt , Marcia Twitty , said her family was " very relieved " by the judge 's arrest .
" Maybe we can get somewhere and finally get these answers that they so desperately , desperately want , " she told CNN from Alabama .
The missing girl 's father , David Holloway , said the arrest " just adds that additional piece to the puzzle .
" How big is the puzzle ?
I do n't know , but the pieces are falling into place and falling into place very quickly , " he told CNN affiliate WBRC .
Natalee 's mother , Beth Holloway Twitty , said Wednesday she 's sure the four young men in custody -- but not formally charged in the case -- have more information to divulge .
" I have no doubt that they know what and who and where and when and why and how .
I have no doubt , " Twitty said on NBC's " Today Show . "
" There are some other individuals , though , that need to be pursued , " she added .
Twitty told CNN she met Tuesday with the parents of Joran Van Der Sloot .
He 's one of the last people reported to have seen Holloway .
She said the Van Der Sloots invited her into their home when she was handing out prayer cards in their neighborhood .
Twitty refused to give details about their 90 - minute discussion .
" I think I walked away with the confirmation that we still have some individuals that we need to pursue , " she said .
Holloway , an honors student from the Birmingham suburb of Mountain Brook , disappeared May 30 after she left a nightclub with Joran Van Der Sloot and brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe , ages 21 and 18 respectively , authorities said .
She was in Aruba , a small Caribbean island of 72,000 residents just north of Venezuela , with about 100 classmates to celebrate their recent graduation .
The three men and a fourth suspect , 26 - year - old disc jockey Steve Croes , face accusations of murder and kidnapping leading to murder .
Twitty says she has seen " no evidence whatsoever " that her daughter is dead .
Defense attorneys for Van Der Sloot and the Kalpoes have said their clients maintain their innocence .
Marcia Twitty said that after meeting with the Van Der Sloots , the missing girl 's mother told her : " ' I still feel like that dad knows something about where Natalee is . ' "
" She 's in very close contact with officials , both Aruban and FBI , " she said .
" They talk daily . "
Satish Kalpoe to mom : ' We did n't do anything '
The mother of the Kalpoes said Thursday that one son had admitted he and his brother made up a cover story to protect Joran Van Der Sloot .
Nadira Ramirez told CNN she was permitted to visit son Satish Kalpoe at Aruba 's prison within the past week .
She stressed that the teen told her their story was not planned ahead of Holloway 's disappearance , and she had no advance knowledge of it .
Initially , Ramirez said , her sons had told her and police they dropped Holloway off at the Holiday Inn , where she was staying .
But Satish Kalpoe told his mother later that was a lie aimed at protecting Van Der Sloot .
In fact , he told his mother , he and his brother had dropped Holloway and Van Der Sloot off at the beach by the Marriott hotel , about a mile from the Holiday Inn .
Ramirez 's account echoes comments made by one of two security guards who were arrested June 5 in connection with the case and released June 13 .
The guards , Abraham Jones , 28 , and Mickey John , 30 , were never charged .
After his release , John said Deepak Kalpoe confided to him while they were in jail together that he had lied to police .
( CNN Access ) Ramirez tearfully said her son insisted he and his brother were innocent .
" ' We did n't do anything .
We will be out from here .
Do n't cry , ' " she said he told her .
" I asked him , ' Satish , are you sure you guys did n't do anything ? ' " she said .
She said he responded : " ' No , mama .
We gave that girl and Joran a lift . '
" They do n't even know Natalee .
They said she did n't even introduce herself to them , " she said .
" They do n't know anything else about that . "
Although she has been suffering and unable to eat since her sons ' arrest , Ramirez said she remains confident they will be cleared .
She described her family as a close and traditional Hindu group and said both sons are " good boys . "
Satish does not drink , she said , and while Deepak drinks occasionally , neither youth takes drugs .

Building a Vector Space Search Engine in Perl
- Building a Vector Space Search Engine in Perl - A Few Words About Vectors - Getting Down To Business - Building the Search Engine - Making it Better - Further Reading
Why waste time reinventing the wheel , when you could be reinventing the engine ?
- Damian Conway
As a Perl programmer , sooner or later you ’ll get an opportunity to build a search engine .
Like many programming tasks - parsing a date , validating an e-mail address , writing to a temporary file - this turns out to be easy to do , but hard to get right .
Most people try end up with some kind of reverse index , a data structure that associates words with lists of documents .
Onto this , they graft a scheme for ranking the results by relevance .
Nearly every search engine in use today - from Google on down - works on the basis of a reverse keyword index .
You can write such a keyword engine in Perl , but as your project grows you will inevitably find yourself gravitating to some kind of relational database system .
Since databases are customized for fast lookup and indexing , it ’s no surprise that most keyword search engines make heavy use of them .
But writing code for them is n’t much fun .
More to the point , companies like Google and Atomz already offer excellent , free search services for small Web sites .
You can get an instant search engine with a customizable interface , and spend no time struggling with Boolean searches , text highlighting , or ranking algorithms .
Why bother duplicating all that effort ?
As Perl programmers , we know that laziness is a virtue .
But we also know that there is more than one way to do things .
Despite the ubiquity of reverse - index search , there are many other ways to build a search engine .
Most of them originate in the field of information retrieval , where researchers are having all kinds of fun .
Unfortunately , finding documentation about these alternatives is n’t easy .
Most of the material available online is either too technical or too impractical to be of use on real - world data sets .
So programmers are left with the false impression that vanilla search is all there is .
In this article , I want to show you how to build and run a search engine using a vector - space model , an alternative to reverse index lookup that does not require a database , or indeed any file storage at all .
Vector - space search engines eliminate many of the disadvantages of keyword search without introducing too many disadvantages of their own .
Best of all , you can get one up and running in just a few dozen lines of Perl .
A Few Words About Vectors
Vector - space search engines use the notion of a term space , where each document is represented as a vector in a high - dimensional space .
There are as many dimensions as there are unique words in the entire collection .
Because a document ’s position in the term space is determined by the words it contains , documents with many words in common end up close together , while documents with few shared words end up far apart .
To search our collection , we project a query into this term space and calculate the distance from the query vector to all the document vectors in turn .
Those documents that are within a certain threshold distance get added to our result set .
If all this sounds like gobbledygook to you , then do n’t worry - it will become clearer when we write the code .
The vector - space data model gives us a search engine with several useful features :
Searches take place in RAM , there is no disk or database access
Queries can be arbitrarily long
Users do n’t have to bother with Boolean logic or regular expressions
It ’s trivially easy to do ‘ find similar ’ searches on returned documents
You can set up a ‘ saved results ’ basket , and do similarity searches on the documents in it
You get to talk about ‘ vector spaces ’ and impress your friends
Getting Down to Business
The easiest way to understand the vector model is with a concrete example .
Let ’s say you have a collection of 10 documents , and together they contain 50 unique words .
You can represent each document as a vector by counting how many times a word appears in the document , and moving that distance along the appropriate axis .
So if Document A contains the sentence “ cats like chicken ” , then you find the axis for cat , move along one unit , and then do the same for like and chicken .
Since the other 47 words do n’t appear in your document , you do n’t move along the corresponding axes at all .
Plot this point and draw a line to it from the origin , and you have your document vector .
Like any vector , it has a magnitude ( determined by how many times each word occurs ) , and a direction ( determined by which words appeared , and their relative abundance ) .
There are two things to notice here :
The first is that we throw away all information word order , and there is no guarantee that the vector will be unique .
If we had started with the sentence “ chickens like cats ” ( ignoring plurals for the moment ) , then we would have ended up with an identical document vector , even though the documents are not the same .
This may seem to be a big limitation , but it turns out that word order in natural language contains little information about content - you can infer most of what a document is about by studying the word list .
Bad news for English majors , good news for us .
The second thing to notice is that with three non-zero values out of a possible 50 , our document vector is sparse .
This will hold true for any natural language collection , where a given document will contain only a tiny proportion of all the possible words in the language .
This makes it possible to build in - RAM search engines even for large collections , although the details are outside the scope of this article .
The point is , you can scale this model up quite far before having to resort to disk access .
To run a vector - space search engine , we need to do the following :
Assemble a document collection Create a term space and map the documents into it Map an incoming query into the same term space Compare the query vector to the stored document vectors Return a list of nearest documents , ranked by distance
Now let ’s see how to implement these steps in Perl .
Building the Search Engine
We ’ll make things easy by starting with a tiny collection of four documents , each just a few words long :
" The cat in the hat " " A cat is a fine pet . "
" Dogs and cats make good pets . "
" I have n't got a hat . "
Our first step is to find all the unique words in the document set .
The easiest way to do this is to convert each document into a word list , and then combine the lists together into one .
Here ’s one ( awful ) way do it :
sub get_words { my ( $ text ) = @_ ; return map { lc $ _ => 1 } map { /( [ a-z\-']+ ) / i } split /\s+/s , $ text ; }
The subroutine splits a text string on whitespace , takes out all punctuation except hyphens and apostrophes , and converts everything to lower case before returning a hash of words .
The curious do statement is just a compact way of creating a lookup hash .
% doc_words will end up containing our word list as its keys , and its values will be the number of times each word appeared .
If we run this ‘ parser ’ on all four documents in turn , then we get a master word list :
a and cat cats dogs fine good got hat have n't i in is make pet pets the
Notice that many of the words in this list are junk words - pronouns , articles , and other grammatical flotsam that ’s not useful in a search context .
A common procedure in search engine design is to strip out words like these using a stop list .
Here ’s the same subroutine with a rudimentary stop list added in , filtering out the most common words :
our % stop_hash ; our @stop_words = qw / i in a to the it have have n't was but is be from / ; foreach @stop_words { $stop_hash {$_}++ } ; sub get_words { #
Now with stop list action ! my ( $ text ) = @_ ; return map { $ _ => 1 } grep { !( exists $ stop_hash {$_} ) } map lc , map { /( [ a -z\ -' ] + ) / i } split /\s+/s , $ text ; }
A true stop list would be longer , and tailored to fit our document collection .
You can find a real stop list in the DATA section of Listing 1 , along with a complete implementation of the search engine described here .
Note that because of Perl ’s fast hash lookup algorithm , we can have a copious stop list without paying a big price in program speed .
Because word frequencies in natural language obey a power - law distribution , getting rid of the most common words removes a disproportionate amount of bulk from our vectors .
Here is what our word list looks after we munge it with the stop list :
cat cats dogs fine good got hat make pet pets
We ’ve narrowed the list down considerably , which is good .
But notice that our list contains a couple of variants ( “ cat ” and “ cats ” , “ pet ” and “ pets ” ) , that differ only in number .
Also note that someone who searches on ‘ dog ’ in our collection wo n’t get any matches , even though ‘ dogs ’ in the plural form is a valid hit .
That ’s bad .
This is a common problem in search engine design , so of course there is a module on the CPAN to solve it .
The bit of code we need is called a stemmer , a set of heuristics for removing suffixes from English words , leaving behind a common root .
The stemmer we can get from CPAN uses the Porter stemming algorithm , which is an imperfect but excellent way of finding word stems in English .
use Lingua :: Stem ;
We ’ll wrap the stemmer in our own subroutine , to hide the clunky Lingua : : Stem syntax :
sub stem { my ( $ word ) = @_ ; my $ stemref = Lingua : : Stem : : stem ( $ word ) ; return $ stemref - > [ 0 ] ; }
And here ’s how to fold it in to the get_words subroutine :
return map { stem ( $_ ) => 1 } grep { !( exists $ stop_hash {$_} ) } map lc , map { /( [ a -z\ -' ] + ) / i } split /\s+/s , $ text ;
Notice that we apply our stop list before we stem the words .
Otherwise , a valid word like beings ( which stems to be ) would be caught by the overzealous stop list .
It ’s easy to make little slips like this in search algorithm design , so be extra careful .
With the stemmer added in , our word list now looks like this :
cat dog fine good got hat make pet
Much better !
We have halved the size of our original list , while preserving all of the important content .
Now that we have a complete list of content words , we ’re ready for the second step - mapping our documents into the term space .
Because our collection has a vocabulary of eight content words , each of our documents will map onto an eight - dimensional vector .
Here is one example :
# A cat is a fine pet $ vec = [ 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 ] ;
The sentence “ A cat is a fine pet ” contains three content words .
Looking at our sorted list of words , we find cat , fine , and pet at positions one , three , and eight respectively , so we create an anonymous array and put ones at those positions , with zeroes everywhere else .
If we wanted to go in the opposite direction , then we could take the vector and look up the non-zero values at the appropriate position in a sorted word list , getting back the content words in the document ( but no information about word order ) .
The problem with using Perl arrays here is that they wo n’t scale .
Perl arrays eat lots of memory , and there are no native functions for comparing arrays to one another .
We would have to loop through our arrays , which is slow .
A better data way to do it is to use the PDL module , a set of compiled C extensions to Perl made especially for use with matrix algebra .
You can find it on the CPAN .
PDL stands for “ Perl Data Language ” , and it is a powerful language indeed , optimized for doing math operations with enormous multidimensional matrices .
All we ’ll be using is a tiny slice of its functionality , the equivalent of driving our Ferrari to the mailbox .
It turns out that a PDL vector ( or “ piddle ” ) looks similar to our anonymous array :
use PDL ; my $vec = piddle [ 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 ] ; > print $vec [ 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]
We give the piddle constructor the same anonymous array as an argument , and it converts it to a smaller data structure , requiring less storage .
Since we already know that most of our values in each document vector will be zero ( remember how sparse natural language is ) , passing full - length arrays to the piddle constructor might get a little cumbersome .
So instead we ’ll use a shortcut to create a zero - filled piddle , and then set the non-zero values explicitly .
For this we have the zeroes function , which takes the size of the vector as its argument :
my $ num_words = 8 ; my $vec = zeroes $ num_words ; > print $ vec [ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]
To set one of the zero values to something else , we ’ll have to use the obscure PDL syntax :
my $ value = 3 ; my $ offset = 4 ; index ( $vec , $ offset ) .= $ value ; > print $ vec ; [ 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 ]
Here we ’ve said “ take this vector , and set the value at position 4 to 3 ” .
This turns out to be all we need to create a document vector .
Now we just have to loop through each document ’s word list , and set the appropriate values in the corresponding vector .
Here ’s a subroutine that does the whole thing :
# $ word_count is the total number of words in collection # % index is a lookup hash of word to its position in the master list sub make_vector { my ( $ doc ) = @_ ; my % words = get_words ( $ doc ) ; my $ vector = zeroes $ word_count ; foreach my $w ( keys % words ) { my $ value = $ words {$w} ; my $ offset = $ index { $w} ; index ( $ vector , $ offset ) .= $ value ; } return $ vector ; }
Now that we can generate a vector for each document in our collection , as well as turn an incoming query into a query vector ( by feeding the query into the make_vector subroutine ) , all we ’re missing is a way to calculate the distance between vectors .
There are many ways to do this .
One of the simplest ( and most intuitive ) is the cosine measure .
Our intuition is that document vectors with many words in common will point in roughly the same direction , so the angle between two document vectors is a good measure of their similarity .
Taking the cosine of that angle gives us a value from zero to one , which is handy .
Documents with no words in common will have a cosine of zero ; documents that are identical will have a cosine of one .
Partial matches will have an intermediate value - the closer that value is to one , the more relevant the document .
The formula for calculating the cosine is this :
cos = ( V1 * V2 ) / || V1|| x | |V2 | |
Where V2 and V2 are our vectors , the vertical bars indicate the 2 - norm , and the * indicates the inner product .
You can take the math on faith , or look it up in any book on linear algebra .
With PDL , we can express that relation easily :
sub cosine { my ( $ vec1 , $ vec2 ) = @_ ; my $ n1 = norm $ vec1 ; my $ n2 = norm $ vec2 ; my $ cos = inner ( $ n1 , $ n2 ) ; # inner product return $ cos -> sclr ( ) ; # converts PDL object to Perl scalar }
We can normalize the vectors to unit length using the norm function , because we ’re not interested in their absolute magnitude , only the angle between them .
Now that we have a way of computing distance between vectors , we ’re almost ready to run our search engine .
The last bit of the puzzle is a subroutine to take a query vector and compare it against all of the document vectors in turn , returning a ranked list of matches :
sub get_cosines { my ( $ query_vec ) = @_ ; my % cosines ; while ( my ( $ id , $ vec ) = each % document_vectors ) { my $ cosine = cosine ( $ vec , $ query_vec ) ; next unless $ cosine > $ threshold ; $ cosines {$id} = $ cosine ; } return % cosines ; }
This gives us back a hash with document IDs as its keys , and cosines as its values .
We ’ll call this subroutine from a search subroutine that will be our module ’s interface with the outside world :
sub search { my ( $ query ) = @_ ; my $ query_vec = make_vector ( $ query ) ; my %results = get_cosines ( $ query_vec ) ; return %results ; }
All that remains is to sort the results by the cosine ( in descending order ) , format them , and display them to the user .
You can find an object - oriented implementation of this code in Listing 1 , complete with built - in stop list and some small changes to make the search go faster ( for the curious , we normalize the document vectors before storing them , to save having to do it every time we run the cosine subroutine ) .
Once we ’ve actually written the code , using it is straightforward :
use Search : : VectorSpace ; my @docs = get_documents_from_somewhere( ) ; my $ engine = Search : : VectorSpace -> new ( docs => \@docs ) ; $ engine ->build_index ( ) ; $ engine->set_threshold ( 0.8 ) ; while ( my $ query = <> ) { my %results = $ engine -> search ( $ query ) ; foreach my $ result ( sort { $ results { $b} < = > $ results { $a} } keys % results ) { print " Relevance : " , $ results { $ result} , "
" ; print $ result , "
" ; } print " Next query ?
" ; }
And there we have it , an instant search engine , all in Perl .
Making It Better
There are all kinds of ways to improve on this basic model .
Here are a few ideas to consider :
Better parsing
Our get_words subroutine is rudimentary - the code equivalent of a sharpened stick .
For one thing , it will completely fail on text containing hyperlinks , acronyms or XML .
It also wo n’t recognize proper names or terms that contain more than one word ( like “ Commonwealth of Independent States ” ) .
You can make the parser smarter by stripping out HTML and other markup with a module like HTML :: TokeParser , and building in a part - of - speech tagger to find proper names and noun phrases ( look for our own Lingua : : Tagger : : En , coming soon on the CPAN ) .
Non-English Collections
Perl has great Unicode support , and the vector model does n’t care about language , so why limit ourselves to English ?
As long as you can write a parser , you can adapt the search to work with any language .
Most likely you will need a special stemming algorithm .
This can be easy as pie for some languages ( Chinese , Italian ) , and really hard for others ( Arabic , Russian , Hungarian ) .
It depends entirely on the morphology of the language .
You can find published stemming algorithms online for several Western European languages , including German , Spanish and French .
Similarity Search
It ’s easy to add a “ find similar ” feature to your search engine .
Just use an existing document vector as your query , and everything else falls into place .
If you want to do a similarity search on multiple documents , then add the vectors together .
Term Weighting
Term weighting is a fancy way of saying “ some words are more important than others ” .
Done properly , it can greatly improve search results .
You calculate weights when building document vectors .
Local weighting assigns values to words based on how many times they appear in a single document , while global weighting assigns values based on word frequency across the entire collection .
The intuition is that rare words are more interesting than common words ( global weighting ) , and that words that appear once in a document are not as relevant as words that occur multiple times ( local weighting ) .
Incorporating Metadata
If your documents have metadata descriptors ( dates , categories , author names ) , then you can build those in to the vector model .
Just add a slot for each category , like you did for your keywords , and apply whatever kind of weighting you desire .
Exact Phrase Matching
You can add arbitrary constraints to your result set by adding a chain of filters to your result set .
An easy way to do exact phrase matching is to loop through your result set with a regular expression .
This kind of post - processing is also a convenient way to sort your results by something other than relevance .

Both the code and the article come from my own work for the National Institute for Technology and Liberal Education .
I was reminded of the story when reading Patrick Cockburn 's The Occupation , a vivid account of war and resistance in Iraq which is published by Verso this week .
Cockburn describes a visit to Dhuluaya , a fruit - growing region 50 miles north of Baghdad , where , early on in the occupation , the American military cut down ancient date palms and orange and lemon trees as part of a collective punishment for farmers who had failed to inform them about guerrilla attacks .
This vandalism will be remembered for generations because it was senseless and to the Iraqi mind powerfully symbolises the malice of the occupiers .
' At times , ' Cockburn says of the period just after the invasion , 'it seemed as if the American military was determined to provoke an uprising . '
Well , now they 've got it , a ferocious war that in the last three months alone has cost 10,000 lives , most of them Iraqi .
There seems no end to it and as Cockburn writes in his conclusion , instead of asserting America 's position as the sole superpower , the occupation has amply demonstrated the limits of US power .
The precise opposite of the desired effect was also achieved in the idiotically named ' War on Terror ' .
By the admission of intelligence services on both sides of the Atlantic , Iraq has galvanised terrorism .
Sections of a US National Intelligence estimate that were declassified last week say the war has become the ' cause celebre for jihadist ' and that ' jihadists regard Europe as an important venue for attacking Western interests ' .
This is not the view of a few CIA desk officers , but the shared verdict of 16 branches of US intelligence .
At the end of bad week in publicity terms , the White House has to deal with Bob Woodward 's new book , State of Denial , which reveals that Bush ignored the mounting insurrection in Iraq and that the White House was riven with disputes over the war between the Cheney / Rumsfeld faction and the former Secretary of State , Colin Powell , and Andrew Card , a former chief of staff .
Rumsfeld is depicted as arrogant and contemptuous of other members of the administration as well as being totally disengaged from the details of occupying and reconstructing Iraq , which was then the Pentagon 's responsibility .
There is an alarming sense of drift in the policy - making on both sides of the Atlantic , an unreality and , to use Woodward 's word , denial .
A leaked document , believed to have been written by a British MI6 officer attached to the Ministry of Defence , pulls no punches : ' The war on Iraq , ' it says , 'has acted as a recruiting sergeant for extremists across the Muslim world ...
Iraq has served to radicalise an already disillusioned youth and al - Qaeda has given them the will , intent , purpose and ideology to act . '
Any number of commentators and some politicians , for instance , Al Gore , Senator Robert Byrd in the US and Ken Clarke and Robin Cook in Britain , predicted precisely this outcome in the run-up to the war .
Bush and Blair never heeded the advice .
Only a tenth of the US document was published , but it is enough to undermine the campaign by the administration over the last few weeks to portray Iraq as an essential part of the war on terror and of making Americans safe at home .
It 's a lie of monumental proportions which exceeds even Downing Street 's manipulation of the September 2002 WMD dossier .
Iraq has done the opposite of making America safe and with five weeks to go to the mid-term congressional elections , the Democrats now have an opportunity to make that case .
Bill Clinton has urged his party to go on the offensive about the war and on Bush 's woeful negligence over the threat posed by bin Laden .
He went on Fox TV last Sunday and made the case about bin Laden in a pugnacious interview with Chris Wallace , pointing out that it was his successor , not he , who had downgraded the al - Qaeda threat and demoted the counterterror expert who so feared bin Laden .
Confirmation of the Bush administration 's lassitude comes in Woodward 's book .
In July of 2001 , two months before the September attacks , he reveals that the head of the CIA , George Tenet , and his counterterrorism chief , J Cofer Black , met Condoleezza Rice , then National Security Adviser , to impress upon her the seriousness of the intelligence about an attack .
Both men felt that she had not taken the warnings seriously .
Five years on , it is still terribly important to fight for the accurate record of what happened .
For instance , last week Jack Straw appeared on Question Time and stated that Tony Blair did not know until ' late ' of America 's plans to attack Iraq .
That is not true .
It has been established that on 22 September 2001 , 11 days after the al - Qaeda attacks , Blair attended a dinner with Bush , Colin Powell and Christopher Meyer during which the attack on Iraq was raised not just as matter of idle speculation .
Is that late ?
No , Blair was on board from a very early stage .
Given the state of Iraq , the diaspora of terror cells , the scandals of torture and extra- judicial punishment in Guantanomo and Britain , it is remarkable that Blair is still Prime Minister , that no member of the war cabinet has apologised for this calamitous record and that the Labour party has not signalled its remorse in the slightest way .
Last week 's conference was devoted to a series of setpieces in which those responsible for the greatest foreign policy disaster since the Second World War were allowed to posture in front of a largely compliant audience .
I had the advantage of reading and not seeing Blair 's speech , which meant that I was n't exposed to his demonic charm and did not fall into the swoon that afflicted so many colleagues .
I urge you to find the speech on the Labour party website and read exactly what he said and , while you 're about it , look up John Reid 's speech , too .
Both their statements on liberty are enough to give you an idea of the profound threat they represent to British democracy , to the traditions of open and accountable government , to the previous requirement that politicians accept responsibility for failed policies .
Blair 's speech dealt with terrorism in the following sentences .
' This terrorism is n't our fault .
We did n't cause it .
It 's not the consequence of foreign policy .
It 's an attack on our way of life . '
He might have said that on 12 September 2001 and he would have been right , but five years later , it is his and Bush 's response to the threat - the invasion of Iraq - that has provided stimulus to the growth of terrorism and made the clash of civilisations a frightening possibility .
Nowhere in his speech did he acknowledge this .
How could he without interfering with the delicate business of moulding his legacy ?
Apparently , he was n't heckled and no one in the hall fell off their chair laughing when he said he would dedicate the rest of his time in office to advancing peace between Israel and Palestinians .
That agenda was his reason for wiring British foreign policy into the White House .
But he got nowhere with Israel at a time when Bush needed him , which leads one to suppose that he does n't have a hope in hell now that he has served Bush 's purpose .
The only satisfaction to take out of this terrible episode is that the true account of what happened before the invasion of Iraq and why is being assembled despite Bush and Blair 's efforts to distort the record .
What we do now is an altogether harder task .
It will need a new generation of leaders to attempt to right the wrongs and set the West on a new course .
But they will always have the memories of senseless destruction to contend with .

Lazy Backup
If there ’s one thing good UI designers know , it ’s that the best UI is not to have one at all .
Applications should just save , security should just work , and computers should just backup .
Apparently that last task is a harder than it appears , since I still have n’t found decent backup software for Unix ( OS X and GNU / Linux ) .
Here is how the software should work :
I install it .
I point it at some storage server ( ideally Amazon EC2 and S3 , but if that ’s too hard then a GNU / Linux server with a large drive ) .
I give it a maximum space limit ( e.g. store no more than 200 GB ) .
I give it a maximum up - bandwidth limit ( e.g. use no more than 5K / s ) .
I tell it to run .
From then on , it should just work .
In the background , it will upload my files to the server using only 5 K/s of bandwidth .
If I get disconnected from the Internet or reboot my computer , when I get back on it will pick up where it left off .
If a file changes it will only send the diff and store that as well .
When I run out of disk space it will delete the old diffs .
It will preserve all the Unix ACLs and permissions and weird Mac OS X resource forks and stuff so that if my drive ever dies I can make a full bootable restore from the backup .
Does this software exist ?
The closest I ’ve seen is rdiff - backup , which is very nice but fails to automate some key steps .
If it does n’t exist , let me know if you ’re interested in writing it ( a wrapper around rdiff - backup to do it should n’t be too hard , I would think ) .
I ’d be willing to offer a bounty .
You should follow me on twitter here .

Jo donned the latest in Hawaiian hoedown chic while partying in Niagara Falls , Canada Monday night .
The Millers danced the night away at a local casino and were joined by Sienna 's " Camille " co-star - and rumored new beau - James Franco .
While the mom and daughter duo opted for matching green floral blouses and pink cowboy hats , James kept it cool in jeans and a blazer .
Bush says domestic spying to continue Eavesdropping on citizens who are suspected of terrorist links is legal , he asserts
WASHINGTON - President Bush vowed Monday to continue the eavesdropping on Americans suspected of terrorist ties and said he assumed the government already is investigating who may have alerted reporters about the controversial spying program .
In a news conference at the White House , the president defended his repeated authorization of the wiretapping , without asking any court for search warrants , on international telephone calls and e-mails between suspected al - Qaida members and their associates .
He said the spying by the National Security Agency is legal and has worked to thwart terrorist attacks against the U.S .
He refused , however , to give any details .
" Do I have the legal authority to do this ?
The answer is , absolutely , " Bush said .
" I 've reauthorized this program more than 30 times since the September the 11th attacks , and I intend to do so for so long as the nation faces the continuing threat of an enemy that wants to kill our American citizens . "
Later in the day , critics continued to imply that Bush had acted outside the law .
" We will not tolerate a president who believes that he is the sole decision - maker when it comes to the policies that this country should have in the war against terror and the policies we should have to protect the rights of completely innocent Americans , " Sen .
Russ Feingold , D - Wis. , said at a Capitol Hill news conference .
" He is the president , not a king . "
Bush said the terrorist threat continues , and he expressed frustration that the Senate has failed to renew the USA Patriot Act , the anti-terror law with some provisions that otherwise expire at the end of the month .
Opponents say the law may trample on civil liberties .
The president said he has not ordered any investigation to determine who , if anyone , leaked information on the spying program to the New York Times , but he presumes one is under way .
" My personal opinion is it was a shameful act , for someone to disclose this very important program in time of war , " he said .
" The fact that we 're discussing this program is helping the enemy . "
The Justice Department would not comment on whether it is investigating .
The year - ender news conference was the latest in a series of Bush appearances , including Sunday night 's televised address from the Oval Office , aimed at stanching criticism of the war in Iraq and Bush 's slide in popularity polls .
It came shortly after U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales told reporters the administration believes the spying program was authorized by the Constitution and by Congress in its resolution authorizing the terror war shortly after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , al - Qaida attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon that killed more than 3,000 people .
Gonzales said the U.S. Supreme Court has acknowledged the president 's powers in wartime , particularly when it decided last year that Congress had authorized the detention of a U.S. citizen captured on the battlefield as an " enemy combatant . "
The high court likely would uphold the administration 's spying as well , even though Congress did not specifically authorize it , he said .
" We believe that the court would apply the same reasoning to recognize the authorization by Congress to engage in this kind of electronic surveillance , " Gonzales said .
Failing that , he said , the Constitution itself gives the president , as commander - in - chief , broad wartime powers .
Bush also made that point , saying that while he is mindful of privacy concerns , it is his responsibility to do whatever is necessary to protect the American people in time of war .
He also said the White House briefed congressional leaders about the spying more than a dozen times .
But lawmakers said they were shocked at the decision to bypass the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , under which a special court , acting in secret , can approve electronic surveillance — either before or after telephones have been tapped .
The FISA courts have rejected administration requests for wiretapping only a few times since the law was passed in 1978 , officials have said .
Several Republican and Democratic senators agreed with Senate Judiciary Chairman Arlen Specter , R - Pa. , that legislative hearings should be held on the issue early next year .
" Where does he find in the Constitution the authority to tap the wires and the phones of American citizens without any court oversight ? " asked Sen. Carl Levin , D - Mich . " ... Notifying some members of Congress , if he did , that he 's taken the law into his own hands — that is not a check on the executive branch , nor is the fact that he gets opinions from six lawyers in the executive branch , all under his control , that he can do this .
That 's not a check .
A check is what is in the law . "
Levin and other senators demanded that the eavesdropping be conducted only under FISA .
Bush told reporters the administration monitors the spying to make sure it complies with the Constitution and that the program without search warrants was needed to move swiftly against would - be attackers .

Growth in information technology is particularly rapid : we 're doubling its power , as measured by price - performance , bandwidth , capacity and many other measures , every year or so .
That 's a factor of 1000 in 10 years , a million in 20 years , and a billion in 30 years , although a slow , second level of exponential growth means that a billion - fold improvement takes only about a quarter of a century .
The exponential growth of computing goes back over a century and covers five main paradigms : · Electromechanical computing as used in the 1890 US census .
· Relay - based computing as used to crack Nazi cryptography in the early 1940s .
· Vacuum - tube - based computing as used by CBS to predict the election of Dwight Eisenhower as US president in 1952 .
· Discrete - transistor - based computing as used in the first space launches in the 1960s .
· Computing based on integrated circuits , invented in 1958 and applied to mainstream computing from the late 1960s .
Each time it became apparent that one paradigm was about to run out of steam , the realisation resulted in research pressure to create the next paradigm .
Today we have more than a decade left in the paradigm of shrinking transistors on an integrated circuit , but there has already been enormous progress in creating the sixth main computing paradigm of three - dimensional molecular computing , using carbon nanotubes for example .
As another example , it took us 14 years to sequence the genome of HIV ; SARS took only 31 days .
The result is that we can reliably predict such measures as price - performance and capacity of a broad variety of information technologies .
There are many things we cannot dependably anticipate .
Our inability to make reliable predictions applies to any specific project .
But the overall capabilities of information technology in each field can be projected .
I have been making predictions of this type for more than 20 years .
We see examples in other areas of science of very smooth and reliable outcomes resulting from the interaction of a great many unpredictable events .
Consider that predicting the path of a single molecule in a gas is essentially impossible , but predicting the properties of the entire gas - comprised of a great many chaotically interacting molecules - can be done very reliably through the laws of thermodynamics .
Analogously , it is not possible to reliably predict the results of a specific project or company , but the overall capabilities of information technology , comprised of many chaotic activities , can nonetheless be dependably anticipated through what I call the law of accelerating returns .
Between 2000 and 2014 we 'll make 20 years of progress at 2000 rates , equivalent to the entire 20th century .
And then we 'll do the same again in only seven years .
To express this another way , we wo n't experience 100 years of technological advance in the 21st century ; we will witness in the order of 20,000 years of progress when measured by the rate of progress in 2000 , or about 1000 times that in the 20th century .
Ultimately , we will merge with our technology .
As we get to the 2030s , the non-biological portion of our intelligence will predominate .
By the 2040s it will be billions of times more capable than the biological part .
Above all , information technologies will grow at an explosive rate .
And information technology is the technology that we need to consider .
Ultimately , everything of value will become an information technology : our biology , our thoughts and thinking processes , manufacturing and many other fields .
As one example , nanotechnology - based manufacturing will enable us to apply computerised techniques to automatically assemble complex products at the molecular level .
This will mean that by the mid 2020s we will be able to meet our energy needs using very inexpensive nanotechnology - based solar panels that will capture the energy in 0.03 per cent of the sunlight that falls on the Earth , which is all we need to meet our projected energy needs in 2030 .
A common objection is that there must be limits to exponential growth , as in the example of rabbits in Australia .
The answer is that there are , but they 're not very limiting .
By 2020 , $ 1000 will purchase 1016 calculations per second ( cps ) of computing ( compared with about 109 cps today ) , which is the level I estimate is required to functionally simulate the human brain .
Another few decades on , and we will be able to build more optimal computing systems .
For example , one cubic inch of nanotube circuitry would be about 100 million times more powerful than the human brain .
The ultimate 1 - kilogram computer - about the weight of a laptop today - which I envision late in this century , could provide 1042 cps , about 10 quadrillion ( 1016 ) times more powerful than all human brains put together today .
And that 's if we restrict the computer to functioning at a cold temperature .
If we find a way to let it get hot , we could improve that by a factor of another 100 million .
And we 'll devote more than 1 kilogram of matter to computing .
We 'll use a significant portion of the matter and energy in our vicinity as a computing substrate .
Our growing mastery of information processes means the 21st century will be characterised by three great technology revolutions .
We are now in the early stages of the " G " revolution ( genetics , or biotechnology ) .
Biotechnology is providing the means to change your genes : not just designer babies but designer baby boomers .
But perfecting our biology will only get us so far .
Biology will never be able to match what we will be capable of engineering , now that we are gaining a deep understanding of biology 's principles of operation .
That will bring us to the " N " or nanotechnology revolution , which will achieve maturity in the 2020s .
There are already early impressive experiments .
A biped nanorobot created by Nadrian Seeman and William Sherman , of New York University , can walk on legs only 10 nanometres long , demonstrating the ability of nanoscale machines to execute precise manoeuvres .
Microchips of Bedford , Massachusetts , has developed a computerised device that , when implanted under the skin , delivers precise mixtures of medicines from hundreds of nanoscale wells inside it .
There are many other examples .
By the 2020s , nanotechnology will enable us to create almost any physical product we want from inexpensive materials , using information processes .
We will be able to go beyond the limits of biology , and replace your current " human body version 1.0 " with a dramatically upgraded version 2.0 , providing radical life extension .
The " killer app " of nanotechnology is " nanobots " , blood - cell - sized robots that can travel in the bloodstream destroying pathogens , removing debris , correcting errors in DNA and reversing ageing processes .
We 're already in the early stages of augmenting and replacing each of our organs , even portions of our brains with neural implants , the most recent versions of which allow patients to download new software to their implants .
The most profound transformation will be " R " for the robotics revolution , which really refers to " strong " AI , or artificial intelligence at the human level .
Hundreds of applications of " narrow AI " - machine intelligence that equals or exceeds human intelligence for specific tasks - already permeate our infrastructure .
Every time you send an email or make a mobile phone call , intelligent algorithms route the information .
AI programs diagnose electrocardiograms with an accuracy rivalling that of doctors , evaluate medical images , fly and land aircraft , guide intelligent autonomous weapons , make automated investment decisions for over $ 1 trillion of funds , and guide industrial processes .
A couple of decades ago these were all research projects .
With regard to strong AI , we 'll have both the hardware and software to recreate human intelligence by the end of the 2020s .
We 'll be able to improve these methods and harness the speed , memory and knowledge - sharing ability of machines .
Ultimately , we will merge with our technology .
This will begin with nanobots in our bodies and brains .
The nanobots will keep us healthy , provide full - immersion virtual reality from within the nervous system , provide direct brain - to - brain communication over the internet and greatly expand human intelligence .
But keep in mind that non-biological intelligence is doubling each year , whereas our biological intelligence is essentially fixed .
As we reach the 2030s , the non-biological portion of our intelligence will predominate .
By the mid 2040s , the non-biological portion of our intelligence will be billions of times more capable than the biological portion .
Non-biological intelligence will have access to its own design and will be able to improve itself in an increasingly rapid redesign cycle .
This is not a utopian vision : the GNR ( genetics , nanotechnology and robotics ) technologies each have perils to match their promises .
The danger of a bioengineered pathological virus is already with us .
Self - replication will ultimately be feasible in non-biological nanotechnology - based systems as well , which will introduce its own dangers .
In short , the answer is not relinquishment .
Any attempt to proscribe such technologies will not only deprive human society of profound benefits , but will drive such technologies underground , which would make the dangers worse .
We wo n't experience 100 years of technological advance in the 21st century ; we will witness in the order of 20,000 years of progress when measured by the rate of progress in 2000 , or about 1000 times that achieved in the 20th century .
Some commentators have questioned whether we would still be human after such dramatic changes .
These observers may define the concept of human as being based on our limitations , but I prefer to define us as the species that seeks - and succeeds - in going beyond our limitations .
Because our ability to increase our horizons is expanding exponentially rather than linearly , we can anticipate a dramatic century of accelerating change ahead .
Intuitive view In 2003 , Time magazine organised a " Future of Life " conference celebrating the 50th anniversary of Watson and Crick 's discovery of the structure of DNA .
All speakers , myself included , were asked what we thought the next 50 years would bring .
Most of the predictions were short - sighted .
James Watson 's prediction was that in 50 years , we 'll have drugs that allow us to eat as much as we want without gaining weight .
" Fifty years ? " I replied .
We 've already demonstrated it in mice and human drugs using the relevant techniques that are in development .
We can expect them in five to 10 years , not 50 .
The mistake that Watson and virtually every other presenter made was to use the progress of the past 50 years as a model for the next half - century .
I describe this way of looking at the future as the " intuitive linear " view : people assume the current rate of progress will continue .
But technological change is not linear but exponential .
You can examine the data in different ways , and for a variety of technologies , from electronic to biological .
You can analyse the implications , from the sum of human knowledge to the size of the economy .
However you measure it , the exponential acceleration of progress and growth applies .
Understanding exponential progress is key to understanding future trends .
Over the long term , exponential growth produces change on a scale dramatically different from linear growth .
Consider that in 1990 , the human genome project was widely regarded as controversial .
In 1989 , we sequenced only one - thousandth of the genome .
But from 1990 onwards the amount of genetic data sequenced doubled every year - a rate of growth that continues today - and the transcription of the human genome was completed in 2003 .
Reverse - engineering the brain
The most profound transformation will be in " strong " AI , that is , artificial intelligence at the human level .
To re-create the capabilities of the human brain , we need to meet both the hardware and software requirements .
Achieving the hardware requirement was controversial five years ago but is now largely a mainstream view among informed observers .
Supercomputers are already at 100 trillion ( 1014 ) calculations per second ( cps ) and will hit 1016 cps near the end of this decade , which is the level I estimate is required to functionally simulate the human brain .
Several supercomputers with 1015 cps are already on the drawing board , with two Japanese efforts targeting 1016 cps about the end of the decade .
By 2020 , 1016 cps will be available for about $ 1000 .
So now the controversy is focused on the algorithms .
To understand the principles of human intelligence we need to reverse - engineer the human brain .
Here , progress is far greater than most people realise .
The spatial and temporal resolution of brain scanning is progressing at an exponential rate , roughly doubling each year .
Scanning tools , such as a new system from the University of Pennsylvania , can now see individual interneuronal connections and watch them fire in real time .
Already , we have mathematical models of a couple of dozen regions of the brain , including the cerebellum , which comprises more than half the neurons in the brain .
IBM is creating a highly detailed simulation of about 10,000 cortical neurons , including tens of millions of connections .
The first version will simulate electrical activity and a future version will also simulate chemical activity .
By the mid-2020s , it is conservative to conclude that we will have effective models of the whole brain .
One benefit of a full understanding of the human brain will be a deep understanding of ourselves , but the key implication is that it will expand the tool kit of techniques we can apply to create artificial intelligence .
We will then be able to create non-biological systems that match human intelligence .
These superintelligent computers will be able to do things we are not able to do , such as share knowledge and skills at electronic speeds .

The act of building software is a journey — at the start you have a destination in mind and some idea of the route .
By the time you reach the destination your map is littered with the record of all of your wrong turns .
Looking back you can see the path you should have taken .
But each wrong turn gave you the insight you needed to plot the right path through the obstacles that you faced .
Here I describe the obstacles that Visual SourceSafe scatters all over your file history , and the few that Subversion adds in the way of moving from the former to the latter .
My starting point was Power Admin 's migration tool .
I have n't studied Brett Wolldridge 's Perl version as I can't really read Perl but I am assuming from his write up and Power Admin 's write up that the two tools use the same migration strategy .
Using Power Admin's tool to port our older alpha development branch of FOST.3 ™ into the test repository took a few hours to work out how to use the software then just over 2 ½ hours to run .
Checking through this afterwards exposed the major flaw in the migration method : it was oriented towards the structure of the files in SourceSafe at the time of migration and was not able to deal with shared files .
For the way that we develop here this was a problem in the migration .
We use a lot of shared files and setting this up manually in Subversion was certainly going to be a major pain .
It seemed to me that a better approach would be to replay the operations that had been done in the original database on the new Subversion repository .
This would allow me to keep the shared files as logically shared within Subversion , something that I was sure would make the transition much smoother .
It would also have the advantage of forcing me to learn all aspects of Subversion properly before I was trying to show others how we were going to use it .
I felt that it would be fairly simple to produce a slightly more complex version of Power Admin 's software that could merge together file histories wherever possible .
It turns out that this just is n't possible and it took me many days to work out why not .
There are an additional couple of points about the software solution .
One requirement that is implicit in the earlier versions that I want to make explicit here is that the migration process itself must not change the SourceSafe database in any way .
A second was that there was no way I was going to attempt to reverse engineer the database format used by SourceSafe which means that the software only has access to data available through running the command line SourceSafe tools .
SourceSafe only gives us access to changes on files and projects ( I 'll call them directories from now on to avoid confusion ) that are still extant at the time that you query it .
There is no GUID for any file or directory and all the history has the names and paths that the file or directory had at that time and not what they have now .
The entire history of a given file is not shown in its history reports .
File / directory renames are shown in the parent directory history ( the parent they had at the time no less ) , and directory sharing is shown in the parent directories .
The time resolution is only to the nearest minute which means that many events that must be replayed in the right order and are split between project and file histories have to be done by guess work .
Files and directories can get " lost " when a parent directory their history has moved through has later been deleted .
Although we get a hint to tell us the location where a file is checked in we do n't get good information about where the file is first created .
Nobody wants to be bored with details of the wrong turns so I wo n't talk about them .
I 'll only discuss the obstacles that are left after all of my dead ends have been filtered out .
I expected the development to take a couple of days .
In the end it took a couple of weeks — every time I thought I 'd made a breakthrough SourceSafe and later Subversion added an extra layer of complexity .
It was n't until I fully embraced the very complex data structures easily done in C++ that I started to make real headway .
Multidimensional shenanigans
We can think of the revision control information in SourceSafe like stacks of versions for each file ( that we are still using at the point of the migration ) with the newest version at the top of the stack .
The stacks are laid out by the directories that contain them .
Of course some stacks are higher than others ( there are more versions ) and in actual fact some stacks are exact copies of each other ( where the files are shared ) , and more interestingly sometimes parts of stacks are copies of each other ( where a file was shared and then branched ) .
The simplest way to deal with this is to ignore the duplication between stacks and parts of stacks and to treat each stack of versions completely independently .
This is the view that Brett Wooldridge and Power Admin 's approach takes of the SourceSafe database and the view that they leave the Subversion repository in .
It guarantees that all of the file versions are present , but it also looses a lot of the information that is in the SourceSafe database .
A more accurate view is that we have a tree structure of directories and files that change over time .
In order to work out where to put things at certain times we have to work out how this tree changes over time and this is what sourcesafe2subversion does .
This task is thankfully made easier because FOST.3 ™ already included a lot of support for handling time based changes as they are very common in business systems .
Using these same data structures to model an ever changing directory tree was fairly straightforward , although also fiddly due to the fact that we have to construct the tree backwards in time and replay it forwards in time .
Hopefully all of this will make more sense as I explain in detail what happens .
Reading the history
The first part of the migration is to read the file history for each of the files that we 're going to migrate .
The tool only considers files that are still visible in the SourceSafe database at the time of migration — this is in keeping with the earlier tools .
Also in keeping with them it ignores labels .
If you need deleted files or directories to be transferred then look for them in SourceSafe and undelete them first .
The history files that SourceSafe generates need to be parsed to fetch the required information .
For files we only look for create and check - in events , ignoring everything else .
For directories we look at a wider range of tasks , including sub - directory creation and deletion ; file deletion ; file and directory recovery ; and renames , amongst others .
We can largely ignore branches because Subversion does a natural “ soft ” branch at each copy command .
What this means though is that where a file is not branched ( in SourceSafe ) then there will be separate Subversion check - ins for each directory that the shared file resides in .
The history from SourceSafe preserves the relative ordering for any given file or directory ( I 'll just call these histories ) , but gives us the history in reverse order ( with some interesting gotchas ) .
We reverse these to get the natural order .
Pinned files
Pinned files are evil and the need for them is because SourceSafe does n't have proper roll back support .
They do of course complicate the file histories .
When you request the initial file listing from SourceSafe it will normally just put the files that are found in a project in this sort of format :
$ / FOST.3/sourcesafe2subversion : event.cpp event.hpp
This is pretty easy to parse , but if you have a file pinned then you get something that looks like this :
$ / FOST.3/sourcesafe2subversion : event.cpp;2 event.hpp
This tells me that the SourceSafe file $ / FOST.3/sourcesafe2subversion/event.cpp is using version two rather than the latest version .
This tool throws away this extra information .
After using the tool you may need to analyse any pinned versions that are found .
For pinned files you have essentially three options :
Use the latest version anyway .
This is the do nothing option .
Roll the file back in SourceSafe and lose the later versions altogether .
Manually copy the earlier version in Subversion when the migration has completed .
We only had one pinned file in our master database so I just copied the required version after the migration completed .
Temporary files
Visual Studio .NET seems to have introduced another fun new features when you add projects to SourceSafe .
It creates some temporary files in the new project directories and then immediately deletes them .
These delete instructions put other instructions out of order meaning that some files will end up in the wrong place .
Because of this any delete command for a file whose name starts with a tilde ( ~ ) will not be added to the history .
If you use files starting with tildes you will need to have a think about how to deal with this .
Sorting the events
Because the time resolution for the history in SourceSafe is poor and we need to replay events in the right order the first thing that we do is to calculate an order for the events .
Two heuristics are layered together to get an ordering that should work .
Remember that the events that we need to re-run are stored in separate histories for different types of event and the SourceSafe time resolution is so poor that we can't just use its time stamps to work out the proper order .
Our starting point is the full list of events split into a structure that allows us to group them by any SourceSafe time stamp .
We know the relative order for the events in a given history because SourceSafe records them in the right order ( although it delivers the history in reverse order the first stage has already sorted this out ) .
The explanation works best if the second heuristic is explained first .
When we look at the events that happen in any given minute we want to list these in the order that we will play them .
We know that the events within a given history are already correct so we will not touch the relative ordering in the histories .
This means that if we can give a weight for each type of event then we simply go through the histories picking the lightest event from all the histories we are looking at .
The weights are assigned such that directory creation is lighter than getting a version which in turn is lighter than directory deletion .
This works fine , but for project ( directory ) sharing in SourceSafe .
SourceSafe shares the files in a directory before it creates the sub - directories .
Because the sub - directory shares will appear first in the histories this means that when we replay the events we will try to share into directories that do not exist .
This is where the first heuristic comes in .
What we would have liked is for SourceSafe to create the sub - directories before it does the share at a given directory level .
As it does n't do this we attempt to spot this behavior and reverse the events that happen at this time stamp .
This is the place where the tool is most likely to get confused and it happens in one specific circumstance , described next .
Sharing
Here is the normal effect of sharing a project ( directory ) in SourceSafe .
What we have done here is to share the WWW project into $ / FOST.3 / Project1 .
Kirit 11/05/06 14:16 Added _debug Kirit 11/05/06 14:16 Added _fslib Kirit 11/05/06 14:16 Shared $ / FOST.3/ Project1/WWW/config.ini Kirit 11/05/06 14:16 Shared $ / FOST.3/ Project1/WWW/favicon.ico Kirit 11/05/06 14:16 Created WWW
It looks to me that SourceSafe has recorded the events in the opposite order in the history for some reason , but it could be that it just does the sub - directories in some random order .
In any case the first heuristic that we use spots this case and puts the sub - directory creation events first by reversing the events for that directory during that minute .
Here is one with a problem though :
Kirit 30/08/05 14:24 Shared $ / FOST.3/ Project2/WWW/config.ini Kirit 30/08/05 14:24 Added _fslib Kirit 30/08/05 14:24 Added _debug Kirit 30/08/05 14:24 Shared $ / FOST.3/ Project1/WWW/favicon.ico Kirit 30/08/05 14:23 Created WWW
What happened here is that the WWW was added manually and then the favicon .ico was shared .
I then followed this by individually sharing the sub - directories and finally sharing the file config.ini .
The heuristic can't spot this and for this reason the events occur in the wrong order .
In order to overcome this the parser looks for a particular comment format for a file share .
We can edit the comment for this event in the directory history and set it to :
sourcesafe2subversion timestamp : 2005-08-30 14:25:00.000
This tells the parser to not use the timestamp from the history , but to use the specified one instead .
By setting this just one minute later the correct re-ordering of the events at 14:24 will occur .
In the migration of our SourceSafe database this had only happened two times so was fairly easy to work around by changing the time stamps for two file shares .
Planning
We now have the file structures as they are currently and all of the file histories going back in time as if they were all in their current locations .
The planning phase attempts to work out how this structure changed over time so that we can work out where files where at earlier times .
In particular we are interested in merging shared files into a single history wherever possible and as an added bonus we also get to replay delete and undelete commands in many circumstances .
There are a number of stumbling blocks though , the most important of which is that we do n't have history for any directories have subsequently been deleted .
We can't get them by just undeleting and taking a peek because the records may have been purged from the database .
We also cannot even assume that that the database was empty when it was first created as there can be file and directories from earlier than this if they were restored into the database .
This all makes the planning rather tricky , but it does its best .
In order to deal with situations where it does n't have information it makes use of a holding directory called _vss_deleted where file versions that can't be found a home anywhere else are put .
This includes things like all file histories for structures that have been restored into the database and also individual file versions for files where the trail has gone cold due to a directory along their history having been deleted .
This leads to a situation where we get multiple check ins for a file that is actually the same file .
If we consider a file that has been shared between projects A and B and then later from B to C we will end up with three files when planning starts as there are three files in the SourceSafe database now .
This planning stage will merge these together so that when it replays the SourceSafe events it will only play a single event into Subversion before the branch to B and then only two until the branch from C .
After this point it will have to write all three versions for each change .
Lost files
When the planning moves back it will spot and merge the files from C and B and it will then spot and merge the files from B and A .
This means that it will knock out all versions of the file in C prior to the share from B and all versions of the files in C and B prior to the share from A .
This is all well and good and helps to migrate the true history of the SourceSafe database .
The problem comes when B has subsequently been deleted .
In this situation there are two files at the beginning of the planning stage , those in A and C .
The share instruction is lost as we do n't have any history for B and hence we know that the file in C has history from before C was created but we do n't know where that history should be .
Under replay these orphaned files are put into _vss_deleted and for each early version of the file in C we will get a version written to both A and to _vss_deleted even though they are actually the same versions .
Although this is the safest approach to take there is an alternative way of doing it .
We can get the directory that a particular check - in was done to ( although not for the first version ) in the file history .
If we find a file in the specified directory with a check - in at the same time then this is probably the same file .
I say probably because there is a circumstance under which they will be different .
If we take our same example of directory sharing from earlier we can imagine two files X and Y both in A .
These will get shared to B and then on to C .
As described earlier , when we have all three directory histories available to us we know what happened and everything is fine .
We can merge them backward in time during the planning phase .
Of course if B is missing then we lose the connection between the versions in C and the versions in A .
But we can find any check ins for the files in C in A because the history will say something like :
*****************
Version 2 *****************
User : Kirit Date : 8/10/02 Time : 18:36 Checked in $ / A Comment : Example checkin
And , what 's better is that we will see this in our versions in C .
This looks like a good enough basis to merge them with , but there is a problem .
What if in B the file X was renamed to X.temp , Y was then renamed to X and X.temp renamed to Y ?
What we do now is to merge the files back to the wrong versions because we cannot see the rename as we cannot see B '' 's history .
Because of this potential problem the option in the configuration Merge orphaned files can be turned off if you are worried about this .
However to try to minimise the problem the following checks are done : # All prior versions must have the same version number ; #
All prior check in time stamps must match ; #
The check in path on all prior versions must match .
With these extra checks in place it seemed to me that this potential renaming problem probably was n't going to come up and if it did happen then we'd live with it — for us it would n't be an issue .
In order to mitigate against it completely there are two other options : # Restore the deleted directory B if it is still available .
This brings back in the history that can be used to merge them properly .
You can delete it again from Subversion after the migration is complete .
#
Get the planning stage to do a get on the earlier versions and compare them .
Only allow the merge if they actually are identical .
These could both be added in , but I felt it was n't worth it to do the extra coding for this pathological case .
===Replay===
Lest those of you reading this think that all of the problems come from using SourceSafe then let me disabuse you of that right now .
The problems with using the command line client svn ' ' of course only really start with this stage , which takes the events we 've worked out and replays them into the Subversion repository .
Apart from the cryptic error messages and the poorly described commands and options there is also one missing command — undelete .
I 'm sure the lack of this command has been gone through a zillion times one place or another and of course the response is that you just copy the file from the revision it was last in :
svn copy svn://angelo.felspar.net/deleted.txt
-- revision 12345
That 's great , but how do you find the revision number ?
Well , that 's pretty easy too , you just do this :
svn log -v svn://angelo.felspar.net/
This is all well and good , but it 's pretty hard to do programmatically .
You have to issue the second command and pipe the content into a file and then read that back .
Note though that the URI s you find in that file have been decoded from UTF - 8 and it's anybody 's guess which character encoding the file uses .
It would be really helpful if one of the following two would work :
svn copy svn://angelo.felspar.net/deleted.txt
-- revision PREV svn recover svn://angelo.felspar.net/deleted.txt
Audit
It 's virtually impossible to audit the that directory transformations have occured correctly as we do n't have full information from SourceSafe , but we do need to ensure that we have the right end result .
To this end the tool has an option to perform a full get using SourceSafe and an export from Subversion once the migration is complete , but before the final tidying up is done .
A tool like WinMerge can be used to determine that the two structures are the same .
There may be some minor differences ( for example with pinned files ) .
You should be able to explain all differences and make a decision about what to do about them .
Most problems with the tool would normally result in it getting confused and not being able to complete the migration .
This is the final stage that should give you confidence that the migration has worked as it should before you start to work in the new repository .
( other ) Potential problems
There are a few things that the current version of the software assumes hold .
You should check these through an import to a test repository for every SourceSafe database before you migrate to your production Subversion repositories .
Character encodings
The tool is Unicode , Subversion uses UTF - 8 internally and SourceSafe uses … well who knows ?
If you have different people checking things in to SourceSafe who use different locale settings then either SourceSafe handles it properly or you 're already having problems .
Once you 've made the switch to Subversion then these character encodings problems should largely disappear , but I have n't managed to work out all of the encoding issues involved in the transition properly as I can only go from the concrete examples I 've seen .
I can promise you that the tool 's Unicode handling is good and if you can get the SourceSafe history files into a known encoding which you can then read in as Unicode the tool should handle everything properly giving Subversion proper UTF - 8 encoded URIs and writing UTF - 8 encoded comments .
The other command line programs that are used should also work properly as they are all executed through the Windows Unicode API .
Fingers crossed …
Date and times
There are a number of dependencies for the dates used to order the changes .
Check the following items :
Dates are reported in European format , i.e. dd/ mm/yy .
SourceSafe reports years as only the final two digits .
If you have any activity in a SourceSafe database before 2000 CE you will need altered date parsing .
The change should be fairly trivial .
you will need altered date parsing .
The change should be fairly trivial .
The locations of the date and time parts are hard coded for the normal report layouts .
I do n't know what happens if there is a long user name in a history report .
Parsing problems
There are a number of places where the tool needs to parse the output of other programs .
SourceSafe histories follow a pattern that the parser then looks for , but if you use lots of stars in history comments the parser may get confused .
Subversion histories are structured in a much better format for machine reading .
If there are changes to this format then the parser may fail .
It would probably be better to use the Subversion API directly to avoid all of this .
SourceSafe gotchas
These are mostly mentioned in the text , but just for quick reference here is a recap :

Black swan ?
Posted by Mikko @ 15:23 GMT
Pete Lindstrom at Spire Security 's weblog has an interesting post out , challenging whether it really is true that bluetooth viruses have tried infecting my phone four times so far :
My own anecdote is that Mikko is the first person I 've ever heard of who has been
attacked by a bluetooth virus .
And he 's been attacked four times .
Has anyone else out there ever been hit by one , or have a friend who was infected ?
Read the full post here .
So : if you 've ever seen a bluetooth virus in action , do post a comment to Pete 's blog .
Let 's see if we can get any feedback about real cases .
Somehow I find it hard to believe I would be the only person in the world who has seen these incoming bluetooth connections in real life .
Here 's one example of my encounter with Cabir .B .
Cheers ,
Mikko

Alert ( " Your new friend is a worm " ) ; Posted by SGMasood @ 12:43 GMT
Web Application Worms exploit persistent Cross Site Scripting ( XSS ) vulnerabilities in websites .
It 's a new category of malware and it's a growing concern for popular websites .
Social Networking sites seem to be the most popular target as of now .
MySpace has already been hit by two such worms - the Samy worm in October last year and last week 's Flash worm .
Samy was written by a guy who wanted to become popular on MySpace .
So he designed the worm to crawl through the site while furiously adding people to his friends list .
The result : over a million " friends " in a couple of hours .
Last week 's worm exploited a vulnerability in Macromedia Flash to redirect MySpace users to an objectionable webpage .
Last week MySpace was also the target of a malicious banner advertisement that ran on the site .
It used the WMF vulnerability in Windows to serve adware to more than a million users with unpatched machines .
All this piqued our interest and we decided to see how secure other popular social networking sites are against " wormable " XSS vulnerabilities .
We picked two among the top social networking sites with a reported combined user base of 80 million .
Within half an hour we had discovered over half a dozen potentially " wormable " XSS vulnerabilities in each site !
We stopped looking after finding half a dozen , but we are sure there are a lot more holes in there .
With about a day's work a malicious attacker with a half - decent knowledge of javascript could create a worm using just one of these vulnerabilities .
Something to consider :
The WMF banner ad successfully reached about one million users .
An automated worm utilizing a similarly malicious WMF exploit or a similar browser expoit ( maybe even a 0 - day exploit ) could potentially reach a much , much larger audience of unpatched machines .
Theoretically , this could be the entire user base ...
Recommendations -
1 . End users need to patch their machines .
There 's no excuse not to .
2 . Web application developers must start taking security seriously .
Yes , XSS issues are silly , easy to find and omnipresent .
And XSS issues have stopped being funny for a long time now .
They are a real danger with the advent of Phishing and Web Application worms that exploit a mass user base of millions of users within a very short time .
Of course , we have reported the issues to the affected websites and are working with them to get the issues fixed .
And , of course , we are n't taking any names here .
F - Secure Tee Shirt Opportunity Posted by Sean @ 11:42 GMT
Last week we promoted our upcoming Reverse Engineering Challenge .
Today we have a different challenge for you .
Just who is the mystery author mentioned in our previous post ?
The first person to send the correct answer to " nerds [ at ] f- secure [ dot ] com " will be mailed a free F - Secure tee shirt .
Here are your clues :
He 's in the banner photo .
He was the subject of a weblog post sometime during 2005 .
He has 17 years of " experience " .
For those of you that do n't want to do any sleuthing , we 'll have the answer for you next week when Assembly ' 06 starts .

CA vs F - Secure Posted by Mikko @ 14:13 GMT
An interesting discussion has started around comments released by one of our competitors , namely Computer Associates .
The comments given by Simon Perry , a VP at CA were prompted by the mobile antivirus service that will be available for Orange smartphone users in UK .
What is interesting about the debate is that CA is indirectly claiming that Orange has made a bad decision by launching a mobile security solution .
CA seems to be claiming that Orange is either ignorant of what is the real malware situation in their network or of ignoring the data they have and choosing to launch an unnecessary service .
CA well knows that all mobile operators have real - time data detailing everything that happens in their networks , and simply cannot be influenced by marketing messages related to what is happening in their network .
Could it be that CA simply does not have competitive mobile security solutions and is explaining their complete lack of success in the mobile market by denying the threat ?
The fact is that there are over 300 known mobile malware .
That is not hype .
We estimate that tens of thousands of phones have been infected so far , worldwide .
Smartphones based on open operating systems are being targeted already .
This means that the vast majority of phones are safe against current malware , but does not eliminate the damage caused to the users of the smartphones that are or have been infected .
It is also a fact that the number of smartphones , mobile malware and infections are on the rise .
Is the threat real ?
Yes it is .
I know , because I 've been hit four times myself .
Of course I 'm running our antivirus on my phone , so I have n't actually been infected .
But a Bluetooth virus has tried infecting my phone four times so far .
Twice in Helsinki , once in Stockholm and once in London .
Protecting mobile users against current and future threats shows caring and wisdom .
It should be applauded rather than criticized .
If we ignore this problem now it 's only going to get worse .
We can still stop this problem and avoid things getting as bad as they did with PCs .
Ranting off ,
Mikko
Netscape.com hacked Posted by SGMasood @ 11:45 GMT
While we were drafting a weblog post on XSS and Social Networking sites , our man Miguel pointed us to Netscape.com .
Netscape.com has been hacked via a persistent Cross Site Scripting ( XSS ) vulnerability in their newly launched Digg - like news service .
Attackers ( who are obviously fans of Digg ) have used the XSS vulnerability to inject their own javascript code snippets into pages on the website , including the homepage .
As of now , it has only been used to display javascript alerts with " comical " messages and to redirect visitors to Digg.com !
Check out additional screenshots here and here .
Fortunately no one has tried to inject malcious code ... yet .
We 'll finish our draft with more on the potential dangers of XSS for you soon .
Do n't fall for a fake virus outbreak warning Posted by Mikko @ 10:14 GMT
We 've received several reports of a mass mailing that 's going around .
The messages have been spoofed to look like they are from update@microsoft.com and arrive with title " Warning !
New Virus On The Internet ! Update Now ! " .
The link in the mail goes to http://update.microsoft.go.ro and downloads an IRC backdoor .
Administrators might want to filter web traffic to this site .
Abuse messages on the site have been sent .
The downloaded file is detected as W32 / FakeMSUpdate by our latest update ( 2006-07-26_02 ) .

Spy vs. Spy Posted by Sean @ 09:29 GMT
Our spyware researchers really hate the word " affiliate " .
Affiliate marketing drives spyware .
From the worst known offenders to questionable rogue anitspyware software - affiliates trying to sell - by - any - means are the engine behind the problem .
Known rogues install maliciously .
But it 's often difficult to pin down the real rogues .
There 's an incredible amount of just mediocre antispyware out there that is n't malicious , but they use the same marketing and sales techniques as the rogues .
Lots of ads ( paid for by commission seeking affiliates ) -
No trial period - Offering a free scan - But if it finds something you then have to pay to clean it off your system .
And they really get in your face about buying .
The known rogues present outright false positives - sometimes offering to clean the malware that prompted you to download the rogue in the first place .
The mediocre guys might also have false positives , but due to bugs in their code , not outright lies .
Adding detections for second - rate software as malware is n't something we do , but we can blog about it to help you be aware .
Many fall into a gray area and our researchers have to put them to the test .
But regardless of anything else , all of these guys , malicious or not , make apparently outrageous claims .
Affiliates repeat the claims over and over in ads to drive sales and get their cut .
Check out this one site we visited , which we will not name here , but it was nuker.com .
They claim to have a very positive review from Download.com .
Only it is n't a link , just an image .
We 've searched Download.com 's site for the supposed review and cannot locate it , not to our surprise .
Download.com is a trusted source and these guys are trying to subvert that trust to their own ends .
They also link to a Yahoo !
" Headline " on their site .
But if you follow the links , you find it's from the PR news section of Yahoo Business and that they themselves uploaded the article .
They 're quoting themselves !
Think you want to try their product ?

Coming Soon : Another Reverse Engineering Challenge Posted by Mikko @ 14:34 GMT
F - Secure is sponsoring Assembly 2006 – one of the largest demo parties in the world .
It takes place in Helsinki , and it ’s historically always been organized at the same time as DEF CON – so in two weeks from now .
As part of our sponsorship we 're hosting an F - Secure Reverse Engineering Challenge Compo .
It 's a competition where the target is to decode programs in order to find hidden information .
It consists of three Windows EXE files written by one mystery researcher working in the F - Secure Security Labs .
The three challenges are a set .
When the programs are run , they 'll ask the user for a password .
Give the correct password , and you then get instructions on how to find the next challenge .
The goal is to solve all three challenges .
The first ones to complete the challenges will win an iPod or a PSP – See Assembly 's website .
The competition will be open to all , not just those attending Assembly .
More details on the rules - and on the mystery author of the challenges – soon !

Exploit Wednesday Posted by Sean @ 10:27 GMT
Another Microsoft Office exploit , Bifrose .UZ , was discovered last week .
It drops a backdoor using PowerPoint ( PPT ) files .
The exploit was discovered after a limited number of people received e-mail with the PowerPoint file as an attachment .
So what 's the deal with Microsoft Office and why the exploits ?
There were Word fixes in June - Several Excel fixes were included in July 's patches - And now there is a PowerPoint exploit that will need to be patched in August .
See a pattern ?
There 's a growing trend here .
We 've been saying for some time that the lack of large virus outbreaks is evidence that the malware environment could be getting worse , not better .
The bad guys want to make money - not make attention .
So as a malware author , if you want to target a few prominent companies for the purpose of industrial espionage , you design your exploit to attack them within and then lay low .
Spoofed e-mails are sent to company insiders and they , thinking it 's just another document that they need to review , open it up and the backdoor gets installed .
The bad guys are taking advantage of three things :
The first is the patch cycle itself .
These new exploits are being released after the second Tuesday of each month to maximize its lifespan .
The second is the common day - to - day routine of receiving Office files .
There have n't been any new macro viruses to speak of for some time and so Office files ( doc/ xml / ppt ) easily pass through corporate firewalls and people do n't think twice about clicking on them .
This avenue of attack is currently under the radar and is not perceived as a danger by end users .
And the third advantage is that the companies exploited do n't want to talk about it .
They dread the negative publicity as a victim of espionage .
That 's why the public does n't know the name of last month 's Excel exploit victim .
Such hush - hush may be keeping some of these exploits from being reported .

Man - in - the - middle phishing Posted by Mikko @ 11:26 GMT
The first ever case of using a man - in - the - middle attack against an online bank was reported by Brian Krebs of Security Fix on Tuesday .
The security industry has long predicted this type of man - in - the - middle attack ; it was only a matter of time .
The attack targeted Citibank 's Citibusiness service and was designed to spoof the token key hardware device used by the bank 's customers .
The phishing site checked the logon credentials with the real site before rendering the results to the phishing victim .
Enter an invalid password , and you got an invalid logon page .
A man - in - the - middle attack checks everything done at the phishing site against the original , so everything should look and feel more genuine .
Exactly the same kind of attacks can be used to target other types of two - factor authentication , including one - time password sheets .
More on Updates Posted by Sean @ 11:11 GMT
With spear phishing on the increase , you should n't neglect visiting Microsoft Update this month .
There are a good number of Office patches to be downloaded and Excel has the most with eight different vulnerabilities .
Even Excel Viewer 2003 requires a patch .
Users do n't update Office as often as the Windows OS and it 's increasingly becoming a target for more focused spear phishing attacks .
Your company could be next - update soon .
And now for something completely different : Daylight Savings Time 2006 was adjusted in Australia to accommodate the Commonwealth Games .
If you live down under , it 's time to adjust the system time back to the standard dates .
G'Day !

Yet Another Name Posted by Kamil @ 11:04 GMT
Last Friday we posted on rogue anti-spyware .
Also on Friday , Alex Eckelberry of SunbeltBlog posted on a new rogue named SpyHeal .
It is believed that SpyHeal is probably a replacement for SpywareQuake .
Take a look , SpyHeal is one of the results of our " Privacy Policy " search .
SpywareQuake is there too !
We have no doubt that they are related .
Kudos to Sunbelt .

What 's In a Name ?
Posted by Kamil @ 14:53 GMT
There 's a category of software that 's rather difficult to define , or at least to name .
Many term it as potentially unwanted applications or software ( PUA / PUS ) .
Companies pushing this type of software use every possible means to get you to download as many copies of their product as possible .
Spamming , pop-ups , hijacking start pages , etc. Sound familiar ?
What are we speaking of ?
Rogue anti-spyware and other so - called system optimization utilities .
And they are n't just pushing one version , they 're pushing many .
Some of these guys create one engine and then sell it under multiple names and interfaces .
Their websites even look like they are copied from the same template .
The sales pitch typically includes a " free " scan .
The results of the scan are often doctored with items that you should remove or fix .
Except in order to do so , you now need to buy a license .
Check out the results of this Google search .
Most of the results are of suspected rogues and are hosted on the same server .
What did we search for ?
A block of text from one site 's privacy policy .
Either all of the sites borrowed exactly the same text from each other , or they are in fact the same organization .
If your product is legitimate , why do you need 30 or more names for it ?

Still Living in 1998 ?
Posted by Sean @ 10:32 GMT
The second Tuesday of this month brings something else in addition to Microsoft Security Updates .
July 11th will also mark the end of Windows 98 / ME technical support .
It 's now the end of their lifecycle .
At least at Microsoft .
According to IDC figures , there are an estimated 70 million 98 / ME machines still in operation worldwide .
Searching for news stories on the topic yields a good number of results from India .
Older hardware and the costs of upgrading can be a very limiting factor for some .
So what to do if you 're still running an older OS ?
Make sure that you have a good antivirus product and a firewall .
Check out Microsoft's Security At Home 98 & ME for more information .
( You 'll find special offers for our F - Secure Internet Security and Anti-Virus products there . )
If you 're still holding on to older hardware because you 're a hobbist , you might also consider trying out a lightweight distribution of Linux .
Live CDs make it quite easy to give it a try .
The George Deutsch scandal instantly became one of the top stories in the press this week , and the coverage has been widespread , even where I live in the United Kingdom .
Andrew Revkin , the author of the New York Times article about Deutsch ’s resignation , deserves a round of applause for being the first to bring the story into the mainstream media .
He contacted me late Monday night , only a few hours after I posted my original findings .
I would also like to direct readers to two Texas papers , the Fort Worth Star - Telegram and the Houston Chronicle , which both ran good stories with a local focus .
In addition , I will be on The World Tonight on BBC Radio 4 tonight at 10:00 pm GMT .
Not everyone has covered this story well , and some have n’t even covered it at all .
Although The Washington Post did cover the Deutsch resignation on Wednesday , the same day as The New York Times , it did not mention the source of the information on Deutsch ’s lying about having a college degree .
Although it briefly mentioned The Scientific Activist in an article on Thursday , it never acknowledged the fact that That ’s the last time I give them a hot news tip .
Incomplete coverage is n’t as bad as no coverage , which is what 's happening at Texas A&M University ’s student paper The Battalion .
There has n't been a single article about the NASA censorship scandal , even though the original story came out over a week and a half ago .
All of this is occurring despite the fact that the story is about A&M and the fact that Why has n’t their been any coverage ?
Editor in Chief Melissa Filbin has the explanation .
“ I just do n’t see the angle , ” she told me .
Are you serious ?
No angle ?
Filbin told me explicitly on Tuesday that there would be no coverage of this story .
Unsurprisingly , a writer at the paper described to me what ’s going on as “ Lots of politics .
” If you would like to submit a letter for publication , submit it to mailcall@thebattalion.net .
Please note that the paper 's website states that letters are supposed to be 200 words or less .
I used to write for The Battalion , and in general I think it is professional and well - done , especially for a student paper .
This situation is pretty sad , though .
I hope that the editors of The Battalion will change their minds , because so far they have done a great disservice to the students of Texas A&M University , many of whom rely on the student paper to find out what ’s going on in the world .
( 9 February 23:59 GMT ) :
It looks like The Battalion will be running a story about Deutsch this Friday after all .
Thanks go to lunaliar for bringing this to my attention .
I called the Editor in Chief , and although she would n't tell me much , she verified that the article would indeed feature an interview with Deutsch himself .
Deutsch only just broke his media silence , but based on what he 's said so far , I think we can expect something pretty ridiculous .
I hope that The Battalion will provide a detailed background on the story , but since it has waived that option so far by not reporting on it at all , I 'll believe it when I see it .
Either way , I do n't think it would hurt to keep them on their toes , so I 'll leave the contact information up in case you have anything you want to say .
( 10 February 9:26 GMT ) : Forget about what I said in the last update .
The Battalion is in factrunning a story today on the NASA scandal , despite Melissa Filbin telling me and others that there would be one .
( 10 February 20:52 GMT ) : I probably should have made this update earlier , but I have been busy all day making up for lost time in the research lab this week !
As it has already been noted in the comments for this post , The Battalion did apparently run an AP story on Deutsch today , although I have n't seen it ( it does not appear on the paper 's website ) .
While I am glad that there has been some coverage , this is n't a substitute for more in depth reporting , and it definitely does not make up for not reporting on this incident at all until now .
I should make it clear that this has nothing to do with mentioning me or The Scientific Activist .
Instead , this is about the students who relied on this paper for their news and were left in the dark on this subject .
Regardless ,
The Battalion has proven itself in the past to be a professional paper , and with the large student body and wealth of resources available to it by operating at such a big public university , I have faith that it can overcome this and not drop the ball the next time a story like this comes up .
I took down the contact information for The Battalion since it was no longer relevant .
Sir Iqbal Sacranie 's organisation represents 400 groups
The Muslim Council of Britain ( MCB ) pledged to tackle extremism " head on " after the 7 July attacks in London .
But in a BBC Panorama special , Mehbood Kantharia and other prominent British Muslims question the MCB 's commitment to meeting this challenge .
The MCB has branded the programme " deeply unfair " and a " witch - hunt " .
Secretary general Sir Iqbal Sacranie said Panorama had used " deliberately garbled quotes in an attempt to malign the Muslim Council of Britain " .
He said it had " the barely concealed goal of drawing British Muslims away from being inspired in their political beliefs and actions by the faith of Islam " .
" It is unfortunate that just when Britain 's 1.6 million Muslims are beginning to make progress in terms of their political participation in the mainstream , there are those who are purposefully trying to sabotage that process , " he added .
Task force
Mehbood Kantharia was a member of the MCB 's central working committee between 1997 and 2004 , but has since left the organisation .
He told Panorama : " It is my personal view that because they are in a state of denial they cannot become real , you know , sort of like , forthright , really forthright about wanting to do something about the kind of extremism that prevails . "
We are confident the programme will be a timely contribution to the present debate
Mike Robinson , Panorama producer
Editor tackles Panorama ' slur '
The MCB , an umbrella organisation of about 400 mosques and other Islamic groups , is seen as representing mainstream Muslim opinion in the UK .
On Saturday the council said Mr Kantharia had informed it that his remarks were not referring to the MCB .
But Mr Kantharia later said that while he had not mentioned the MCB specifically , his comments could have been interpreted as applying to individuals within it .
" I think the MCB is overreacting in this matter , " he added .
MCB secretary general Sir Iqbal Sacranie was asked after the 7 July attacks to help set up a task force to root out extremism in Britain 's Muslim communities .
After meeting Tony Blair in Downing Street on 19 July he said : " The community is determined to deal with this issue head on . "
But an investigation by Panorama reporter John Ware found groups affiliated to the MCB promoting anti-Semitic views , the belief that Islam is a superior ideology to secular British values and the view that Christians and Jews are conspiring to undermine Islam .
In an interview with Mr Ware , Sir Iqbal refused to disown a group known as Al - e - Hadith , which says the ways of Christians and Jews " are based on sick or deviant views " and that " imitating the Kuffar [ non- Muslims ] leads to a permanent abode in hellfire " .
Suicide bombers
Commenting on the group , Sir Iqbal said " we must accept the reality " of the diversity within the Muslim community in the UK .
He also praised the work of the Islamic Foundation , which promotes the teachings of Jamaa 'at Islami founder Sayid Mawdudi .
Mr Mawdudi wrote Islam was a " revolutionary ideology which seeks to alter the social order of the entire world " .
In a wide ranging interview , Mr Ware also tackled Sir Iqbal on his decision not to attend the Holocaust Day Memorial and his attendance of a memorial service for Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin , who supported suicide bombers in Israel .
Asked what kind of signal his presence at Sheikh Yassin 's memorial service sent to young British Muslims , Sir Iqbal said : " If your whole question is based upon one aspect of that person 's belief in terms of supporting it , we look into the wider picture .
The suicide bombing that you 're referring to is one aspect of the whole struggle . "
But Sir Iqbal condemned suicide bombings by British Muslims anywhere and said there was no difference between the life of a Palestinian and the life of a Jew and that all life was sacred .
In a separate interview , a senior spokesman for one of the MCB 's main affiliates , the Muslim Association of Britain ( MAB ) , appeared to condone the glorification of suicide bombers .
' Witch hunt '
Asked if describing martyrdom in Israel as " divine bliss " meant he was an " apologist for terrorism " , Dr Azzam Tamini replied : " If you want to consider me so that 's up to you . "
London mayor Ken Livingstone earlier this week accused the BBC and other media organisations of conducting a " witch - hunt " against the MCB , which he described as the " mainstream representative body of British Muslims " .
The MCB has made a formal complaint to the BBC accusing it of " blatant pro-Israeli bias " and " undermining community relations in the UK " .
In his letter of complaint , written before he had viewed the programme , Sir Iqbal said : " It appears the BBC is more interested in furthering a pro-Israeli agenda than assessing the work of Muslim organisations in the UK . "
He added : " The BBC should not allow itself to be used by the highly placed supporters of Israel in the British media to make political capital out of the 7 July atrocities in London . "
' Timely contribution '
In his response , Panorama editor Mike Robinson , said the programme examined questions " being raised by the Muslim community itself " .
" Despite some critical comments to the contrary , it is certainly not the case that nearly all the questioning of Sir Iqbal Sacranie was about Israel . "
He added that the BBC " rejects completely any allegation of institutional or programme bias " and he was " confident " the programme would be " a timely contribution to the present debate " .
The Panorama special A Question of Leadership is on BBC One at 2220BST on Sunday , 21 August .

Supreme Court Hears Arguments in KSR summarizes the oral arguments for KSR International v. Teleflex , an important patent case pending before the Supreme Court .
The question involves whether it should be more difficult to obtain a patent for a claimed invention in a patent application .
In our patent system , a patent may be obtained if four criteria are satisfied : ( a ) if it is the type of thing that the patent statute covers , i.e. " statutory subject matter " ( this is pretty broad , of late — it includes any practical invention — " anything under the sun that is made by man " — this is " Section 101 " of the US Patent Act ) ; ( b ) has " utility " ( pretty easy to satisfy , unless it does not work at all , like a perpetual motion machine , or if it has only " negative " utility , e.g. a weapon that would destroy all life on earth — Section 101 again ) , ( c ) which is " novel " ( this means new — section 102 ) ; and ( d ) which is " non-obvious " ( section 103 ) .
This last — non - obviousness ( called " inventive step " in most other countries ) — is usually the most difficult hurdle to overcome .
This is because many things are " new " combinations of existing things or elements , but " would have been " considered " obvious " to a hypothetical " person having ordinary skill in the art " ( PHOSITA ) .
In other words , an invention is not novel if you can find a single prior art " reference " ( say , a previous patent or article ) that fully describes it .
But if the invention is a combination of elements that is a new combination of elements and not all found in a single reference , then it is novel .
So then the Examiner has to find multiple references that teach all the elements .
Now originally , the Supreme Court held that simply aggregating old elements together does not pass the patentability test if the elements are each performing the same functions that they were already known to perform .
( See pp. 36 et seq. of this brief . )
But the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ( CAFC ) , the federal appellate court with exclusive appellate jurisdiction in patent law cases since it was established in 1982 , has held that a claimed invention cannot be held obvious unless the patent office can show some proven " ' teaching , suggestion , or motivation ' [ TSM ] that would have led a person of ordinary skill in the art to combine the relevant prior art teachings in the manner claimed . "
That is , the CAFC 's approach has allowed mere aggregations to be patented so long as there is no evidence suggesting that the elements be combined .
( Here one gets a glimpse of the utter arbitrariness and inherent vagueness of IP law and its complete dissimilarity to real property law . )
So under current practice , using the example above , the PTO Examiner has to find two or more references that show all the elements of the claimed invention , AND he must somehow show some other teaching or reference that suggests combining the references .
For example , suppose it 's known to make brooms with straw bristles ; and it 's known to use plastic for a variety of purposes .
Someone tries to patent a broom having plastic bristles .
Let 's assume this is novel — no one has done this before .
Is it " obvious " to combine plastic ( which is known to be widely used , and as a substitute for other materials ) with the standard broom design ( also well known ) ?
What if the Examiner can't find an article where someone muses , " Say , you know , you could use plastic instead of straw in a broom if you want — ... " ?
The point is that quite often , you can get an invention patented by making sure it includes some fairly trivial feature that makes it " novel " and then , when the Examiner tries to argue well , this is just obvious , you tell him he has to prove it by finding an explicit TSM ( teaching , suggestion or motivation ) out there that suggests combining the elements .
( And let 's face it : all inventions are combinations of existing prior art ; this is the nature of progress . )
In other words , under the current TSM test , claims " cannot be held invalid . . . no matter how trivial might be the differences "  from the prior art unless evidence suggesting the difference is found in the art .
In the current case , KSR manufactures gas pedals that can be adjusted for the height of the driver and uses electronic signals rather than a mechanical cable to accelerate when the pedal is pushed .
Both features were developed separately but Teleflex sued KSR claiming that KSR 's combination of the two features infringed on a patent it was issued in May 2001 .
KSR argues that the patent should be invalidated because the combination of the two features is obvious .
They want the Supreme Court to overrule the CAFC , which " held that the prior art did not render the claimed invention unpatentable because they had not proven , beyond genuine dispute and by clear and convincing evidence , that there was a suggestion or motivation to combine the teachings of the prior art in the particular manner claimed by the patent at issue ( U.S. Patent No. 6,237,565 ) . "
So what will the Court do ?
It is possible the TSM test may be modified or dropped , and I hope it is .
This would mean it is easier for the patent office to show that a claimed invention is obvious , since it will not have to show a TSM to combine well - known elements that the patent applicant has merely aggregated in an obvious way .
The presumption may be shifted , so that if all the elements claimed are shown in multiple references , the patent applicant has to show that the invention is non-obvious , rather than the PTO ( or opponent at trial ) having to show some TSM to aggregate or combine the well - known elements .
It 's interesting that some companies are against the TSM test ( that is , they are in favor of making it more difficult to obtain patents ) , and some are in favor of it .
" Critics of the test argue that this has made it too difficult to prove that a claimed invention is obvious . "
The Coalition for Patent Fairness , for example , which incldes high - tech companies like Intel , Cisco Systems and Hewlett - Packard , seems to be in favor of revision of the current test .
" The tech companies [ Microsoft Corp. , Cisco Systems Inc. , Intel Corp. and others ] want to put a damper on all the patents on all the patents on business methods , designs and undeveloped technologies that casues them to spend lots of money to defend . "
( One of their concerns is " patent trolls - companies that exist primarily to make money from patents through litigation instead of commercialization " — but as I 've noted , the hostility against patent trolls is misplaced .
They are no different than any other patentee who takes advantage of the corrrupt and unjust patent system . )
But pharmaceutical and biotechnology research - based companies such as Johnson & Johnson , GE and DuPont , for example , have filed briefs " arguing that major changes to the patent system would jeopardize billions of dollars invested in product innovation .
They want to protect pharmaceutical and chemical products from generic manufacturers and counterfeiters .
These companies oppose any change to the test since it might make it difficult to patent known drugs for new uses .
I am hopeful the Court will decide to narrow or drop the TSM test , but even if they do , it 's only a mild improvement to this horrible morass of artificial and unjust law .

The small loans are aimed at helping developing countries
But in 1997 , Mr Whittle 's boss gave him a new challenge - to fund small projects .
After several failed attempts to push these small projects through the World Bank bureaucracy , he decided to call a brainstorming session .
" My colleagues and I went into a room at the World Bank one day , and said , what if we just allowed anybody to come in and just pitch their idea .
And what if we made decisions on the same day , " said Mr Whittle .
They decided to put the plan into action , and it proved successful .
More than 1,000 groups from some 85 countries submitted ideas for small businesses and non-profit projects .
More than 500 finalists were chosen , and came to Washington , DC , to make their cases for funding .
On the final day , the World Bank awarded $ 5 m to dozens of small start - ups .
But what Mr Whittle remembers most is a conversation with one South African woman who did not win that day .
She was not upset .
In fact , she was convinced that there were many people around the world who would fund her project if they knew about it .
Going online
Dennis
Whittle saw an opportunity to tap into what he calls the " secondary market " for donations .
He quit the World Bank , and six years ago , he and a colleague started a private , web - based microfinance program called Global Giving .
Take a goat herder in Uganda .
If you give him $ 25 , that 's two smaller goats .
That 's a great start .
With $ 100 , you can imagine more goats , perhaps a small shelter , stock up on goat feed
Jessica Flannery , Kiba
" The website is kind of like a combination of eBay and Amazon .
And the idea is that qualified grassroots projects from around the world can be listed , as long as they meet certain qualifications .
" If you 're a donor , and you 're interested in HIV / Aids , you can find projects to fund .
If you 're interested in projects in Kenya , you can find those .
It 's a clearing house . "
A potential donor searches through a list of small - scale projects on the Global Giving website .
You can even e-mail project leaders for more information .
Then , the donor can choose to give as little as $ 10 to a project .
Some , though , have given as much as $ 150,000 .
Needy projects
Global Giving is not the only website tapping into internet 's power to directly connect would - be funders with would - be entrepreneurs .
The couple behind Kiva spent time in Africa
Kiva 's story starts a little more than two years ago , when Jessica Flannery went to East Africa .
She was working for a group that gives $ 100 grants to needy projects .
" Every single day , I would meet an entrepreneur , and hear about how $ 100 had changed not just his or her life , but also the lives of their families , friends and other community members , " said Ms Flannery .
" Take a goat herder in Uganda .
If you give him $ 25 , that 's two smaller goats .
That 's a great start .
With $ 100 , you can imagine more goats , perhaps a small shelter , stock up on goat feed .
So , that little bit of money can really help set someone up . "
Jessica 's husband Matt Flannery , a computer programmer , came to visit her in East Africa for a few weeks .
He too was moved by the entrepreneurial spirit he saw there .
So , he set out to design a website that could connect small lenders with small donors .
" I wanted to start a little program where someone in America or Europe or Australia or anywhere with the internet could lend money online to a small businessperson in Africa , " said Mr Flannery .
' Peer - to - peer ' giving
The result is the Kiva website .
Kiva is a Swahili word for unity or agreement .
The site went live last year .
The challenge that these microcharity enterprises have is identifying great projects , vetting them , ensuring that they are on the level , and ensuring that they are using the money wisely
Ethan Zuckerman , Harvard Law School
" The way it works is you pay using PayPal , " said Mr Flannery .
" Then , you receive updates that are like blogs over e-mail and on the internet , and eventually you get paid back according to the performance of the entrepreneur . "
Lenders do not receive interest on loans , but the borrower does pay some interest , which helps pay some of Kiva 's costs .
But the internet can bring both great promise and great peril for microfinance , according to Ethan Zuckerman , a fellow at Harvard Law School 's Berkman Center for Internet and Society .
Mr Zuckerman , who also sits on the advisory board of Global Giving , points out that the net makes it easy to give money to worthy projects , but it also makes it easy for scammers to dupe potential donors .
He says that guarding against these kinds of scams is an important service Global Giving and Kiva can provide .
" The challenge that these microcharity enterprises have is identifying great projects , vetting them , ensuring that they are on the level , and ensuring that they are using the money wisely , " he said .
Globalgiving and Kiva say they work with local groups to vet would - be entrepreneurs .
Both organisations contend that is the best and most cost - effective way to make sure money collected via the internet is distributed efficiently , and properly .
Both websites seem to have successfully tapped into what one could call a " distributed network " of small donors and lenders worldwide .
Global Giving has raised millions of dollars in donations for small projects in the developing world .
And while the Kiva 's co-founders will not put a dollar figure on the amount they have loaned so far , they do say that every time a new business is listed on the website , the needed funds are raised in just days , or even hours .

Bush ’s ballyhooed speech , full of swaggering braggadocio about his now - acknowledged secret prisons and the tortures his minions practice there ( which Bush , using the usual prissy euphemisms favored by state - terror sadists , calls " an alternative set of procedures " ) , made much hay of the information squeezed out of al - Qaeda factotum Abu Zubaydah .
But as Ron Suskind noted in his piercing book , The One Percent Solution — and notes again in a new Salon.com interview — Zubaydah is literally insane , suffering from a severe multiple personality disorder .
He was never a top al Qaeda operative , as Bush claimed yet again in his bluster yesterday ; and the " information " he spewed out under torture was almost entirely garbage — yet , as Suskind notes , it sent American agents on wild goose chases all over the world .
I mentioned here earlier this week that as the Bush era endgame begins , these thugs will grow more brazen in their depredations , and more open about their brutal tactics .
It ’s getting harder to hide the massive extent of their lawbreaking , and if the Democrats take Congress in November , it will be harder still .
So what they must do now is simply break down all notions of law and morality , destroy the notions of justice and honor .
They must make up down and turn black to white :
Torture is not bad , it ’s not a crime ; torture is good , it keeps us safe .
You want to be safe , do n’t you ?
You want your children to be safe , do n’t you ?
Then we must use these " alternative procedures . "
And to keep us safe , the president must be able to do anything he pleases , without hindrance from the " pre-9/11 mindset " of the Constitution : he can spy on us , he can imprison us without charges , he can hold us indefinitely , he can even murder us in " extrajudicial killings " without arrest , trial , jury — or warning .
What ’s wrong with that , if it keeps your family safe ?
Do you want your children to die ?
Because that ’s what will happen if you oppose the president !
All of this must be made to seem normal , acceptable — even laudable — if the Bush Faction is to remain in power and escape prosecution .
Like ABC ’s " Road to 9/11 " propaganda film , Bush ’s speech is part of a larger campaign of moral and political subversion that will only grow in frenzy and intensity in the months to come .
The Best of Chris Floyd
You don´t have to go to Brasilia to experience Oscar Niemeyer´s wacky architecture .
Right near the center of São Paulo is his Memorial da America Latina .
It was opened in 1989 , despite it´s rather 60´s Jetson´s look .
Niemeyer has never really altered his style .
The centerpiece of the memorial is a vast , shade - less , sunbaked , concrete plaza -- perhaps not the best feature in a tropical city .
The project strikes me as one of those self - congratulatory public projects that don´t do very much good .
The quote at the bottom of the bleeding hand is from the then - governor of São Paulo state .
The site is located next to one of the major transit points in São Paulo ; Barra Funda , where the train , subway and multiple bus lines converge .
A shopping mall would´ve been a better contribution to the urban fabric .
Instead Paulistas have a vast , fenced - in , ceremonial dead - zone in the heart of the city .
I suppose the models at least looked cool .

Gore 's TV idea seems more Current / Viewer - sent content ridiculed a year ago

Television insiders and pundits mocked Al Gore and Joel Hyatt a year ago when the pair introduced Current TV , their San Francisco - based cable and satellite channel .
Even after critics saw that the ex-vice president and Democratic Party fundraiser were n't crafting a left - wing network , few in the change - averse world of television could understand why anyone would tune into Current 's programming motif : three - to seven - minute videos created by emerging filmmakers , citizen journalists and the most rank of amateurs -- the viewers themselves .
Soon after Current 's premiere , the Wall Street Journal described it this way : " Newsless , often clueless and usually dull , the new channel is a limp noodle . "
Plus , Current was carried in only 17 million households , making it the equivalent of a one - stoplight town in the television universe .
Big advertisers do n't start calling until a network can be seen in 40 million households .
But the media landscape has shifted in the past year , as video - sharing sites like YouTube.com revealed an audience for viewer - created entertainment .
Current has since led the industry in the commercialization of that concept , as its viewers are creating ads for its leading advertisers .
Half of Toyota and Sony 's commercials on Current are made by the people watching them , giving advertisers a window into the mind - set of the coveted younger demographic .
Now carried in 30 million homes , Current will announce a plan next month for online expansion and is planning an international version next year .
Madeleine Smithberg , co-creator of Comedy Central 's " The Daily Show With Jon Stewart , " will start a daily offering this fall that 's still under wraps .
The best news of all for Hyatt , who is Current 's CEO , is that the operation is making a small profit , according to Derek Baine , a senior analyst with Monterey - based Kagan Research .
And some of the TV industry observers who once mocked Current have begun to change their minds as several networks , such as CNN and the CW -- which is a combination of the former WB and UPN television networks -- are now embracing user - generated content .
But while Current may have been ahead of the curve on this trend , the next challenge it confronts is tougher :
Many in the channel 's targeted 18 - 34 demographic may not be able to afford the premium - tier service of some digital cable systems , where Current is carried .
Others may prefer lapping up videos online in YouTube 's free - form format rather than on Current 's more organized site .
Critics continue to ask : Is Current focused on the wrong medium ?
Current " caught the ( viewer - created content ) trend early , but it is kind of surfing by them , " said John Higgins , business editor at Broadcasting & Cable magazine , a trade publication for the television industry .
" These guys ( at Current ) had all the right ideas and all the same machinery in place that YouTube did , but they did n't quite do it .
Lighting struck 10 feet to the left of them .
" Do you ever hear people say , ' Did you see that video on Current ? '
No .
They say , ' Did you see that video on YouTube ? ' " Higgins said .
Hyatt said Current is trying to position itself as the thinking person 's YouTube -- " a premium offering " where the best of user - generated content will gravitate to TV .
Part of Current 's strategy is rooted in the belief that while YouTube may be serving up 100 million videos a day to 6 million unique visitors , the 18 - to - 34 set still watches and appreciates a lot of television .
But while that age group watches an average of three hours and 55 minutes a day , it is far less than older folks .
The over - 50 crowd sees nearly six hours daily , according to Nielsen Media Research .
Yet , in another sign that media consumption habits are unpredictable , the audience for short videos may not be as young as perceived .
The highest percentage of YouTube 's audience is between 35 and 49 years old , according to June measurements by Nielsen / NetRatings .
" Content creators -- people who want to share their stories with their generational cohorts -- believe that television is at a whole different level than the Web , " Hyatt said recently while sitting in Current 's offices across the street from AT&T Park .
" So , yes , anybody can submit a piece of video to , fill in the blank -- YouTube , iFilm , Google Video , Yahoo video -- and it's all put up there .
And it 's a big mass of stuff .
" And for viewer creators , yes , you get your stuff on the Web , but the best of it can get on television , " Hyatt said .
Plus , said Current programming chief David Neuman , cable TV offers a proven business model that a dot - com company does n't .
Higgins agreed : " That 's where they have to make their mark .
To be the organizers , the editors of user - generated video . "
The majority of Current 's videos , called " pods , " are submitted by correspondents with whom the channel 's editors have a continuing relationship .
About 30 percent of Current 's pods come in over the transom as " viewer - created content . "
The way viewer - created video winds up on the air is akin to " American Idol . "
Creators submit pieces to Current 's Web site , www.current.tv, where viewers comment on them and vote on whether to " green - light " them to the airwaves .
Current producers skim the cream of these for airplay .
Current 's lineup is an eclectic mix of point - of - view journalism and trend and cultural pieces .
It has aired heartbreaking stories from AIDS - ridden corners of Africa and wacky pods on bikini - wearing meter maids .
It 's shown correspondents filming from the site of recent rocket attacks in Israel and aired an insightful conversation with two Hezbollah members that was filmed days before the current Middle East war broke out .
Programming chief Neuman , an NBC veteran who supervised mid-1980s comedies such as " Cheers , " became more confident than ever that Current was on the right track last fall when he saw a video filmed by a New Orleans resident shortly after Hurricane Katrina struck the city -- and before network reporters could get on the ground .
The resident shot the video while he volunteered on a 3 a.m. rescue operation aboard a flat - bottomed boat .
" He was authentically from that place , " Neuman said .
" He was telling the story in his voice , from his point of view .
It was just a more compelling and authentic experience than you could get from conventional news .
And he had scooped the competition .
They were out by a satellite truck somewhere trying to figure out how to drive through 3 feet of water . "
Neuman said Current has no hard rules on story length , but it has no plans to begin airing long - form documentaries .
While its market research says Current 's audience will watch six to eight pods in a row , Neuman said , " They do n't want to sit there and be annihilated with miserable war news for 45 minutes .
" When you want the audience to participate meaningfully in digital generation , it 's easier in the short form , " he said .
Current may be ahead for now in the area of short - form television entertainment , but others in the industry are gaining on it .
In the past few weeks , the CW announced it would allow viewers to create 15 - second promotional spots for its programs , as Current already does .
In September , MTV will start MTV Flux in the United Kingdom , a channel that will allow viewers to share video they shot ; if the concept works , an MTV executive said all MTV channels could be " fluxed . "
CNN just started soliciting viewer video and photos for its CNN Exchange Web site , and NBC has created a channel on YouTube.com to promote its programs .
Hyatt smiled and shook his head at the changes , noting that the imitation is flattering .
" We are gratified , to be sure , but we 're motivated by the validation . "
But Current is still too small to be Nielsen - rated , " so nobody knows if people are watching or not , " said Baine , of Kagan Research , who is tracking Current .
" That 's a tough thing for advertisers .
You 're showing them a lot of hypotheticals . "
Baine estimated that the company is turning a slight profit of $ 3 million this year based on estimated revenue of $ 47 million .
He forecasts that Current 's advertising revenue will increase next year to $ 19 million from $ 10 million this year .
" For a network in its first year to not be losing money is pretty good , " Baine said .
Major advertisers such as Toyota are happy with Current 's first year -- and especially its V - CAMS , or viewer - created ads , which began in May .
Toyota is so pleased with the new approach that it is considering using a viewer - created ad if it buys advertising time during the 2007 Super Bowl .
Current " is a great place to experiment with new ideas like this , " said Kim McCullough , corporate manager for marketing communications for Toyota Motor Sales , USA .
As for whether television is the best medium for user - generated content , McCullough said , " I do n't think there is one best way .
It 's too early to say right now .
We want to be involved in all these different platforms as this shakes out . "
Next , Current is experimenting with a video - on - demand offering in Los Angeles , where viewers can watch the pods they choose .
It is attempting to lure more high - end filmmakers with its " Seeds of Tolerance " contest , which awards $ 100,000 to the best piece on tolerance and diversity .
And two months ago , it began soliciting short pods shot on cell phones .
Newman said the quality is n't good yet , but he is n't concerned .
" It 's perfectly consumable TV ; it 's just not really compelling , " Neuman said .
" Where it will become more compelling is when it 's taking you places where you would n't be taken otherwise . "

One sat -nav firm has now removed Crackpot from its database
Cars , minibuses and trucks have taken the steep , twisty road from Swaledale to Wensleydale in North Yorkshire .
When vehicles become stuck , drivers are reversing perilously close to the cliff edge , say worried locals .
Carol Porter , 39 , who lives at Summer Lodge Farm , said : " We want this sorting out before something terrible happens . "
She said that she and her husband Steven , 41 , who live next to the track , have been helping at least one driver a week .
" When they get grounded on the small boulders , we 're having to go up there in the tractor and pull them out , " said Mrs Porter .
" If we 're outside , we try to stop them , but it 's a public right of way so we can't put any signs up saying no entry . "
We get a lot of sales reps in posh cars coming and they get so cross

The couple want to see the track removed from the route recommended by satellite navigation systems for travelling between Swaledale and Wensleydale .
She said : " The drivers are going up and through the gate on to the gravel track .
" You can see it goes from Tarmac to the stones - and it's only just passable with 4x4s .
" But we get a lot of sales reps in posh cars coming and they get so cross .
" We 're three miles off the main road and having to turn them back and tell them to take a different road , they 're getting really frustrated . "
Even an Argos delivery truck had to turn round at Christmas when it was faced with the track , she said .
" It 's only a matter of time before something happens - and it's a 100 ft drop over the edge . "
Database change
Grinton Parish Council has now asked North Yorkshire County Council to look into the problem and see if safety signs can be erected .
A county council spokesman said : " We will look at the signing issue and any appropriate action that needs to be taken will be taken . "
A spokeswoman for Trafficmaster , which makes the Smartnav system , said it had removed any possibility of through - routes making use of Crackpot from its mapping database after tests on Wednesday morning .
She added : " The tests showed if you keyed in Crackpot as a destination then you would be sent along this route but it would not have been used as a through - route on our system .
" We believe our system would not have been responsible for taking motorists on unsuitable roads in the first place . "
How to defend yourself from bad advice about writing
In one of the NaNoWriMo forums , Elrina asks for help on " How to Avoid Passive Tense ? " :
Okay , I admit it .
I am a shameless user of passive tense .
I 've been involved with a power - struggle with one of my writing profs on campus ( creative nonfiction class ) about the tense , and I think it 's finally time for me to concede .
However , she seems to think that I should just inherently know other ways to word things .
And , of course , there 's the issue that I do n't think I quite understand passive tense , because the things she 's been marking as " wrong , " are not passive tense as I was taught .
I guess I tend to say things like " I was doing this , " " there were these things , " etc .
A specific sentence I 've been playing with recently :
" Thomas was relieved when the car finally pulled onto the highway . "
So , any thoughts would be awesome .
Well , Elrina , here are a few thoughts .
First , there 's nothing wrong with " Thomas was relieved when the car finally pulled onto the highway " .
At least , there 's no grammatical or stylistic reason for you to reword it .
Second , that sentence is probably not really an example of the passive voice , unless you mean that Thomas was relieved in the sense that his replacement arrived for duty .
If you mean that Thomas was relieved in the sense that he felt a lessening of anxiety , then the construction is an example of what the Cambridge Grammar of the English Language calls an " adjectival passive " .
CGEL observes that " adjectival passives are passive only in a derivative sense " .
( More on this in a later post , or go read pp. 1436 -1440 of CGEL if you 're curious and impatient .
A clue : you can say " Thomas was very relieved when the car finally pulled onto the highway " , but not " Thomas was very run over when the car finally pulled onto the highway " . )
Third , your other two examples -- " I was doing this " and " there were these things " -- are definitely not passives in any sense at all .
If your writing prof is really telling you that things like this are wrong because they 're in the passive voice , then she 's certainly ignorant and probably incompetent .
Fourth , there 's nothing intrinsically wrong with using the passive voice .
All the best writers do it , some of the time .
See the list of posts at the bottom of the page for some examples -- if you 're eager , go here to find some examples of passives in the writing of E.B.
White , who was the White in Strunk & White , or here , to examine the passive practices of professor Strunk himself ..
Fifth , and least important , the traditional terminology is " passive voice " , not " passive tense " .
The term tense deals with ways of expressing concepts of time , like present and past ; the term voice deals with ways of arranging the arguments of a verb , as in " The ninja explained the concept of passive to the writing teacher " ( which is an example of active voice ) , vs . " The concept of passive was explained to the writing teacher by the ninja " ( which is an example of passive voice ) .
There 's also aspect , which deals with ways of expressing action ( or being ) in respect of its inception , duration , or completion .
Putting voice , tense and aspect together , we can create a little paradigm of some variations on one of your examples .
I do this .
[ active voice , present tense ]
I am doing this .
[ active voice , present tense , progressive aspect ]
I did this .
[ active voice , past tense ]
I was doing this .
[ active voice , past tense , progressive aspect ]
This is done ( by me ) .
[ passive voice , present tense ]
This is being done ( by me ) .
[ passive voice , present tense , progressive aspect ]
This was done ( by me ) .
[ passive voice , past tense ]
This was being done ( by me ) .
[ passive voice , past tense , progressive aspect ]
So your example , the one in bold , was in the active voice .
Speaking of ninjas and writing teachers , the ninja is this cartoon by Nic Bommarito seems to know her grammar :
Of course , we here at Language Log do n't recommend or even condone the murder of English professors , though we do feel that some of them ought to sit in on a linguistics course or two , or maybe read a good student grammar .
And if you want to be able to stand up to them , Elrina , you might invest in such a grammar yourself , and perhaps in a good usage guide while you 're at it .
What 's in those books might even help your writing , but in any case it 'll help you keep your writing teachers from wasting your time .
Following Elrina 's question , the NaNoWriMo forum has three pages of interesting answers .
These make it clear that most people believe that " passive " has something to do with whether or not the subject is an agent , and perhaps also something to do with overall dynamism , vividness or concreteness .
For example , " Corvus " defends the use of passive in this way :
While I do not advocate a sudden embracing of the passive voice , I do advocate a less strident opposition to it .
It 's not always the wrong voice .
For example : " The horrific thought occured to me that I was on the wrong train , headed for Paris instead of Berlin . "
I challenge the reader to reconstruct this idea in active voice and maintain the flavor .
That challenge is hard to meet , since the sentence is already in the active voice .
The issue for Corvus seems to be that the subject of the main clause is " thought " rather than " I " .
In another comment , " Cpt. Nemo " suggests switching Elrina 's problem sentence from
Thomas was relieved when the car finally pulled onto the highway .
to one of
Thomas felt relieved when the car finally pulled onto the highway .
Thomas gave a sigh of relief when the car finally pulled onto the highway .
and " paintbyletters " responds that
The third is definitely the most active , because Thomas is acting .
I , as the reader , sigh in relief right along with him .
OTOH , to tell me that Thomas felt relief or was relieved distances me from Thomas .
I do n't care quite as much , and overuse of passive verbs will have a cumulative effect on your reader 's interest in your characters .
I do n't care at all , myself .
I 've given up , for the moment , on wishing that people would use grammatical terminology in a coherent way , and instead , I 'm asking myself whether any of this writing advice makes any sense .
Specifically , I wonder whether there 's any evidence that a narrative is better if it has a higher proportion of verbs that denote actions , whose subjects are human agents .
Let 's do a quick sanity check , by looking at the openings of a few successful novels , pulled ( literally ) off the shelf at random .
Exercise for the reader : what proportion of the clauses have a verb denoting an action , with an agentive subject ?
Would these novels have been better if that proportion were higher ?
It was August , and it should n't have been raining .
Perhaps rain was too strong a word for the drizzle that blurred the landscape and kept my windshield wipers going .
I was driving south , about halfway between Los Angeles and San Diego .
[ Ross Macdonald , The Far Side of the Dollar ]
The Channel Club lay on a shelf of rock overlooking the sea , toward the southern end of the beach called Malibu .
Above its long brown buildings , terraced gardens climbed like a richly carpeted stairway to the highway .
The grounds were surrounded by a high wire fence topped with three barbed strands and masked with oleanders .
[ Ross Macdonald , The Barbarous Coast ]
The law offices of Wellesley and Sable were over a savings bank on the main street of Santa Teresa .
Their private elevator lifted you from a bare little lobby into an atmosphere of elegant simplicity .
It created the impression that after years of struggle you were rising effortlessly to your natural level , one of the chosen .
[ Ross Macdonald , The Galton Case ] Moran 's first impression of Nolen Tyner :
He looked like a high risk , the kind of guy who falls asleep smoking in bed .
No luggage except for a six - pack of beer on the counter and the Miami Herald folded under his arm .
[ Elmore Leonard , Cat Chaser ]
A friend of Ryan 's said to him one time , " Yeah , but at least you do n't have to take any shit from anybody . "
Ryan said to his friend , " I do n't know , the way things 've been going , maybe it 's about time I started taking some . "
[ Elmore Leonard , Unknown Man # 89 ]
The marriage was n't going well and I decided to leave my husband .
I went to the bank to get cash for the trip .
This was on a Wednesday , a rainy afternoon in March .
The streets were nearly empty and the bank had just a few customers , none of them familiar to me .
[ Anne Tyler , Earthly Possessions ]
He -- for there could be no doubt about his sex , though the fashion of the time did something to disguise it -- was in the act of slicing at the head of a Moor which swung from the rafters .
It was the colour of an old football , and more or less the shape of one , save for the sunken cheeks and a strand or two of coarse , dry hair , like the hair of a cocoanut .
[ Virginia Woolf , Orlando ]
I 'll make my report as if I told a story , for I was taught as a child on my homeworld that Truth is a matter of the imagination .
The soundest fact may fail or prevail in the style of its telling : like that singular organic jewel of our seas , which grows brighter as one woman wears it and , worn by another , dulls and goes to dust .
Facts are no more solid , coherent , round , and real than pearls are .
But both are sensitive .
[ Ursula K. LeGuin , The Left Hand of Darkness ]
Early this morning , 1 January 2021 , three minutes after midnight , the last human being to be born on earth was killed in a pub brawl in a suburb of Buenos Aires , aged twenty - five years , two months and twelve days .
If the first reports are to be believed , Joseph Ricardo died as he had lived .
[ P.D James , The Children of Men ]
My quick count says that out of 39 tensed verbs , 7 ( or about 18 % ) denote actions and have an agentive subject .
Two of the seven are " said " -- hardly the most dynamic action around -- and if we discount those , we 're down to 13 % .
Do you see any places where the text would be improved by substituting some active - voice transitive verbs denoting actions , with human agentive subjects ?
I do n't .
The next time someone tells you to " avoid passive " , -- apparently meaning that you should use verbs denoting actions with human agents as subjects -- why not ask them to define their terms , and to back up their advice with some evidence ?

( CNN ) --
When you first meet 4 - year - old Roberto Salazar , you can't help but notice his unwavering smile and constant laughter .
By all accounts , he 's a very happy boy .
It is only when he rams his head violently into walls or plays a little too roughly with a schoolmate , all the while smiling , that you are reminded that he suffers from an incredibly rare genetic disorder .
Roberto is one of 17 people in the United States with " congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis , " referred to as CIPA by the few people who know about it .
Roberto was born in July 2001 , becoming Luis ' and Juan 's little brother .
As a newborn , his parents thought he was the perfect baby .
" Roberto was wonderful .
He never cried .
He would sleep 23 out of 24 hours a day .
He never cried to eat , never cried that his diaper is itching , " said his mother , Susan Stingley - Salazar .
At 3 months , things abruptly changed .
Roberto refused to eat .
He was rapidly losing weight .
His parents tried desperately to find ways to " force a child to eat that does n't want to eat , " Stingley - Salazar said .
First they tried to feed him with an eyedropper .
Then a feeding tube was attached to his stomach at 8 months .
Other abnormalities quickly surfaced .
Roberto was severely susceptible to heatstroke on hot summer days .
His parents soon noticed he did not sweat .
" You can't carry Roberto because he sucks your heat from your body .
You 're hot , sweaty .
His body can't sweat like yours so he 's just absorbing all of your heat , " Stingley - Salazar said .
His family was shocked when Roberto started teething .
He gnawed on his own tongue , lips and fingers to the point of mutilation .
" If you could imagine when you bite your tongue how bad it hurts .
At one point , you could n't even distinguish that his tongue was his tongue , " Stingley - Salazar said .
Stingley - Salazar , a registered nurse with a degree in molecular biology , took Roberto to see more than 60 physicians in the boy 's first few years .
She researched his symptoms on the Internet every night .
She e-mailed any specialist she could find .
She came up with very few answers until she contacted Dr. Felicia Axelrod of the New York University Dysautonomia Treatment and Evaluation Center .
Axelrod has studied this family of " no - pain " diseases for more than 35 years .
These genetic disorders affect the autonomic nervous system -- which controls blood pressure , heart rate , sweating , the sensory nerve system and the ability to feel pain and temperature .
Stingley - Salazar 's first reaction : " There is somebody out there who actually knows what we 've been going through , you know , the hell we 've been living for the last two - and - a - half years . "
CIPA is the most severe and fatal type of the seven types of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy , or HSAN .
Overheating kills more than half of all children with CIPA before age 3 , Stingley - Salazar said .
According to Axelrod , levels of pain vary .
" For some children it 's a mild degree such as breaking a leg , they 'll get up and walk on the leg .
They feel that something is uncomfortable but they keep on moving , " she said .
" For other children , the pain loss is so severe that they can injure themselves repetitively and actually mutilate themselves because they do n't know when to stop . "
All HSAN disorders are recessive genetic disorders -- both parents have to carry the genetic mutation in order to pass it on to a child .
But there is less than a 1 - in - 4 chance that the child will develop it .
Neither of Roberto's older brothers has the disorder .
A more common HSAN condition is familial dysautonomia , or FD .
There are about 500 cases of FD in the United States , Axelrod said .
The first sign of FD is a child 's inability to suck properly followed by delayed milestones -- these children walk and speak later .
Often , FD patients endure severely dry eyes because they are unable to produce tears .
Also , part of this sensory disorder is difficulty " telling where they are in space , " Axelrod said .
The minor effect is constantly bumping into things .
The major effect is that 80 percent of these kids suffer curvature of the spine because they have no concept of posture .
" The hardest thing growing up with FD is that sometimes your balance can be off .
Also when you get busy , like when your blood pressure drops , I faint .
It 's scary for people who do n't know what to do , " 15 - year - old Perry Goldberger said .
Perry was diagnosed when she was 2 weeks old .
She , too , suffers from common ailments of HSAN -- she gets liquids through a stomach tube ; she can't distinguish between hot and cold ; she does n't feel pain .
Perry has learned to handle her daily medical regimen :
During the day she takes nebulizer treatments for her lungs and seven tube feedings .
At night she must use an oxygen machine to help her breathe and must place a moisture chamber around her eyes while she sleeps .
" This is my daily schedule that I take every single day .
You get used to it after a while , " she said .
Her mother , Laurie Goldberger , said her family takes it one day at a time and is teaching Perry a certain level of independence .
" Now at 15 , she 's gotten very responsible and understands it and she knows she has to take it .
So at school she does her own medicine , " Goldberger said .
Axelrod points to Perry as an example of the huge strides made in HSAN disorders .
" Forty years ago , a child with FD had a 50 percent probability of reaching the age of 5 , " she said .
" Today , a child born with FD would have a 50 percent probability of reaching the age of 40 . "

For those admirers of Elizabeth Hurley who cannot afford the real thing - and that 's most of us - here is a rather cheaper alternative ... the ' fembot ' played by her in Austin Powers 2 : The Spy Who Shagged Me .
The prop has gone on sale on auction website eBay , but the silicon puppet does have a few disadvantages compared with the real thing .
The fembot has a tendency to explode at inopportune moments , and frankly could do with a spot of make - up , but the curves do seem to be in the right places .
The Hurley fembot , aka Vanessa Kensington , was Austin Power 's wife until she exploded into metal pieces , and was revealed as a robot .
Whether Vanessa Kensington was a fembot all along is still up for debate .
It is presumed that Vanessa was captured and killed by Powers ' nemesis , Dr Evil , soon before she and Austin married , but some fans believe she perhaps is still alive .
Bids for the fembot start at £ 1,800 , which probably would n't even get you lunch with the real Liz .
Mario Moreno should still have been behind bars the night he climbed into the passenger seat of a stolen car with two fellow gang members .
He was carrying a rifle , some cartridges and , in his jacket pocket , a bag of marijuana .
“ Let ’s go do this , ” the car ’s driver recalled Moreno saying as they headed into the turf of a rival black gang .
They drove by a liquor store at 89th Street and Central Avenue in South Los Angeles .
Two older black men were standing outside .
Moreno , 18 , aimed his weapon out the driver ’s - side window and fired .
One bullet killed Darrell Dennard , 53 , a grandfather who slept in an alley behind a nearby fish market and got by doing odd jobs .
He had just bought a lottery ticket .
It was about 9 p.m. on Oct. 11 , 2004 .
If not for a chronic shortage of jail beds in Los Angeles County , Dennard ’s killer would have been in jail four more months .
Moreno had been convicted of possessing a sawed - off shotgun — a felony .
A probation officer called him a “ danger to the community , ” and a judge sentenced him to a year in jail , the county maximum .
Six days later he was released into a work program .
Since his arrest , he had served a total of 53 days .
Moreno joined more than 150,000 county inmates who have been released during the last four years after serving fractions of their sentences .
Thousands , like Moreno , committed violent crimes when they would otherwise have been locked up , even with time off for good behavior .
The large - scale releases started in mid-2002 , when Sheriff Lee Baca had to make major budget cuts .
Unwilling to lay off patrol officers , he chose to close jails .
As a result , nearly everyone now sentenced to 90 days or less is let go immediately .
Many others leave after serving no more than 10 % of their time , making Los Angeles County Jail sentences among the weakest in the nation .
A Los Angeles Times investigation of early releases since Baca ’s jail closures began found :
 Nearly 16,000 inmates — more than 10 % of those released early — were rearrested and charged with new crimes while they were supposed to be incarcerated .
 Nearly 2,000 of those rearrested were released early a second time , only to be arrested again while they should have been behind bars .
Hundreds of those people cycled through jail three or more times .
One example of the revolving door : A 55 - year - old woman was released early in 2002 on an assault charge , only to be rearrested three days later on suspicion of another assault .
Over the next three years , she was released early 15 times and rearrested 19 times when she was supposed to be locked up .
 Sixteen men , including Moreno , were charged with murders committed while they should have been in jail .
Nine are awaiting trial ; seven have been convicted in the homicides .
 More than a fourth of those rearrested were charged with violent or life - endangering crimes , including 518 robberies , 215 sex offenses , 641 weapons violations , 635 drunk - driving incidents , 1,443 assaults and 20 kidnappings .
Many of these inmates probably would have committed new offenses even if they had served full sentences .
But the early releases have given career criminals more time on the streets to commit additional crimes , endangering the public .
Juvenal Valencia , 21 , was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon , released early and then cycled in and out of jail twice more after early releases .
Prosecutors have now charged him with first - degree murder in a drive - by shooting that left one man dead and five others wounded .
He has pleaded not guilty .
At the time of the killing , Valencia had two months left to serve for a probation violation .
In recent years , sheriff ’s clerks have routinely disregarded sentences handed down by judges .
In some cases , inmates are freed despite instructions from a judge that they must serve their full sentences .
“ That puts us all in peril , ” said Los Angeles City Atty .
Rocky Delgadillo .
“ I think criminals have learned from this that there is a way to beat the system .
For many , a few days in jail has become just a cost of doing business . ”
Los Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton , who led the Boston and New York police departments before taking over in Los Angeles in late 2002 , said the situation has frustrated officers on the street and made policing harder .
“ It ’s an amazing system .
I ’ve never seen anything like it , ” he said .
“ The police , prosecutors and judges — sometimes even a jury — have made decisions , and you have the ability to arbitrarily undo all of that . ”
In recent interviews , Baca defended his decision to release inmates early as a “ last resort , ” saying he had little choice but to shut down jail facilities when he had to cut millions of dollars from his budget .
At the time , Baca warned that crime would increase if he were n’t given more money .
“ In a public safety fashion , the net will be cut and the floodgate will be open to more crime , ” Baca told county supervisors at a 2002 board meeting to which he had brought a thousand supporters .
Now , he says , the public is paying the consequences .
“ I knew that there are people in our county jails that are so unstable that even if they ’re only in there for a minor crime , they ’re capable of committing a bigger crime , ” he said .
“ You just ca n’t predict who that person is going to be , specifically . ”
A bond measure of up to $ 500 million to fund improvements to — and expansion of — the jail system is being considered for the November ballot .
But even if the extra millions come through , sheriff ’s officials say they wo n’t be enough to fix long - neglected jails .
The sheriff has little control over who comes into his jails .
In recent years , bookings have steadily increased , partly the result of a jump in arrests by Los Angeles police .
And more than a thousand jail beds are regularly taken up by prisoners awaiting transfer to state facilities , a process that takes weeks .
Today , the county has about 19,000 jail beds in use .
Baca says he would need at least 30,000 — and additional deputies — to end early release .
‘ A Truly Innocent Victim ’
A little over a week before Moreno killed him , Dennard ’s mother , Gladys Derrick , visited her son in the alley behind the fish market .
She brought travel - size lotions and shampoos and a basket of “ all kinds of things he did n’t have to cook . ”
He was “ always good company , ” she said .
“ It ’s not very often that you have a truly innocent victim , ” said LAPD Det .
John Skaggs , who investigated the killing .
“ This of course is that case . ”
Half a dozen members of Dennard ’s family were in the Compton courthouse on March 27 to see Moreno sentenced to state prison for voluntary manslaughter , a plea prosecutors said they offered because witnesses would n’t testify .
Dennard ’s sister wore a T - shirt printed with her brother ’s smiling image and the dates marking his life :
9/26/51-10/11/04 .
Moreno , a member of one of the county ’s most notorious gangs , Florencia 13 , smiled at his family when he entered the courtroom .
A girlfriend powdered her nose .
His mother , her hair tied back in two long braids , read a Bible .
Dennard ’s brother , Howard McZeal , addressed the court .
“ I ’d like to know why my brother is n’t here , ” McZeal said , his voice cracking .
“ What did he do to you ? ”
Moreno stared straight ahead .
Until speaking to a Times reporter shortly before the sentencing , Dennard ’s family had no idea that his killer had gotten out of jail with months still to serve .
“ A gang member arrested with a sawed - off shotgun ?
That [ jail time ] was a camping trip to him , a business junket , ” McZeal said later .
“ If that man had still been in jail , Darrell would still be alive . ”
A Crush of Inmates
When beds were full , inmates were housed in hallways , common rooms , the pews of the jail ’s chapel and anywhere floor space was available .
In the summer of 1983 , with the building filled to twice its capacity , hundreds of inmates were given four blankets each and slept under the stars on the roof of Men ’s Central Jail .
By then a class - action lawsuit filed on behalf of inmates by the American Civil Liberties Union was making its way through the court system .
A federal court found the overcrowding to be cruel and unusual punishment and ordered the county to stop overloading its jails .
At the time , more than 22,000 inmates were being housed in space meant for half as many .
County officials , under a federal consent decree , agreed to open new facilities .
In 1988 , the judge allowed the county to institute what was to be a temporary solution to the overcrowding : early release .
The number of early releases ebbed and flowed , but by the late 1990s it had slowed to a trickle .
Then , in mid-2002 , Baca faced two years of budget shortfalls , forcing $ 167 million in cuts .
County supervisors said they had little choice but to rein in spending .
During that time , state and county governments were reeling from losses in tax revenue caused by fallout from the dot - com bust .
Other county departments were also hit hard .
“ We did what we could to maintain ” the sheriff ’s funding , said Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke .
Baca was already dealing with a jail system that had lost 5,000 beds in a decade , mostly from earthquake damage .
In little more than a year , he closed three more jails and shut down parts of four others , reducing the number of inmates by another 5,000 .
The cuts saved more than $ 50 million .
But they also guaranteed a new wave of early releases .
Baca ’s critics point to “ nonessential ” pet projects , like rehabilitation programs in the jail , that could have been cut to keep inmates in jail longer .
“ That ’s nice , but that ’s not our job .
Our job is custody , ” said Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Sgt. Paul Jernigan , who works in Men ’s Central and is one of four candidates running against Baca in the June 6 election .
But the sheriff said these programs amounted to a fraction of the money he needed to save .
With cuts down to the bone , he said he faced laying off deputies or closing the jails .
“ If you were to ask the community , ‘ I ’ll take away five police cars in your neighborhoods or I ’ll do early release , ’ ” they ’ll say , ‘ Do n’t take away the five radio cars .
Now manage your jail the best way you can . ’
So I did , ” he said .
In the last two years , Baca ’s department has benefited from an increase in county revenue from property taxes , fueled by a surging real estate market .
More than half the beds closed since 2002 have been reopened .
The department has the funds , but not the staff , to reopen the remaining 2,500 beds .
And there is still the problem of aging and outdated facilities at a time of growing pressure to reduce violence among inmates and relieve overcrowding that has continued despite the large - scale early releases .
In Men ’s Central , cells designed for three inmates are filled with six .
Last week , U.S. District Judge Dean D. Pregerson described the practice as “ simply not consistent with basic values , ” noting that inmates did not even have the space to stand up and take a step or two .
Pregerson , who oversees the still - open civil rights case on jail conditions , said the situation “ should not be permitted to exist in the future . ”
A Balancing Act
Los Angeles County , with the largest jail system in the nation , has led the way .
In the 3 1/ 2 years before Baca closed jails , about 10,000 inmates were let out prematurely .
In the 3 1/ 2 years that followed , almost 150,000 were released three or more days early .
With fewer beds , the sheriff has also had to loosen standards on who qualifies for early release .
“ By lowering that criteria , you ’re qualifying more hardened criminals , ” said Sheriff ’s Capt .
Bill Bengtson .
Until The Times asked for data , sheriff ’s officials had not tracked how often inmates were rearrested when they would otherwise have been behind bars .
In February , the officials hastily conducted an analysis of rearrests before giving the newspaper data on more than 2 million bookings into the jail since 1999 .
The Sheriff ’s Department analysis , which looked at the seven years of data as a whole , concluded that inmates released early were no more likely to re-offend than those who were not .
But The Times found distinct differences when it compared the years before the jail closures with those after .
As fewer served full terms , rearrests within 90 days of release increased for all inmates .
Those released early after the policy change were more likely to be rearrested within 90 days than inmates who served their full jail time .
The Times analysis also showed that although the number of inmates released early increased 15 - fold after mid-2002 , arrests of people with time left on their sentences rose about 60 - fold , from 266 to 15,775 .
Rearrests for violent and life - threatening crimes soared from 74 before the jail closures to more than 4,000 since .
Among the perpetrators : Hector Aguilar , who left jail Sept. 1 , 2004 , with three months left on his sentence for domestic violence .
Four days later , he opened fire with an AK - 47 assault rifle on a sheriff ’s patrol car , missing two deputies inside .
He pleaded guilty to assault with a deadly weapon and was sentenced to 43 years in state prison .
In deciding which inmates deserve the most time , sheriff ’s officials try to balance overcrowding against the need to keep dangerous criminals locked up .
The inmate pool for early release is limited to about 10 % of the jail population — convicts sentenced by judges to less than a year .
The remaining inmates are awaiting trial or transfer to state prison for longer sentences , or are incarcerated for parole violations under a contract with the state .
Since late 2004 , a small number of beds — now about 75 — has been reserved for inmates sentenced to jail who have been identified by the LAPD as chronic , dangerous offenders .
They do their full time .
Occasionally , inmates arrested for specific crimes in specific areas are also kept longer .
In recent months , for example , sheriff ’s deputies have cracked down on prostitution in parts of South Los Angeles and Compton .
Current guidelines say prostitutes arrested there “ shall serve 100 % of their sentence , and shall NOT be released [ early ] . ”
Guidelines issued by the sheriff spell out which inmates in the 10 % pool qualify for early release :
Those in jail for manslaughter , sex offenses and child abuse , along with violators of gang injunctions , do all of their time .
For nearly all other convictions , inmates serve a fraction of their sentences .
Women , who are housed in separate , less crowded facilities , usually do no more than 25 % .
Men serve no more than 10 % .
If jailers had the room , a typical inmate given a year in jail would spend about 243 days behind bars after discounts for good behavior and work .
As it is now , an inmate eligible for a 10 % release would serve just 24 days .
“ That ’s a disaster , ” said Los Angeles County Dist .
Atty .
Steve Cooley .
“ Obviously , if they are n’t in , they can be out committing crimes . ”
‘ Get Them Out ’
Each day the decision of who goes home early is made in cramped cubicles at the county ’s Inmate Reception Center .
Sheriff ’s clerks work eight - hour shifts , reviewing inmate files to identify those who meet the sheriff ’s criteria for early release .
On a recent morning , Pamela Broom ’s desk was stacked with a dozen or so manila envelopes , filled with paperwork on candidates for early release .
Broom pulled the envelope of Rosa Louise Degraw .
A blond , plump face glared from a booking photo .
The jail ’s computer showed that Degraw was serving a 180 - day jail sentence for battery and vandalism .
With time off for good behavior , she was supposed to serve about four months .
Degraw ’s sentencing documents contained an explicit directive from the judge : “ No early release . ”
Instead , 33 days after she was booked , Degraw was eligible to go .
“ The sheriff says , ‘ It does n’t mean anything .
I ’ve got to get them out of my jails , ’ ” said Broom ’s supervisor , Greg Sivard .
Degraw had landed in jail after repeatedly violating her probation requirements following a conviction for battery and vandalism .
Among her battery victims : her mother .
Broom said she has little time to reflect on whom she is releasing .
“ I ’d be in a mental ward , ” said Broom , who finds anywhere from two to 40 inmates each day to release early .
“ You follow the criteria .
You get paid to do your job , not have opinions . ”
In red ink on the envelope , she marked Degraw free to go .
Two and half hours later , Degraw , 23 , pushed her way through a metal jail door onto Bauchet Street in downtown Los Angeles .
She was angry she ’d served as much time as she had .
Dressed in the same white tank top and blue jeans she had come to jail in , Degraw said she believed she ’d serve only 10 % of her sentence .
Still , she said , the extra time made her want to avoid coming back .
“ The longer you make them stay in there and think about it , the chances are less that they ’ll get out and do something else , ” she said .
Degraw said she planned to reunite with her 4 - year - old son and try again to earn her high school equivalency degree .
For the immediate future , she had other plans : “ I ’m going to drink me a bottle of Southern Comfort today . ”
Freed Without a Review
“ It should be clear to those who are listening that we are going to put them in programs and ankle bracelet monitoring , ” Baca said , appearing on KCET - TV Channel 28 ’s “ Life and Times ” in April 2003 .
“ They ’re not just walking out the door with no obligations . ”
For a few months in 2003 , jailers reviewed criminal histories before approving early release .
Then they abandoned the effort , saying it was too time - consuming .
Since then , inmates have been freed without anyone looking at their full criminal past .
Many had long arrest records .
More than 4,400 released early after the jail cuts had been prosecuted for assaults with deadly weapons or seriously injuring people .
Today , the department has far fewer inmates on electronic monitoring and other types of supervision than it did in 2001 .
Elsewhere , jail officials do more to determine which inmates are likely to endanger public safety .
In Portland , Ore. , the Multnomah County Sheriff ’s Department examines the criminal records of inmates so convicts with violent pasts do more time regardless of their most recent offenses .
After questions from The Times , Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Chief Marc Klugman said the department would consider once again looking at criminal histories and other factors to determine whether an early release was appropriate .
Baca said judges and prosecutors also bear some responsibility .
He said they are well aware that he is releasing inmates early , yet continue to agree to plea bargains that send dangerous offenders to jail instead of prison .
Creative Sentencing
On Sept. 30 , 2002 , Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James R. Brandlin sentenced Jeffery , 36 , to two years in County Jail .
Eight months later , he was back on the street .
Brandlin , who had called Jeffery a “ tremendous risk to public safety , ” demanded answers in a letter to Baca .
The sheriff had his aides look into the case .
Jeffery , Baca wrote back to the judge , had been released properly by sheriff ’s officials struggling to keep the jail population down .
“ While this may not meet with your approval , ” Baca said , “ I sincerely hope that it allays any concerns you have that Mr. Jeffery was incorrectly released . ”
Brandlin declined to comment for this story .
As more and more inmates realized that there was little risk of serving full sentences , fewer accepted deals to serve their time under house arrest or through community service .
And as alternative sentences dwindled , more pressure was put on the jails .
“ You tell a guy now , ‘ Hey , 30 days Caltrans , ’ ” Cooley said .
“ He says ‘ You know what , I do n’t need all that jazz .
Give me my time .’ ”
Cooley said frustrated prosecutors and judges seek creative ways to “ beat the sheriff ’s sentencing system . ”
Here ’s how prosecutors and one judge made sure that a defendant served his time .
In September , sheriff ’s deputies caught Steven Torres strolling through his Compton neighborhood carrying a large glass bong and a small pipe containing drug residue .
He was on probation for previously carrying a concealed weapon .
A search of his home turned up another handgun — a serious violation .
His probation officer wrote that Torres should “ spend a suitable amount of time in local custody ” to show him that “ criminal behavior will not be tolerated . ”
At a November hearing , where Torres pleaded no contest , Superior Court Judge Xenophon F. Lang Jr. told him he would “ serve 90 actual days in the County Jail ” and ordered him to surrender to the jail in January to await sentencing .
In March , at Torres ’ sentencing hearing , Lang smiled at the bulky defendant before him in handcuffs .
The judge reminded Torres of the 90 - day sentence he had proposed earlier .
“ It appears he has done that , ” Lang said with a chuckle , ordering Torres released on probation .
Fatal Consequences
Randy Morones , 33 , had been rousted from a jail bed about 2 a .m .
It was his 11th day in jail on a drug conviction .
He had been sentenced to six months .
In 1999 and again in 2000 , he had been convicted of beating a girlfriend and sent to state prison .
His latest offense marked his seventh stay in County Jail in four years .
Since 1989 , he had been convicted of drunk driving four times .
None of this mattered when Morones again came up for early release .
Because he had served 10 % of his jail time , he was free to go .
Morones left the downtown jail complex about 8:30 a.m .
By evening , he was drinking beer at a friend ’s house .
Then he climbed behind the wheel of his 18 - foot motor home and headed to his parents ’
Pico Rivera home , speeding along 3rd Street .
Witnesses said he did n’t even hit the brakes as he approached the red light at Arizona .
He slammed into Garcia , throwing him more than 130 feet and killing him .
Morones ran from the crash site , but witnesses caught and held him until deputies arrived .
In September 2004 , a jury found Morones guilty of second - degree murder and gross vehicular manslaughter while drunk .
At his sentencing , Morones apologized to Garcia ’s family : “ I wish the Lord took my life instead of an innocent man . ”
He was sentenced to 20 years to life in state prison .
Galdino Garcia wept when he spoke recently of the crash and his memories of his brother .
A Mexican immigrant , Jose played guitar in Latin rock bands .
He spent time riding his motorcycle in the San Gabriel Mountains , telling his family that the rides made him feel like he was “ caressed by God . ”
Galdino Garcia said he blames the justice system as well as Morones .
“ I believe in the law , but that was one of my questions :
Why did they let him out early ? ” Galdino said .
“ They never answered me that question . ”

Now we know the truth .
In an interview with NBC's Brian Williams , Apple CEO Steve Jobs explained why Apple comes up with new iPod models so frequently : " You keep on innovating , you keep on making better stuff , " Jobs said , in response to a question from Williams about why a new iPod might seem outdated as soon as you take it out of the box .
Then Jobs offered a bit of advice to consumers : " If you always want the latest and greatest , then you have to buy a new iPod at least once a year . "
Gee , thanks , Steve .
We always thought it was the dead batteries or battered shell that kept sending us back to the Apple store .

Researchers have linked human activities to rising ocean temperatures in hurricane formation regions , further connecting severe storms to global climate change .
Using 22 different computer models of the climate system , atmospheric scientists from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and 10 other labs say that they have shown that the warming of the tropical Atlantic and Pacific oceans over the last century is directly linked to human activities .
For the period 1906 - 2005 , the researchers found an 84 percent chance that external forcing ( such as human - caused increases in greenhouse gases , ozone and various aerosol particles ) accounts for at least 67 percent of the observed rise in sea surface temperatures ( SSTs ) in the Atlantic and Pacific hurricane formation regions .
In both regions , human - caused increases in greenhouse gases were found to be the main driver of the 20th century warming of SSTs , the scientists say .
"
We ’ve used virtually all the world ’s climate models to study the causes of SST changes in hurricane formation regions , ” says Benjamin Santer of Livermore ’s Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison , and lead author of a paper describing the research .
The use of fossil fuels are said to emit greenhouse gases that cause global climate change .
This research shows a further direct link between human activities , climate change and killer storms .
“ In the real world , we ’re performing an uncontrolled experiment by burning fossil fuels and releasing greenhouse gases , ” Santer says .
“ We do n’t have a convenient parallel Earth with no human influence on climate .
This is why our study relied on computer models for estimates of how the climate of an ‘ undisturbed Earth ’ might have evolved .
The bottom line is that natural processes alone simply cannot explain the observed SST increases in these hurricane breeding grounds .
The best explanation for these changes has to include a large human influence .
” The researchers note that hurricanes are complex phenomena and are influenced by a variety of physical factors such as SST , wind shear , moisture availability and atmospheric stability .
The increasing SSTs in the Atlantic and Pacific hurricane formation regions is n’t the sole cause of hurricane intensity , but is likely to be one of the most important influences on hurricane strength .
“ The models that we ’ve used to understand the causes of SST increases in these hurricane formation regions predict that the oceans are going to get a lot warmer over the 21st century , ” Santer says .
“ That causes some concern .
In a post - Katrina world , we need to do the best job we possibly can to understand the complex influences on hurricane intensity , and how our actions are changing those influences . ”
Tolkien 's Not -So -Secret Vice
In 1931 , Tolkien wrote an essay about the somewhat peculiar hobby of devising private languages .
He called it A Secret Vice .
But in Tolkien 's case , the " vice " can hardly be called secret anymore .
What , really , is going on inside the head of a man who all his life is toying with enormous linguistic constructions , entire languages that have never existed outside his own notes ?
For one thing must be perfectly clear :
He made very much more of these languages than he could ever hope to include in his stories .
True , there are a few Elvish poems and a swarm of exotic names in the annals of Middle - earth , but even so , this is nothing compared to all that Tolkien made .
In Tyalië Tyelelliéva # 6 , Lisa Star informs us that her own list of published words has twelve thousand entries .
We are talking about enormous linguistic constructions .
How did it start ?
How was it done ?
And why ?
Young John Ronald Reuel in the Nevbosh - speaking world
One day quite exactly a hundred years ago , early teenage Tolkien was baffled to hear a couple of other kids communicating in Animalic .
This was a primitive play - language that mainly consisted of English words for animals .
The inventors of Animalic did not attempt to keep it a secret , and young Tolkien soon learnt some of it .
In his essay A Secret Vice ( published in The Monsters and the Critics p. 198-219 ) he gives one example of Animalic :
Dog nightingale woodpecker forty , which translates as " you are an ass " .
( By all means : " ass " here means donkey and nothing else .
In Animalic , forty meant donkey , while donkey , of course , meant forty ... )
Animalic soon became a dead language , but some of the kids continued their linguistic games .
They invented a language called Nevbosh ( this being Nevbosh for " new nonsense " - the nonsense replacing Animalic , evidently ... )
Tolkien was not the originator of this language , but according to himself , he contributed to the vocabulary and helped to standardize the spelling .
" I was a member of the Nevbosh - speaking world , " he proudly recalls .
Nevbosh was mainly a mixture of heavily distorted English , French and Latin words .
It did not represent a real breaking away from English or other normal languages .
More than twenty years after it became a dead language Tolkien was still able to remember at least one connected fragment , that he calls " idiotic " :
Dar fys ma vel gom co palt ' hoc
pys go iskili far maino woc ?
Pro si go fys do roc de
Do cat ym maino bocte
De volt fac soc ma taimful gyróc ! '
The rhymes can actually be preserved in translation : " There was an old man who said ' how / can I possibly carry my cow ? /
For if I was to ask it / to get in my pocket / it would make such a fearful row ! ' " But for Tolkien , simply distorting existing words ( like woc = " cow " ! ) was in the long run not enough .
Already among the Nevbosh kids there emerged something more sophisticated : words that could not be traced to any specific source , but popped up simply because they seemed to fit their meaning - because the combination of sound and sense gave the kids pleasure .
Tolkien mentions a word lint " quick , clever " .
Young John Ronald Reuel never forgot this word :
Forty years later he had Galadriel singing how the years in Middle - earth had passed ve lintë yuldar lissë - miruvóreva , like swift draughts of the sweet mead ...
Time went by , and Nevbosh joined Latin and Gothic on the long list of dead languages .
But Tolkien , still a child , was already devising one of his first wholly private languages : Naffarin .
He mentions one Naffarin sentence to illustrate , but there is no translation : O Naffarínos cutá vu navru cangor luttos ca vúna tiéranar , dana maga tíer ce vru encá vún ' farta once ya merúta vúna maxt ' amámen .
Though Naffarin supposedly incorporated some of the latest stages of Nevbosh , we already sense a movement towards " Elvish " forms .
Naffarin was inspired by Latin and Spanish , but Tolkien was to find two even more powerful inspirations .
Through the Welsh cellar door into the Finnish wine - cellar One thing was important to Tolkien .
Languages should be beautiful .
Their sound should be pleasing .
Tolkien tasted languages , and his taste was finely tuned .
Latin , Spanish and Gothic were pleasing .
Greek was great .
Italian was wonderful .
But French , often hailed as a beautiful language , gave him little pleasure .
But heaven itself was called Welsh .
In his essay " English and Welsh " , Tolkien recalls how he once saw the words Adeiladwyd 1887 ( It was built 1887 ) cut on a stone - slab .
It was a revelation of beauty .
" It pierced my linguistic heart , " he recalls .
It turned out that Welsh was full of such wonderful words .
Tolkien found it difficult to communicate to others what really was so great about them , but in his essay he makes an honest attempt : " Most English - speaking people ... will admit that cellar door is ' beautiful ' , especially if dissociated from its sense ( and from its spelling ) .
More beautiful than , say , sky , and far more beautiful than beautiful .
Well then , in Welsh for me cellar doors are extraordinarily frequent , and moving to the higher dimension , the words in which there is pleasure in the contemplation of the association of form and sense are abundant . "
He then lists concrete examples like Welsh wybren being " more pleasing " than English sky .
- MC p. 190-193 .
But there were more pleasures in store for young Tolkien .
One day he found ... a
Finnish grammar !!!
He soon found himself in phonaesthetic ecstasy .
" It was like discovering a complete wine - cellar filled with bottles of an amazing wine of a kind and flavour never tasted before .
It quite intoxicated me " ( Letters : 214 ) .
High on Finnish he scrapped his latest project ( " make your own Germanic language " ) , for now he had found more powerful inspirations .
Many years later , he stated that the Elvish tongues were " intended ( a ) to be definitely of a European kind in style and structure ( not in detail ) ; and ( b ) to be specially pleasant .
The former is not difficult to achieve , but the latter is more difficult , since individuals ' personal predilections , especially in the phonetic structure of languages , varies [ sic ] widely ...
I have therefore pleased myself " ( Letters : 175-176 ) .
This in effect meant that from the point he discovered Welsh and Finnish , they were the main influences on his own linguistic constructions .
Of course , he was right in observing that individual taste varies widely .
The Welsh language that he loved so much and modeled Sindarin on , was once described as " a mass of grunts and gargling sounds " by a Norwegian radio reporter .
Still , many people seem to agree that the Elvish tongues are generally euphonious .
Tolkien registrered positive feedback : " The names of persons and places in this story were mainly composed on patterns deliberately modelled on those of Welsh ( closely similar but not identical ) .
This element in the tale has given perhaps more pleasure to more readers than anything else in it " ( MC:197 ) .
But we are leaping ahead of things ; let us return to the very beginning .
While World War I was still raging , Tolkien 's linguistic constructions definitely became Elvish languages .
On March 2nd , 1916 , 24 - year - old Tolkien wrote to his beloved Edith telling her that he had been working on his " nonsense fairy language - to its improvement .
I often long to work at it and do n't let myself ' cause though I love it so it does seem such a mad hobby ! "
Mad or not , he was to give in to his longing and keep working on this hobby throughout his life .
- Letters : 8 . Exactly at this point , in 1916 , while Tolkien was in hospital having survived the Battle of Somme , the very first parts of his " mythology for England " were written - fragments of what would one day become the Silmarillion .
At the same time , or rather a little before , he wrote his first Elvish word - lists .
One thing triggered the other : " The making of language and mythology are related functions , " he observed in A Secret Vice .
" Your language construction will breed a mythology " ( MC:210-211 ) .
Or again in a letter written many years later , shortly after the publication of LotR : " The invention of languages is the foundation .
The ' stories ' were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse .
To me a name comes first and the story follows ... [ LotR ] is to me ... largely an essay in ' linguistic aesthetic ' , as I sometimes say to people who ask me ' what is it all about ? ' " ( Letters:219-220 )
Few people took this explanation seriously .
" Nobody believes me when I say that my long book is an attempt to create a world in which a form of language agreeable to my personal aesthetic might seem real , " Tolkien complained .
" But it is true . " - Letters :264 .
From the very beginning , there were two main languages in his mythology : one that sounded much like Finnish , and one that was similar to Welsh .
Unlike their inspirations , they were related and were derived from a common primitive language .
The Finnish - like language was called " Qenya " right from the start ; a small spelling reform was all that stood between it and its final name .
The other language was originally called Golgodrin or " Gnomish " , it was i-Lam na-Ngoldathon or " the tongue of the Gnomes " .
( Its later form , so heavily revised that it was not really the " same " language , was long called Noldorin ; only as Tolkien was completing LotR did he realize that its real name was Sindarin .
But see below . )
The first Gnomish lexicon was published a few years ago and turns out to be very comprehensive , probably the most complete " dictionary " Tolkien ever made for any Elvish language .
The " Qenya " word - list was finally published in 1998 and turns out to be another very comprehensive document , as can be seen from the indices presented on this web - page ( whether by English glosses or Qenya words ) .
The years passed by and the stories of the Silmarillion evolved , but it seems that the relevance of the original dictionaries soon dwindled : Frequent revisions inevitably rendered them obsolete .
In the second half of the thirties , however , Tolkien made a list of some seven hundred Primitive Elvish " stems " and some of their derivatives in later languages .
It was apparently this list , the so - called Etymologies , he was referring to when he started to write The Lord of the Rings ( he added to the list some words and names from this work , e.g. mith " grey " and rhandir " pilgrim " , that together give Mithrandir ) .
The Etymologies was published in its entirety by Christopher Tolkien in The Lost Road p. 347-400 .
A fairly typical entry goes like this : MBUD - project .
* mbundu : Q mundo snout , nose , cape ; N bund , bunn .
Cf. * andambundâ long - snouted , Q andamunda elephant , N andabon , annabon .
Here we have several archaic forms ( duly asterisked as " unattested " ) plus the descendants of these forms is Q ( Quenya ) and N ( " Noldorin " , read : Sindarin ) .
This brings us over to the technique used by Tolkien in devising his linguistic creations .
How was it done ?
Tolkien 's technique Christopher Tolkien describes his father 's strategy as a language - maker in one formidable sentence : " He did not , after all , ' invent ' new words and names arbitrarily : in principle , he devised from within the historical structure , proceeding from the ' bases ' or primitive stems , adding suffix or prefix or forming compounds , deciding ( or , as he would have said , ' finding out ' ) when the word came into the language , following it through the regular changes in form that it would thus have undergone , and observing the possibilities of formal or semantic influence from other words in the course of its history . "
The result : " Such a word would then exist for him , and he would know it . "
( LR:342 ) As an example of this process we may use the Elvish numerals .
Consider the primitive stems for the words for the numbers 1 - 10 , plus words derived from these stems as they appear in Quenya and Sindarin : 1 : MINI : Q minë , S min
2 : AT ( AT ) : Q atta , S tad
3 : NEL( ED ) : Q neldë , S neledh
4 : KÁNAT : Q canta , S canad
5 : LEPEN : Q lempë , S leben
6 : ÉNEK : Q enquë , S eneg
7 : OTOS / OTOK : Q otso , S odog
8 : TOL - OTH /OT : Q tolto , S toloth
9 : NÉTER : Q nertë , S neder
10 : KAYAN / KAYAR : Q cainen , S caer
( There were also stems for 11 and 12 , since the Elves apparently used a duodecimal system of counting almost from the moment they came into being , but this is enough for our purpose . )
One can observe how Tolkien changed the original stems according to fixed rules and calculated their forms in later Elvish tongues .
For instance , one rule is that in Sindarin unvoiced p , t , k become voiced b , d , g when they follow a vowel :
Thus we get leben from the stem LEPEN , eneg from ÉNEK and neder from NÉTER .
In Quenya , the rule is that the unvoiced plosives are usually unchanged , so in High - elven we have the forms lempë ( from the stem LEPEN - via * lepne and * lenpe ? ) , enquë ( i.e. enkwe ) and nertë .
On the other hand , Quenya has a rule that short final i became e at the end of words , so we have minë from MINI .
Sindarin drops the vowel to produce min .
These and other rules for sound - change were so designed that the resulting languages had the kind of music Tolkien wanted : one approaching " Finnish " phonology , while the other came to sound much like Welsh .
Christopher Tolkien notes how his father took into consideration " the possibilities of formal or semantic influence from other words in the course of its history " .
The numerals provide us with an example of that , too .
According to the Etymologies , the Sindarin word for " three " was originally neledh as in the list above .
But later it became neled because it was " influenced " by canad " four " .
( One imagines the Elf counting min , tad , neledh , canad ; one day he says neled , canad instead ! )
But no matter how much Tolkien was toying with sound - changes and did not just invent new words and names arbitrarily , the words would still have to come from somewhere .
Were they , after all , arbitrary anyway ?
Often not .
When Tolkien was interviewed by the Daily Telegraph in 1968 and got to read a preliminary version of the interview before it was printed , he was horrified to discover that he had said this : " When you invent a language , you more or less catch it out of the air .
You say boo - hoo and that means something . "
This was not at all what he really meant ; he was n't sure that he had said this at all .
He carefully explained that he made words based on personal predilections , his guide being what he thought was phonetically fitting ( Letters : 375 ) .
It may be discussed how " personal " these associations were .
Many would probably agree that quite a few Elvish words in a strange way seem to fit their meaning : elen " star " , menel " sky " , vanya " beautiful " , wen or wend ë " maiden " , lótë " flower " , masta " bread " .
( Of course one may disagree , too : The present writer thinks MOR , the well - known stem for " black " , sounds brown instead - and how could Tolkien think that carnë means " red " ?
To me , the word sounds green ! )
Tolkien has explained the basis of some of his predilections : " The element ( n ) dor ' land ' , probably owes something to say such names as Labrador ( a name that might as far as style and structure goes be Sindarin ) " ( Letters : 383 - 4 ) .
He also tells us how GON ( O ) , GOND ( O ) got to be the Elvish root for " rock , stone " ( as in Gondor " stone - land " , Gondolin " Stone - song " ) :
When he was eight years old , Tolkien read a book stating that nothing was known of the language of the pre-Celtic and pre-Roman tribes , except possibly ond " stone " .
Young John Ronald Reuel thought this word " fitted the meaning " , so he remembered it and used it in his home - made languages many years later : Sindarin gond or gonn , Quenya ondo .
( Letters :410 .
The book that provided Tolkien with the word ond was finally identified in Vinyar Tengwar # 30 : Celtic Britain by Professor John Rhys , that according to Carl F. Hostetter and Patrick Wynne " consists of over 300 densely - set pages and eschews neither etymological discussion , untranslated Latin passages , nor untransliterated Greek words " .
This was Tolkien 's preferred reading at the age of eight . )
Many " Elvish " words turn out to be picked from a wide variety of sources : Pé " mouth " is Hebrew , lá " no , not " is Arabic , nér " man " from the reconstructed Indo - European language , ken- " see " is similar to Chinese kan , and roch " horse " is reminiscent of the Hebrew verb râkháv " ride " .
The stem ÑGAR ( A ) M " wolf " yields ( besides Quenya narmo and Sindarin garaf ) the Doriathrin word garm , Garm being one of the names of the monstrous Fenris - wolf haunting Norse mythology .
Not just Old Norse , but also modern Scandinavian languages seem to be represented : Quenya varya " protect " is suspiciously similar to Norwegian verge , verje ; " arrow " is pil in Scandinavian and pilin in Quenya , and while Quenya mat-/ Sindarin medi means " eat " , Norwegian / Swedish mat , Danish mad means " food " !
Given the fact that one of the prime influences on Tolkien 's languages was Finnish , we might also wonder if Quendi as a name of the Elves has something to do with kvener , an old Scandinavian name of the Finns .
If there is any internal factor showing that Tolkien 's languages are fictious , it must be the fact that some " plagiarism " can be detected in the vocabulary .
But Tolkien willingly admitted that he did not try do avoid the influence of real - world languages .
After all , he made languages for his own pleasure , not to fool others and make them think that they were " real " .
When devising the few fragments of non-Elvish languages , such as Sauron 's Black Speech and also the Adûnaic tongue ( elaborated in structure but not in vocabulary ) , Tolkien was probably less reluctant to simply make words arbitrarily .
Or so he thought .
The Black Speech word nazg " ring " ( as in Nazgûl , Ringwraith ) seems to be an unconscious borrowing from Gaelic nasc of the same meaning ( Letters p. 385 ) .
For a change the Black Speech was constructed to be as ugly as it possibly could be , and Tolkien did not like Gaelic ( yet another example of his fine - tuned linguistic taste - except for native speakers , how many people are able to tell Gaelic and Welsh apart ? )
Tolkien insisted that " all the names in the book , and the languages , are of course constructed , and not at random " ( Letters : 219 ) .
Yet there are a few " random " names .
A note reproduced in The War of the Jewels p. 318 suggests that Tolkien did not know what the names Amloth and Ecthelion meant when he first used them , but since they " are well - sounding and have been in print " , he took the time to find out what they meant .
But the name Eöl proved too tough : " It is n't really absolutely necessary that names should be significant " !
( The War of the Jewels p. 320 . )
The questionable question of stability However , Tolkien 's languages changed in other ways than just the simulated changes within the imagined history .
In The Monsters and the Critics p. 218- 19 , Tolkien observes that " if you construct your art - language on chosen principles " , you can write poetry in that language - " in so far as you fix it , and courageously abide by your own rules , resisting the temptation of the supreme despot to alter them " .
Tolkien did not courageously abide by his own rules .
Tolkien did not resist the temptation of the supreme despot .
He never got his languages really " finished " .
The one thing that finally ensured total stability was his demise in 1973 .
In Sauron Defeated p. 240 , Tolkien 's character Lowdham speaks for Tolkien himself : " In making up a language you are free : too free .
It is difficult to fit meaning to any given sound - pattern , and even more difficult to fit a sound - pattern to any given meaning .
I say fit .
I do n't mean that you can't assign forms or meanings arbitrarily , as you will .
Say , you want a word for sky .
Well , call it jibberjabber , or anything else that comes into your head without the exercise of any linguistic taste or art .
But that 's code - making , not language - building .
It is quite another matter to find a relationship , sound plus sense , that satisfies , that is when made durable .
When you 're just inventing , the pleasure or fun is in the moment of invention ; but as you are the master your whim is law , and you may want to have the fun all over again , fresh .
You 're liable to be for ever niggling , altering , refining , wavering , according to your linguistic mood and to your changes of taste . "
This is precisely what Tolkien did himself .
Throughout his life he kept revising , revising , revising .
In the words of his son , " The linguistic histories were ... invented by an inventor , who was free to change these histories as he was free to change the story of the world in which they took place , and he did so abundantly ...
Moreover , the alterations in the history were not confined to features of ' interior ' linguistic development : the ' exterior ' conception of the languages and their relations underwent change , even profound change " ( LR:341-342 ) .
Sindarin is a good example of changed ideas about the outer history of the languages .
The scenario set out in the appendices to LotR is that this is the language of the Sindar , the Grey - elves - the Elves that came to Beleriand from Cuiviénen , but did not go over the sea to Valinor .
But in Tolkien 's pre-LotR notes , Sindarin is called Noldorin , and before that Gnomish , for this was the language of the Noldor or " Gnomes " , the " Wise Elves " .
It was developed in Valinor , while Quenya in the former scenario was the language of the Lindar , the first of the three clans of the Eldar ( to complicate matters even further , the Lindar were later renamed and became the Vanyar , while Lindar became a name of the third clan , the Teleri ...)
But then Tolkien must have realized that the Elves , immortal and all , would hardly develop radically different languages when they lived side by side in Valinor .
So according to the revised scenario , both the Vanyar and the Noldor spoke Quenya with just minor dialectal differences , while the " Noldorin " language that Tolkien had already made was simply re-christened Sindarin , transferred from Valinor to Middle - earth and relocated to the mouths of the Grey - elves there .
It was , of course , far more plausible that they had developed a language very different from Quenya , having been separated from their kin in Valinor for thousands of years .
Christopher Tolkien comments , " So far - reaching was this reformation that the pre-existent linguistic structures themselves were moved into new historical relations and given new names " ( LR:346 ) .
But also the vocabulary , the phonology and the grammar of the languages were repeatedly revised .
Consider these lines from an early " Qenya " poem , published in MC:213 - 14 :
Man kiluva lómi sangane ,
telume lungane
tollalinta ruste ,
vea qalume ,
mandu yáme ,
aira móre ala tinwi
lante no lanta -mindon ?
" Who shall see the clouds gather , the heavens bending upon crumbling hills , the sea heaving , the abyss yawning , the old darkness beyond the stars falling upon fallen towers ? "
This was written in 1931 .
Much later , probably in the sixties or even the ( necessarily ) early seventies , Tolkien re-wrote this poem .
He literally translated it from early " Qenya " into mature " Quenya " , Quenya as the language had become after thirty years of revisions .
Now these lines go like this ( MC:222 ) , though they mean the same as ever : Man kenuva lumbor ahosta
Menel akúna
ruxal ' ambonnar ,
ëar amortala ,
undume hákala ,
enwina lúme elenillor pella
talta - taltala atalantië mindonnar ?
As we see , the only word that is the same in both texts is man " who " ; there is also the future - tense ending - uva in kiluva > kenuva " shall see " .
It is an open question whether an Elf speaking the " Qenya " of the twenties and the early thirties would have been able to follow a conversation in mature Quenya .
Not just words , but even grammatical endings were subject to revision .
In the Etymologies , there are quite a few examples of " Qenya " having a genitive in -n , e.g . Ar Manwen " Manwë's Day " ( LR:368 ) .
But in the published LotR , -n has become the dative ending , while the genitive now ends in - o .
Does the ending -o sound more " genitival " than -n does ?
One day , Tolkien must have decided just that .
Some words had their meaning totally reversed .
We have learnt that the Avari are the Elves that refused to leave Cuiviénen and go to Valinor .
But the Etymologies shows that Tolkien originally intended Avari as the name of the Elves that did go to Valinor !
The name Fëanor existed at a very early stage , but it did not always mean " Spirit of Fire " , as it is translated in the Silmarillion .
In the Etymologies it is interpreted as " Radiant Sun " , from earlier * Phay - anâro ( LR:381 ) .
Before that , in the earliest word - lists , it meant " goblet - smith " ( The Book of Lost Tales I , p. 253 ) .
Even when something had appeared in print , Tolkien could not always resist the temptation to keep tampering .
In the first edition of LotR , Frodo 's greeting to Gildor was elen síla lúmenn ' omentielmo .
Later Tolkien decided that the last word should have been omentielvo instead , and this form was used in later editions .
( One of the pioneers in the study of Elvish , Dick Plotz , was shocked to see the new form .
He thought the American publishers , Ballantine , had made a mistake and prevailed upon them to correct it .
In the next edition the publishers - necessarily incompentent in these matters - introduced the form omentilmo , that means nothing at all : Even honest efforts can have sad consequences ! )
Nonetheless : the greatest changes and revisions undoubtedly happened before the mid-thirties .
Concerning the original " Gnomish " language of 1915 or thereabouts , old Tolkien considered it merely a " language that ultimately became that of the type called Sindarin " , and his earliest " Qenya " he now held to be " very primitive " ( The Peoples of Middle - earth p. 379 ) .
But with the appearance of the Etymologies in the mid-thirties , the near - mature form of Q( u ) enya and " Noldorin " = Sindarin came into place , and the remaining forty years of Tolkien 's life were spent niggling over details .
Students , imitators , satirists and writers
How , then , do Tolkien 's languages fare today , when a quarter of a century has passed since their maker went to the halls of Mandos ?
Some of us have embarked on the study of Elvish , perhaps with somewhat the same attitude as people enjoying a well - made crossword puzzle :
The very fact that no real Elvish grammars written by Tolkien have been published makes it a fascinating challenge to " break the code " .
Or it may be pure romanticism , a special form of literary immersion :
By studying the Eldarin languages , you try to get closer to - indeed into the heads of - the immortal Elves , fair and wise , the Firstborn of Eru Ilúvatar , teachers of mankind in its youth .
Or , less romantically , you want to study the constructions of a talented linguist and the creative process of a genius engaged in his work of love .
And many simply enjoy the Elvish languages as one might enjoy music , as elaborate and ( according to the taste of many ) gloriously successful experiments in euphony .
Whatever the motive of the student , the study is undoubtedly instructive :
To describe Tolkien 's languages properly , one has to get acquainted with much linguistic terminology .
( The present writer would hardly have been intimately familiar with such terms and concepts as allative , ablative , locative , svarabhakti , assimilation , lenition and many more if I had not needed them in my study of Elvish .
Once I impressed one of my lecturers with my knowledge of Welsh lenition patterns .
How could she know that my examples were actually based on Sindarin ? )
It has also been suggested that some of Tolkien 's insights as a linguist are buried in his languages , waiting to be unearthed .
Modern Language Association International Bibliography deemed that the study of Elvish was sufficiently serious for them to register Vinyar Tengwar , the news letter of the Elvish Linguistic Fellowship , on their index .
Furthermore , it can easily be demonstrated that the nomenclature of The Lord of the Rings has inspired other fantasy writers - in this genre , names often have a distinctly Celtic or Welsh style .
We can even find direct borrowings of morphemes .
Reading such examples as Eriador , Gondor , Mordor etc. some have evidently gathered that the element - dor means " land " , and in fantasy novels , you often encounter quite a few countries having names in - dor.
Cf. for instance Alan Gardner 's golden land of Elidor .
There exists a Norwegian fantasy comic , Ridderne av Dor or " The Knights of Dor " , that satirizes this phenomenon : countries have names like Kondor , Matador and Glassdor !
Parodies indeed appeared already when Tolkien was alive ; just consider this , ahem , version of A Elbereth Gilthoniel from Bored of the Rings .
Prominent scholars of Elvish , including Arden R. Smith and Anthony Appleyard , have analyzed this text just as seriously as it does not deserve .
More serious attempts to write Elvish texts - mostly in verse - have also been published over the years .
By now it would certainly be possible to put together a small anthology of such compositions .
Hence , a small body of Elvish literature does exist today .
Of course , there is no way of knowing what Tolkien would have thought of such newly written texts .
It can hardly be doubted that if he ever returns from the dead , he will soon be busy with a red pencil .
But as Tolkien 's papers are being published and our knowledge of Quenya and Sindarin becomes more complete - the gaps are still enormous - it might become possible to write long texts in Elvish .
In her journal Tyalië Tyelelliéva , Lisa Star has boldly declared that " the ultimate goal is the revival of the Elvish languages for speaking , writing and art " .
Realistic or not , Tolkien does deserve it : A lifetime of work is left on the long road from Nevbosh to mature Quenya and Sindarin .
It would be the final monument to Tolkien 's efforts if his beloved languages could be brought to life - and indeed it would be the only fitting monument to a man who had to invent a whole world just to have a place where people could greet one another with the words Elen síla lúmenn ' omentielvo .

IS the dot - com bubble reinflating ?
Last week , a relatively obscure Wall Street analyst named Safa Rashtchy , from Piper Jaffray , became an overnight sensation among the Internet faithful .
He predicted that Google 's stock price , which has climbed more than 350 percent since its initial public offering in 2004 , and was $ 422.52 at the time , would hit $ 600 a share by the end of 2006 .
Mr. Rashtchy 's bold forecast recalls memories of the time in 1998 that Henry Blodget , then a young , unknown analyst at CIBC Oppenheimer , predicted that Amazon.com would hit $ 400 a share .
At the time , Amazon stock traded at $ 242.75 a share ; after Mr. Blodget 's prognostication , the stock jumped to more than $ 600 .
Of course , the story did not end well for Mr. Blodget : Amazon 's stock eventually fell back to earth ( today , it is trading at around $ 288 , after accounting for splits ) and Mr. Blodget himself , who had been hired away by Merrill Lynch with a seven - figure salary after his seemingly prescient call , was barred from working in the securities industry when it emerged that he had touted other companies that were also clients of the firm .
No one is suggesting that Mr. Rashtchy is involved in any chicanery , but his prophecy does raise the question of whether analysts and investors have once again become irrationally gaga over the Internet , and Google in particular .
Note to this online book :
On April 29 , 2002 , I reacquired the publishing rights to my book ( from Prentice Hall ) , and have decided to publish it online , where it is now freely available for anyone to read ( and print - provided that the printed copy is only for your personal use ) .
I have personally moved on to the Java programming language , JavaScript , HTML5 , etc .
This book is showing its age , but for anyone who still programs in C , the techniques described in this book -- especially the class methodology in Chapter 4 -- are still an incredible ' little gem ' worth knowing about .

For years researchers have been trying to understand how a few HIV - infected patients naturally defeat a virus that otherwise overwhelms the immune system .
Last year , a research team at the University of Rochester Medical Center confirmed that such patients , called long - term non-progressors , maintain higher than normal levels of the enzyme called APOBEC - 3G ( A3G ) in their white blood cells , which function to stave off infections .
Now , the same group has teamed up with a structural biologist to provide the first look at the A3G structure .
Such information represents an early step toward the design of a new class of drugs that could afford to all the same natural protection enjoyed by few , according to a study published today in The Journal of Biological Chemistry .
Researchers believe that A3G works by mutating or " editing " the HIV genetic code every time the virus copies itself .
Editing introduces errors until the virus can no longer reproduce .
At the same time , HIV has also evolved to counter A3G with its own defense protein , the viral infectivity factor ( Vif ) , which holds firmly to A3G and tricks the white blood cell into destroying it .
The results of the current study suggest how the physical form of A3G leads to its role in the immune system , and what parts of it may need to be protected so that it can continue to protect the body .
" Keeping A3G in action represents a new way to attack HIV , " said Joseph E. Wedekind , Ph.D. , associate professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of Rochester Medical Center .
Wedekind , along with Harold C. Smith , Ph.D. , professor in the same department , led the study .
" This first , rough glimpse of A3 G 's physical structure gives us a map to follow in the search for a new class of AIDS treatments , " Wedekind said .
Study Details
For two decades , Smith and his team have worked to determine how " editing enzymes " like A3G make necessary changes to human genetic material .
As the human immune system evolved , it recognized the ability of these enzymes to cause rapid genetic change and unleashed them on viral DNA .
Last September , Smith 's laboratory published work in the Journal of Virology that found higher levels of A3G closely correspond to lower HIV viral levels .
After confirming that the A3G plays a key role in the body 's fight with AIDS , Smith sought out Wedekind for a collaboration to determine its structure .
Wedekind is an expert in structural biology , the branch of molecular biology concerned with the study of the molecular shape and properties of proteins and nucleic acids , the molecules that make up the body 's structures and carry out its life functions .
Improved understanding of both protein and nucleic acid architecture has revolutionized medicine in recent years and has contributed to the design of current leading AIDS drugs .
In seeking to determine the structure of A3G , however , the team was unable to use standard methods to start .
For instance , X - ray crystallography , Wedekind 's area of expertise since 1989 , involves aiming a high - energy X - ray beam at a sample of protein or nucleic acid that has been crystallized to form a repeating lattice of the molecule .
The beams reflect off the atoms within a crystal , a camera records the reflected pattern and the data are reconstructed into a 3 - D electron map by computers .
The technique gives high - resolution images of the positions of atoms within a molecule , but only if researchers can first crystallize the molecule of interest .
The team is making progress on crystallizing A3G , but wanted complementary , structural information in the meantime .
To achieve immediate results , the researchers elicited the help of Richard Gillilan , Ph.D. , staff scientist at the Cornell High - Energy Synchrotron Source ( CHESS ) in Ithaca , N.Y. , and second author on the JBC manuscript .
Gillian has expertise in an imaging method called small - angle X - ray scattering ( SAXS ) , which does not require the sample analyzed to be crystalline .
While less detailed than crystallography , SAXS provides the general shape of a molecule , the spatial relationship of its parts to one another and hints about the function of each part .
Implications of Shape
Within infected human cells , viral DNA chains must temporarily unzip their two attached chains into single strands to be read and copied , and they must be copied if the virus is to infect more cells .
Past work had established that A3G edits single strands of HIV DNA exposed while the virus copies itself .
The newly determined structure of A3G suggests how it is able to crawl down HIV DNA chains , introducing mistakes wherever the chains are unzipped and skipping over zipped - up , double stranded regions .
Researchers now believe A3G is capable of this because its structure is surprisingly different from other enzymes in its class .
The study also confirmed that A3G has two forms -- one that actively disrupts viral reproduction by editing as a free protein , and another in which the enzyme is inactive due to the presence of mRNA .
The new SAXS results show what both forms look like , and suggest new ways in which HIV or the cell itself may turn off A3G .
HIV , along with deploying Vif , may also create a surplus of molecules that force A3G into its inactive form , researchers said .
The theory is that HIV infection disrupts the normal process of making proteins , creating a surplus of free messenger RNAs that force A3G to become inactive .
Messenger RNAs , copies of DNA that serve as a templates for the building of proteins , thus , may be natural regulators of whether A3G remains active or not .
Preventing this mRNA interaction with A3G may represent yet another new avenue of attack on HIV .
" We are the first group to be able to say 'here are the parts of the molecule that need to be protected to keep A3G active in its age - old , ongoing war against viruses " Smith said .
" We believe this work will lead to the development of a new treatments that enable patients to better harness their own natural defense mechanisms . "

Turn off the options , and turn up the intimacy .
I recently spent three days working with what is possibly the most advanced recording console in the world , and I have to report that it was a horribly unmusical experience .
The console , which has more than 10,000 controls on its surface and a computer inside , was designed in such a way that music - making tasks once requiring a single physical switch now require a several - step mental negotiation .
My engineer kept saying " Wait a minute " and then had to duck out of the musical conversation we were having so he could go into secretarial mode to execute complex computer - like operations .
It 's as though a new layer of bureaucracy has interposed itself between me and the music we want to make .
After days of tooth - gnashing frustration , I had to admit that something has gone wrong with the design of technology - and I was paying $ 2,000 a day in studio fees to discover it .
Years ago I realized that the recording studio was becoming a musical instrument .
I even lectured about it , proclaiming that " by turning sound into malleable material , studios invite you to construct new worlds of sounds as painters construct worlds of form and color . "
I was thrilled at how people were using studios to make music that otherwise simply could not exist .
Studios opened up possibilities .
But now I 'm struck by the insidious , computer - driven tendency to take things out of the domain of muscular activity and put them into the domain of mental activity .
This transfer is not paying off .
Sure , muscles are unreliable , but they represent several million years of accumulated finesse .
Musicians enjoy drawing on that finesse ( and audiences respond to its exercise ) , so when muscular activity is rendered useless , the creative process is frustrated .
No wonder artists who can afford the best of anything keep buying " retro " electronics and instruments , and revert to retro media .
The trouble begins with a design philosophy that equates " more options " with " greater freedom . "
Designers struggle endlessly with a problem that is almost nonexistent for users : " How do we pack the maximum number of options into the minimum space and price ? "
In my experience , the instruments and tools that endure ( because they are loved by their users ) have limited options .
Software options proliferate extremely easily , too easily in fact , because too many options create tools that can't ever be used intuitively .
Intuitive actions confine the detail work to a dedicated part of the brain , leaving the rest of one 's mind free to respond with attention and sensitivity to the changing texture of the moment .
With tools , we crave intimacy .
This appetite for emotional resonance explains why users - when given a choice - prefer deep rapport over endless options .
You can't have a relationship with a device whose limits are unknown to you , because without limits it keeps becoming something else .
Indeed , familiarity breeds content .
When you use familiar tools , you draw upon a long cultural conversation - a whole shared history of usage - as your backdrop , as the canvas to juxtapose your work .
The deeper and more widely shared the conversation , the more subtle its inflections can be .
This is the revenge of traditional media .
Even the " weaknesses " or the limits of these tools become part of the vocabulary of culture .
I 'm thinking of such stuff as Marshall guitar amps and black - and - white film - what was once thought most undesirable about these tools became their cherished trademark .
The Marshall guitar amplifier does n't just get louder when you turn it up .
It distorts the sound to produce a whole range of new harmonics , effectively turning a plucked string instrument into a bowed one .
A responsible designer might try to overcome this limitation - probably the engineers at Marshall tried , too .
But that sound became the sound of , among others , Jimi Hendrix .
That sound is called " electric guitar . "
Or think of grainy black - and - white film , or jittery Super 8 , or scratches on vinyl .
These limitations tell you something about the context of the work , where it sits in time , and by invoking that world they deepen the resonances of the work itself .
Since so much of our experience is mediated in some way or another , we have deep sensitivities to the signatures of different media .
Artists play with these sensitivities , digesting the new and shifting the old .
In the end , the characteristic forms of a tool 's or medium 's distortion , of its weakness and limitations , become sources of emotional meaning and intimacy .
Although designers continue to dream of " transparency " - technologies that just do their job without making their presence felt - both creators and audiences actually like technologies with " personality . "
A personality is something with which you can have a relationship .
Which is why people return to pencils , violins , and the same three guitar chords .
Quality seems to be widely misunderstood .
People often talk about quality being a key variable that a project team can choose to alter to reshape their project — along with other variables such as cost , scope and time .
I think that view is flawed .
Meanwhile Mishkin Berteig is not unusual when he says “ I have come to believe that quality is not negotiable ” — meaning that although it ’s possible to negotiate over it , it ’s fundamentally wrong to do so .
I think that view is flawed , too .
From my position quality can rarely vary in the same way as other key project variables , is rarely changed directly , and often it is right to allow it to drop below 100 % .
I want to spend some time here explaining why .
Before I launch into this , allow me to say that although this is inspired by an issue on which I differ with Mishkin , I do have great respect for him .
In fact , it ’s arguable that I ’m only writing this because I have such respect for him — because it ’s so surprising to see him write something that seems to be so mistaken .
The sections ahead are :
Quality is about much more than bugs
Quality is rarely addressed at the outset
Quality is less flexible than scope , time or money
Quality is usually the driven , not the driver
Quality can be lowered — and sometimes thatâ€™s okay
Non-executive summary for non-executives
Now , let ’s get on with things …
Quality is about much more than bugs
First , let ’s make one thing clear : quality is not just bugs .
It includes look and feel , ease of use , ease of installation , performance , and so on .
Looking at Mishkin ’s post it ’s clear to me that we he says “ quality ” he really means “ bugs ” : he is making a strong case for test - driven development .
But test - driven development does n’t help with an application that requires six clicks rather than one to enter the default data .
It does n’t help that one of your modules needs administrator access to save its state .
It does n’t help that you ca n’t add any more servers when you need to triple its capacity .
These are situations where quality could be improved , but which are n’t solved by test - driven development .
Quality is wider than that .
Quality is rarely addressed at the outset
There ’s a classic project management mantra in many variations : “ cost , quality , time : pick any two ” is one such [ 1 , 2 ( PDF ) , 3 ] .
At one level it implies ( quite fairly ) that the major project variables at the outset are interdependent , and you ca n’t choose settings for them all .
You ca n’t say , for instance “ I want it to do all this , I want it to be flawless , and I want it in a week ” — making just two of those demands determines what you get for the third .
But at another level it suggests that people are making these kinds of decisions , and that quality is often determined at the outset .
I find this implausible .
I rarely hear clear requirements at the start of a project about the quality of the result .
I ’ve heard vague pronouncements , but rarely anything that could be factored into a project plan .
I ’ve heard “ we need to do better than last time ” , and “ let ’s not over - do it the way we did before ” .
But that ’s usually part of an agenda - setting speech , not the project plan .
It ’s not enough to help make a calculable impact on scope , cost or time .
At the start of a project you will hear a precise number for a budget , a strong date for a deadline , and ( we hope ) a clear list of requirements .
But it ’s very rare that people give a precise level of quality — it does n’t even have a common unit of measurement ( remember : quality is not just a bug count ) .
Quality is rarely negotiated at the outset .
The client expects the software to do the job specified , and that ’s that .
Quality is less flexible than scope , time or money
Another misconception is that quality can be varied to the same degree as other major ( initial , or input ) variables such as scope , time and money .
Scope can be cut right back , or added to indefinitely .
Similarly for money and time .
But quality does n’t vary in the same way .
Quality ca n’t be increased arbitrarily — after a point there ’s nothing left to do , assuming the scope is n’t changing .
Similarly it ca n’t be reduced to zero , because below a certain point — well before you get to zero — the product is n’t doing the thing it was supposed to do and therefore you ’re reducing scope .
However , while I believe that quality varies less than other project variables , I do believe the consequences of improving quality — even a small amount — are significant .
Unit tests reduce firefighting and ensure the project is always moving forward .
Usability testing ensures people are much more comfortable and confident with your software , paying dividends throughout the business .
Increasing quality by a small amount can have a big , positive knock - on effect .
Quality is usually the driven , not the driver
I ’ve talked about scope , time and money being “ input ” or “ initial ” variables .
They ’re things that are usually explicity set at the start of the project .
Quality , however , might be set early on , but it ’s usually determined by other things .
Sam Newman writes , correctly in my opinion , that quality is driven by process .
Here , they way you do things determines how good the result is .
Quality is an “ output ” variable more often than not .
Introducing test - first development is a process change ; allowing post - development testing time to be reduced because the development phase has overrun is a consequence of an unfortunate project management process ; introducing or eliminating performance testing is a process change .
In all these cases quality is not an independent variable ; it is driven by other things .
Quality can be lowered — and sometimes that ’s okay
Quality is negotiable , and it would be foolish if it was n’t .
It would be foolish if budget , scope and time were n’t ever negotiable , but they are , and in that respect quality stands next to them on a level .
Real situation :
The website is being built ; the investors are making bullish noises in the City ; the launch — a release and public demo — was scheduled months ago and is due next week with 200 big media attendees , and testing is still on - going .
If a real , but infrequent , bug is found that ca n’t be fixed by next week does the company cancel the launch ?
Real situation :
You ’ve been working for months on your release .
It ’s almost done , but there ’s another project looming , which the sales team are desperate get started .
The time remaining for your current work will leave some untidy edges , but there ’s a pressing commercial need to release it and move on to the new project before the company loses more competitive edge than it already has .
Do you push for a project extension ?
If a developer tells me their professional needs are bigger than those of the organisation in which they work , then they should n’t be working there .
A developer works for their organisation — just as everyone in that organisation does — not the other way round .
And making the right decisions for the business must have positive consequences for the development team .
Mishkin says
Every time the developers sacrifice quality for schedule / cost / features , they incur a debt .
Sometimes this is called “ technical debt ” .
I like to call it lying .
Powerful prose , but I ’m afraid that particular extract strikes me as uncharacteristically arrogant .
“ Technical debt ” is an honest term .
By using this term the developer says to their organisation that the decision taken now will incur an increased cost later .
The organisation as a whole can then weigh up the options and make an informed decision .
And call me crazy , but it might just be that after being appraised of the situation , the project board , or managers , or directors might be in a better position to make a strategic decision than the developer who ’s paid for their expertise in one very particular part of the organisation .
Of course , that ’s not to say that every decision on quality needs to be raised to board level .
Just as a developer would n’t dream of bothering their project board as to whether they should use descriptive variable names ( “ Well , short names are quicker to type and might shave off 2 % of our delivery time , but longer names will save us time if we need to revisit that part of the code … ” ) so there will always be ways to improve quality in refactoring , or configuration , or packaging , or architecture which the developer should just do without question because they ’re a professional .
But the developer who never informs their project board of major quality forks in the road , and who never allows their client to be involved in such decisions , is failing to fulfill their responsibility as a member of the whole project team .
At Guardian Unlimited we ’re always looking for ways to improve the quality of what we do .
But I ’ve also heard people say “ let ’s not gold - plate it ” , and “ look , we ’re not producing art ” .
These are senior developers who are arguing against particular quality improvements because they are able to weigh up not just the technical decisions but also the wider business decisions .
They are being pragmatic .
I ’d say they are much better developers for it .
Non-executive summary for non-executives
Let ’s recap .
Quality is really important .
It ’s about much more than unit testing .
And making small increments in quality can result in disproportionately large increments in the results .
But let ’s not kid ourselves that quality is a variable that can be tweaked arbitrarily and independently this way and that .
It ’s not of the same standing as budget or scope or time .
And let ’s not kid ourselves that developers of principle have to stand firm against some kind of management beast constantly trying to undermine them .
Developers are an integral part of the organisation , and should behave ( and be treated ) as such .
The quality of developers ’ output needs to be balanced just as every other organisational demand does .
As long as we can see and understand software quality for what it really is , the better we are able to improve it .
The dynamics of evolution are fully in play within the environment of a tumor , just as they are in forests and meadows , oceans and streams .
This is the view of researchers in an emerging cross-disciplinary field that brings the thinking of ecologists and evolutionary biologists to bear on cancer biology .
Insights from their work may have profound implications for understanding why current cancer therapies often fail and how radically new therapies might be devised .
A review by researchers at The Wistar Institute of current research in this new field , published online November 16 , will appear in the December issue of the journal Nature Reviews Cancer .
" A tumor cell population is constantly evolving through natural selection , " says Carlo C. Maley , Ph.D. , an assistant professor in the Molecular and Cellular Oncogenesis Program at Wistar whose own research focuses on this area .
He is senior author on the new review .
" The mutations that benefit the survival and reproduction of cells in a tumor are the things that drive it towards malignancy .
" Evolution is also driving therapeutic resistance , " Maley adds .
" When you apply chemotherapy to a population of tumor cells , you 're quite likely to have a resistant mutant somewhere in that population of billions or even trillions of cells .
This is the central problem in oncology .
The reason we have n't been able to cure cancer is that we 're selecting for resistant tumor cells .
When we spray a field with pesticide , we select for resistant pests .
It 's the same idea . "
Maley notes that there are three necessary and sufficient conditions for natural selection to occur and that all are met in a population of tumor cells .
The first requirement is that there be variation in the population .
This variation is evident in tumors , which are a mosaic of many different genetic mutants .
The second condition is that the variation must be heritable .
This , too , can be seen within a tumor - cell population .
When mutant tumor cells divide to replicate , the daughter cells share the same mutations .

The final condition is that the variation has to affect fitness , the survival and reproduction of the cells .
All of the characteristics that are considered hallmarks of cancer affect fitness , according to Maley .
Among these are that cancer cells no longer heed normal growth inhibition signals in their environment , they no longer require an external signal to divide as healthy cells do , and they are able to suppress a vital set of internal instructions that require cells to self - destruct when their genes are mutated beyond repair .
This protective cell - suicide program carried by normal cells is known as apoptosis .
Seeing a tumor in this light opens a window on new therapeutic strategies .
" It 's not just a metaphor to say tumor cell populations are evolving , " Maley says .
" Evolution is going on in the tumor .
So let 's think about how we might want to influence that evolution .
Can we push it down paths that might be more beneficial to us ? "
One idea might be to develop new drugs that would act as benign cell boosters .
Such drugs would specifically target the more benign cells in a tumor to increase their relative fitness over their malignant neighbors .
This would allow the benign cells to outcompete the malignant cells , leading to a less aggressive , less dangerous tumor .
" Another idea we 're pursuing is what we call the sucker 's gambit , " Maley says .
" In this case , you try to increase the fitness of chemosensitive cells so that they outcompete any resistant cells that are in the tumor .
And then you apply your chemotherapy .
So you sucker the tumor into a vulnerable state and then you hit it with your therapy . "
In their review , Maley and his coauthors also explored how the ecological ideas of competition , predation , parasitism , and mutualism unfold in tumors .
Here again , they found that the concepts from another field helped to illuminate cancer biology .
advertisement
Mutant cells compete with each other for needed resources .
The immune system often kills tumor cells like a predator hunting prey , and the tumor cells that develop defenses against the predation are the ones that survive and reproduce .
An example of parasitism in the tumor environment can be seen in angiogenesis , in which a subset of tumor cells send chemical signals to stimulate the host to generate new blood vessels to supply the tumor with nutrients .
The neighboring cells that are n't investing resources in producing the signals take advantage of the nutrients nonetheless .
Mutualism describes a situation in which two organisms interact in a mutually beneficial way .
Tumor cells send signals to stimulate the growth of the cells that form the scaffold in which the tumor cells grow , known as fibroblasts .
The fibroblasts , in turn , send signals to the tumor cells to stimulate their growth .
Recent studies suggest , too , that the fibroblasts in a tumor microenvironment begin to acquire mutations of their own .
" They 're co-evolving , and it becomes a dynamic , runaway process , " Maley says .

The spams were in Mr Roberts ' personal e-mail account
Nigel Roberts , who lives in Alderney in the Channel Islands , took action against Media Logistics UK over junk e-mails in his personal account .
Under new European laws , companies can be sued for sending unwanted e-mails .
The Stirlingshire - based firm has agreed to pay £ 270 compensation to Mr Roberts , who runs an internet business .
' Tiny victory '
Three years ago the EU passed an anti-spam law , the directive on privacy and telecommunications , which gave individuals the right to fight the growing tide of unwanted e-mail by allowing them to claim damages .
Mr Roberts received unwanted e-mail adverts for a contract car firm and a fax broadcasting business and decided to take action against the company .
The company filed an acknowledgement of the claim at Colchester County Court but did not defend it and a judge ruled in favour of Mr Roberts .
In an out - of - court agreement Media Logistics agreed to pay Mr Roberts damages of £ 270 plus his £ 30 filing fee .
Mr Roberts said he had limited his claim to a maximum of £ 300 in order to qualify to file it as a small claim .
He said : " This may be a tiny victory but perhaps now spammers will begin to realise that people do n't have to put up with their e-mail inboxes being filled with unwanted junk . "
No - one from Media Logistics UK was available for comment .
A spokesman for the Information Commissioner 's Office , the watchdog who oversees the Data Protection Act , said it was the first case of its kind he had heard of .
He said : " What I can say is that I have n't heard of anyone doing so and we have n't taken a case under that legislation . "
So , I was reading the little snake that could n't , a pessimistic post on Python web programming by Ivan Krstic .
I was rather annoyed by his Frankenweb post , but never replied to it since I figured I 'd just be pissy .
So maybe this will be an indirect reply to that too .
First , a point of correction : I 'm not developing Pylons ( as was noted in a Tim O'Reilly post ) , but I 'm working with the Pylons developers as they are using Paste quite heavily .
Like one of the commenters on that post , I also agree that Rails is good for Python .
Rails is doing a good job at describing a kind of development that Python is good for -- small numbers of good programmers making a product quickly and well .
And to quote Ivan : ' If Rails has its way with the web , 2006 will be dubbed " the year of the anti-enterprise . " ' ; that 's a- ok by me too .
So I think I'm on the same page as the Rails guys when it comes to basic motivation and techniques .
So , insofar as Rails is convincing people that they can do projects with small teams , with simpler goals and simpler results released in smaller iterations , that 's good for Python .
And yes , Rails has been a much - needed kick in the butt for Python web programming , which was not being driven forward as it should have been , and not payed enough attention in the Python community .
( Incidentally , Guido was just hired by Google , so hopefully we 'll see some web needs given a little more attention in the core . )
Python frameworks might not have the buzz that Rails has , but they did n't before Rails , and they are doing better now than they were before , so we really should n't complain .
Anyway , back to the post :
Point the first : if you 're writing a Python web framework that will out - rail Rails , please give up now .
No problem , no one is trying to do that .
Really , not a single one .
Subway was in the beginning , but they stopped really trying to do that a long time ago ( incidentally it looks like Subway will merge with TurboGears ) .
A Rails - like Python framework with best - of - breed Python components will never be mainstream , and will never be better than Rails : it 'll just be different .
More Pythonic .
I , for one , like " Pythonic , " and not just in terms of the particulars of whitespace or punctuation .
Rails is n't Pythonic , nor is Ruby .
It 's not the anti-Python either , but there are real differences in philosophy , and I think Python 's philosophy is ultimately better .
Also , I think Rails risks some serious risks of taking a Zope - like turn , with more risk specifically because of Ruby .
Zope added one Really Bad Idea ( Acquisition ) that killed one of Python 's best features ( locally understandable code and general backtrackability ) .
There were some other bad choices ( TTW , in - ZODB code , lots of mixins and subclassing ) ; but the worst of the choices were enabled specifically because of Acquisition .
If you do n't know what Acquisition is , think of it as crazy attribute dynamic scoping .
Ruby does n't have Acquisition , but it also plays loose with classes and interfaces in a way that makes code hard to understand locally .
Of course nothing is inevitable , but there 's risk .
And the first generation of programmers is usually enthusiastic ; any failure is a personal failure , so you can gloss over those things .
It 's the second generation that 's going to be less enthused , that 's going to stare in bafflement at these classes that mysteriously spawn methods , and trying to figure out what 's going when there 's an exception in dynamically generated code .
You can monkeypatch code in Python pretty easily , but we look down on it enough that we call it " monkeypatching " .
In Ruby they call it " opening a class " and think it 's a cool feature .
I will assert : we are right , they are wrong .
That 's a risk for Rails , but we can't just hang around and hope to catch people who drop from Rails .
But Rails is hardly answering everyone 's needs .
And no , Seaside is n't answering every need that Rails is n't answering .
Python has an opportunity to do something Rails is n't trying to do , that DHH specifically does n't want to do : create a heterogeneous web programming environment .
The " Frankenweb " is a feature , and it describes the web we have , the software we have , and the future that is inevitable .
The world was never all J2EE , or ASP ( . NET ) , or PHP , and it wo n't be all Rails either .
The Python web framework diversity is just a microcosm of that ; it 's not necessarily good , but neither is it necessarily bad .
There 's a certain hubris to the idea that a framework should not reuse external code ( something that both DHH and Adrian Holovaty basically asserted at Snakes and Rubies ) .
Yes , you can get by without using other people 's code , and often you can make it work fairly quickly and on a timescale you control , and the specific gains you get from reusing code may not match your initial expectation .
But there 's also a presumption that no one else is ever going to make code worth using , that you will always be the cutting edge , that you can assimilate every idea without assimilating any code .
But you just can't be the cutting edge of everything ; and once you are n't , people have to choose to stay or to go .
Well , people do n't have to stay or go , but they will if you do n't have a plan .
Frameworks can fit together , but it 's hard .
It 's hard , but it 's good exercise .
The project that is reusing code right now will be able to reuse code in the future .
That 's one thing Python can do .
Another is actually try to pick up where PHP leaves off .
Rails does n't do any of the stuff that PHP does well , it merely provides a landing spot for disaffected PHP programmers .
The beauty of PHP is that they are constantly sloughing off disaffected programmers , and yet their numbers still grow .
( If PHP is wrong , do we want to be right ? )
PHP grows because there 's lots of useful applications -- some quite good , but you do n't even have to be good to be useful .
You install an app , you customize the app , you realize later you are a PHP programmer .
There 's other good features too , but anyway , we can provide useful applications that do n't require an understanding of the framework to install and start customizing .
The last system like that ( before PHP ) was Perl CGI ; and they did pretty damn well for themselves during that period .
Python can be the next system like that , and hell , I even have a plan .
( Zope 2 's growth was very similar , applications first , but Zope 3 is not at all like this .
But it could be !
My plan includes everyone who wants to participate !
I love you all equally ! )
And that 's only like two ideas .
Rails has a message , and it has an implementation that fulfills that message .
That 's not bad , it 's certainly working out for them .
But if you think that 's it , that there 's nothing left to work on , then you sorely lack imagination .
Bad usability in the design of aircraft controls can result in what is cheerfully referred to as CFIT : Controlled Flight Into Terrain .
The usability of your product may not be quite as critical .
If you ’re lucky , the mistakes you make in usability design will merely cause people to lose limbs , or , heck , even just thumbs .
No biggie !
In fact if you ’re extremely lucky , your unusable design will do nothing more than make people sad .
They ’ll try to accomplish things , and either fail , or struggle , and for very real reasons this will literally make them unhappy .
I ’ll explore the psychological reasons for that in a future article , but for now , suffice it to say that making the users of your design unhappy is not likely to be precisely the result you were looking for , unless you ’re designing a French film .
So , usability .
That ’s really at the heart of good design , and I ’m going to spend a lot of time on it .
The good news is that I can teach you everything I know about usability while standing on one foot .
Ready ?
Here we go :
Something is usable if it behaves exactly as expected .
That ’s it !
That ’s the whole story !
As Hillel said , all the rest is commentary .
Let me run a little example by you .
Which is Easier to Use : Windows or Mac ?
When you ’re designing a product for humans , it helps to keep imaginary users in mind .
The more realistic the imaginary user is , the better you ’ll do thinking about how they use your thing .
My imaginary user is Pete .
Pete is an accountant for a technical publisher who has used Windows for six years at the office , and a bit at home .
He is fairly competent and technical .
He installs his own software ; he reads PC Magazine , and he has even programmed some simple Word macros to help the secretaries in his office send invoices .
He has a cable modem at home .
Pete has never used an Apple Macintosh .
“ They ’re too expensive , ” he ’ll tell you .
“ You can get a 3.6 GHz PC with 2 gigs of RAM for the price of … ” OK , Pete .
We get it .
One day Pete ’s friend Gena asks him for some computer help .
Now , Gena has a Macintosh iBook , because she loves white computers .
When Pete sits down and tries to use Gena ’s Macintosh , he quickly gets frustrated .
“ I hate these things , ” he says .
He is , finally , able to help Gena , but he ’s grumpy and unhappy .
“ The Macintosh has such a clunky user interface . ”
Clunky ?
What ’s he talking about ?
Everybody knows that the Macintosh has an elegant user interface , right ?
The very paradigm of ease - of - use ?
Well .
On the Macintosh , when you want to resize a window , you have to grab the bottom right hand corner to resize it .
On Windows , you can resize from any edge .
When Pete was helping Gena , he tried to widen a window by dragging the right edge .
Frustratingly , the whole window moved , rather than resizing as he expected .
On Windows , when a message box pops up , you can tab to a button and hit the space bar to press that button .
On the Mac , space does n’t work .
When Pete got alerts , he tried to dismiss them using the space bar , like he ’s been doing subconsciously for the last six years .
The first time Pete tried that on the Mac , nothing happened .
Without even being aware of it , Pete banged the space bar harder , since he thought that the problem must be that the keyboard did not register his tapping the space bar .
Actually , it did — but it did n’t care !
Eventually he used the mouse .
Another tiny frustration .
Pete has also gotten into the habit of using Alt + F4 to close windows .
On the Mac , this actually changes the volume of the speakers .
At one point , Pete wanted to click on the Internet Explorer icon on the desktop , which was partially covered by another window .
So he hit Alt + F4 to close the window and immediately double - clicked where the icon would have been .
The Alt +F4 raised the volume on the computer and did n’t close the window , so his double click actually went to the Help button in the toolbar on the window which he wanted closed anyway , and that immediately started bringing up a help window , slowly , so now , he ’s got two windows open which he has to close .
Another small frustration .
But , boy , does it add up .
At the end of the day , Pete is grumpy and angry .
When he tries to control things , they do n’t respond .
The space bar and the Alt + F4 key “ do n’t work ” — for all intents and purposes , it ’s as if those keys were broken .
The window disobeys him when he tries to make it wider , playing a little prank where it just moves over instead of widening .
Bad window .
Even if the whole thing is subconscious , the subtle feeling of being out of control translates into unhappiness .
“ I like my computer , ” Pete says .
“ I have it all set up so that it works exactly the way I like it .
But these Macs are clunky and hard to use .
It ’s an exercise in frustration .
If Apple had been working on MacOS all these years instead of mucking about with video iPods and other toys , their operating system would n’t be such a mess . ”
Right , Pete .
We know better .
His feelings come despite the fact that the Macintosh really is quite easy to use — for Mac users .
It ’s totally arbitrary which key you press to close a window .
The Microsoft programmers probably thought that they were adding a cool new feature by letting you resize windows by dragging any edge .
The Apple programmers probably thought they were adding a cool new feature when they let you move windows by dragging any edge .
All those flame wars you read on the OS bigot websites about user interface issues focus on the wrong thing .
Windows is better because it gives you more ways to resize the window .
So what ?
That ’s missing the point .
The point is , does the UI respond to the user in the way in which the user expected it to respond ?
If it did n’t , the user is going to feel like they can’t control the interface , and they ’re going to be unsuccessful .
That ’s all there is to it .
Something is usable if it behaves exactly as expected .
Tattoo this on your forehead .
Backwards , so you can read it in the mirror .
If you follow along in future articles , you ’ll see that just about everything I can teach you about usable design is going to relate back to this simple rule , so if for some reason aliens land in your garden tonight and whisk you away to the planet Kij8 zxwrk , where you have no access to the Earth ’s Internet because TCP / IP does n’t work well when packets take hundreds of years to arrive , you already know enough to get a job as a pretty decent usability designer .
Economic weakness spread beyond the stricken housing and auto sectors last month , with reports showing U.S. manufacturing shrank for the first time in 31/2 years and construction dropped the most since the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
U.S. industries broadly cut back production , adding to factory shutdowns caused by deepening recessions in auto - and housing - related industries such as wood , furniture and appliances , according to a report yesterday from the Institute for Supply Management .
An unexpected decline in construction of offices and other business facilities in October added to a record string of drops in housing construction of more than 1 percent in the last seven months to cause the biggest drop in construction spending in six years , the Commerce Department said yesterday .
“ Industry is clearly going through a rough patch ” that few anticipated , said Daniel Jester , analyst at Moody ’s Economy.com .
Outside housing and autos , the Federal Reserve had expected business to pick up rather than decline this fall , supporting a so - called “ soft landing ” in the economy .
The weakness in manufacturing started with autos , was compounded by housing , and recently has spread to big - ticket capital goods such as technology and telecommunications equipment , Mr. Jester said .
In addition , a broad array of manufacturers are cutting back because of an unexpected buildup of inventories this fall that has to be worked off , he said .
“ It is clear that several segments of the industrial base have weakened measurably over the past few months .
This may now be spilling over to heretofore healthy segments related to business investment , ” he said .
“ The signal of declining production should not come as a surprise , ” said Daniel J. Meckstroth , chief economist at the Manufacturers Alliance .
“ Two major manufacturing markets are declining — motor vehicles and housing — and many other industries are trying to adjust inventories to adjust for a period of much slower growth ahead in 2007 . ”
The “ awful ” collapse of the construction market in October means that sector is likely to be a major drag on economic growth for the fourth straight quarter in the final quarter of 2006 , according to Economy.com estimates .
David Wyss , economist at Standard & Poor ’s Corp. , noted that the downbeat tone of recent economic news contrasts sharply with upbeat assessments this week coming from Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and other Fed officials .
Mr. Wyss said there is cause for worry .
“ Weak retail sales and a drop in consumer confidence in November create worries about the consumer , ” he said , adding that “ home sales and prices are dropping and the manufacturing sector appears to be retreating for the first time in over three years . ”
While Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials maintain that the economy can avoid recession even with the critical housing and car industries in decline , many economists disagree .
“ Housing slowdowns tend to lead recessions rather than result from them , ” said John Makin , economist with the American Enterprise Institute .
“ An annual drop in the growth rate of residential investment of more than 10 percent has coincided with a recession five of the seven times it has occurred since 1965 . ”
Housing , the biggest contributor to a halving of economic growth this year , plummeted at an 11 percent rate in the spring , 18 percent in the summer , and an estimated 9 percent in the fall .
“ The intensity of the fall in U.S. residential investment during the middle two quarters of 2006 is approaching potential recession territory , ” Mr. Makin said , but whether a downturn occurs depends on whether the Fed changes its stance and starts to cut interest rates .
Interest rates declined in the bond market yesterday in expectation that the Fed will reverse course and start cutting rates by March .
Roger M. Kubarych , economist with Unicredit Markets , said the Fed will reconsider its position at a meeting later this month .
Mr. Bernanke signaled that the central bank is starting to become concerned about the housing market in a speech this week that for the first time designated a housing collapse as the biggest risk to economic growth .
“ It seems the Fed is beginning to get nervous about the economic outlook , ” he said .

Yes , this is a serious question .
Porn in the woods .
Did you , as a kid , find porn in the woods ?
I did , and I have noticed this is a worldwide phenomena .
Why the porn in the woods ?
Where does the porn in the woods come from ?
As of this writing , North Korea continues to fire test missiles in a barrage of defiance aimed at the U.S. and its regional allies , belligerently declaring its right to do so and threatening anyone who stands in its way with unspecified " physical " harm .
What , one has to wonder , do the rulers of the Hermit Kingdom want ?
Our clueless president claims it ’s hard to read Pyongyang ’s motives in all this , but that is disingenuous , at best , even for someone who makes a virtue out of his own ignorance .
Surely Bush has noticed that there are presently some 30,000 U.S. troops in South Korea , allied with a well - armed South Korean force , facing off against a North Korean army of 700,000 .
No doubt he realizes , even if only vaguely , that his administration has consistently refused to engage in bilateral talks with the North Koreans , instead seeking to cloak negotiations in the context of " six - party " talks involving Japan , China , South Korea , and Russia .
And perhaps he is even aware , to some degree , that the U.S. has stood directly in the path of North - South reunification efforts , actively discouraging the democratically elected government of South Korea from pursuing negotiations with the Pyongyang regime .
The flurry of missile tests proved at least one point that advocates of engagement have been making : North Korea represents no credible threat to the U.S.
The much - vaunted long - range missile launched by the North Koreans crashed after only a few brief moments airborne .
So much for all those screaming headlines about Pyongyang ’s plan to target San Francisco with a nuclear - tipped Taepodong - 2 .
The real threat , if one exists , is to Japan , first and foremost , and to South Korea , where millions would be instantaneously incinerated if the North ever attacked , including those 30,000 American troops .
But the fiercely nationalistic Koreans  and , make no mistake , the lords of Pyongyang are Koreans first , and communist ideologues second  would hesitate a good deal before launching such a ruinous attack on what is , after all , their own country .
This constraint , coupled with the fact that the North is a rapidly unraveling economic basket case , pretty much rules out an unprovoked assault on the South .
Let the Korean commies lob all the missiles they want into the Sea of Japan  they are n’t about to attack Tokyo , either .
Unless , that is , the U.S decides to pick a fight .
So what and where is the big danger ?
In 2002 , on the eve of South Korea ’s presidential election , Richard Perle  the Darth Vader of the neoconservative movement , and then chief of the president ’s defense advisory board  declared that war with the North might be necessary .
This helped tip the election to the more conciliatory Roh Moo -Hyun , who , following in the footsteps of Roh Tae - Woo , pursued the path of national reconciliation and eventual reunification .
Washington , however , opposed the newly elected president ’s peace initiatives .
George W. Bush pointedly refused to even talk directly to the North Koreans , labeling their regime part of the " axis of evil , " along with Iran and Saddam ’s Iraq .
This effectively put the kibosh on the desire of South Koreans to end the half - century - old conflict and rid the country of foreign occupiers once and for all .
This is the real question at the heart of the Korean standoff : what are American troops still doing there , nearly 60 years after Harry Truman dispatched them without congressional approval and in violation of the Constitution ?
The American troop presence is a testament to the permanence of all such " temporary " emergencies .
The American occupation of South Korea grates on our " allies , " the South Koreans , almost as much as it does on the commies of the North .
Numerous incidents involving crimes against South Koreans committed by U.S. troops have caused significant tensions between Washington and Seoul , and the current president of the ROK came to power vowing not to " kowtow to the Americans . "
This goes far in answering the question posed at the beginning of this column : the North Koreans want pretty much what the South Koreans want , and that is the withdrawal of U.S. troops and the reunification of the country .
One very much doubts that the Pyongyang regime envisions a united Korea under Kim Jong - Il , the eccentric heir to the throne bequeathed to him by his father , Kim Il - Sung , the founder of the North Korean communist state .
The South Korean economy is several times the size of the North ’s , and the " workers paradise " that makes Stalin ’s Russia look almost easygoing is seemingly on its last legs .
An aerial view of the Korean peninsula at night shows the North plunged in near - total darkness , while the South shines with the brightness of capitalist prosperity .
Famine plagues the North Korean dystopia , and one wonders how an army of 700,000 will fight if half the population is starving to death .
The political response to this ratcheting - up of the Korean " crisis " is going to be very interesting .
There is every indication that the Democrats will take up the cry of " appeasement ! " in response to the Bush administration ’s " inaction . "
In a crazed op - ed piece for the Washington Post , former Clinton administration defense secretary William J. Perry and Ashton B. Carter , former assistant secretary , write :
" Should the United States allow a country openly hostile to it and armed with nuclear weapons to perfect an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of delivering nuclear weapons to U.S. soil ?
We believe not .
The Bush administration has unwisely ballyhooed the doctrine of ‘ preemption , ’ which all previous presidents have sustained as an option rather than a dogma .
It has applied the doctrine to Iraq , where the intelligence pointed to a threat from weapons of mass destruction that was much smaller than the risk North Korea poses .
( The actual threat from Saddam Hussein was , we now know , even smaller than believed at the time of the invasion . )
But intervening before mortal threats to U.S. security can develop is surely a prudent policy .
" Therefore , if North Korea persists in its launch preparations , the United States should immediately make clear its intention to strike and destroy the North Korean Taepodong missile before it can be launched . "
The Perry - Carter scenario is based on the premise that Pyongyang ’s test of the Taepodong - 2 was bound to be successful , and that the North Koreans would then train their nuclear sights on U.S. targets .
Now that we know they have no such capability , does this mean war can or should be averted ?
Of course not : the Democrats , you see , are determined to out - hawk the Republicans on this one .
Having adopted the doctrine of preemption for their very own , Perry and Carter can certainly make the argument that success or failure does n’t matter  as long as the potential for a successful test exists , then it is necessary and prudent to take out the North Koreans before they become a threat .
What is especially weird is the particularly dippy way in which these two Clintonites go into the details of just how this " precision " strike would occur .
" In addition to warning our allies and partners of our determination to take out the Taepodong before it can be launched , we should warn the North Koreans .
There is nothing they could do with such warning to defend the bulky , vulnerable missile on its launch pad , but they could evacuate personnel who might otherwise be harmed .
The United States should emphasize that the strike , if mounted , would not be an attack on the entire country , or even its military , but only on the missile that North Korea pledged not to launch  one designed to carry nuclear weapons .
We should sharply warn North Korea against further escalation . "
Imagine if North Koreans dispatched a demolition team to the U.S. and took out a military base where nuclear weapons are stored  would even the completely deluded propagandists of the North Korean regime utter such blatant nonsense to justify their brazen aggression ?
" Comrade Americans , we are n’t attacking you  oh , no !
And you can ignore that ominously glowing cloud hanging over most of your major cities  it ’s nothing but a capitalist mirage to distract you from the truth , which is that we were just attacking an instrument of imperialist aggression .
Long live our Glorious Leader , Kim Jong - Il ! "
The rulers of the last stronghold of Stalinism and the American foreign policy elites inhabit the same Bizarro World : it is n’t just the neocons and the denizens of this administration who believe that they create their own reality  with words and armies .
They ’re only attacking the missile  is that what they plan on telling the Iranians ?
If I were a Democrat , I would not make too much of a partisan play here .
After all , the opposition can’t raise the question of just why this administration is relatively " soft " on the North Koreans , while it ’s willing to go to the mat over Iran ’s quest to join the nuclear club .
The answer , of course , is that if Israel had been situated somewhere in North Asia , Pyongyang would today be a smoking ruin , along with much of the south .
The world might be minus a few Japanese cities , but , once again , it would be made safe for Israel  and that , as John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt point out in their excellent Harvard University study , " The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy , " is really the starting point for policymakers of both parties .
The Democrats , of course , ca n’t afford to have this come up , because they ’re equally culpable when it comes to our Israel - centric foreign policy , and so  if they ’re " smart "  they ’ll just confine their arguments to proving how the " national security Democrats " can apply the policy of imperial preemption far more creatively and decisively than those Republican pikers .
The solution to the Korean " crisis " is to recognize that Pyongyang is not a threat to the U.S. , or , really , to anyone .
They are mostly a threat only to themselves .
The regime is on its last legs : desperate for cash , they have commandeered trains used by the Chinese to send much - needed aid  and have refused all Chinese demands to return the trains forthwith !
The last Stalinist regime on earth is not long for this world : the irony is that our war threats provide the regime with its only basis for popular support .
The people may be starving , but , in the Korean case at least , they ’d rather starve than be occupied or dominated by a foreign power .
The intensity of Korean nationalism is often derided as " isolationism "  the entire " juche " concept that serves as the basis of the official ideology is based on the idea of national " self - reliance "  but it tends to come in handy when Koreans are faced with a foreign enemy .
The supreme arrogance of the Perry - Carter proposal is underscored in that the authors feel absolutely no obligation to consult the South Koreans : we are only to warn them , as well as the North Koreans , and then patiently explain with a sigh that we had no choice .
Oh , and sorry about all that radiation .
We ’ll be glad to send over a clean - up crew and lots of Geiger counters .
Instead of allowing the Communist regime to implode and meet the fate of its former sponsors in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe , the Bush administration has been exacerbating tensions between North and South , threatening Pyongyang , and doing everything to inflame Korean nationalists on both sides of the DMZ .
We should have withdrawn from the Korean peninsula long ago .
Instead , as in Japan , we are still guarding the Pacific perimeter of our Asian empire on the pretext of " defending " allies against nonexistent threats  or , rather , against threats largely created and maintained by a foreign policy seeking American hegemony in every region of the world , including North Asia .
What does North Korea want ?
Pretty much what South Korea wants : to be left alone .
Is that really so bad ?
Yes , the North Korean regime is something out of George Orwell ’s worst nightmare .
But , as I said above , it ca n’t last much longer .
Surely the advocates of " regime change " will agree that a peaceful Atlas shrugging  as in the case of the German Democratic Republic  would be preferable to a bloody war of " liberation " that could easily go nuclear .

I wonder ... this puts the burden on Microsoft NOW to make sure that newer
versions of Office also work with this plug - in .
If not , it would be SO clear
that they want what they want , when the want it , and are n't going to play if

If this plug - in works as promised , that pretty much

Do n't bother hunting for a download .
It 's not available .
The ODF Plugin came
out of testing last week .
I wish i could say we did this last night , but it 's
been at least a year in development .
The first stop for the ODF Plugin will be Massachusetts , followed by the EU and
California .
We were not aware of the RFi until this past Friday when we notified
Massachusetts tha tthe ODF Plugin has been competed .
Hard as it is to believe ,
it 's completely coincidental that Massachusettes decided on the RFi route the
day before we notified them that the ODF Plugin had completed testing .
It just
looks like we did this overnight .
Hey , maybe that 's not a bad thing :)
Unless you 're completely caught up in Win32 bound business processes , legacy
systems dependencies , and shared collaborations , i would suggest you forego the
ODF Plugin and immediately download OpenOffice.org and GooglePack .
The ODF
Plugin was developed for workgroups and individuals caught between a rock and a
hard place , unable to get their information into ODF any other way .
Unable to
move forward into the age of collaborative computing until Chairman Bill decides
how he wants to do it , decides when his solution will be available , and
determines what it will cost .
So please , consider the ODF Plugin as an important part of that wave of desktop ,
server , and device applications moving to ODF everywhere , all the time , for
every purpose .
Let no application be left behind ,

Churchill once stated :
This is not the beginning of the end , but it is the end
of the beginning .
We now have the same thing but in the world of software and the fight to force
Microsoft to use open , international standards that are not of their own
proprietary interest and development .
This plug - in obliterates problems with
version read from Office97 to current release in all Microsoft formats - and all
are transcribed to an ISO standard .
From where I stand , my perception is that this incredible plug - in has just
completely taken the initiative away from Microsoft ...... and Microsoft has no
choice but to follow .
Indeed , it has other ramifications : If all Microsoft
Office suites can now be translated into ISO ODF formats , why bother purchasing
any update of Office ?
This is almost a software version of the " Texas Chainsaw Massacre " .
My sincere congratulations to the programmers who worked on this amazing bit of
software .

Mac Office ?
It would be a real boon to me to be able to use MS Office on my
Macs to work with ODF .
The current version of NeoOffice wo n't run on my Intel
Mac , OpenOffice 2 X11 is clunky and I keep closing it by hitting AppleQ and
Pages 2 ( good though it is ) does n't talk ODF at the moment either .
A solution
for Mac
Office would be a great help , especially in converting MS Office docs to
ODF although from my experience the compatiblilty of Mac Office with Windows
Office is only a little better than OpenOffice manages and sometimes I use
OpenOffice because Mac Office mangles stuff from a PC . [ Reply to This | # ]

It looks to me like the name Office Open XML was deliberately chosen to cause

Is " OpenOffice " trademarked ?
IANAL
but if so then this might make a good trademark infringment case .
If not could
it still be trademarked since " Open Office " has a few years of history

It all reminds me of the last game of monopoly I ever played many years ago .
I was adult , had a couple of young kids & was around at a friends place who had older children .
It was an adults game , and silly me I read the rules .
I found one that I had never ever noticed before and built 4 houses on the cheap blocks , used all the houses and refused to change them to hotels .
No - one else can build houses .
To put it in proper english parlance , it just aint cricket , old chap .
The ructions caused by a friendly game of Monopoly showed me that  theres rules and theres rules .
Missus didnt have a civil word for a month , I was the worlds biggest ---- , etc etc , and the missus still dont let me forget , 20 years later .
Well Bill , I do believe that you have just done the same , only big time .
I believe that you have now gone beyond what is considered acceptable in cricket , baseball or soccer and that the big boys , the old money and still the power , will now have a good hard look at reviewing and codifying what is acceptable .
I dont think the big boys will be impressed or happy that they have to get involved .
I believe that they will start playing your game back .
And I do believe you have aggravated them enough so they will play back hard .
Ah - the sweet sound of monopolies starting to crack .

Microsoft will rapidly develop their own support for ODF in MS Office 12 , and
block provision of alternative support .
There will be mysterious issues with
the generated ODF documents that Microsoft will blame on deficiencies in the ODF

I notice this plug - in'll also undercut one of Microsoft 's big bogeymen : accessibility functions for the disabled .
If the plug - in works and all the accessibility features of MSWord work just fine , MS will be left to explain just why they made such a fuss about accessibility not working right except with native Word documents .
I think the community 's position should be " But why would n't accessiblity work just fine in MSWord ?
It works when Word reads a Word95 document , or an HTMl document or a plain text document , why would it stop working just because it 's reading an ODF document ? " .

This is a fine example of what I refer to as " The Principle of Leverage " in action :
If you create leverage within your product and make people aware of it , they will eventually exploit this leverage to the betterment of your product .
Microsoft has long been aware of the Principle of Leverage .
The " plugin " APIs into Office create just this sort of leverage for people to exploit , as do macros , VBA , and similar " programmability " features .
And now these developers have just exploited this leverage to make Microsoft 's products more useful , by supporting a set of document formats not otherwise supported in these products .
Everybody benefits ... yes , even Microsoft , counter to their own goals though it may be .
( Just so you know :
No , I did n't come up with this principle myself .
I originally read it somewhere , though I can't remember where right now . )

... may possibly read like one .
Just reading through this story again [ and I 've been following this since PJ
brought the story to our attention ] one nagging doubt refuses to go away .
The Commonwealth of Massechussetts [ hereunder CoM ] have expressed a wish to have
a file format that is completely open and free of restrictions , in order to
permit any member of the public of the Commonwealth to be able to access that
information , now and in the future , by a means of their choice .
So at this point we start a wonderful and interesting debate that introduces us
to ODF and the Microsoft alternative , but one perhaps self - evident and possibly
even trivial question remains un-answered .
What is it about the file formats of
Microsoft Office 95 , 97 , 2000 and XP , etc , that their owning Company , Microsoft ,
believes gives them such an incredible competitive advantage as to render them
precious intellectual property ?
About 10 days ago a friend of mine asked me to help rebuild their PC after a
hardware failure [ HDD crashed ] and after installing a new disc we re-installed
their OS [ Windows 2000 ] and their software stack [ including Office 2000 ] .
I
noticed from the list of supported file formats that Office can be configured to
read and write in something like 15 or 20 different file formats [ including
those of numerous competitors ] .
What , then , is so special about ODF that
Microsoft believes that it * can * support WordPerfect but * cannot * support ODF ?
More importantly , what is it about Microsoft 's own " Word " file format
that contains such cutting edge technological advances ?
It 's a file format ,
right ?
Now , I could accept their argument if an MSWord file occupied significantly less
disc space than something I save under OpenOfficeWriter2.x .
I might be pursuaded
if the file could be opened in significantly less time than a similar file
loaded into KWord .
You might even tempt me if you could demonstrate that the
file could be text - searchable and / or securely encrypted in a better manner than
comparable competitors .
Unfortunately , the reality is that none of the above
assertions are true .
So I return to my original question [ with profound apologies to all if this
topic has been " done to death " elsewhere ... ]
What , exactly , do Microsoft believe that they have in their expansive ,
slow - loading , insecure and not spider - friendly file format that makes it so
special ?
OK , I think you realise that this is a rhetorical question asked with
tongue firmly placed in cheek ...
The answer , of course , is that Microsoft owns
the " proprietary " nature of the file format , the format is in use in
probably the majority of PCs in use on the planet today and , by keeping the
format closed , they have the ability to insert hidden tweaks that keep the
Office clones [ KOffice , OpenOffice , StarOffice , etc ] one jump behind .
We still do n't have a valid or reasonable answer to my question , however .
If
this were a piece of software that we were talking about , I could understand
Microsoft wishing to assert copyright or claim that the content was their
intellectual property .
[ Frankly , they would be welcome to it ] .
What I can't see
the logic of , however , is how this extends to a file format .
Unless of course
your motives are other than those publicly stated .
As a 20 - year veteran of the IT Industry , I spend a lot of my time dealing with
vendors who want to demonstrate leading or cutting edge software to my employer .
[ I work for a very large multinational organisation ] .
It is common practise
under these circumstances for us to put in place an NDA [ Non-Disclosure
Agreement ] to allow the company to discuss the details of their technology in
advance of a formal , public launch .
It helps my employer with purchasing
decisions and helps vendors sell technology .
If Microsoft believe that their technology is so special and so superior to ODF
or others and yet has content that is so super - secret that they cannot simply
publish Word2000 format to the public , perhaps the CoM could enter in to an NDA
with Microsoft so that the software company can explain in detail exactly what
is so special about the Word2000 .doc format ?
What makes it so super - secret that noone else could be allowed to know about .
Perhaps Microsoft could even specify all the patents that they have relating to
the Word2000 or WordXP file format ?
Because of course , if Word2000 or WordXP
file formats contain such valuable IP , it would of course be patented , would n't
it ?
After all , do n't Microsoft support the use of patents to protect valuable
IP ?
You do n't suppose - just a wild guess here - that any such patent , written in
appropriate language , would run foul of so many protests of prior written art
[ dating from the days before MS produced a Word Processor , that is ] that any
attempt to patent the Word file format would fall at the first hurdle ?
And of course , if MS tried to engineer it into the next release of their
product , it would break compatability with older software versions , thus
rendering them entirely vulnerable to the argument given by the CoM to go with a
common standard in the first place ....
Nope , the more I think about this , the more I suspect we 've somehow missed
asking the obvious question of Microsoft .
It 's a bit like the one we 've been
asking The SCO Group all these years ?
What 's so special about Word 's .doc
format ?
Where is your evidence of IBM 's infringement ?
Just on the off - chance that this line of thinking has n't convinced you yet ,
here 's another example to consider .
A few years ago a company called Iomega
produced a " Zip " Drive with the capacity of 100 Mb [ later versions went
to 250 and even 750 Mb ] .
It was designed to replace the floppy disc .
Iomega
designed to hold back [ or use restrictive licence deals ] that made it very
difficult for competitors to enter that market with them .
The PC industry
desperately needed a new medium to transport the ever - expanding bloatware ,
sorry , software packages , used by Windows PCs .
Compare and contrast Iomega's
approach with that of Phillips , inventor of the Compact Disc .
In the space of
months CD Drives had become a de-facto standard in PC hardware specifications -

I asked a similar question yesterday .
I read a lot of people saying this is a
win for open formats and it will lead to use of open source programs .
How ?
You
have just given anyone who wants to continue to use M$ Office a way to do it .
What about the comfort factor ?
Do you really believe that people are going to
change the program they are used to because a plug in allows them to write files
in another format ?
Microsoft knows about the comfort factor , thats why they
bundle things .
Once someone is used to a program it takes a lot to get them to
change .
Second , whats to stop state governments to continue to license M$ office and
spend our tax dollars ?
All it will take is a little cash under the table and a
few paid for fud studies .
The politicians will be listening to state workers who
do not want to change because of the comfort factor .
Next it will be time to
raise taxes because of the costs involved .

Any software which is not available for download , purchase , or via source is
considered vaporware in my book .
If their is a beta , it should be open to the public for testing .
Otherwise , it
is just smoke coming from the OpenDocument Foundation .
Call me a troll or not , but its the truth .

It 's nice to see that Office : Mac users do n't need this feature .
Thank god we

The article states that the plugin supports every version of Microsoft Office back to .... , but there seem to be a total disregard for the fact that Microsoft Office also have lived on the Mac for as long as there has been such a product .
( MS Excel 1.0 in 1986 on the Mac Plus and Word 1.05 even earlier . )
The concept of open format gets a pretty strange ring to it , if the openness is just available for Windows and Linux users .
In my estimates there must be 25 + million Mac Office users out there with documents that could benefit from this plugin .

The use of botnets to send spam would not matter as much if e-mail filters could still make effective use of the second spam - fighting strategy : analyzing the content of an incoming message .
Traditional antispam software examines the words in a text message and , using statistical techniques , determines if the words are more likely to make up a legitimate message or a piece of spam .
The explosion of image spam this year has largely thwarted that approach .
Spammers have used images in their messages for years , in most cases to offer a peek at a pornographic Web site , or to illustrate the effectiveness of their miracle drugs .
But as more of their text - based messages started being blocked , spammers searched for new methods and realized that putting their words inside the image could frustrate text filtering .
The use of other people ’s computers to send their bandwidth - hogging e-mail made the tactic practical .
“ They moved their message into our blind spot , ” said Paul Judge , chief technology officer of Secure Computing .
Antispam firms spotted the skyrocketing amount of image spam this summer .
A technology arms race ensued .
The filtering companies adopted an approach called optical character recognition , which scans the images in an e-mail and tries to recognize any letters or words .
Spammers responded in turn by littering their images with speckles , polka dots and background bouquets of color , which mean nothing to human eyes but trip up the computer scanners .
Spammers have also figured out ways to elude another common antispam technique : identifying and blocking multiple copies of the same message .
Pioneering antispam companies like the San Francisco - based Brightmail , which was bought two years ago year by the software giant Symantec , achieved early victories against spam by recognizing unwanted e-mail as soon as it hit the Internet , noting its “ fingerprint ” and stopping every subsequent copy .
Spammers have defied that technique by writing software that automatically changes a few pixels in each image .
“ Imagine an archvillain who has a new thumbprint every time he puts his thumb down , ” said Patrick Peterson , vice president for technology at Ironport .
“ They have taken away so many of the hooks we can use to look for spam . ”
But do n’t spammers still have to link to the incriminating Web sites where they sell their disreputable wares ?
Well , not anymore .
Many of the messages in the latest spam wave promote penny stocks — part of a scheme that antispam researchers call the “ pump and dump . ”
Spammers buy the inexpensive stock of an obscure company and send out messages hyping it .
They sell their shares when the gullible masses respond and snap up the stock .
No links to Web sites are needed in the messages .
Ken Chew also presented data indicating global remaining discovered proved plus probable ( 2P ) liquid resources of some 1,250 billion barrels .
This implies global proved liquid reserves ( 1P ) of around 950 billion barrels ( based on an assumption that 1P is approximately 75 % of 2P ) .
This is substantially lower than estimates provided by BP , Oil & Gas Journal and World Oil .
At the Oil Depletion conference ( hosted by the Energy Institute ) held in London on 7th November , Dr Kenneth Chew , a Vice President of IHS Energy reported proved and probable reserves ( 2P ) for Kuwait of around 52 billion barrels ( read from chart ) .
This is approximately 51 % of the proved reserves reported in the BP statistical review that stand at 101.5 billion barrels .
This tends to support recent reports of Kuwaiti reserves being substantially overstated .
This report is built around a presentation ( link live until 28th Nov. 2006 ) made by Ken Chew , at the Oil Depletion conference held in London on 7th November and subsequent correspondence I have had with him .
I would like to acknowledge that Ken has been very helpful in clarifying background information to his talk .
IHS Energy own Cambridge Energy Research Associates ( CERA ) who are also leading commentators on global energy issues .
Why are Kuwaiti and Middle East ( ME ) oil reserve estimates important ?
The simple answer is that one point of view is that all ME OPEC reserves are incorrectly booked and are in fact grossly " inflated " .
The IHS energy data presented by Ken Chew suggests Kuwaiti and world oil reserves are significantly lower than otherwise reported in the public domain .
The IHS database is one of the more widely used sources of world oil information therefore the whole world should take note .
Let 's start with a look at how reserves are booked and evidence for anomalous reserves booking by ME OPEC countries .
Reserves - definitions and determination
Oil reserves ( pdf ) are booked according to the confidence level in their existence .
In very general terms :
Proved / proven ( 1P ) need to be proven by drilling wells , with a limited amount of extrapolation allowed away from the well bore .
Probable reserves ( 2P ) include 1P plus additional reserves that can be estimated on the basis of reasonable extrapolation further away from the well bore based on , for example , seismic , well test , pressure and a range of geological and engineering inputs .
Possible reserves ( 3P ) include 1P plus 2P but may also include speculative additions that may be added by future drilling .
In order to prove oil reserves it is necessary to drill wells .
Finding oil is not enough to prove reserves and a wide variety of geological and engineering data is normally collected before , during and after a well is drilled in order to estimate the amount of oil that may eventually be produced .
This data may include :
Seismic - used to determine the oil trap / structure volume
Wire line well logs - used to determine the proportion of reservoir to non-reservoir in the trap , the porosity of the rocks , water / oil / gas saturation levels etc .
Core analysis - used to further assess the porosity and permeability of the reservoir
Special core analysis - used to determine the wetability of the reservoir and further evaluate the water / oil / gas saturation levels .
PVT data - ( pressure - volume - temperature ) .
This is vital to determine phase relationships of the hydrocarbons in relation to depressurisation during production .
Geochemistry and physical properties of oil gas and water - gravity , viscosity , composition .
Required for designing production facilities and refining .
Well test data - further test of porosity , permeability , connectivity and volume of the reservoir .
This list is not exhaustive , but serves to illustrate the type of reservoir engineering , petrophysical and geological input that is required to prove oil reserves .
Proved oil reserves may be used to present an investment case to a bank , may greatly add to the market capitalisation of any company and they may underpin national economies .
A general feature of reserves estimates is that they are revised as more information about individual fields or a country 's resources become available .
Furthermore , once production begins , produced oil has to be deducted from reserves and any new discoveries may be added .
So on a corporate or national level reserves should be adjusted annually as follows :
Proved reserves at start of year Less annual production
Plus or minus revisions
Plus new discoveries
Gives proved reserves at end of year
Finally oil price may impact reserves estimates as this may affect whether or not discovered oil and gas resources may be commercially exploited .
The ebb and flow of how all these factors have influenced the booked 1P reserves for the UK are illustrated below .
Figure 1 . The history of UK proven reserves 1980 to 2005 .

The ME OPEC Reserves Anomalies
Based on published data , the ME OPEC countries contain more than 50 % of the World 's remaining producible oil reserves .
Understanding the reliability of these reserves estimates is therefore vital to the future of the oil driven growth in the World Economy .
It is then amazing to consider that the reliability of estimates for the size of this vital resource is the subject of considerable controversy and debate covered by amongst others Stuart Staniford in earlier TOD articles .
The anomalous nature of ME OPEC reserves , illustrated below for Kuwait ( Figure 2 ) , can be summarised as follows :
1. Reserves were uplifted by 38 % in 1984 .
This does not relate to any verifiable new field discoveries .
If Kuwait was the only country to have done this it might be excused as rectifying a past mistake .
But in the period 1984 to 1987 all of the ME OPEC countries uplifted reserves by large amounts in this period ( Figure 3 ) .
For example , the UAE increased their oil reserves by 295 % in 1986 .
One view of these anomalous revisions is that they are related to OPEC quota negotiations and are not founded on geological or engineering data .
2. Following this arbitrary uplift , reserves have more or less remained unchanged .
Most significantly , no deductions have been made for production for around 20 years .
Figure 2 " Proven reserves " history for Kuwait .
Source BP statistical review .
The Petroleum Intelligence Weekly ( PIW ) estimate is reported here and the IHS Energy data are discussed below .
Figure 3 . The Big 5 ME OPEC producers all show a similar history to Kuwait , with large arbitrary uplift in reserves during the 1980s , followed by " flat line " reserves histories lacking evidence for depletion , though additions are evident in Iran and Iraq .
It is my opinion that these two anomalous features wholly invalidate the reserves booking process .
That is not to say the booked reserves are wrong - there is always the remote possibility that they are correct by chance .
But this is not science and does not comply with any notion of reliable accounting that would normally be accepted within the OECD .
The fact that reputable organisations like BP report these spurious reserves figures as " Proved Reserves " in their annual statistical review has tended to lend respectability to the data that are accepted as fact by many observers .
In particular , national governments that may want to deny that world oil reserves are depleting can point at BP as a reputable source .
The reliability of ME OPEC reserves , however , is now in the public eye , and national governments are at least pressing for more transparency in resource reporting .
A View of Kuwait and ME OPEC reserves based on the IHS data
Ken Chew 's presntation at the Oil Depletion conference had 37 slides crammed full of data in 30 minutes , making it difficult to absorb all that was said although all the slides were made available in a handout and a few examples are reproduced below , and these are now available on line for a limited period ( link live until 28th Nov. 2006 ) .
Ken Chew , email correspondence 10 Nov. 2006 :
The whole point of my talk is that we ( IHS ) report 2P versus 1P ( and also liquids versus oil ) .
I do n't need to mention 2P on every slide .
At the outset it is important to make clear that IHS data provide for a Low - end Estimate and a High - end estimate for global reserves as detailed below :
World liquids resources - the low - end estimate ( 2P )
Worldwide liquids discovered 2,328 billion barrels
Worldwide cumulative production 1,077 billion barrels
Worldwide remaining liquids 1,251 billion barrels
Worldwide liquids depletion 46.3 %
World liquids resources - the high - end estimate ( excluding tar sands and extra heavy oil )
Worldwide liquids discovered 3,390 billion barrels
Worldwide cumulative production 1,077 billion barrels
Worldwide remaining liquids 2,315 billion barrels
Worldwide liquids depletion 31.8 %
My own opinion on the high - end estimates is that it is a gross exaggeration of what is likely to ever be recovered .
One reason for stating this view is that to reach such high volumes would require development of a myriad of small accumulations in hostile environments ( unless some major oil provinces have been overlooked thus far ) and net energy arguments combined with lower cost alternatives that will likely become available in the medium term will mean that such a huge resource will never be extracted .
Email correspondence ( dated 10 November 2006 ) asked specifically that the following data be posted on The Oil Drum ( the data refer to ME reserves ) :
Here are the numbers used in the graph that compares BP Stats Review and others with IHS ( billions of barrels ) .
IHS Energy Proved plus Probable All Liquids 678.5
BP Statistical Review Proved Oil 742.7
Oil and Gas Journal Proved Oil 743.7
World Oil Proved Oil 711.9
The IHS proved plus probable all liquids number , which includes things like the condensate reserves of the North Field and South Pars , is 64 billion barrels less than the BP Stats Review proved oil - only number .
For companies that report both 1P and 2P we find that 2P is generally one - third more again than 1P .
Applied to the ME that would bring the IHS all liquids number down to about 510 billion barrels proved .
The following slide for Kuwaiti oil reserves was presented :
Figure 4 . IHS Energy estmate for 2P Kuwaiti reserves .
And speaking to this slide , Ken Chew said :
So this is one of the reasons why it is important to do a field - by - field analysis because it does highlight the politicisation if you like of resource or reserve reporting .
A second example shows to me the benefit of back dating in fact because this is what we have for Kuwait .
This is the OPEC Kuwait crude reserve estimate , this is the IHS energy remaining resource estimate based on the fields with all the resource back dated to fields date of discovery and then the cumulative production subtracted and you 'll see actually that there are periods where the ??
are almost parallel and if we separate the divided zone from Kuwait it would just push to about here .
There would be a complete coincidence between what we think is the situation in Kuwait and what Kuwait would support up until this point in time , from which point onwards we have a huge divergence and this again follows the point at which more or less all of the major OPEC producers suddenly boosted their alleged reserves .
So that 's the second benefit of using backdating .
The official Kuwaiti data are only proven reserves ( 1P ) and Ken Chew made clear that his estimate was for 2P reserves .
The rule of thumb for converting 1P = 2P * 0.75 , however , this was added in a later email ( 10 November 2006 ) :
That one - third on top for " probable " is a ball park figure that I find to be a useful rule of thumb for western companies in their reserves reporting .
I have no idea if it will apply in the specific case of Kuwait or Saudi Arabia but I believe that it could be a useful guide for the Middle East as a whole .
On this basis , Ken Chew was reluctant to concede that Kuwaiti 1P reserves would be around 75 % of the 2P reserves indicated on the chart .
Looking at the chart for Kuwaiti reserves and considering what was said , one might expect to see a dramatic difference between the IHS data ME OPEC / global reserves figures , and the likes of the bp statistical review , who still accept " inflated ' ME OPEC reserves figures without question .
In fact , Ken Chew went to some length to illustrate the weaknesses of The Oil and Gas Journal data .
It was alleged this data was not up - dated every year .
For example , he claimed that 39 estimates ( 40 % ) in the Oil and Gas Journal had not changed for the last five years .
And so given the fact that inflation of Kuwaiti reserves ( " political " ) has been recognised and weaknesses in the Oil and Gas Journal data have been highlighted you might expect to see a dramatic difference between the IHS data estimates and the rest of the pack .
Unfortunately the picture is not that simple .
The comparison between IHS data , BP , O&G Journal and World Oil is shown below .
Figure 5 . Comparison of IHS Energy data with other sources , and this is where care is required .
The BP , Oil and Gas Journal and World OIL estimates are all proved reserves ( 1P ) .
IHS Energy data is proved + probable ( 2P ) except for North America which is 1P
At first glance it seems that nothing much has changed .
But then you have to realise that IHS are quoting proved and probable ( 2P ) , except for N America where they show 1P , whilst the other sources are proved only ( 1P ) .
Personally I find this presentation a bit confusing and I have therefore reproduced the gross figures shown in Figure 5 , rebased as 1P in Figure 6 .
Figure 6 .
The data shown in Figure 5 rebased as proved reserves using 1P = 2P * 0.75
Clarification of IHS 1P and 2P
ME OPEC countries are reported to view their oil and gas reserves figures as State secrets and so I was wondering how IHS Energy manage to acquire the geological and engineering data to distinguish between 1P from 2P and this was Ken Chew 's response ( dated 10 th November 2006 ) :
I indicated in the presentation , we construct our estimates by summing individual fields .
So our Middle East number is the composite of 1,156 different fields that contain a liquids estimate of some sort and for each of which we report the best available information .
Sometimes that means reporting Ministry or NOC data if nothing more authoritative is available .
In subsequent correspondence it was also indicated that the IHS data base is used widely on a commercial basis by companies , who in the absence of any other data , appreciate getting ball park numbers that are fit for purpose in their decision making process .
It is therefore important to recognise that the exercise of using this data to construct a view of Global oil resources is somewhat an academic exercise .
Data that is fit for one purpose may not necessarily be fit for another - but it is an interesting academic exercise none the less .
The 1P versus 2P definition applied to IHS data in the case of ME OPEC reserves is not comparable to the 1P versus 2P definitions as it may be applied or understood in the OECD .
A cautionary note comparing 1P reserves with URR
Many readers of The Oil Drum are familiar with the Hubbert Linearisation ( HL ) technique which , based on historic production figures , provides a " top down " estimate of ultimate recoverable reserves ( URR ) .
Proven oil reserves ( 1P ) are a much more conservative estimate and should be significantly lower than URR .
This recent HL for World all liquids from Jean Laherrere shows that recent production increases have led to a possible extension of URR .
My own view here , this in part reflects un-used capacity in the ME getting switched on in 2002 .
These were existing reserves " not seen " by production to that date .
My guess is reality will likely lie somewhere between the 2250 and 3000 billion barrel intercepts .
Figure 7 . A recent Hubbert Linearisation for World all Liquids from John Laherrere .
The IHS data 1P + production to date gives 2062 billion barrels
The IHS data 2P + production to date gives 2328 billion barrels
The IHS data high end is 3,390 billion barrels
I find it interesting to note that Ken Chew 's estimates of 1P and 2P made from the IHS data fall right in the range of the HL - accepting that 1P is over conservative .
Summary
IHS Energy data indicate proved plus probable Kuwaiti reserves to be around 52 billion barrels ( read from chart ) .
The proved only reserves figure will be significantly lower .
IHS Energy data suggest proved global oil reserves of the order 950 billion barrels and this is significantly lower than estimates quoted by BP , The Oil & Gas Journal and World Oil .
Contributors note : Ken Chew has gone out of his way to be helpful in the compilation of this report .
He has also indicated that he finds some comments published on the Internet to be somewhat defamatory .
So I would respectfully ask all posters to try and stick to objective facts , observations and argument and to refrain altogether from expressing personalised points of view .
One final comment , Ken Chew has asked me to point out that the opinions presented in his talk and in email correspondence are his own interpretations of IHS Energy data and do not necesarrily reflect the views of IHS Energy .

We had here recently shots of Moscow city at night by Letchik Leha , the guy who works as a pilot on a big civil airplane and is fond of making photos right from the plane ’s cockpit .
Today some other shots from him .
There is Eiffel tower in Paris , probably the most famous tower in the world .
But for most of people living in Soviet Union there was another tower that they knew even better than Eiffel ’s one .
It was a Moscow city Ostankino Tower .
Standing 1772 feet ( 540 metres ) tall , it was the tallest free - standing structure in the whole world until in 2003 there was build another one , taller , in Canada .
Still it is the tallest alone standing structure in Europe and Asia .

Bush 's Enron Lies By Robert Parry
May 26 , 2006 F our years ago , when the taboo against calling George W. Bush a liar was even stronger than it is today , the national news media bought into the Bush administrations spin that the President did nothing to bail out his Enron benefactors , including Kenneth Lay .
Bush supposedly refused to intervene , despite the hundreds of thousands of dollars that Enron had poured into his political coffers .
That refusal purportedly showed the high ethical standards that set Bush apart from lesser politicians .
Bushs defenders will probably reprise that storyline now that former Enron Chairman Lay and former Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Skilling stand convicted of conspiracy and fraud in the plundering of the onetime energy - trading giant .
But the reality is that the Bush - cant - be - bought spin was never true .
For instance , the documentary evidence is now clear that in summer 2001  at the same time Bushs National Security Council was ignoring warnings about an impending al - Qaeda terrorist attack  NSC adviser Condoleezza Rice was personally overseeing a government - wide task force to pressure India to give Enron as much as $ 2.3 billion .
Then , even after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , when Indias cooperation in the war on terror was crucial , the Bush administration kept up its full - court press to get India to pay Enron for a white - elephant power plant that the company had built in Dabhol , India .
The pressure on India went up the chain of command to Vice President Dick Cheney , who personally pushed Enrons case , and to Bush himself , who planned to lodge a complaint with Indias prime minister .
Post - 9/11 , one senior U.S. bureaucrat warned India that failure to give in to Enron 's demands would put into doubt the future functioning of American agencies in India .
The NSC - led Dabhol campaign didnt end until Nov. 8 , 2001 , when the Securities and Exchange Commission raided Enrons offices  and protection of Lays interests stopped being politically tenable .
That afternoon , Bush was sent an e-mail advising him not to raise his planned Dabhol protest with Indias prime minister who was visiting Washington .
[ For details on the Dabhol case , see below . ]
Contrary to the official story , the Bush administration did almost whatever it could to help Enron as the company desperately sought cash to cover mounting losses from its off - the - books partnerships , a bookkeeping black hole that was sucking Enron toward bankruptcy and scandal .
As Enrons crisis worsened through the first nine months of Bushs presidency , Lay secured Bushs help in three key ways : -- Bush personally joined the fight against imposing caps on the soaring price of electricity in California at a time when Enron was artificially driving up the price of electricity by manipulating supply .
Bushs resistance to price caps bought Enron extra time to gouge hundreds of millions of dollars from Californias consumers .
-- Bush granted Lay broad influence over the development of the administrations energy policies , including the choice of key regulators to oversee Enrons businesses .
The chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was replaced in 2001 after he began to delve into Enrons complex derivative - financing schemes .
-- Bush had his NSC staff organize that administration - wide task force to pressure India to accommodate Enrons interests in selling the Dabhol generating plant for as much as $ 2.3 billion .
Bankruptcy
As Enrons corporate house of cards collapsed anyway in fall 2001 , the toll was devastating .
Investors lost tens of billions of dollars ; some retirees were financially wiped out ; 5,000 Enron employees were laid off .
Enrons accounting tricks also discredited its accounting firm , Arthur Andersen LLP , which was soon closed by government regulators .
But Bush was fortunate that the Enron scandal broke while he was still wrapped in the glow of favorable poll ratings that followed the 9/11 attacks .
The Washington news media generally acquiesced to Bushs insistence that he really wasnt that close to Enron or Lay , though Lay had earned a Bush nickname :  Kenny Boy . 
The facts , however , suggest a political intimacy between Bush and Enron , especially with the now convicted swindler Ken Lay , dating back at least to Bush 's first campaign for Texas governor in 1994 .
By the 2000 presidential campaign , Lay was a Pioneer for Bush , raising $ 100,000 .
Enron also gave the Republicans $ 250,000 for the convention in Philadelphia and contributed $ 1.1 million in soft money to the Republican Party .
Not only was Lay a top fund - raiser for the campaign , but he helped out during the recount battle in Florida in November 2000 .
Lay and his wife donated $ 10,000 to Bushs Florida recount fund that helped pay for Republican lawyers and other expenses .
Lay even let Bush operatives use Enrons corporate jet to fly in reinforcements .
After Bush secured his victory , another $ 300,000 poured in from Enron circles  including $ 100,000 from Lay and $ 100,000 from Skilling  for the Bush - Cheney Inaugural Fund .
Yet , after the Enron scandal broke , Bush acted as if he barely knew Lay .
On Jan. 11 , 2002 , Bush told reporters that Lay was a supporter of Ann Richards in my run in 1994  for Texas governor , implying that he had gotten to know Lay as Gov. Richards  holdover appointee to a Texas business council .
The administration also claimed that it turned down Enrons bail - out pleas in late October 2001 when Lay sounded out senior Bush officials about overt financial help .
By then , however , Enrons troubles were too advanced  and the public spotlight too intense  for the administration to launch a full - scale rescue mission out in the open .
Yet , before Enron went into its death spiral , the Bush administration did what it could , behind the scenes .
Gathering Storm
The Houston - based energy traders financial crisis can be traced back to 2000 when the long - running stock market boom ended .
During the boom , Enron had risen through the ranks of Fortune 500 companies to a perch at No. 7 . A leader of the so - called New Economy , Enron expanded beyond its core business interests in natural gas pipelines , branching out into complex commodity trading , which included electricity , broadband capacity and other ethereal items , such as weather futures .
The bursting of the dot - com bubble in March 2000 put pressure on Enron as it did many other companies .
Even though Enrons stock held strong , hitting an all - time high of $ 90 a share on Aug. 17 , 2000 , the tumbling market and some risky overseas energy projects left Enron with many poor - performing assets .
To protect its image as a darling of Wall Street  and to prop up its stock value 
Enron began shifting more of its losing operations into off - the - books partnerships given names like Raptor and Chewco .
Hedges were set up to limit Enrons potential losses from equity investments , but some hedges were themselves backed by Enron stock , creating the possibility of a spiraling decline if investors lost faith in Enron .
Still , Enron saw a silver lining in the darkening economic clouds of 2000 .
A prospective George W. Bush victory could speed up Enrons deregulatory plans for the energy markets .
Through energy trading in California alone , Enron stood to earn tens of billions of dollars .
Meanwhile , in summer 2000 , the first signs of suspicions arose that Enron was trying to manipulate the California energy market .
An employee with Southern California Edison sent the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ( FERC ) a memo expressing concerns that Enron and other electricity providers to Californias deregulated energy market were gaming the system by cutting off supply and creating phony congestion in the electricity grid to run up energy prices .
[ See Energy Daily , May 16 , 2002 ]
By December 2000 , Enron was implementing plans dubbed  Fat Boy ,   Death Star and  Get Shorty  to siphon electricity away from areas that needed it most and getting paid for phantom transfers of energy supposedly to relieve transmission - line congestion .
[ Washington Post , May 7 , 2002 ]
That same month , after a 35 - day battle over Florida 's vote count , Bush nailed down his presidential victory by getting five Republicans on the U.S. Supreme Court to stop a statewide recount .
Grateful Bush Once in the White House , a grateful Bush gave Lay a major voice in shaping energy policy and picking personnel .
Starting in late February 2001 , Lay and other Enron officials took part in at least a half dozen secret meetings to develop Bushs energy plan .
After one of the Enron meetings , Vice President Cheney 's energy task force changed a draft energy proposal to include a provision to boost oil and natural gas production in India .
The amendment was so narrow that it apparently was targeted only to help Enrons troubled Dabhol power plant in India .
[ Washington Post , Jan. 26 , 2002 ]
Other parts of the Bush energy plan also echoed Enrons views .
Seventeen of the energy plans proposals were sought by and benefited Enron , according to Rep. Henry Waxman , D - Calif .
One proposal called for repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 , which hindered Enrons potential for acquisitions .
Bush also put Enrons allies inside the federal government .
Two top administration officials , Lawrence Lindsey , the White Houses chief economic adviser , and Robert Zoellick , the U.S. Trade Representative , both worked for Enron , Lindsey as a consultant and Zoellick as a paid member of Enron 's advisory board .
At least 14 administration officials owned stock in Enron , with Undersecretary of State Charlotte Beers and chief political adviser Karl Rove each reporting up to $ 250,000 worth of Enron stock when they joined the administration .
Lay exerted influence , too , over government regulators already in place .
Curtis Hebert Jr. , a conservative Republican and ally of Sen. Trent Lott , R - Miss. , had been appointed to the FERC during the Clinton administration .
Like Bush and Lay , Hebert was a promoter of  free markets ,  and Bush elevated him to FERC chairman in January 2001 .
But Hebert ran into trouble when he broke ranks with Lay on Enrons plan to force consolidation of state utilities into four giant regional transmission organizations , or RTOs .
By quickly pushing the states into RTOs , Enron and other big energy traders would have much larger markets for their energy sales .
Hebert , who advocated state rights , told the New York Times that he got a call from Lay with a proposed deal .
Lay wanted Hebert to support a faster transition to a national retailing structure for electricity .
If he did , Enron would back him to keep his job .
The FERC chairman said he was offended  by the veiled threat .
Lay already had demonstrated sway over selection of administration appointees by supplying Bush aides with a list of preferred candidates and personally interviewing a possible FERC nominee .
Lay offered a different account of the phone call .
He said Hebert was the one requesting 
Enron 's support , though Lay acknowledged that the pair very possibly  discussed issues involving FERC 's authority over the nations electricity grids .
Hebert also raised Enrons ire when he started an investigation in early 2001 into how Enrons complex derivative financing instruments worked .
 One of our problems is that we do not have the expertise to truly unravel the complex arbitrage activities of a company like Enron ,  Hebert said .
[ NYT , May 25 , 2001 ]
At the time , those complex  and deceptive  derivative schemes were concealing Enrons worsening losses .
Energy Crisis
The California energy crisis also was spinning out of control .
Rolling blackouts crisscrossed the state , where the partially deregulated energy market , served by Enron and other traders , had seen electricity prices soar 800 percent in one year .
After taking power , Bush turned a deaf ear to appeals from public officials in California to give the state relief from the soaring costs of energy .
He also reined in federal efforts to monitor market manipulations .
As Californias electricity prices continued to soar , Democratic Gov. Gray Davis and Sen. Dianne Feinstein voiced suspicions that the free market was not at work .
Rather they saw corporate price - fixing , gouging consumers and endangering Californias economy .
But Californias suspicions mostly were mocked in official Washington as examples of finger - pointing and conspiracy theories .
The administration blamed the problem on excessive environmental regulation that discouraged the building of new power plants .
Again , Lay was influencing policy behind the scenes .
An April 2001 memo from Lay to Cheney advised the administration to resist price caps .
 The administration should reject any attempt to re-regulate wholesale power markets by adopting price caps or returning to archaic methods of determining the cost - base of wholesale power ,  Lay said .
[ San Francisco Chronicle , Jan. 30 , 2002 ] Cheney and Bush echoed Lays position in their political exchanges with Davis and other Democrats .
On April 18 , 2001 , Cheney told the Los Angeles Times that the Bush administration opposed price caps because they would discourage investment .
[ L.A. Times , April 19 , 2001 ]
In May 2001 , Bush traveled to California on a trip choreographed like a President visiting a disaster area .
Only this time , Bush wasnt promising federal help to a state in need .
He was carrying the same message that Lay had sent to Cheney .
In effect , Bush was saying : Read my lips .
No price caps .
 Price caps do nothing to reduce demand , and they do nothing to increase supply ,  Bush said .
[ L.A. Times , May 30 , 2001 ]
After weeks of standoff , as electricity prices stayed high and began spreading to other Western states , the political showdown ended on June 18 , 2001 .
FERC approved limited price caps , a reversal prompted by Republican fears of a political backlash that could cost them seats in Congress .
[ L.A. Times , June 19 , 2001 ]
Still , the administrations rear - guard defense of deregulation had bought Enron and other energy traders precious months to reap hundreds of millions of dollars in trading profits in California .
The imposition of FERCs limited price caps  and the states aggressive conservation efforts  brought the energy crisis under control .
That may have been good news for California , but not for Enron .
By losing control over its ability to keep electricity prices artificially high , Enron faced new economic pressures .
 There are some hints of a connection [ between the price caps and Enrons collapse ] , including the billions of dollars in cash that flowed in and out of Enron as the crisis waxed and waned ,  the New York Times reported later .
[ NYT , May 9 , 2002 ]
With the easing of the California energy crisis , Enrons stock price began to decline , slipping from around $ 80 early in the year to the high - $ 40s .
That began to put pressure on the stock hedges tucked inside the off - the - books partnerships .
The Dabhol Battle In June 2001 , the White House went to bat for Enron on another touchy issue , the natural gas power plant that Enron had built in Dabhol , India .
The plant had become something of a white elephant .
Its cost of electricity was several times higher than what India was paying other providers , which led to an impasse over unpaid bills .
Enron wanted India to pay $ 250 million for the electricity or buy out Enrons stake in the plant , worth about $ 2.3 billion .
These sorts of contract disputes between U.S. companies and foreign governments are normally handled by the Commerce Department or possibly the State Department .
But Enrons Dabhol problem became a priority of Bushs National Security Council staff .
That level of interest over a contract dispute was almost unprecedented , according to former NSC officials from both Republican and Democratic administrations .
The administrations intervention even involved direct appeals from top U.S. officials .
On June 27 , 2001 , Cheney personally discussed Enrons problem with Sonia Gandhi , the leader of Indias opposition Congress Party .
 Good news is that the Veep mentioned Enron in his meeting with Sonia Gandhi yesterday ,  said one NSC e-mail dated June 28 , 2001 .
( I obtained this and other documents under a Freedom of Information Act request . )
Throughout summer 2001 , while intelligence warnings about an expected al - Qaeda terror attack went unheeded , the NSC staff met frequently to coordinate U.S. pressure on India over Enron 's plant , drawing in the State Department , the Treasury Department , the Office of U.S. Trade Representative and the Overseas Private Investment Corp. , which had committed $ 360 million in risk insurance to the Dabhol project .
While the NSC held no follow - up meetings on the Aug. 6 , 2001 , intelligence warning entitled  Bin Laden Determined To Strike in U.S. ,  national security adviser Condoleezza Rice organized and led the  Dabhol Working Group . 
The working group sought to broker meetings between Lay and senior Indian officials , including Brajesh Mishra , the national security adviser to Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee .
During a trip to India , a senior State Department official delivered a demarche or official warning to the Indian government , but New Delhi still resisted the U.S. pressure .
Also in the summer of 2001 , Enron was consolidating its influence at FERC .
Nora Mead Brownell , a controversial member of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission , was named as a new FERC commissioner .
In support of Brownells appointment , Lay called White House aide Karl Rove to say that Brownell was a strong force in getting the right outcome in deregulating Pennsylvanias energy market , according to a July , 17 , 2001 , letter by Rep. Waxman to the White House counsel .
Then , in August 2001 , FERC Chairman Hebert , who had gone along with the California price caps and had ordered the inquiry into Enrons arbitrage schemes , abruptly resigned only six months into his four - year term .
He clearly was forced out , explaining lamely that he desired  to seek other opportunities . 
Bush replaced Hebert with former Texas Public Utilities commissioner Pat Wood III .
Lay had included Wood and Brownell on a list of his preferred FERC candidates .
[ AP , Jan. 31 , 2002 ]
Accounting Scandal
As Lay was flexing his political muscle in Washington , out of public view back in Houston , Enrons accounting house of cards was shaking .
On Aug. 15 , 2001 , Sherron Watkins , an Enron vice president , warned Lay that accounting irregularities , including the hedges tied to Enron stock , were threatening to undo the corporation .
On Sept. 11 , however , the course of George W. Bushs presidency took a sharp turn , as Islamic terrorists seized four U.S. airliners , crashing two into the World Trade towers at the heart of the U.S. financial markets .
Another smashed into the Pentagon and the fourth crashed in Pennsylvania when passengers apparently battled for control .
Bush vowed to retaliate for the attacks by waging a war on terror ,  finally targeting Osama bin Laden and his protectors in Afghanistan , the Taliban government .
On the front lines of that new war were Pakistan and India , traditional enemies who were engaged in a brush war over the disputed territory of Kashmir .
Despite New Delhis importance in prosecuting the war on terror ,  Enrons Dabhol power plant remained at the center of U.S. relations with India .
On Sept. 28 , more than two weeks after the 9/11 attacks , the NSC - led Dabhol Working Group prepared talking points  about the Enron business dispute for Cheney to deliver in a meeting with Indias Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh .
On Oct. 7 , the U.S. - led invasion of Afghanistan began with aerial assaults against Taliban targets .
Two days later , on Oct. 9 , the State Department was again pressing Enrons case with the Indians .
Undersecretary Alan Larson raised the Dabhol issue with both FM Singh and NSA Mishra and got a commitment to try to get the government energized on this issue prior to the PMs visit to Washington in November , an Oct. 23 NSC e-mail said .
 Pls give me one / two bullets for the President to use during his meeting with Vajpayee . 
Meanwhile , Enrons financial situation was collapsing .
Its credit rating was cut and its stock was falling .
On Oct. 30 , 2001 , behind closed doors , SEC commissioners approved a formal investigation of Enrons accounting .
The NSCs Dabhol Working Group , however , continued to press for India to make concessions to Enron .
On Nov. 1 , the White House prepared a memo on Dabhol talking points that Bush could raise in his meeting with Prime Minister Vajpayee .
On Nov. 6 , OPIC President Peter Watson sent a stern warning to Vajpayees national security adviser Mishra .
 The acute lack of progress in this matter has forced Dabhol to rise to the highest levels of the United States government ,  Watson said in a letter .
The dispute could have a negative effect regarding other U.S. agencies and their ability to function in India . 
So , almost two months after 9/11 with the war against Afghanistan still being fought , the Bush administration was threatening India , a key regional power , with a pullout of U.S. agencies from India because it was refusing to meet Enrons demands for cash .
The Bush administrations pressure on India over Dabhol did not end until Nov. 8 , the day the SEC delivered subpoenas to Enron and the company announced that it was under formal SEC investigation .
That same day , on Nov. 8 at 2:33 p.m. , an internal administration e-mail warned that  President Bush can not talk about Dabhol in his meeting with Indias prime minister .
As Enron slid into scandal and bankruptcy , White House officials stressed that the administration had rebuffed a couple of last - minute overtures for a bail - out from Lay , including one to Treasury Secretary Paul ONeill .
Those rejections , administration spokesmen claimed , proved the mettle of Bushs integrity , not letting politics influence policy .
In early 2002 , when OPIC officials responded to a Freedom of Information Act request by releasing documents on the Dabhol Task Force , Bushs aides dismissed the significance of the evidence .
On Jan. 18 , 2002 , White House spokesman Ari Fleischer called the Dabhol effort not uncommon . 
But the available evidence makes clear that the Dabhol operation  like other energy - related initiatives  represented extraordinary efforts to save Enron .
Bush even put Enrons financial interests at the top of the administrations agenda with India , though it threatened to complicate relations with a key South Asian power after 9/11 .
The White House also appears to have taken to task OPIC officials who released the internal e-mails in a normal response to a Freedom of Information Act request .
When I sought more Enron documents under FOIA , a shaken OPIC bureaucrat told me that his agency had been perhaps too cooperative in releasing the earlier records .
All future Enron - related releases from the Bush administration amounted to boilerplate and documents that were already in the public domain .

Steve Friedl's Unixwiz.net Tech Tips An Illustrated Guide to IPsec
IPsec is a suite of protocols for securing network connections , but the details and many variations quickly become overwhelming .
This is particularly the case when trying to interoperate between disparate systems , causing more than one engineer to just mindlessly turn the knobs when attempting to bring up a new connection .
This Tech Tip means to give bottom - up coverage of the low - level protocols used in an IP v4 context ( we provide no coverage of IPv6 ) .
This is not a deployment guide or best - practices document — we 're looking at it strictly at the protocol level on up , rather than from the big picture on down .
NOTE : originally this was to be a pair of papers , with the second covering Key Exchange and the like , but it appears that this was not meant to be .
Sorry .
So many flavors ...
One of the first things that one notices when trying to set up IPsec is that there are so many knobs and settings : even a pair of entirely standards - conforming implementations sports a bewildering number of ways to impede a successful connection .
It 's just an astonishingly - complex suite of protocols .
One cause of the complexity is that IPsec provides mechanism , not policy : rather than define such - and - such encryption algorithm or a certain authentication function , it provides a framework that allows an implementation to provide nearly anything that both ends agree upon .
In this section , we 'll touch on some of the items in the form of a glossary , with a compare - and - contrast to show which terms relate to which other terms .
This is not even remotely complete .
AH versus ESP " Authentication Header " ( AH ) and " Encapsulating Security Payload " ( ESP ) are the two main wire - level protocols used by IPsec , and they authenticate ( AH ) and encrypt+authenticate ( ESP ) the data flowing over that connection .
They are typically used independently , though it 's possible ( but uncommon ) to use them both together .
Tunnel mode versus Transport mode Transport Mode provides a secure connection between two endpoints as it encapsulates IP 's payload , while Tunnel Mode encapsulates the entire IP packet to provide a virtual " secure hop " between two gateways .
The latter is used to form a traditional VPN , where the tunnel generally creates a secure tunnel across an untrusted Internet .
MD5 versus SHA - 1 versus DES versus 3DES versus AES versus blah blah blah Setting up an IPsec connection involves all kinds of crypto choices , but this is simplified substantially by the fact that any given connection can use at most two or ( rarely ) three at a time .
Authentication calculates an Integrity Check Value ( ICV ) over the packet 's contents , and it 's usually built on top of a cryptographic hash such as MD5 or SHA - 1 .
It incorporates a secret key known to both ends , and this allows the recipient to compute the ICV in the same way .
If the recipient gets the same value , the sender has effectively authenticated itself ( relying on the property that cryptographic hashes can't practically be reversed ) .
AH always provides authentication , and ESP does so optionally .
Encryption uses a secret key to encrypt the data before transmission , and this hides the actual contents of the packet from eavesdroppers .
There are quite a few choices for algorithms here , with DES , 3DES , Blowfish and AES being common .
Others are possible too .
IKE versus manual keys Since both sides of the conversation need to know the secret values used in hashing or encryption , there is the question of just how this data is exchanged .
Manual keys require manual entry of the secret values on both ends , presumably conveyed by some out - of - band mechanism , and IKE ( Internet Key Exchange ) is a sophisticated mechanism for doing this online .
Main mode versus aggressive mode
These modes control an efficiency - versus - security tradeoff during initial IKE key exchange .
" Main mode " requires six packets back and forth , but affords complete security during the establishment of an IPsec connection , while Aggressive mode uses half the exchanges providing a bit less security because some information is transmitted in cleartext .
We 'll certainly face more options as we unwrap IPsec .
The IP Datagram
Since we 're looking at IPsec from the bottom up , we must first take a brief detour to revisit the IP Header itself , which carries all of the traffic we 'll be considering .
Note that we are not trying to provide comprehensive coverage to the IP header — there are other excellent resources for that ( the best being TCP / IP Illustrated , vol 1 ) .
ver
This is the version of the protocol , which is now 4 =IP v4 hlen IP Header length , as a four - bit number of 32 - bit words ranging from 0..15 .
A standard IP v4 header is always 20 bytes long ( 5 words ) , and IP Options — if any — are indicated by a larger hlen field up to at most 60 bytes .
This header length never includes the size of payload or other headers that follow .
TOS Type of Service
This field is a bitmask that gives some clues as to the type of service this datagram should receive : optimize for bandwidth ?
Latency ?
Low cost ?
Reliability ?
pkt len Overall packet length in bytes , up to 65535 .
This count includes the bytes of the header , so this suggests that the maximum size of any payload is at least 20 bytes less .
The vast majority of IP datagrams are much , much smaller .
ID
The ID field is used to associate related packets that have been fragmented ( large packets broken up into smaller ones ) .
flgs
These are small flags that mainly control fragmentation : one marks the packet as ineligible for fragmentation , and the other says that more fragments follow .
frag offset
When a packet is fragmented , this shows where in the overall " virtual " packet this fragment belongs .
TTL
This is the Time to Live , and is decremented by each router that passes this packet .
When the value reaches zero , it suggests some kind of routing loop , so it 's discarded to prevent it from running around the Internet forever .
proto
This represents the protocol carried within this packet , and it 's going to be central to most of our discussions .
Though the datagram itself is IP , it always encapsulates a subsidiary protocol ( TCP , UDP , ICMP , etc. — see the chart below ) within .
It can be thought of as giving the type of the header that follows .
header cksum
This holds a checksum of the entire IP header , and it 's designed to detect errors in transit .
This is not a cryptographic checksum , and it does n't cover any part of the datagram that follow the IP header .
src IP address
The 32 - bit source IP address , which the recipient uses to reply to this datagram .
Generally speaking , it 's possible to spoof these addresses ( i.e. , lie about where the datagram is coming from ) .
dst IP address
The 32 - bit destination IP address , which is where the packet is intended to arrive .
IP Options
These are an optional part of the IP header that contains application - specific information , though they are not commonly used for routine traffic .
The presence of IP options is indicated by a hlen greater than 5 , and they ( if present ) are included in the header checksum .
Payload Each protocol type implies its own format for what follows the IP header , and we 've used TCP here just to show an example .
These proto codes are defined by IANA — the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority — and there are many more than would ever be used by any single installation , but most will ring a bell with a network - savvy technician .
These representative types are taken from the IANA website listing protocols :
Some IP protocol codes Protocol
code Protocol Description 1 ICMP — Internet Control Message Protocol 2 IGMP — Internet Group Management Protocol 4 IP within IP ( a kind of encapsulation ) 6 TCP — Transmission Control Protocol 17 UDP — User Datagram Protocol 41 IP v6 — next - generation TCP / IP 47 GRE — Generic Router Encapsulation ( used by PPTP ) 50 IPsec : ESP — Encapsulating Security Payload 51 IPsec : AH — Authentication Header
We 'll be studying the last two in detail .
AH : Authentication Only
AH is used to authenticate — but not encrypt — IP traffic , and this serves the treble purpose of ensuring that we 're really talking to who we think we are , detecting alteration of data while in transit , and ( optionally ) to guard against replay by attackers who capture data from the wire and attempt to re-inject that data back onto the wire at a later date .
Authentication is performed by computing a cryptographic hash - based message authentication code over nearly all the fields of the IP packet ( excluding those which might be modified in transit , such as TTL or the header checksum ) , and stores this in a newly - added AH header and sent to the other end .
This AH header contains just five interesting fields , and it's injected between the original IP header and the payload .
We 'll touch on each of the fields here , though their utility may not be fully apparent until we see how they 're used in the larger picture .
next hdr
This identifies the protocol type of the following payload , and it's the original packet type being encapsulated : this is how the IPsec header (s ) are linked together .
AH len
This defines the length , in 32 - bit words , of the whole AH header , minus two words ( this " minus two words " proviso springs from the format of IPv6's RFC 1883 Extension Headers , of which AH is one ) .
Reserved
This field is reserved for future use and must be zero .
Security Parameters Index
This is an opaque 32 - bit identifier that helps the recipient select which of possibly many ongoing conversations this packet applies .
Each AH - protected connection implies a hash algorithm ( MD5 , SHA - 1 , etc. ) , some kind of secret data , and a host of other parameters .
The SPI can be thought of as an index into a table of these settings , allowing for easy association of packet with parameter .
Sequence Number
This is a monotonically increasing identifier that 's used to assist in antireplay protection .
This value is included in the authentication data , so modifications ( intentional or otherwise ) are detected .
Authentication Data
This is the Integrity Check Value calculated over the entire packet — including most of the headers —
The recipient recomputes the same hash ; Mismatched values mark the packet as either damaged in transit , or not having the proper secret key .
These are discarded .
Transport Mode
The easiest mode to understand is Transport Mode , which is used to protect an end - to - end conversation between two hosts .
This protection is either authentication or encryption ( or both ) , but it is not a tunneling protocol .
It has nothing to do with a traditional VPN : it 's simply a secured IP connection .
In AH Transport Mode , the IP packet is modified only slightly to include the new AH header between the IP header and the protocol payload ( TCP , UDP , etc. ) , and there is a shuffling of the protocol code that links the various headers together .
This protocol shuffling is required to allow the original IP packet to be reconstituted at the other end : after the IPsec headers have been validated upon receipt , they 're stripped off , and the original protocol type ( TCP , UDP , etc. ) is stored back in the IP header .
We 'll see this chain of next header fields again and again as we examine IPsec .
When the packet arrives at its destination and passes the authentication check , the AH header is removed and the Proto=AH field in the IP header is replaced with the saved " Next Protocol " .
This puts the IP datagram back to its original state , and it can be delivered to the waiting process .
Tunnel Mode
Tunnel Mode forms the more familiar VPN functionality , where entire IP packets are encapsulated inside another and delivered to the destination .
Like Transport mode , the packet is sealed with an Integrity Check Value to authenticate the sender and to prevent modification in transit .
But unlike Transport mode , it encapsulates the full IP header as well as the payload , and this allows the source and destination addresses to be different from those of the encompassing packet :
This allows formation of a tunnel .
When a Tunnel - mode packet arrives at its destination , it goes through the same authentication check as any AH - type packet , and those passing the check have their entire IP and AH headers stripped off .
This effectively reconstitutes the original IP datagram , which is then injected into the usual routing process .
Most implementations treat the Tunnel - mode endpoint as a virtual network interface — just like an Ethernet interface or localhost — and the traffic entering or leaving it is subject to all the ordinary routing decisions .
The reconstituted packet could be delivered to the local machine or routed elsewhere ( according to the destination IP address found in the encapsulated packet ) , though in any case is no longer subject to the protections of IPsec .
At this point , it 's just a regular IP datagram .
Though Transport mode is used strictly to secure an end - to - end connection between two computers , Tunnel mode is more typically used between gateways ( routers , firewalls , or standalone VPN devices ) to provide a Virtual Private Network ( VPN ) .
Transport or Tunnel ?
Curiously , there is no explicit " Mode " field in IPsec : what distinguishes Transport mode from Tunnel mode is the next header field in the AH header .
When the next - header value is IP , it means that this packet encapsulates an entire IP datagram ( including the independent source and destination IP addresses that allow separate routing after de-encapsulation ) .
This is Tunnel mode .
Any other value ( TCP , UDP , ICMP , etc. ) means that it 's Transport mode and is securing an endpoint - to - endpoint connection .
The top - level of the IP datagram is structured the same way regardless of mode , and intermediate routers treat all flavors IPsec / AH traffic identically without deeper inspection .
We 'll note that a host — as opposed to a gateway — is required to support both Transport and Tunnel modes , but when creating a host - to - host connection , it seems a little superfluous to use Tunnel mode .
Furthermore , a gateway ( router , firewall , etc. ) is only required to support Tunnel mode , though supporting Transport mode is useful only when creating an endpoint to the gateway itself , as in the case of network management functions .
Authentication Algorithms
AH carries an Integrity Check Value in the Authentication Data portion of the header , and it 's typically ( but not always ) built on top of standard cryptographic hash algorithms such as MD5 or SHA - 1 .
Rather than use a straight checksum , which would provide no real security against intentional tampering , it uses a Hashed Message Authentication Code ( HMAC ) which incorporates a secret value while creating the ICV .
Though an attacker can easily recompute a hash , without the secret value he wo n't be able to recreate the proper ICV .
HMAC is described by RFC 2104 , and this illustration shows how the message data and secret contribute to the final Integrity Check Value :
We 'll note that IPsec / AH does n't define what the authentication function must be , it instead provides a framework which allows any reasonable implementation agreed to by both ends to use .
It 's possible to use other authentication functions , such as a digital signature or an encryption function as long as both sides provide for it .
AH and NAT — Not Gonna Happen
Though AH provides very strong protection of a packet 's contents because it covers everything that can be possibly considered immutable , this protection comes at a cost : AH is incompatible with NAT ( Network Address Translation ) .
NAT is used to map a range of private addresses ( say , 192.168.1.X ) to and from a ( usually ) smaller set of public address , thereby reducing the demand for routable , public IP space .
In this process , the IP header is actually modified on the fly by the NAT device to change the source and / or destination IP address .
When the appropriate source or header IP address is changed , it forces a recalculation of the header checksum .
This has to be done anyway , because the NAT device typically serves as one " hop " in the path from source to destination , and this requires the decrement of the TTL ( Time To Live ) field .
Because the TTL and header checksum fields are always modified in flight , AH knows to excludes them from coverage , but this does not apply to the IP addresses .
These are included in the Integrity Check Value , and any modification will cause the check to fail when verified by the recipient .
Because the ICV incorporates a secret key which is unknown by intermediate parties , the NAT router is not able to recompute the ICV .
This same difficulty also applies to PAT ( Port Address Translation ) , which maps multiple private IP addresses into a single external IP address .
Not only are the IP addresses modified on the fly , but the UDP and TCP port numbers ( and sometimes even to payload ) .
This requires much more intelligence on the part of the NAT device , and more extensive modifications to the whole IP datagram .
For this reason , AH — whether in Tunnel or Transport mode — is entirely incompatible with NAT , and it may only be employed when the source and destination networks are reachable without translation .
We 'll note that this particular difficulty does n't apply to ESP , as its authentication and encryption do not incorporate the IP header being modified by NAT .
Nevertheless , NAT does impose some challenges even on ESP .
NAT translates IP addresses on the fly — but it has to keep track of which connections are flowing through it so that replies can be properly associated with sources .
When using TCP or UDP , this is commonly done with port numbers ( whether rewritten on the fly or not ) , but IPsec provides no hook to allow this .
At first one might suspect the SPI , which appears to be a useful identifier , but because the SPI is different in both directions , the NAT device has no way to associate the returning packet with the outgoing connection .
Addressing this requires special facilities for NAT traversal , something not covered in this paper .
ESP — Encapsulating Security Payload
Adding encryption makes ESP a bit more complicated because the encapsulation surrounds the payload rather than precedes it as with AH : ESP includes header and trailer fields to support the encryption and optional authentication .
It also provides Tunnel and Transport modes which are used in by - now familiar ways .
The IPsec RFCs do n't insist upon any particular encryption algorithms , but we find DES , triple - DES , AES , and Blowfish in common use to shield the payload from prying eyes .
The algorithm used for a particular connection is specified by the Security Association ( covered in a later section ) , and this SA includes not only the algorithm , but the key used .
Unlike AH , which provides a small header before the payload , ESP surrounds the payload it 's protecting .
The Security Parameters Index and Sequence Number serve the same purpose as in AH , but we find padding , the next header , and the optional Authentication Data at the end , in the ESP Trailer .
It 's possible to use ESP without any actual encryption ( to use a NULL algorithm ) , which nonetheless structures the packet the same way .
This provides no confidentiality , and it only makes sense if combined with ESP authentication .
It 's pointless to use ESP without either encryption or authentication ( unless one is simply doing protocol testing ) .
Padding is provided to allow block - oriented encryption algorithms room for multiples of their blocksize , and the length of that padding is provided in the pad len field .
The next hdr field gives the type ( IP , TCP , UDP , etc. ) of the payload in the usual way , though it can be thought of as pointing " backwards " into the packet rather than forward as we 've seen in AH .
In addition to encryption , ESP can also optionally provide authentication , with the same HMAC as found in AH .
Unlike AH , however , this authentication is only for the ESP header and encrypted payload : it does not cover the full IP packet .
Surprisingly , this does not substantially weaken the security of the authentication , but it does provide some important benefits .
When an outsider examines an IP packet containing ESP data , it 's essentially impossible to make any real guesses about what 's inside save for the usual data found in the IP header ( particularly the source and destination IP addresses ) .
The attacker will certainly know that it 's ESP data — that 's also in the header — but the type of the payload is encrypted with the payload .
Even the presence or absence of Authentication Data can't be determined by looking at the packet itself ( this determination is made by using the Security Parameters Index to reference the preshared set of parameters and algorithms for this connection ) .
However , it should be noted that sometimes the envelope provides hints that the payload does not .
With more people sending VoIP inside ESP over the internet , the QoS taggings are in the outside header and is fairly obvious what traffic is VoIP signaling ( IP precedence 3 ) and what is RTP traffic ( IP precedence 5 ) .
It 's not a sure thing , but it might be enough of a clue to matter in some circumstances .
ESP in Transport Mode
As with AH , Transport Mode encapsulates just the datagram 's payload and is designed strictly for host - to - host communications .
The original IP header is left in place ( except for the shuffled Protocol field ) , and it means that — among other things — the source and destination IP addresses are unchanged .
ESP in Tunnel Mode
Our final look of standalone ESP is in Tunnel mode , which encapsulates an entire IP datagram inside the encrypted shell :
Providing an encrypted Tunnel Mode connection is getting very close to the traditional VPN that springs to mind when most of us think about IPsec , but we have to add authentication of one type or another to complete the picture : this is covered in the following section .
Unlike AH , where an onlooker can easily tell whether traffic is in Tunnel or Transport mode , this information is unavailable here : the fact that this is Tunnel mode ( via next =IP ) is part of the encrypted payload , and is simply not visible to one unable to decrypt the packet .
Putting it all together : Building a real VPN
With coverage of the Authenticating Header and Encapsulating Security Payload complete , we 're ready to enable both encryption and authentication to build a real VPN .
The whole purpose of a Virtual Private Network is to join two trusted networks across an untrusted intermediate network , as is by stringing a very long Ethernet cable between the two .
This is commonly used to connect branch offices with company headquarters , allowing all users to share sensitive resources without fear of interception .
Clearly , a secure VPN requires both authentication and encryption .
We know that ESP is the only way to provide encryption , but ESP and AH both can provide authentication : which one do we use ?
The obvious solution of wrapping ESP inside of AH is technically possible , but in practice is not commonly used because of AH 's limitations with respect to Network Address Translation .
By using AH+ESP , this tunnel could never successfully traverse a NAT 'ed device .
Instead , ESP + Auth is used in Tunnel mode to fully encapsulate the traffic on its way across an untrusted network , protected by both encryption and authentication in the same thing .
Traffic protected in this manner yields nearly no useful information to an interloper save for the fact that the two sites are connected by a VPN .
This information might help an attacker understand trust relationships , but nothing about the actual traffic itself is revealed .
Even the type of encapsulated protocol — TCP , UDP , or ICMP — is hidden from outsiders .
What 's particularly nice about this mode of operation is that the end - user hosts generally know nothing about the VPN or other security measures in place .
Since a VPN implemented by a gateway device treats the VPN as yet another interface , traffic destined for the other end is routed normally .
This packet - in - a - packet can actually be nested yet more levels : Host A and Host B can establish their own authenticated connection ( via AH ) , and have this routed over the VPN .
This would put an AH inner packet inside an enclosing ESP + Auth packet .
Update - it 's important to use authentication even if encryption is used , because encrypt-only implementations are subject to effective attack as described in the paper Cryptography in Theory and Practice : The Case of Encryption in IPsec ; see the Resources section for more information .
Touching on Other Matters
IPsec is a very complex suite of protocols , and this Tech Tip cannot possibly give proper justice to more than a small part of it .
In this section we 'll mention a few areas that beg for more coverage .
Security Associations and the SPI
It seems self - evident that if two endpoints or gateways are going to establish a secure connection , some kind of shared secret is required to seed the authentication function and / or key the encryption algorithm .
The matter of just how these are secrets are established is a substantial topic to be addressed elsewhere , and for the purposes of this discussion we shall just assume that the keys have magically landed where they belong .
When an IPsec datagram — either AH or ESP — arrives at an interface , just how does the interface know which set of parameters ( key , algorithm , and policies ) to use ?
Any host could have many ongoing conversations , each with a different set of keys and algorithms , and something must be able to direct this processing .
Unsure !
It 's been pointed out that the SADB only uses the protocol type and SPI to select an entry , not the partner IP address ; we simply do n't know .
This might depend on whether the association is configured with main mode or aggressive mode , but we welcome clarifications .
This is specified by the Security Association ( SA ) , a collection of connection - specific parameters , and each partner can have one or more Security Associations .
When a datagram arrives , three pieces of data are used to locate the correct SA inside the Security Associations Database ( SADB ) :
Partner IP address
IPsec Protocol ( ESP or AH )
Security Parameters Index
In many ways this triple can be likened to an IP socket , which is uniquely denoted by the remote IP address , protocol , and port number .
Security Associations are one way , so a two - way connection ( the typical case ) requires at least two .
Furthermore , each protocol ( ESP / AH ) has its own SA in each direction , so a full AH+ESP VPN requires four Security Associations .
These are all kept in the Security Associations Database .
A tremendous amount of information is kept in the SADB , and we can only touch on a few of them :
AH : authentication algorithm
AH : authentication secret
ESP : encryption algorithm
ESP : encryption secret key
ESP : authentication enabled yes / no
Many key - exchange parameters
Routing restrictions
IP filtering policy
Some implementations maintain the SPD ( Security Policy Database ) with command - line tools , others with a GUI , while others provide a web - based interface over the network .
The amount of detail maintained by any particular implementation depends on the facilities offered , as well as whether it 's operating in Host or Gateway mode ( or both ) .
Key Management
Finally , we briefly visit the very complex matter of key management .
This area includes several protocols and many options , and the bulk of this will be covered in a future paper .
This section is necessarily highly incomplete .
IPsec would be nearly useless without the cryptographic facilities of authentication and encryption , and these require the use of secret keys known to the participants but not to anyone else .
The most obvious and straightforward way to establish these secrets is via manual configuration : one party generates a set of secrets , and conveys them to all the partners .
All parties install these secrets in their appropriate Security Associations in the SPD .
But this process does not scale well , nor is it always terribly secure : the mere act of conveying the secrets to another site 's SPD may well expose them in transit .
In a larger installation with many devices using the same preshared key , compromise of that key makes for a very disruptive re-deployment of new keys .
IKE — Internet Key Exchange — exists to allow two endpoints to properly set up their Security Associations , including the secrets to be used .
IKE uses the ISAKMP ( Internet Security Association Key Management Protocol ) as a framework to support establishment of a security association compatible with both ends .
Multiple key - exchange protocols themselves are supported , with Oakley being the most widely used .
We 'll note that IPsec key exchange typically takes place over port 500 / udp .
Resources
The Internet has a great many resources surrounding IPsec , some better than others .
The starting point , of course , is always with the RFCs ( Requests for Comment ) that form the Internet standards defining the protocols .
These are the main reference works upon which all other documentation — including this one — is based .
Update :
In December 2005 , a whole new set of RFCs was issued by IETF , and the 43xx series largely obsoleted the 24xx series .
We included references to all the RFCs ( old and new ) below , though this document has not really been updated for the new ones .
N.B. —
We are not IPsec experts , and though we 've spent a great deal of time researching these matters , we may have some details wrong .
Feedback and corrections are very much welcome .
We 're particularly grateful for the extensive technical feedback provided by IPsec architects at Sun and Microsoft .

The Eventual Death of Developer Magazines
I enjoy predicting the death of companies .
Everybody needs a hobby .
I suppose mine is more cynical than some , so scratch me off the list of good role models for your kids .
I 'm pretty good at it , too .
Nine years of running a business has given me a certain amount of intuition about whether something is going to " make it " or not .
Heck , if I could get my accuracy rate a bit higher and improve my timing , I could make a business out of predicting the death of other businesses .
I 'm not sure exactly what the revenue model is , but it seems obvious that if I could accurately tell people if and when a company is going to fail , I could charge a lot of money for that service .
Unfortunately , I 'm not always right .
For example , a nearby restaurant has been defying my predictions for years .
I really like the place , but it 's basically always empty .
I can't imagine how they pay the rent .
On more than one occasion I have wondered if the place is a front for something illegal , but I 'm pretty sure my conjectures are not enough for anybody to get a search warrant .
Accuracy in my projections is hard .
Timing is much harder .
Even when it is obvious that a business will fail , it can be incredibly difficult to know just when it will happen .
Sometimes my guesses are pretty good , but in other cases , I 've missed by months or even years .
If the company does n't have much debt , it can cut costs and lay around on life support for an absurdly long time .
There 's a camera shop here in Champaign .
It 's doomed .
Nature has selected this kind of camera shop for extinction , but the owner of this particular store is fighting back .
The newspaper recently reported that he has laid off everyone but himself .
That will help keep his doors open , but it does n't help me at all .
Now I do n't know what date to choose for my prediction !
He could close up shop tomorrow or he could keep going for years .
It 's hard to tell .
New companies , old companies
Suppose my hobby were a game and we needed a way to keep score .
For correctly predicting the death of a specific company , you can get a maximum score of say 10 points .
But timing is critical , so you have to specify a date .
If you get the date pretty close , then you get the full 10 points .
If you miss , a penalty will be deducted .
The worse you miss , the fewer points you get .
The eventual rules of scoring will end up incredibly complicated .
For example , all else equal , public companies need to be worth a lot less than ones which are privately held .
Plus we need ways of resolving disputes over whether a company really died or not .
Here 's another scoring problem :
New businesses die quickly .
Old businesses die slowly .
Predicting the death of a new company is a relatively simple matter .
If they 're going to fail , they 're probably going to do it soon .
Many such businesses never develop a reasonable revenue model of any kind .
Others die in the chasm , taking all the money they can from the early adopters but never crossing over into the land of the pragmatists where all the big bucks are .
But old businesses are much trickier , and the timing can be nearly impossible .
After 150 years of operation , Western Union 's telegram business was shut down on 27 January 2006 .
It was n't too hard to see this coming , but how would I have gotten even close to the right date ?
So if new companies are worth 10 points , old companies should be worth maybe a 100 or so .
This is especially true now that we 've got dozens of ridiculous " Web 2.0 " companies sprouting up like crabgrass .
If I correctly predict the death of something really tricky like Sun Microsystems , while you correctly predict the death of five startups doing web calendaring , I should still have the higher score .
Developer magazines
One specific situation that has kept me stumped is figuring out exactly when the software development magazines are going to die .
I correctly resisted the temptation to predict their imminent death back when the Web was starting to become ubiquitous .
For a while it was fashionable to predict that the Web would eliminate publishing , or at least that it would eliminate magazine publishing .
Ten years later , most of these pubs are still around .
But there is obviously some truth here .
Today 's developer - focused magazines are looking very sickly indeed .
The health of a magazine is very closely correlated with its page count .
Note the following :
The March 2006 issue of Software Development ( CMP ) is 56 pages .
Recent issues of Visual Studio Magazine ( Fawcette ) have been either 56 or 64 pages .
After years of clinging to life at 48 pages , C/C++ User Journal ( CMP ) recently ceased publication .
Two days ago I stopped in at my local Borders bookstore and noticed that not one of these magazines was available for sale .
They carry hundreds of periodicals .
They have an entire shelf of magazines for scrapbookers .
They have niche titles like Biblical Archaeology Review .
But I could n't find a single pub which was focused at software developers .
What 's up with that ?
The unavoidable truth is that these magazines have largely ceased to be relevant .
More and more , software developers get their information on the Web , not from a magazine .
As just one example , compare the quality of the technical content in any developer magazine against Raymond Chen 's blog .
It 's not even close , and Chen 's blog is pure content , as opposed to " tidbits of content squeezed in between the ads " .
Speaking of ads , people are going to start noticing that SourceGear is currently not advertising in any developer magazine .
This is a big change for us .
I 'm pretty sure that at least one SourceGear magazine ad has been printed every month for the last 8 years .
Next month , there will be none .
When I show up at Tech - Ed in June , I will no doubt encounter several sales guys from these magazines .
Each of them will try to convince me that by choosing to stop advertising , I am giving their readers the impression that SourceGear is dying .
The irony seems very thick .
My company is not the one that is languishing here .
For the record , SourceGear is quite healthy .
We do n't share our financials , but 2005 was our best year ever , and 2006 is probably going to beat it .
It 's not that we can't afford the ads .
I 'm just tired of playing the game , so I 'm taking a break .
After Vault 4.0 comes out , maybe we 'll run some more ads to spread the word .
Or maybe we wo n't .
Vault 4.0 is still probably 6 - 9 months away .
All these magazines might be gone by then . :-)
OK , probably not .
Like I said , old businesses die slowly .
Developer magazines still have their place .
Their market is shrinking , but it 's not gone , and I would n't be surprised if these pubs are still hanging on five years from now .
But although I can't get the timing right , the signs are clear .
Developer magazines are dying .

A simple water droplet is beautiful , but when two drops collide , the varieties are endless and fascinating .
The shapes are affected by many things : the physical properties of the liquid , such as surface tension and viscosity , as well as the timing of the drops and when the camera 's shutter is opened and flash fired .
Being experiments in fluid dynamics , they reveal the chaotic nature of fluid flow - it can be quite reproducible sometimes , and other times highly sensitive to initial conditions .

A Little History
IA Ventures began life a little less than seven years ago , just as the world was coming out of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression .
The term “ Micro VC ” had yet to be coined .
“ Big Data ” was still somewhat mysterious and edgy to those outside Wall Street , Government and Defense .
Unicorns were mythical animals that pranced around meadows and were signs of good luck .
And there certainly were no discussions of colonizing Mars ( ! ) .
Upon reflection , 2009 seems almost a generation ago , but I guess that ’s what happens when life , fueled by stunning advances in technology , seems to move at warp speed .
But with all of these changes , a few basic principles still remain .
The greatest venture funds - and firms - in history started small .
They started investing very early in a company ’s life , owned a lot and continued investing over time .
In short , they identified great founders playing in large markets , took significant early risk , continued to lean in when risk / reward appeared attractive and ended up owning a lot for a * little * .
This is exactly the model we have followed at IA Ventures since Day 1 , and it was never more in evidence than in the seeding , bridging , growth investing and eventual IPO of one of our first investments .
The story of this journey and IA ’s approach to investing is plainly laid out below .
Jubilation - IA ’s first IPO
Last week , we at IA enjoyed perhaps the greatest moment of our ( relatively ) young life , sharing the opportunity with one of our founders , and his team , to celebrate the occasion of going public .
The successful IPO of The Trade Desk has had a salutary impact on perceptions of the best private companies in the adtech sector , as well as on technology IPOs writ large .
But perhaps most meaningful to us at IA , it represents a company that we backed when it was a single founder and a PowerPoint ( though an awesome co-founder had been identified ) , through myriad twists and turns , financing struggles and rejected M&A offers , continuing to provide timely financial support , all the way through to a 400 + person global company valued well in excess of $ 1BN .
But rather than talking about what fueled our belief that Jeff Green ’s vision , powered by the Company ’s amazing colleagues and innovative clients , would ultimately yield a venture - scale outcome ( Alex already does a great job with that here ) , I ’d like to talk about how we as a firm put ourselves in the position to win .
Because make no mistake , it is anything but easy , and stands in stark opposition to the strategies of many newer venture firms .
But it is how we like to work with founders and , ultimately , believe it gives us the best chance to generate superior returns for our LPs .
Getting Started - The Seed Round
Brad and I started IA with a first close of $ 17 M in January 2010 .
Our initial LPs were , shall we say , non-traditional venture investors , as many if not most were still smarting from the hangover of 2008 / 09 .
While we had a vision of closing our first fund at $ 25 M ( $ 25 M was on the cover , while $ 40 M was the hard cap ) , we had the good fortune of being able to close at $ 50 M later in the year .
This was nowhere on the radar screen , however , when we first met Jeff in October 2009 or invested in the Company in March 2010 .
Our initial investments in Fund I were scoped to be up to $ 750 k for 12 - 15 % ownership , with upwards of $ 2 M going into our strongest companies over 2 - 3 rounds .
We intended on doing some limited incubation ( see : Vectra Networks , which we incubated as Trace Vector before getting the support of Khosla Ventures , Accel , DAG and other great investors ) , but were largely going to enter companies at the seed stage .
The positioning to investors was “ Old style VC , ” starting very early ( and always pre- product / market fit ) , building a concentrated portfolio and owning 10 % + of our best investments post - Series C. 20 - 25 portfolio constituents , of which 5 - 6 would represent our “ best of fund ” investments and capture more than half of the investment dollars .
With this in mind , our first investment into The Trade Desk was $ 750 k for ownership right in our target range .
So far , so good .
Need Mo’ Money - The Bridge Round
Jeff and Dave Pickles ( the CTO and co-founder , who joined around the time we and Founder Collective led the Seed round and Eric Paley and I joined the Board ) had set a visionary and ambitious plan that involved a tech build that was nothing short of insane .
Right in our power alley (!?! ) .
As all great founders do , Jeff stayed close to customers and planted seeds well in advance of the Company ’s ability to deliver , laying the foundation for great expectations ( and rocking tech and product ) and rapid adoption .
The only thing that remained was shipping the product .
Well , as is the case with pretty much every construction project and startup , stuff takes longer and costs more than expected , and The Trade Desk was no exception .
So what did Jeff do ?
He did great work helping us understand the unfolding of the addressable market ( his hypothesis that Programmatic would eat traditional ad buying was not yet clear to many ) , customer feedback and feature requirements ( including query - per- second - QPS - throughput ) .
He and Dave also provided us with revised estimates of release dates corresponding to key technical achievements that would put us in - market .
At this point both Founder Collective and IA provided a bridge to this next set of milestones .
Why ?
Because we believed in Jeff ’s vision and hypotheses about the reshaping of ad buying , as well as his leadership , recruiting power and industry credibility , together with Dave and the tech team ’s ability to ship .
Ugly Industry , Dearth of Believers , still - Bridge # 2 + Non-VC Series A
Believe it or not , even after the Company ’s successful release , adtech was still so hated and the programmatic opportunity so misunderstood that we had to bridge again , until we finally raised a Series A from non-traditional investors ( in this case , successful entrepreneurs from in and around the domain who understood the opportunity first - hand and were happy to invest ) .
At each step of the way IA continued to participate , such that by the time The Trade Desk was generating cash ( on a total of $ 8 M raised ) we had invested a little over $ 2.2 M across four funding events that resulted in us owning around 18 % of the Company .
But we had another big decision to make .
Gearing up for Global Expansion - The Series B
As the Company was rapidly expanding its global footprint , we as a Board decided it made sense to put more capital on the balance sheet to both support growth as well as secure a substantially larger credit line for financing receivables and a slice of term debt .
Hermes Growth Partners , specifically the force - of - nature Juan Villalonga ( ex - McKinsey , former Chairman and CEO of Telefonica ) and the whiz - kid Alex Kayyal ( now of Salesforce Ventures ) , stepped in to lead a $ 20 M Series B. Given the Company ’s growth and scale , it really had the character of a growth round , and was priced as such ( the Series B being a misnomer given how cash efficient Jeff & Co. had been in getting to EBITDA positive ) .
Recycling Capital - Fueling IA ’s Participation in the Series B
At this point in IA Ventures Fund I ’s life , we were beyond the initial investment period , so we ’d be making no new investments .
We have a culture of wanting to recycle capital to between 110 - 120 % of committed capital when possible , which means the intersection of : ( a ) portfolio liquidity events in a time frame where we can redeploy capital ; and ( b ) later stage opportunities that have , in our opinion , 5 - 10 x cash - on - cash return potential from that point onward .
In the case of The Trade Desk , stars and planets aligned due to our earlier sale of Simple to BBVA , which generated significant liquidity , and our deep belief that notwithstanding the nine - figure price of investing in the Hermes - led Series B , it did , in fact , have the return profile referenced above .
So IA ended up writing a $ 3 M check into the Series B , bringing our total investment to $ 5.2 M or just over 10 % of our Fund I committed capital .
On a fully - diluted basis , IA owned just under 17 % post - Series B .
This is exactly where we wanted to be .
Was it seemingly out - of - step for a “ Micro VC ” to invest at such prices and to have so much of a fund in a single company ?
Perhaps .
But the way we secured our ownership was by being super early , being close to the arc of the Company ’s development and culture , and ultimately having the conviction to lean in hard when opportunities presented themselves ( or , in the early days , were necessitated by circumstance : step up or face a premature sale scenario ) .
The IA Ventures Model
The Trade Desk ( Fund I ) .
Vectra Networks ( Fund I ) .
Transferwise ( Fund II ) .
Digital Ocean ( Fund II ) .
Companies where IA was super early , leaned in hard , put ginormous dollars to work ( as a % of fund size ) and , as a result , owns 14 - 18 % of four high - growth , post - Series C companies , three of which are approaching or beyond $ 100 M revenue run rates and at or beyond EBITDA breakeven .
We still believe others in these funds that could achieve these levels as well , but it ’s still early , particularly for Fund II investments made in the latter part of its investment period .
In each fund we have 24 - 28 investments , with 6 - 8 garnering the lion ’s share of the capital over multiple rounds .
Clearly we ’re only seven years in with fewer than 60 data points , so it is too early to claim victory , but I do think that we ’ve demonstrated that it is possible to be a successful life - cycle investor at MUCH smaller fund sizes than the traditional Series A and B firms .
What it takes is deep conviction and perhaps irrational confidence to successfully invest in pre-product / market fit companies , write larger checks for greater ownership in the face of sparse data , and to amplify ownership and risk when you both want to and can do so .
And this is n’t easy , particularly with follow on investors often being very ownership - sensitive and sometimes sharp - elbowed with earlier investors .
But this is where the strength of founder relationships comes in , and this is something we at IA invest in very heavily .
It is also an outgrowth of being so early and so supportive when there are n’t a ton of believers .
As we ’re now investing out of our third fund , we ’ll have ever more data to validate or invalidate our hypotheses concerning our model .
Sitting here today , I feel pretty confident that we ’re onto something that fits our companies and our partnership just right .
The Real Heroes
All credit goes to the founders and their colleagues who give us the chance to do what we do .
While the highs are often transitory and the lows can feel very , very low , getting to share last week ’s IPO with Jeff , Dave , Brian , Rob , Paul and the rest of The Trade Desk team , those people who are helping to transform the advertising and media industries and employ more than 400 well - compensated , mission - driven people worldwide , made plying this particular trade feel very , very worthwhile .
Worried about its massive DVD sales , retail behemoth Wal - Mart has told some of Hollywood ’s biggest players it will retaliate against them for selling movies on Apple ’s iTunes .
Last year when Disney announced it would begin offering episodes of the hit shows “ Lost ” and “ Desperate Housewives ” on Apple ’s iTunes , the reaction of the world ’s largest retailer sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry .
Wal - Mart , worried that offering the shows for viewing on iPods would cut into DVD sales at its stores , sent “ cases and cases ” of DVDs back to Disney , according to a source familiar with the matter .
Now , following Apple ’s entrance in to the business of selling full - length films for download , the battle between Hollywood and its largest client is getting uglier , as studio executives say Wal - Mart has overtly threatened to retaliate if they go into business with Apple .
So far , Apple has only inked a deal with one studio – Disney – on whose board Apple boss Steve Jobs sits .
But after seeing the success Apple had in creating a legal download business for the music industry , the movie industry would like to come aboard .
“ We all want to be in the Apple business , ” said one high - level executive at a major movie studio .
But Apple ’s pricing – $ 9.99 to $ 14.99 – is lower than DVD prices at Wal - Mart .
The studios generally charge Wal - Mart a wholesale price of $ 17.95 for new DVDs , while Apple is paying Disney a wholesale price of about $ 14.50 per film , according to a studio source .
The last thing studios want to do before the holiday shopping season is to offend their biggest sales outlet ; the studios , collectively , rely on Wal - Mart for some $ 5 billion of DVD sales in the fourth quarter .
But several weeks ago , in the midst of rumors that Apple was close to announcing a deal with Disney , Wal - Mart ’s David Porter – the executive responsible for stocking the retailer ’s shelves with DVDs and CDs and whose influence is so immense in Tinseltown that he ’s been named to Premiere magazine ’s annual power list – made the rounds of Hollywood studios .
His message , according to a studio exec involved in the discussions : that there would be “ serious ramifications ” if the studios hopped in bed with Apple .
“ They threatened to hurt us in terms of buying less products , ” said this person .
The situation between Bentonville and Hollywood has gotten so heated and so high - level that Jobs recently phoned Wal - Mart CEO Lee Scott to ask him to moderate his stance , according to a source .
“ What they probably will do is not hurt Disney on new titles , but will buy less of their library titles , ” said one source .
Library titles , however , are where Wal - Mart makes money from DVDs .
The retailer typically slashes the price of new releases below cost , making up for it by selling other products to shoppers .
A Wal - Mart spokeswoman said , “ We intend to meet our customer needs whether they choose to purchase movies online or in the store and will continue to work hard with all our partners to do that . ”

From The New York Times of September 21 :
LONDON , Sept. 20 — A British scientific group , the Royal Society , contends that Exxon Mobil is spreading " inaccurate and misleading " information about climate change and is financing groups that misinform the public on the issue .
The Royal Society , a 1,400 - member organization that dates back to the 1600's and has counted Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein as members , asked Exxon Mobil in a letter this month to stop financing these groups and to change its public reports to reflect more accurately the opinions of scientists on the issue .
There is a " false sense somehow that there is a two - sided debate going on in the scientific community " about the origins of climate change , said Bob Ward , the senior manager for policy communication at the Royal Society .
The reality is that " thousands and thousands " of scientists around the world agree that climate change is linked to greenhouse gases , he said , with " one or two professional contrarians " who disagree .
The Royal Society is totally dishonest in its claims and is out to intimidate and silence those with whom it disagrees .
There are not one or two " contrarians " who dispute the claims of the Greens concerning global warming but over 17,000 scientists .
These scientists in fact have actually signed a petition stating their opposition in no uncertain terms .
As the organizers of the petition point out , the signers " so far include 2,660 physicists , geophysicists , climatologists , meteorologists , oceanographers , and environmental scientists who are especially well qualified to evaluate the effects of carbon dioxide on the Earth 's atmosphere and climate . "
As they further point out , the signers " also include 5,017 scientists whose fields of specialization in chemistry , biochemistry , biology , and other life sciences make them especially well qualified to evaluate the effects of carbon dioxide upon the Earth 's plant and animal life . "

The petition was organized by Frederick Seitz , who is the Past President of the National Academy of Sciences and President Emeritus of Rockefeller University .
The petition itself is online , at http://www.oism.org/pproject/s33p37.htm.
It reads :
We urge the United States government to reject the global warming agreement that was written in Kyoto , Japan in December , 1997 , and any other similar proposals .
The proposed limits on greenhouse gases would harm the environment , hinder the advance of science and technology , and damage the health and welfare of mankind .
There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide , methane , or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will , in the foreseeable future , cause catastrophic heating of the Earth 's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth 's climate .
Moreover , there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the Earth .
The petition is accompanied by an eight page review of scientific information on the subject of " global warming " titled " Environmental Effects of Increased Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide . "
I will make no attempt to summarize that review here .
I will content myself merely with endorsing one of its essential conclusions , namely , that " Predictions of global warming , " which the Royal Society alleges to be indisputable , scientifically proven fact , " are based on computer climate modeling , a branch of science still in its infancy . "
There is absolutely no empirical basis for the Royal Society 's assertion .
It is certainly not the case that a laboratory experiment has ever been performed , or could ever be performed , based on a side - by - side comparison of two identical planet Earths .
In one of these planet Earths , an Industrial Revolution takes place and is followed by a catastrophic rise in temperature , while in the other , in which there is no Industrial Revolution , there is no catastrophic rise in temperature .
That would be an experimentally established fact .
There simply is no such experimentally established fact .
Moreover , repeated long periods of global warming have taken place on the one and only planet Earth that does exist , without any contribution whatever by Man , his industry , or by increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide caused by nature itself .
In other words , the Royal Society has no actual empirical basis for its claims .
All it has is computer climate modeling , which is no more reliable and accurate than weather forecasting , which is actually all that it is , only on a scale of centuries rather than days .
This is the basis on which the Royal Society wants to squelch opposition to the Greens and their agenda of global government control and massive economic deprivation .
What we have in the Royal Society 's behavior is an obvious attempt at intimidation and the imposition of a conformity of thought on a major public issue .
Imagine the uproar if the kind of letter sent by the Royal Society to Exxon had instead been sent by Exxon to the 1,400 members of the Royal Society urging them to stop their support of that organization because of its views on global warming .
I can hear the denunciations now : " Inquisition , " " violations of free speech , " " strong - arm tactics , " " Fascism , " . . . .
Well , all of that is precisely what all of the world 's alleged defenders of freedom of speech and press should be saying right now about the tactics of the Royal Society .
Those tactics are a perfect illustration of what noted MIT climate expert Prof.
Richard Lindzen described last April in his Wall Street Journal article " Climate of Fear . "
Joined with the arbitrary power of a host of government agencies that between them control virtually every aspect of its existence , they are capable of forcing Exxon to submit .
In fact , I for one will not be surprised if Exxon ends up being compelled to be to the oil industry what Philip Morris has become to the tobacco industry , namely , a company that seems to exist for no other purpose than to discourage as much as possible the purchase of its products .
Such self - abasing behavior is what can result when a company is at the mercy of arbitrary government power inflamed against it by vicious propaganda coming from those , such as the Royal Society , who pose as the fount of intellect and morality .
As it happens , the petition I have referred to has no financial support from Exxon or any other company in the oil , coal , or natural gas industries .
Can the same thing be said about governmental support of The Royal Society and the endless " studies " dedicated to advancing the Green agenda ?
The Royal Society should apologize to Exxon and to the respected scientists — Seitz , Lindzen , and the more than 17,000 others who oppose its views — whose reputations it has besmirched .

Surgeons performed two heart operations on Nawal Mayor
Nawal Mayor was working on a heart scanner at London Independent Hospital on 19 April , when he fell ill .
The 54 - year - old , from Walton - on - Thames , Surrey , then underwent two operations to unblock a main artery .
Doctors said his condition was so serious it was unlikely he would have survived had he been anywhere else .
Mr Mayor told BBC London : " I was getting really sweaty .
I was getting quite panicky . "
I really need to be alive because my children need me and my family need me
Nawal Mayor
He said the last thing he could remember was telling a member of staff he was feeling poorly .
Surgeons then used the heart machine - fixed by Mr Mayor - to scan his arteries , before operating on him .
Later the same day , he was operated on again and fitted with a replacement valve .
Professor Adam Timmis , from the hospital in Stepney Green , said : " Had this happened outside this hospital , it 's very unlikely he would have survived . "
Two weeks on , he is back at home recovering with his two children .
He said : " I really need to be alive because my children need me and my family need me , so things have worked out reasonably ok . "
Apple surprised a few people in June when they rolled podcasting support into iTunes 4.9 , giving users the ability to download recorded audio programs automatically through the iTunes Music Store .
What is less known is that the company took another step and added support for video podcasts ( or vodcasts , and some people call them ) .
That 's right .
No longer do you only get to hear news and opinions read by people in their underwear , now you can watch them , too !
The quiet , fanfare - less launch of video podcasting ( in fact , it 's not even clear when it was launched ) is a bit surprising for the company , but there may be a reason : there 's not too many video podcasts out there in the wild .
Furthermore , video podcasts are currently only playable on your computer , although it seems clear enough that a video iPod is on the way .
If you did n't believe it before , you should definitely believe it now .
For now , it looks like video podcasting content available through the iTunes Music Store is limited .
For instance , Crookz , a video podcast ( iTMS link ) spoof of Cops , appears to be one of the few video offerings out there that 's actually working .
However , you can bet that webcams and DV cameras around the world will be dusted off in the wake of this news .
Everyone wants to be a radio - star killing video producer , do n't they ?
When podcasts first hit the scene , I was underwhelmed to say the least .
I can read much faster than someone can read to me , and if I 'm somewhere like the gym where reading is n't really possible , then I 'd much rather listen to music .
Still , podcasts have become all the rage , and plenty of sites are now offering podcasts .
If enough people wanted them , we might do a weekly podcast for our readers , as well .
Let us know .
The thing that occurred to me when podcasting caught on , however , was how we 're basically headed towards the democratization of video content .
A brief outline of the revolution ( if we can call it that ) is as follows : from text , to audio , to video .
Blogging caught on once it became dead easy for non -techie types to publish online .
Podcasting has followed in its wake : why read or write when you can listen or speak ?
( Or so the thinking goes . )
And now , coming full circle in many ways , the video podcast is poised to take on other forms of video entertainment head - on .
What 's needed is that proverbial " killer app " that could make video production as easy and recording a podcast .
And just who do you think is going to pull that off ?
Would you be surprised to learn that Apple has applied for trademarks relating to the word iPodcast ?
According to AppleInsider :
The first filing seeks a trademark on the term iPodcast , which covers hardware - related goods , namely " computers , computer peripherals , hand held computers , computer terminals , personal digital assistants , electronic organizers , electronic notepads , apparatus for recording , transmission and reproduction of sounds , images , or other data ; magnetic data carriers . "
A second filing requests that the iPodcast trademark cover services , including " telecommunications services ; communication by computer , computer intercommunication ; telex , telegram and telephone services ; rental , hire and leasing of communications apparatus and of electronic mailboxes ; electronic bulletin board services , " etc .
If I look into my crystal ball , I see a video iPod launch accompanied by an iPodcaster application aimed precisely at producing and optimizing video podcasts .
I 'd suggest that it would be an addition to the iLife suit , but to be honest , I think success will hinge on Windows support .
Update : after digging a bit deeper , it looks like video Podcasting support has in fact been around for an indeterminate amount of time .
The strange thing about it is , where 's the love from Steve Jobs ?
Jobs will tout the saltiness of a peanut if he needs to , but Apple has been quiet enough on this front that most of us were caught off guard by the happenstance discovery .
In fact , the reader who pointed this out to me said that the Wall Street Journal is also reporting on this topic today .
The major internal conflict for the strangest alliance in history is about what will happen to Jews who do n’t convert to evangelical Christianity .
The Armageddonites , those 30 million Americans who happily see Mideast chaos as hastening their one - way trip to paradise , are being increasingly questioned about the fate of Jews whom they urge to help fulfill the prophecies .
Once their death wish agenda is realized , the end - of - the - worlders believe that Buddhists , Hindus , Muslims ( of course ) , other Christians ( apparently including Catholics and Orthodox ) , and all the rest of humanity will be killed .
But the born - again will be “ raptured ” to Heaven .
( See “ The Brutal Christ of the Armageddonites . ” )
Now some enterprising Texans have “ resolved ” the big question .
The Jews God kills will go to a parallel heaven , “ their ” kind of heaven , to enjoy eternity alongside the good Christians .
The Jewish heaven will presumably be what “ they ” would like , perhaps different from the evangelical heaven , where there will be “ no booze , no bars , and no need to mow the grass on one ’s lawn , ” according to a popular Gaither Singers song .
( The fact that the Jewish faith has no afterlife at all similar to the Christian one is irrelevant , nor do the faithful Texans probably even know it . )
It is called the “ dual covenant theory ”  the belief that Jews and Christians have separate deals with God .
However , Muslims , Hindus , and others have no deal .
A Wall Street Journal piece described the dual covenant theory in an article about a Christian Zionist meeting in Washington two weeks ago .
In particular it reported on Rev. John Hagee , who founded Christians United for Israel and organized the event .
Now , Jerry Falwell and other evangelicals who once opposed the thesis have joined the Hagee group board of directors .
They urge no peace concessions by Israel and , now , war with Iran .
The 3,500 delegates held a major rally in Washington attended by , among others , Rep. Tom DeLay ( R - Texas ) , Senators Sam Brownback ( R - Kans . ) and Rick Santorum ( R - Penn . ) , Republican National Committee chairman Ken Mehlman , Israel ’s ambassador to the U.S. , and other leading Zionists .
As the Journal reports , “ They see , and even sometimes seem to embrace , the notion of a global conflict between Islam and the Judeo - Christian West , just as do many zealous Muslims . ”
( Protesters outside the meeting were led by Carol Moore , who long ago first brought media attention to the Waco and Weaver travesties . )
Interestingly , polls indicate that most Americans are nowhere near as pro-Israel as their elected representatives .
Recent polls show strong majorities of Americans do not want the U.S. to intervene on Israel ’s behalf in its current military campaign .
There are many other strange facets to the Zionist - Evangelical alliance :
God needs Jews to gather in Israel for the fulfillment of His plans .
To further this , the Christian Zionists collect money ( from churchgoers and on TV programs ) to pay for primarily Russian Jews to emigrate to Israel , because God ca n’t end the world until most Jews have returned to the holy land .
However , American Jews apparently can stay in America without hindering His agenda .
The great advantage of being “ raptured ” is that there is no Judgment Day .
Everybody who is “ born again ” automatically goes to Heaven , their sins all forgiven , and no good works are necessary .
But it must happen soon .
If John Hagee , Jerry Falwell , or Pat Robertson should die before Armageddon happens , then God will handle their souls the ordinary way .
God loves the Jews , according to fundamentalist theology , but not if they work for peace .
Pat Robertson explained that murdered Israeli leader Yitzhak Rabin was killed because he got in the way of God ’s plans for continued war .
Robertson also blamed Ariel Sharon ’s recent stroke on his withdrawal from Gaza .
Similarly , according to the Wall Street Journal , Hagee said that “ calls for Israel to show restraint violate ‘ God ’s foreign policy statement ’ toward Jews . ”
In May , 2003 Hagee and other evangelical leaders sent a letter to President Bush applauding the invasion of Iraq but complaining about the Israel - Palestine peace plan .
They said it would be “ morally reprehensible ” for the U.S. to be “ evenhanded . ”
Hardly any leader of the Christian Right publicly opposes the torture of prisoners of war ( with the notable exception of Chuck Colson of Prison Fellowship ) .
Perhaps predictably , many fundamentalists are passionate supporters of John Bolton , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , noted for symbolizing all that the rest of the world dislikes about America .
Just war , rule of law , the Geneva Convention , charity to one ’s enemies  such concepts are all anathema to these Christians who long for the end of the world .
Millions of Arab Christians are certainly not loved by the God of the Armageddonites .
In fact , Arab Christians do n’t seem to exist .
Pat Robertson ’s 700 Club , for instance , refused to show a segment about Christian Arabs .
Jerry Falwell ’s tours of Israel purposely avoided them , according to Grace Halsell , who traveled with Falwell ’s group and wrote a book about it .
Robert Novak has written about the plight of Christians under Israeli rule and how almost no representative in Congress dares to speak up for them , except for Henry Hyde , who is retiring .
The self - proclaimed “ Christian ” columnists and commentators on Fox News and the Washington Times op - ed page remain silent .
The White House has explained the nuances of God ’s plans to Armageddonites before .
Last year , it sponsored a meeting with leading fundamentalist preachers to explain that Gaza was not part of the historical Judea and Samaria .
Therefore , its spokesman argued , Israel ’s withdrawal of settlements would not interfere with God ’s plan to end the world .
It is a bit weird that we begin the 21st century with American foreign policy being made by religious fundamentalists who mirror some of their Muslim brethren in their hatred .
And now they want to attack Iran , whatever the consequences for the world ’s oil supplies through the Straits of Hormuz .
Never mind all the wisdom and experience , books and lectures of America ’s foreign policy establishment : State Department and CIA experts overseas , analysts at think tanks , the most brilliant thinkers in the nation might as well be whistling in the dark .
George Bush has been asked if he believes that we are in the “ end times . ”
He refused to answer .
He has said that God tells him what policies to pursue , presumably those now inflaming the Muslim world .
Catholics and most other Christians , incidentally , do not believe the Armageddonites ’ scenario .
Others believe God ’s prophecies already occurred in Biblical times .
And the preachers ?
Just in case the world does not end soon , Rev.
Hagee has set aside several million dollars in trusts , money earned from his prophecies and preaching .
The San Antonio Express News reported on the IRS filings of his Global Evangelism Television network .
After their report ,
Hagee re-registered the fundraising network as a church , which does not need to show its IRS filings .
With 11 days until Christmas , I have bought exactly zero presents .
I ’m not a bad person , I just do n’t like hurling myself into the hordes of mall santas , double - wide strollers , and Sbarro devouring teenagers .
Before my illustrious career as web design rockstar ( edit : corporate drone ) I lived in the dark - ages : I worked retail for 7 years .
For seven long years housewives threw pens , money , credit cards , and obscenities at me .
I learned that without the magic ability to produce merchandise that did n’t exist , or produce it at an unreasonably low price , a lowly shop wench did n’t stand a fighting chance .
I saw women mow down my pyramids of stemware with hum - vee strollers , and witnessed the morbidly obsese walk again when their Rascals would n’t fit through the aisles .
Desperate husbands scooped up gift - cards and jingle rock santas , while sticky - fingered , unattended children flung pretzels and cheerios across the store .
So , as I would sooner endure paper cuts to my eyelids than go near a mall the day after Thanksgiving , I ’ve come up with a few tips based on my experiences to help out my fellow anti-commerce holiday slackers .
The item you want is probably gone already .
Do n’t trust internet inventory locators , they ’re always wrong .
Call the store and ask someone .
Most stores , even during the holidays , will begrudgingly hold something for you if you can get there fast enough .
All bets are off .
Do n’t turn your back on the spoils in your cart and expect it to remain untouched .
Someone else wants that poop - herself - pretty - pretty - princess .
She who has her hands on it last , leaves the store with it .
Bring cash , and bring extra .
Almost every holiday season my store ’s card services went down after being overloaded with requests .
Card processing will time out , and writing checks runs you the risk of having your eyeballs clawed out by the impatient lines behind you .
You wo n’t find a parking space , so do n’t bother trying .
Just take the spot in the middle of nowhere , it will take you less time to walk to the store than it does to sit in your car pissing off everyone trying to get around you .
There wo n’t be anyone to help you .
The nearest salesperson is teetering on a ladder , getting the last thingamajic and whatchamacallit from the store ’s highest display , for a moth - ball scented old bag who ’s “ just looking . ”
Know what you want and where it is .
If a store does offer free gift wrap , you do n’t want it , and you ’re a jerk if you get it .
This means you ’re pulling away staff from the salesfloor and cash registers , potentially inciting a riot .
And if you ’re getting something oddly shaped or oversized , they ’re not going to be able to wrap it any better than you would , it ’s still going to look like a blob of crumpled up gift - wrap .
Just go home and stick whatever it is in a gift bag , besides it ’s easier for your stuffy sister - in - law when she regifts .
Always ask for a gift receipt first , even if you do n’t want one .
You never know when you ’ll need it , your tastes are n’t infallible and you do n’t want Aunt Ethel to know how cheap you are , and the cashier will have to get a manager to reprint one for you .
Get out of there .
As soon as you ’re done , leave the store , sprawlmart , or ye olde mall towne immediately .
You never know who you ’re going to run into .
One unfortunate Christmas Eve I fell prey to a local weather girl gone investigative reporter spotlighting last minute shoppers , and my whole family got a sneak preview of their gifts on the ten o’clock news .
Now good luck , and get some of that pre-alcoholic egg nog , because you ’re going to need it .
And remember , gift cards are your friend .
If you always have trouble trying to find the right Christmas gift for someone , you should look into sending them a great Christmas gift basket delivered right to their home .
By sending a holiday gift basket you can let people you ’re thinking of them through the holidays .
Besides holiday themed gift baskets , gift baskets can come in a variety of packages such as wine gift baskets , fruit gift baskets and Chocolate gift baskets .
