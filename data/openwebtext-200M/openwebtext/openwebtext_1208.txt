But what will worry Israel the most are mutterings in the occupied West Bank of a " third intifada " .
The most recent intifada , or mass uprising , erupted in 2000 and lasted four years – resulting in the deaths of thousands of Palestinians and hundreds of Israelis .
Any movie that starts with Morgan Freeman 's cask - aged voice , telling us we 're screwed , is off to a great start .
Many science - fiction movies open with voiceovers , which prepare you for greatness ... or bombard you with backstory .
Here are 50 of our favorites .
Too bad War Of The Worlds goes downhill a bit after that amazingly portentous opening .
No movie could live up to the promise of Morgan Freeman reading H.G. Wells , more or less verbatim , but it 's still a sad thing .

The greatest voiceovers tell you what kind of movie you 're in for , and also give you the information you need to hit the ground running .
Take Sean Connery 's iconic voiceover from Highlander , which is so awesome , you need it written out for you to appreciate its greatness :
Sadly , most voiceovers that launch movies either try to pack in way , way too much backstory ( " And then there was a man named 92 ZorkX , who built a mega - cube in his pants " ) or go way , way overboard with the cheese .
Here are 48 more voiceovers that mostly go way over the top , sorted by type :

Perhaps my favorite kind of opening voiceover is the kind where the narrator starts out by intoning , " In the year 2027 , we realized we had gone out of the house without any lower garments , and the Earth was reduced to rubble as a result .
The survivors lived in caves , eating scraps of jerky .
Until one day , a new hope appeared . "
Here are ten of the most awesome voiceovers that begin with a date and end with a sad recitation .

This is sort of a catch - all for two categories that did n't quite deserve their own pages : monologues that start out as a voiceover , and then turn into someone talking to the camera ; and voiceovers that are just sort of demented , silly or satirical .
They 're both a bit different from your standard science fiction voiceover , in any case .

Cupertino , CA – Apple has decided to take extreme measures in the back and forth battle with Palm .
To prevent the Palm Pre from syncing with iTunes , Apple has removed the ability of iTunes to sync with any devices , even iPods and iPhones .
The Palm Pre launched with the ability to sync music using iTunes , which eased the adoption by former iPhone users .
Apple countered by issuing an update which prevented unauthorized devices from syncing with iTunes , however , Palm quickly issued an upgrade to WebOS , which fooled iTunes .
The battle has been escalating for several months now .
Apple 's head of iTunes development Eric Schoenberg said , " This really was the only solution .
Every move we made to lock them out did n't work .
Now , there 's no possible way the Pre can sync with iTunes . "
Schoenberg said that engineers " removed the ability to sync from iTunes 9.0.3 " and that all future " iPods , iPhones and any music device that Apple produces in the future will be unable to sync . "

He agreed that these changes might make it hard for users , but that " keeping the Pre off iTunes was much more important , and would improve user experience in intangible ways . "
Apple fans supported the move by Apple , " I can't sync any more , but I think it 's the right response , " said Martin Fillmore of San Francisco .
" If we allow Palm Pre users to use iTunes , then the next thing you know we 'll have Zune users too .
Do we really want those devices polluting the purity of iTunes ? "
There has n't been an official response from Palm yet , but sources inside Palm have suggested that the company may even have a work around for this move by Apple .
The sources neither confirmed nor denied that the work around may involve alien technology .
Palm 's stock was up on the news .

Canadian Grand Prix organisers announced on Monday they have reached a settlement with Formula One Administration that will mean the Montreal race will return to the calendar next year .
The Canadian event was absent from this year 's schedule for the first time since 1987 , meaning there were no races in North America .
However , negotiations to bring the race back had been ongoing and the GP was already listed on a provisional 2010 calendar with a June 6 date .
On Monday , organisers confirmed a deal that will see Montreal back next year .
" I am very happy , and fully satisfied , with this outcome , " said Normand Legault , CEO of Grand Prix F1 du Canada .
" I have always been confident of being able to resolve the dispute , given the in - depth understanding I have had to develop of the Formula 1 racing situation in Canada .
" And I am especially pleased that an announcement is forthcoming to the effect that the Canadian Grand Prix will be back on the FIA calendar as of 2010 .
I never doubted that the Canadian race would regain its rightful place on the FIA schedule , and my discussions with F1 management led me to believe that the event would return soon .
" The race is important not only for Formula 1 , but also for the teams , manufacturers and sponsors .
I am also happy for the Canadian Grand Prix 's many fans , because they are true F1 enthusiasts who appreciate the real value of the spectacle and the competition . "
Some of the kids over at Georgia Tech have recently unveiled a development that takes realtime information from varied sources such as CCTV cameras and motion detectors and layers it on to Google Earth and Microsoft Virtual Earth .
The result ?
The ability to watch things happen as they happen anywhere in the world ( well – not quite anywhere just yet , but that ’s the idea ) .
While this undoubtedly reeks of “ awesome , ” the mind of a suspicious citizen of the 21st century automatically jumps to a future Orwellian land of Big Brothers who are this time running professional versions of Google Earth in dark offices atop mile - high , tinted - window skyscrapers .
From just a few camera angles ’ video streams , the software can display 3D traffic on a highway of the expansive digital land of Google Earth .
It can even estimate how the traffic runs on stretches of road that have no surveillance between camera - covered areas .
From other cameras and their angles placed around a park , the people playing American soccer can be watched from up above .
This also works the same for cameras in a football stadium tracking and displaying the live feed of an American football game .
Using motion capture devices and a video feed , 3D representations of people walking about a campus as well as the cars on the street by them are also layered on Google Earth .
Turning one ’s viewpoint up to the heavens in the software , a user can see what the weather is like taken from different sources and layered in the sky .
The video below shows the technology in action .
Up until this point , Google Earth ’s information has always been essentially static .
The satellite images are only updated every so often depending on the location , and the videos , images , links , and text has always been from the moment a user or someone with authority adds it , and it ’s generally never updated to reflect the constant change as time marches on .
The technology is very new , and the students from Georgia Tech are going to debut it at the IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality next month .
However , one can still read the paper on the project that they ’re going to present at the symposium by following this link .
There do n’t seem to be any specific long - term plans or goals for the technology at this time beyond perfecting it , but it ’s not likely that it will stay solely in the educational field for long .
In the meantime , the researchers plan to add better weather tracking , birds and animals , and motion in rivers to their project .
Despite its usefulness for informational purposes , this technology is definitely going to have to go through a lot of red tape before it shows up in commercial software and devices ( if it or even part of it ever does ) .
Though this is a really exciting development in the realms of technology , and though one can see a myriad of uses to be applied to it , it ’s obvious that some restrictions ought to be placed on such a technology before releasing it into the wild or even into the hands of a few , regardless of how “ wise ” or “ trustworthy ” the few may be .
Of course , this project ’s worldwide impact is restricted to what cameras ’ and other informational feeds ’ streams can be accessed ; what relatively low percentage of city streets and sidewalks that do have surveillance can’t all necessarily be legally accessed for public or private use just like that .
Still , it is n’t hard to negotiate with the varied organizations who have control of these monitoring devices , and it is n’t hard to add more .
Some of you are probably already dusting off the tin-foil hats after reading .
México enfrenta problemas con la competencia chilera de China y Perú
MÉRIDA , Yuc. —
Como parte de los trabajos del cuarto Congreso Mundial del Chile que inició ayer en esta ciudad y en el que participan productores de todo el país y de 15 países , el presidente del Consejo Nacional del Chile , Jesús Camacho Gutiérrez , informó que seguirán el ejemplo de los productores de la península de Yucatán , que obtuvieron la denominación de origen del habanero y harán lo mismo los estados de Jalisco y Chihuahua para obtener esa certificación para el chile de árbol y el jalapeño .
Asimismo , indicó que pese a que México ocupa el quinto sitio a nivel mundial como productor de chiles , todavía tienen muchos problemas con la competencia , principalmente con China y Perú , porque los chileros nacionales carecen de una norma oficial mexicana para esos productos , así como la falta de centros de acopio e infraestructura , lo que los hace caer en el coyotaje .
Dijo que la actividad genera 30 millones de jornales al año , por lo que instó al gobierno Federal a apoyar la actividad , ya que en México son miles de familias que dependen de esa hortaliza .
Como parte de la Convención Mundial , en las instalaciones del Siglo XXI en esta ciudad , se abrió una exposición nacional de todos los chiles que se producen en el país y en donde los expositores y productores decidirán e intercambiarán puntos de vista sobre avances tecnológicos y científicos que permitan proteger esos cultivos .
Los trabajos se desarrollarán a puerta cerrada .
En Yucatán se informó que la obtención de la denominación de origen del chile habanero traerá dividendos importantes a los tres mil 500 productores que se dedican a ese cultivo y que trabajan 500 hectáreas que generan una producción promedio de 5 mil toneladas del picante al año .
Los productores del habanero en la península , se comentó , buscarán unificar criterios que permitan impulsar la producción .

Justice : What ’s the Right Thing to Do ? , by Michael Sandel ( Farrar , Straus and Giroux , 320 pp. , $ 25 )
The Idea of Justice , by Amartya Sen ( Harvard University Press , 496 pp. , $ 29.95 )
“ Justice , justice shalt thou pursue , ” commands the Book of Deuteronomy .
But for American political philosophers , it is not so much justice as A Theory of Justice that is the object of pursuit .
Since John Rawls published that seminal book in 1971 , its ideas and language have exercised an extraordinary hold on the imagination of political thinkers .
Just look at Justice by Michael J. Sandel and The Idea of Justice by Amartya Sen — two books , coincidentally appearing at the same moment , by leading political philosophers , both of them professors at Harvard ( as Rawls was ) .
Justice is the more accessible work , based on Sandel ’s popular introductory course in Harvard ’s Core Curriculum , while The Idea of Justice is more ambitious , treating a range of theoretical and practical problems in political economy .
Yet both books are , at heart , responses to and revisions of Rawls , and their titles deliberately allude to Rawls ’s magnum opus .
Just as the nineteenth - century critics of Hegel were still known as Young Hegelians , so these critics of Rawls are essentially post -Rawlsians .
The power of A Theory of Justice , which functions in Sen ’s and Sandel ’s books like the Freudian father who both must and must not be slain , comes from the way Rawls gave theoretical form to the core assumptions of late - twentieth - century left - liberalism .
Rawls ’s version of social contract theory is almost as well known by now as Hobbes ’s and Locke’s .
The only way for us to design a truly just society , Rawls argues , is to imagine ourselves behind a “ veil of ignorance ” that prevents us from knowing what our actual place in society will be — more , that blocks off our view of our own abilities , desires , and values .
People negotiating in this “ original position , ” Rawls holds , will necessarily agree on two basic principles : first , that the liberty of every person will be inviolable ; second , that economic disparities will only be allowed if they serve the advantage of the worst - off in society .
It ’s not hard to see that these principles — especially the latter , known as the “ difference principle ” — offer a middle way between two earlier visions of the just society , both of which were largely discredited by Rawls ’s time .
Unlike the proponents of laissez - faire Manchester liberalism , Rawls recognizes no absolute right to property or to the fruits of one ’s own labor .
He places the needs of the community before the right of the individual and imagines the original position in such a way that even personal abilities are the gift of the community , which the community has the right to control .
On the other hand , unlike Marxists , Rawls does not insist that a just society is one without inequalities .
He recognizes that inequality of wealth and status might be the necessary , if undesirable , price of overall prosperity and even of liberty .
What he offers instead bears a close resemblance to New Deal–style welfare capitalism , or social democracy : a system that permits competition but also restrains it , that rewards the rich but also cares for the poor .
Since this comes close to most liberals ’ present intuitions about how society should function , it ’s no wonder that even Rawls ’s critics find it hard to break entirely with his central ideas .
Rather , Sandel and Sen offer modifications that will , they believe , help us attain Rawlsian goals more effectively .
Sandel ’s book is , in form , not a response to Rawls but a primer , aimed at readers who enjoy debating moral conundrums and current political issues but who are not familiar with the traditional vocabulary of political philosophy .
Sandel ’s favorite technique is to present the reader with a real - life dilemma , then show how our intuitive responses to it have been anticipated , and challenged , by thinkers like Mill , Kant , and Aristotle .
“ Political philosophy cannot resolve [ our ] disagreements once and for all , ” Sandel writes .
“ But it can give shape to the arguments we have , and bring moral clarity to the alternatives we confront as democratic citizens . ”
This is an appealing strategy , allowing Sandel to show how real , and unavoidable , philosophy ’s apparently abstract thought experiments can be .
Take the old classroom chestnut about the runaway trolley : should you allow it to kill five workers on the track , or divert it onto another track where it would kill only one person ?
There is something comfortably abstract about this problem — it invites leisurely debate , since we know that it could n’t actually happen to us .
But then Sandel turns to a real incident that took place in 2005 .
A Navy SEAL operating behind enemy lines in Afghanistan came across some unarmed goatherds : should he kill them , though they had n’t done anything hostile , or let them go , and take the risk that they would warn the Taliban ?
In a Hollywood movie , we know what the hero would do : he would be merciful and let the men live .
And in fact , Sandel shows , Petty Officer Marcus Luttrell did let the goatherds go ; then they alerted the Taliban , his unit was ambushed , and 19 American soldiers were killed .
It makes a pretty convincing case for killing innocent civilians , and Luttrell himself now regrets his impulse to do what seemed like justice : “ It was the stupidest , most southern - fried , lamebrained decision I ever made in my life . ”
Sandel uses such ripped - from - the - headlines stories — Hurricane Katrina , the bank bailout , the Hopwood affirmative - action case — to introduce the reader to three major schools of thought about justice : the utilitarianism of Bentham and Mill ; the deontological , rights - based theories of Kant and Rawls ; and finally the teleological ethics of Aristotle .
Sandel is not neutral among these approaches , however : Justice has a dialectical form , in which the inadequacies of the first two schools are demonstrated so that we are inevitably led to prefer the third .
Sandel gives his least serious consideration to utilitarianism .
He takes it as self - evident that American readers will reject any theory of justice that leaves no place for inalienable rights .
Nor , despite his praise of Kant , does Sandel engage fully with the power of the categorical imperative .
Instead , he focuses on the unpalatable , not to say absurd , conclusions to which it seems to lead , such as Kant ’s famous dictum that one should not lie even to a murderer .
What really animates Justice , it becomes clear , is Sandel ’s debate with Rawls , which has been the defining theme of his career .
“ In the 1980s , ” he writes , “ a decade after Rawls ’s A Theory of Justice gave American liberalism its fullest philosophical expression , a number of critics ( of which I was one ) . . . argued that we ca n’t reason about justice by abstracting from our aims and attachments .
They became known as the ‘ communitarian ’ critics of contemporary liberalism . ”
As this passage suggests , the major focus of Sandel ’s critique of Rawls is the idea of the veil of ignorance .
Does it make sense to demand , as Rawls does , that we lay aside our personhood — not just our station in life , but our very sense of values and morals — before we reason about justice ?
Is there , in fact , any person left after such a radical abstraction is made ?
Sandel argues that there is not , because we are ineluctably entangled with our communities , our pasts , and our sense of the possible future .
To demonstrate the point , he turns to the question of collective guilt and apology .
Does n’t “ the relation of Germans to Jews , or of American whites to African Americans , ” make clear that individuals can bear responsibility for crimes that they never personally committed ?
If we are ashamed of what our country does , or proud of it , we are tacitly admitting that we are “ claimed by moral ties that we have not chosen and implicated in the narratives that shape our identity as moral agents . ”
The self , Sandel concludes , is thicker and less free than Rawls allows .
For all the noise that has been made about the communitarian challenge to liberalism , however , it is clear from Justice that Sandel ’s vision of the just society is actually very close to Rawls ’s .
When Sandel dissents from Rawls , it is not because he rejects Rawls ’s basic premises — justice as fairness , the priority of the collective to the individual , the validity of the difference principle .
It is rather that Sandel believes these goals can be better achieved through a more emotional , patriotic , and even religious appeal , rather than through Rawls ’s abstract liberalism .
He approvingly quotes President Obama to the effect that “ addressing problems such as ‘ poverty and racism , the uninsured and the unemployed ’ would require ‘ changes in hearts and a change in minds . ’ ”
Amartya Sen ’s
The Idea of Justice is an original contribution to political philosophy , rather than , like Justice , an introduction to the subject .
But Sen ’s indebtedness to Rawls is , if anything , even more fundamental .
The book covers a good deal of ground and touches on a number of Sen ’s favorite themes — non - Western traditions of democracy , the importance of democracy in thwarting famine , and certain topics in economic theory .
But the heart of the book is Sen ’s proposed revisions to A Theory of Justice , to which he pays extravagant respect .
“ It may sound a little ‘ over the top , ’ ” he writes , but when he first read Rawls ’s book , “ I did think that I could grasp the feeling to which Wordsworth gave expression : ‘ Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive , / But to be young was very heaven ! ’ ”
Even so , Sen writes , “ I now think that some of the main planks of the Rawlsian theory of justice are seriously defective . ”
One of these rotten planks is the idea that people can and should design any society in isolation , shut off from the rest of the world .
Instead ,
Sen argues that we should adopt what Adam Smith called the perspective of the “ impartial spectator ” — trying to imagine how our ideas of justice might appear to people who do n’t share our background , traditions , or language .
What seems commonplace to an American might look quite barbaric to a European — for instance , the absence of universal health care ; what seems natural in some parts of Africa — for instance , female circumcision — would be a violation of human rights elsewhere .
More important , because it goes to the very heart of the Rawlsian enterprise , is Sen ’s argument that Rawls is mistaken to search for justice in terms of a single set of ideal institutions .
Sen suggests , in terms reminiscent of Isaiah Berlin , that such “ transcendental institutionalism ” inevitably violates “ the plurality of reasons for justice . ”
To use Sandel ’s language , there are times when utilitarianism counsels one course of action , deontology another , teleology a third , so that it is impossible finally to decide that only one of these courses is truly just .
This does not mean , Sen insists , that we must simply give up on seeking agreement about what is just and unjust .
Rather , he writes , we should focus on “ comparative assessments between pairs of alternatives ” — that is , on deciding what is more and less just in any given situation .
In the early nineteenth century , for instance , radicals and clergymen could agree that slavery should be abolished , though they could never have settled on the same definition of a just society .
What unites these two lines of criticism , and provides The Idea of Justice with its underlying coherence and force , is Sen ’s recognition of the real tension between liberalism and cosmopolitanism .
Sen , a Nobel Prize–winning economist who was born in what is now Bangladesh and has taught in India , Britain , and the U.S. , knows better than Rawls that not all of the world ’s peoples would reason the same way in the original position — more , that the original position amputates the diversity that is an irreducible condition of the real world .
This does not lead Sen to despair , or to accept the notion , beloved of despots , that liberal democracy is a purely Western invention , with no relevance to “ Asian values . ”
On the contrary , at many points he argues that liberalism can find a usable past in Eastern cultures as well as Western ones .
One of his heroes is the sixteenth - century Mughal emperor Akbar , who decreed religious tolerance in India .
But Sen ’s global perspective allows him to see that the obstacles to Rawls ’s just society are far more considerable than Rawls allows .
Sen ’s pluralism and incrementalism , like Sandel ’s communitarianism , are intended to offer more robust means to Rawls ’s liberal ends .
Both books imply that it is where A Theory of Justice ends that the pursuit of justice actually begins .
Earlier this week , Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier ( CA - 12 ) , a co-sponsor of the Uniting American Families Act ( UAFA ) which would allow gays and lesbians to sponsor their foreign - born partners for citizenship , expressed her concerns about passing the bill as a part of larger immigration reform .
“ By making the bill comprehensive it does muddy the waters , ” said the freshman House member , who predicted “ nothing will happen this year on immigration . ”
Speier voiced her concerns about the strategy at a town hall meeting she held August 31 for the LGBT community in San Francisco .
The northern most sections of Speier ’s 12th Congressional District reach into portions of the city , including such LGBT - heavy neighborhoods as Glen Park , Diamond Heights , and Twin Peaks .
Since winning a special election to her seat last year , Speier has quickly moved to back several legislative efforts to win LGBT rights .
The issue of immigration has been especially fraught for the Peninsula lawmaker , as several of her constituents who are binational same - sex couples have reached out to her for help with immigration issues .
Speier ’s view seems to have changed since a town hall earlier this year , where she indicated “ the only way that bill is going to get passed is if its part of a larger immigration reform measure . ”
In addition to the standalone act , UAFA compatible language also exists in the omnibus immigration reform bill called Reuniting Families Act , sponsored by Congressman Mike Honda ( CA - 15 ) .
In her short 16 months in Congress , Speier has proven herself to be a strong ally and advocate for the LGBT community , and was instrumental in staying the deportation of a lesbian mother this past spring .

The world 's greatest investor is weathering the financial crisis by practising what he preaches .
One of Warren Buffett 's favourite sayings about the market is : " be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy " .
When the market was fearful last September , Mr Buffett was greedy , putting $ 5 bn ( £ 3 bn ) into the investment bank Goldman Sachs on exceptionally favourable terms .
He says he was only able to negotiate the deal because not many people had $ 5 bn to hand at that particular moment .
But there is no doubt Mr Buffett 's public show of confidence in the company was , in itself , a valuable asset to Goldman .
Mind - boggling returns
The deal already looks like a good one for Mr Buffett , with potential profits for him in the billions .
He has always enjoyed himself in a falling market , which , as he sees it , provides him with the best opportunities .
As if to prove his fabled status as the most successful investor ever , Mr Buffett prints his fund 's spectacular growth record , all the way back to 1965 , in the annual report of his company , Berkshire Hathaway .
It shows he has achieved an extraordinary 20.3 % average annual growth in the company 's value , which - he helpfully works out - comes to a mind - boggling 336,000 % over the years - 84 times that of the standard US index fund , the S&P 500 .
The numbers really are off the scale .
Life in Nebraska
As the biggest shareholder in Berkshire Hathaway , Mr Buffett 's personal stake in that growth made him the richest man in the world last year .

This year , he is number two , as Berkshire 's share price tumbled in the economic crisis .
His great friend Bill Gates regained his usual position at the top .
But Buffett has never admitted to any interest in such tables , and has trained himself to ignore short - term share price movements , either up or down .
So how has he made his estimated $ 40 bn ?
This is a man who has not even started a business .
( Berkshire Hathaway was an old textile mill he bought , whose name he kept as the name of his holding company . )
Nor has he invented anything , or come up with a way of making businesses more profitable .
And he still lives in his native Omaha , in the mid-western state of Nebraska , 1,200 miles from the financial whizzkids on Wall Street .
T - bone plays bridge
On the 14th floor of a non -descript office block he has rented for almost 50 years , Mr Buffett works his financial magic , reading newspapers and companies ' annual reports , looking for the right business to invest in and the right moment to make a move .

Over the years , the numbers have grown , as Mr Buffett 's financial universe has expanded : from the millions to the hundreds of millions , to today 's multibillion - dollar deals .
And yet his modest office remains defiantly low tech .
" I 've never had a computer in there , I 've never had a calculator in there , I 've never had a stock ticker in there , " he boasts .
He believes that if a deal needs complicated calculations before you can decide if it is right , then it probably is not .
He always leaves a " margin of safety " , he says , so that if things do n't work out as he'd hoped , he does not lose money .
Mr Buffett has one personal assistant , and hates meetings or having a busy schedule .
He drives himself to work from his house , a few miles along the same street .
His daughter Susie says that most evenings , he will probably have a ham sandwich , and settle down to several hours of online bridge .
If you go online and find yourself playing someone called T - Bone , that is him .
Conglomerate executive
Those who work for companies Mr Buffett owns say when they call him up , he often picks up the phone himself , or if not he will always call back promptly .
You want a dynamic system , and you want a market system that 's free to make mistakes to some degree
Warren Buffett
" He seems to have an endless amount of time , " says Tony Nicely , chief executive of the Buffett - owned insurance company Geico .
Despite his image as the great stock - picker , for decades Mr Buffett 's success has come from more than that .
Today , most of the value of Berkshire Hathaway lies in 70 or so businesses it owns and runs - although it still has billions invested in other companies too .
As Mr Buffett 's biographer , Alice Schroeder points out , " the conventional wisdom is that Warren Buffett sits in a room , buying and selling stocks all day .
But the reality is that since the 1960s , he 's been buying companies " .
Mr Buffett is now an executive , running a huge conglomerate .
Be an owner To Mr Buffett , the difference between owning a business outright and owning shares in it is only one of degree .
He has always bought shares for the long - term and , as a shareholder , thought of himself as buying a part of a business .

As he says , you should " think like an owner " .
Mr Buffett wants to invest in profitable businesses with good prospects rather than looking for undervalued shares .
Focusing on share prices , he says , makes you a mere speculator , whereas a real investor " looks to the asset itself to produce the return " .
He compares his approach to someone buying a farm : they would not worry about the price of the farm every day , but would focus instead on its productivity .
Mr Buffett 's brief communications with the chief executives of his businesses exhort them , too , to think long - term , rather than , as in most companies , to worry about the figures for the next quarter .
" They get a letter from me once every two years , " he says .
" It 's a page and a quarter long .
And that letter says ' treat the business like it 's the only business your family owns .
They can't sell it .
They 're going to own it for a hundred years ' . "
The same applies to his shareholders .
He communicates with them in a famous annual letter which , over decades , has given them , and the wider world , an insight into his thinking .
The process has weeded out speculators , and given him shareholders who think like him .
Irrational markets Mr Buffett says the turnover on Berkshire Hathaway shares is a tenth of that on most stocks .
" We look on our shareholders as partners .
They buy into Berkshire to be part of a business .
It 's something they expect to die with . "
The current financial crisis has put Mr Buffett 's message about long - term thinking to the test : Berkshire Hathaway 's businesses are in a mix of sectors , some of which ( construction , confectionery ) were more vulnerable to the downturn than others ( energy , insurance ) .

Berkshire shares lost almost half their peak value - and have since recovered to be about 25 % down on their 2008 peak .
At this year 's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha , 35,000 shareholders turned up to hear Mr Buffett 's take on things .
It looked as if his years of patient training had paid off .
He was still smiling , and telling people that the carnage in the markets was just what you should expect once in a while .
" If you take the couple of centuries we 've had , the 19th and the 20th , we 've had about 15 bad years in both centuries , " he told shareholders , " and we 'll have fifteen bad years in centuries to come .
" Capitalism overshoots , and market people do get irrationally exuberant sometimes , but that 's the nature of it .
You want a dynamic system , and you want a market system that 's free to make mistakes to some degree . "
Secret successor
Mr Buffett will be 80 next year , and is still showing no sign of slowing down or retiring .
Why would he when the financial roller coaster may be starting a slow climb from the bottom of a deep ravine ?
In a few years time , when Berkshire 's figures may be benefiting from the bargains he 's been picking up , well , that part of the cycle might just feel like the moment he and his fellow company directors have been contemplating for years - the day Berkshire faces life without Warren .
There are succession plans , but Mr Buffett , characteristically , wants to keep them simple .
He is not planning to emulate his friend ( and fellow director of Berkshire Hathaway ) Bill Gates , who arranged a " transition " which lasted a couple of years , as he stepped down from Microsoft to concentrate on his charity work .
Mr Buffett is thinking in terms of splitting his job - between a person to look after investing and another to concentrate on Berkshire 's owned businesses .
But he is not planning to name a successor until he is ready to leave .
" I mean , what would they do ? " he asks with a twinkle .
" Come and sit in my office all day , so I could chuck them the paper to read when I 'd finished with it ? "

I wanted to show you how Goldman Sachs " makes " money .
Go to www.stockcharts.com and look up the symbol ICE .
Over the past few days the stock has had two of its largest down bars EVER .
No one knew what was happening or why , yet the volume was exploding and there were no upticks even during the day .
As it was happening Goldman Sachs had a research note coming out on the stock , they gave the information that they were going to down grade the stock to their largest clients and their own trading floor .
But wait , you say that the SEC would call this insider trading !
That is true , but the SEC has been bought and paid for by the market makers years ago along with the congress .
The SEC has actually made this practice legal because they say it ’s not insider trading !
The bottom line is their research note dropping the stock from buy to neutral was HUGE information to the market place .
This is how Goldman Sachs has been raping and pillaging in the markets for years .
It ’s short term price manipulation but it ’s actually legal according to the SEC .
You notice on the chart that when they actually came out with the report ( yesterday ) that the stock went up : ) .
That is because all the large clients and Goldman 's traders all bought back the shares they shorted on the announcement .
It ’s called sell the rumor buy the news , or vice versa .
This strategy of theirs works even better on the upside since the general public and even traders in general like to buy more than sell stocks .
This is illegal activity and yet it occurs right in front of the SEC every stinking day !
Matt Taibbi ’s recent article about GS was completely wrong in its accusations , but 100 % right in the general idea .
They manipulate markets short term only ; long term trends are made by the fundamentals , and bubbles are made by the mob ( the public ) .
GS in reality can be caught up by the mob just like everyone else .
They had huge losses last year as oil dropped from 140 to 35 and their traders were crushed in October and November trying to buy the lows early .
The IPO scam is another way they " make " money .
They give their large clients access to the IPO 24 hours before it goes public and then they sell into the public buying on day one .
99 % of their money is made short term via this sort of scam activity and through their market - making transactions .
It was a beautiful screw job .
In 2000 they did this stuff all the time in tech stocks .
Dell would get smooshed one day for no apparent reason and then the next GS would downgrade them .
I thought you 'd appreciate seeing their slimy activities in real time and just how it is they " make " money .
MSNBC host Dylan Ratigan says the efforts of some congresspeople to kill the public health care option and limit access to the proposed health care exchange system is a sign that Congress is defending the “ corporate communism ” of the health care industry .
On MSNBC ’s Morning Meeting , Ratigan pointed to the fact that health insurers are exempt from anti-trust laws as proof of the “ communist ” nature of the health care industry .
ADVERTISEMENT
Anti-trust laws were enacted to prevent companies from forming market monopolies .
Health care companies are exempt from these laws , which is why , for example , BlueCross BlueShield is able to control 83 percent of Alabama ’s health insurance market , and why WellPoint is able to control 78 percent of the market in Maine .
( See the complete chart here . )
“ If you ’re looking for choice in your own health care or competition to break up the corporate communism that burdens our country at this point and prevents any of us from finding work — no no , your Senate is not working for you , there will be no competition , nor will there be any choice , ” Ratigan said .
Ratigan said the interplay between the health industry near - monopolies and their protectors in Congress amounts to “ a cancer on our nation . ”
Ratigan was referring to an amendment proposed by Oregon Democratic Senator Ron Wyden that would have allowed anyone with health insurance from an employer or a labor union to shop for health care on a so - called health insurance exchange .
Wyden withdrew that amendment last week after heavy pressure from business and labor leaders , meaning the health reform bill being debated in the Senate will allow only those without such insurance policies to use the exchange , rendering it useless for a majority of Americans .
Ratigan said the move to restrict the exchange was “ a great tactic .
It protected health insurers from having any real competition , perpetuating their corporate communism . …
These are literally people who are paying off our government to make sure they do n’t have to compete , whether it ’s the too - big - to - fail banks or in this case the health insurance companies . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
To prove his point , Ratigan drew attention to the Max Baucus Wheel of Health Care Contributions , a chart designed by the Sunlight Foundation and the Center for Responsive Politics that shows Montana Democratic Sen .
Max Baucus — the author of the current health care bill before Congress — took on average 3.5 times as much money from the health care industry as the average senator .
Last week , RAW STORY reported on the Wheel of Contributions and the discovery by political watchdogs that politicians are receiving more money from the health insurance industry because of the existence of “ contribution clusters ” — political donations from lobbyists whose clients had already donated directly to the politician .
“ This research puts a fine point on the connections — how the lobbyist contributions really complement and echo those of their clients , ” Sheila Krumholz of the Center for Responsive Politics told Ratigan .
“ But it is n’t a smoking gun , however … there is no proof of coordination just because there are all of these contributions coming from all of these sources . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The more I learn and see this , the more I suspect that we do n’t have a two - party system , we have a one - party system where it ’s those who have the money who control the Democrats and Republicans to ensure they do n’t have to compete , ” Ratigan said .
“ And everybody else gets screwed . ”

Duncan Campbell ( left ) took over lead vocals from brother Ali last year Reggae act UB40 have admitted they hate rehearsing their 1983 number one hit Red Red Wine .
Guitarist Robin Campbell said he and his bandmates - who are preparing for a tour of the UK - cannot bring themselves to practise the song .
" We hate rehearsing Red Red Wine , we 're bored to tears of it , " he said .
But he said the band continue to play it at shows because they know fans still love it .
UB40 begin their tour in Ireland next month .
" Very often in rehearsals we 'll just skip it because we 're so bored of it , but the second you do it to an audience , it changes , " he said .
" That 's one of the songs they 're there to hear , and you can be as tired of it as you like , but they 're not .
They have n't heard you sing it for several years .
It takes on a new life again . "
The band will tour with Duncan Campbell taking on lead vocal duties after his brother and original singer Ali quit the band last year .

Since I got back into Lisp again ( I had a wonderful flirtation with
it in University , but it was presented as a toy language , so I
did n’t stick with it ) , I ’ve been telling people how incredibly
freeing it is , and how I seem to be allergic to syntax .
I ’ve had a
hard time explaining this to other people , and finally hit on a way
to do it .
This essay is the result .
Before I get into this , some general comments on Lisp :
If you ’re saying “ Eww , how can you count all those parens ? ” , You ’re Doing It Wrong .
See scheme - style for how it actually works .
Note that this objection is different from “ I do n’t like all those parens ” , which is a perfectly legitimate personal choice , but see the rest of this essay .
.
See scheme - style for how it actually works .
Note that this objection is different from “ I do n’t like all those parens ” , which is a perfectly legitimate personal choice , but see the rest of this essay .
If you ’re saying “ But Lisp is a toy language ” , you ’re simply incorrect .
Unless you want to make one of those two points , please feel free to
email me about this essay .
Moving on .
I use an example out of Perl .
It does n’t actually
matter what the example means , I do n’t think , except that it ’s
setting a sub -set of a complex data structure hanging off the object
“ self ” .
Let ’s say we have :
$ self - >{' CONF '}->{' outerdatawindow'} = $ outerdatawindow ;
I have no idea how this would work in
CLOS off the top of my
head , but let ’s say it looks like this in CL :
( setf ( outerdatawindow ( CONF self ) ) outerdatawindow )
In both cases , I need to know :
what type of thing self is as a data structure
what the CONF slot is for , and what type of thing it holds
what the outerdatawindow slot is for , and what type of thing it holds
In the CL case , I also need to know :
what function application looks like
that the CONF and outerdatawindow functions are slot accessor functions
what setf does
It is important to know that the first one does n’t count to me :
no matter what language I ’m in , I need to know what function
application looks like .
On top of that , the last one does n’t really count either : it ’s just
a library function , every language has them , and I ’m always having
to look them up no matter what ; that ’s just how my brain works .
So , in my head at least , only one additional item of information is
needed for CL that would n’t be needed for any possible language .
In the perl case , I need to know :
what = does
what ; does
what $ does in both places , which are in my mind quite different : retrieving a value feels different than retreiving a reference to a value .
This is a problem with my mind rather than Perl , but that ’s what this whole essay is about anyways .
I probably would n’t have this problem if $ $ foo{ ‘ bar ’} did n’t work , but that just makes $ Incomprehensible Magic to me , so that every case of its use is a special case in my mind .
I probably would n’t have this problem if $ $ foo{ ‘ bar ’} did n’t work , but that just makes $ Incomprehensible Magic to me , so that every case of its use is a special case in my mind .
What -> does
What {...} does
Whether the quotes are actually necessary or not
In any given programming situation , for every one of the points
listed above , the odds of my having to look something up are , at a
bare minimum , 1 in 10 .
That is , if I ’ve been programming my ass off
in a language for days and I know this shit cold , for every chunk of
information like the ones above , there ’s still a 1 in 10 chance
I ’ll have forgotten it and have to look it up ; I keep many
standard library reference windows open when I code , always , and
often many language reference windows open .
The less familiar a language is , the higher that 1 in 10 goes , of
course , but it never goes lower than that , and I think 1 in 10 is a
pretty generous estimate ; the lower bound may be more like 1 in 5 .
So every chunk added to a statement is another seperate - die- roll
chance that I have to look something up .
In Lisp basically all I need to know is function application and
what the functions do and what ’s in the variables .
All inescapable .
Yes , lisp has special forms , but they ’re few and far between , and
I just treat them as functions anyways , because that ’s mostly
what they look like .
There was a conversation whith kpreid where I
realized that I was fucking up because of that , but mostly it works .
New pieces of syntax ( like $ or -> or whatever ) cannot be handled in
this fashion .
I think the difference between me and other people is that for other
people , after a while the syntactical bits stop couting as data that
one might forget , and that ’s never true with me .
They always count ,
and I routinely have to look them up , and that ’s on top of
having to look up functions routinely .
So every bit of syntax
gotten rid of makes me happy .
To give you a sense of scale here , I remember having to stop and
think about how to do function application whilst working with
Oz , when I was right in the thick of it .
Now ,
Oz ’s function application syntax is unusual , but I was doing at
least an hour in this language every single day , and it ’s not
that unusual .
No question that this whole issue is a problem
with my brain ; I just wanted to explain the problem once and for
all , since it ’s hard to convey to people .
It ’s worth noting that this may all be illusory .
I feel that
syntax - heavy languages have more places - per - line - of - code that my
memory can fail me , but that may not actually be true .
It may
simply be that looking up functions annoys me less , because it ’s
unavoidable .
Even if that ’s all it is , being less annoyed is
valuable all by itself .

President Robert Mugabe says Zimbabwe 's first high - level talks with top EU officials in seven years went well .
After the talks , in Harare , he again called for international sanctions imposed since disputed presidential election in 2002 to be lifted .
The EU team also praised the meeting but indicated it was not appropriate yet for sanctions to end and complained about the slow pace of reforms .
The EU team later met PM Morgan Tsvangirai .
' Good rapport '
Before going into the talks with the EU team , Mr Mugabe said : " We welcome you with open arms .
We hope our talks will be fruitful with a positive outcome . "
AT THE SCENE Andrew Harding , BBC News , Harare A smiling President Mugabe welcomed the European Union delegation with " open arms " , he said , and " with great expectations " .
But there has been no obvious breakthrough .
The EU team said they had complained to the president about the slow pace of political reform and about human rights violations and the rule of law .
After the meeting Mr Mugabe told journalists at State House that he had honoured the terms of Zimbabwe 's power sharing deal and it was time sanctions were lifted .
I asked him if he had any plans to step down .
He laughed and said he was " still young " he said targeted foreign sanctions against him and his allies were entirely responsible for the country 's economic collapse and he insisted he bore no responsibility for any of Zimbabwe 's problems .
Tentative thaw in EU - Zimbabwe ties
When he reappeared after they ended , he told the BBC the talks had gone well .
He said : " We established a good rapport , it was a friendly meeting .
Obviously they thought the Global Political Agreement was not working well . "
The Global Political Agreement is the power - sharing deal that was sealed a year ago , most importantly with Mr Tsvangirai .
Mr Mugabe said that " everything we were asked to do under GPA we have done " .
The EU team , led by Development Commissioner Karel De Gucht , expressed satisfaction with the talks , saying there had been " progress " in a " very open atmosphere " .
But the BBC's Andrew Harding , in Harare , says the EU team also pointed out the problems it had with the current situation .
ZIMBABWE SANCTIONS EU : 2002 to present
Assets freeze and travel ban on some Mugabe allies , arms - sale ban US : 2003 to present
Trade ban against 250 Zimbabwean individuals and 17 companies Other countries
Canada , Australia and UK among nations to have imposed their own targeted sanctions Sources : EU , Reuters , US treasury , UK Foreign Office
The team , which has described the visit as an attempt to reopen political dialogue with Zimbabwe , said it was not appropriate to lift sanctions at the moment or for major aid to start .
Mr de Gucht said he hoped the president realised the need for " more understanding between the three principals - himself , the prime minister and the vice - prime minister " .
Our correspondent says that one year on from the announcement of power - sharing , there remain serious doubts about human rights , the stalling of political reform and the good faith of President Mugabe and his supporters .
In a speech a day before meeting the delegation , Mr Mugabe had lashed out at the Western sanctions , accusing whites of wanting to " poke their nose into own our own affairs " .
" We have stood firm and we have refused to let go .
Zimbabwe - sanctions or no sanctions , Zimbabwe remains ours , " he told a meeting of his Zanu - PF youth wing in Harare .
Conditional removal Last week , African leaders had called for sanctions against the country to be lifted but Mr de Gucht said the measures had " no impact on the common population " .
The EU team will also be meeting Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai Sweden 's Development Minister Gunilla Carlsson and Mr de Gucht will be in the country until Sunday .
Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt , whose country currently holds the EU presidency , said last week that the EU was not considering lifting sanctions .
Long - time opposition leader Mr Tsvangirai wants a removal of sanctions to be conditional on how well the power - sharing deal signed a year ago has been implemented .
But last week the leaders of the Southern African Development Community ( Sadc ) rejected that proposal .
South African President Jacob Zuma , who has criticised Mr Mugabe in the past and was expected to side with Mr Tsvangirai , said there should be no conditions placed on the removal of sanctions .

All the major indices ended down over 2 % , with the NASDAQ losing 3 % , and the S&P 500 down 2.6 % .
The Dow , meanwhile , lost 200 , closing at 9509 -- suddenly 10,000 looks like a long ways away .

From the Mercury News : Silicon Valley office vacancies near 20 percent
Nearly one - fifth of Silicon Valley office space stood empty last quarter , while landlords lowered rents to try to retain tenants and attract new ones , according to a [ report from commercial real estate firm Grubb & Ellis ] released Friday .
...
The rising vacancy rate is " re-emphasizing that this is the slowest commercial real estate market the valley has seen since the dot - com bust in 2001 , " the report stated .
Empty space for research and development , the one - to three - story buildings where so many smaller tech companies reside , is also beginning to pile up , said Dick Scott , Grubb & Ellis ' managing director in Silicon Valley .
...
" There was a temporary period of time where we all were naively optimistic that R&D would hold up .
But it 's taking a hit now , " he said .
...
Said the Grubb & Ellis report : " Expect asking rents to decrease as companies put unoccupied space onto the market . "
Some of the increase in the vacancy rate was because of new office space coming online , but it sounds like Grubb & Ellis expects a significant amount of sublease space to come on the market too .
That is usually a bad sign for rents - and also suggests companies do n't expect much growth .
( CNN ) -- A Dutch court Friday ruled against letting a 14 - year - old girl sail solo around the world , saying she is not experienced enough to make the trip on her own .
Laura Dekker would be allowed to travel from July 1 of next year if she fulfills certain requirements the court established for her to sail .
In August , Dutch authorities placed Dekker under state care for two months , following her parents ' refusal to prevent her from undertaking the potentially dangerous voyage .
Dekker is seeking to become the youngest person to sail solo around the world .
The current record holder is 17 - year - old British teenager Mike Perham who completed his nine - month voyage in August .

All three men say they have been illegally incarcerated at the controversial prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , where the U.S. military has detained 550 suspected al - Qaeda and Taliban operatives for nearly three years .
The stories of how they came to be swept up in the United States ' worldwide , anti-terrorism dragnet are emerging in federal court in Washington , D.C.
Their cases offer a more complex picture of Guantanamo captives than what has been described by U.S. officials , who generally have portrayed men held in Cuba as fighters picked up on the battlefields of Afghanistan .
The three detainees are among more than 60 Guantanamo captives who have taken advantage of a Supreme Court ruling in June that allows them to challenge their detentions in federal court .
The ruling has set the stage for federal judges to force the Bush administration to reveal who is being held at this remote U.S. Navy base — and why .
( Related story : Trial delayed )
Since the Pentagon began transferring detainees to the base in January 2002 , U.S. officials have described Guantanamo captives collectively as " the worst of the worst , " hardened terrorists determined to kill Americans .
Court papers filed in recent weeks suggest that the government indeed could be holding al - Qaeda and Taliban fighters and financiers of al - Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden 's network .
But the papers also reveal that some Guantanamo detainees — including Al - Rawi , Hassan and Boudella — were not captured in Afghanistan , and that the reasons for holding them are less clear .
Many of the detainees say they were taken into custody because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time ; others say their words were twisted or misunderstood by military translators .
Some detainees have hinted that they were tortured into confessing about having ties to terrorism .
The truth may be elusive because the U.S. government , citing national security concerns , is relying heavily on secret evidence to justify holding many of the detainees .
The Bush administration 's tactics have led some legal analysts to question whether the administration is violating the spirit of the Supreme Court 's ruling .
" We are all deeply concerned about national security , " says Muneer Ahmad , an American University law professor .
" But the government should not be holding people without providing a factually based reason for doing so . "
Cases challenge fairness
After the Supreme Court 's ruling , Bush administration officials predicted there would be chaos in U.S. courts as lawyers for Guantanamo detainees rushed to file claims seeking their release .
So far , that has not happened .
The Center for Constitutional Rights in New York , the civil liberties group that brought the original cases before the high court , has lined up law firms to represent groups of detainees in lawsuits filed in Washington .
Fourteen cases have been filed on behalf of more than 60 captives .
They include nine petitions filed since June .
All of the cases challenge not only the detentions , but also the fairness of administrative hearings that the Pentagon began in July to review each detainee 's situation and determine whether he should continue to be held indefinitely as an " enemy combatant . "
President Bush says he can hold the captives because they violated the laws of war by failing to wear military insignia , among other things , and that they must remain in custody to keep them from rejoining the fight against the USA .
The government 's strategy is to use the review panels — known as Combatant Status Review Tribunals — to convince federal judges that the detainees have received as much due process as they deserve , considering that they are foreigners who are not entitled to the panoply of rights that U.S. citizens enjoy .
Justice Department lawyers are taking a hard line against the detainees ' claims in federal court with a different take on the Supreme Court 's ruling .
They say the court based its ruling on a statute , not the Constitution , and that the foreign detainees should have no legal rights such as the right to counsel .
Attorneys for the detainees counter that the high court would not have invited captives to file lawsuits without allowing them to have lawyers .
Last month , U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar - Kotelly ruled that an array of U.S. laws allow judges to ensure that captives have lawyers to help them in court .
But her ruling has no effect on the Pentagon 's decision to bar detainees from having lawyers to help them before the review panels .
As of Wednesday , 295 such hearings had been held at Guantanamo , without lawyers for detainees .
Only one detainee has been determined not to be an enemy combatant ; he was released .
The hearings are split into public and secret sessions .
The media have observed some public sessions , which detainees also can attend .
Only military officers can attend the secret sessions .
Civil libertarians are concerned that detainees might be incriminating themselves by testifying before the panels without a lawyer 's help .
Several detainees have answered questions posed by the panels , the court papers reveal .
The government 's aggressive tactics do n't end there .
The military 's review panels are using affidavits by captives ' relatives — filed in the detainees ' civil lawsuits — to justify detentions .
The panels are citing inconsistencies between what the detainees and their relatives say about matters such as a captive 's relationship with his father , or how and why other prisoners went to Pakistan or Afghanistan .
Capture was ' a mistake '
The military has held hearings to review the status of Al - Rawi , Hassan and Boudella and has determined that the men should continue to be held at Guantanamo .
Human rights advocates say many detainees were not fighting the United States , but were captured in the chaos of war or sold to U.S. forces by bounty hunters .
According to court papers , Hassan , 25 , says his capture was " a mistake " that occurred in a college dorm in Pakistan , not on a battlefield in Afghanistan .
He says he believes he was taken into custody because he was with men from Saudi Arabia , Libya , Russia and Yemen .
Al - Rawi , 37 , says the U.S. military cut a deal with Gambian officials and kidnapped him while a petition for his release was pending in British courts .
U.S. court papers say he is detained because he admitted helping Abu Qatada , a London preacher with alleged ties to al - Qaeda , find an apartment , among other things .
Al - Rawi , who had lived in Britain for 18 years , says he was a go - between for Qatada and British intelligence agents .
At his review hearing , Al - Rawi sought testimony from several British agents , including some he says visited him at Guantanamo .
British authorities refused to provide the agents , whom Al - Rawi says he knew only by their first names .
Boudella , 39 , was one of six Algerians arrested in Bosnia in October 2001 on suspicion of plotting to attack the U.S. and British embassies in Sarajevo .
A day after the Bosnian Supreme Court ordered their release because they had been held for three months without charges — and as their relatives waited at the prison gate — the Algerians were turned over to the U.S. military and then were taken to Guantanamo .
The military review panel was impressed with Boudella 's claim that he is not anti-American , but it felt compelled to keep him in custody because of secret evidence it had reviewed , court papers say .
But the panel took the unusual step of recommending that Boudella be considered for release when he receives an annual evaluation on whether he continues to pose a threat to U.S. interests .
Justice Department lawyers say in court papers that the circumstances surrounding such captures are " quintessential political questions " for the president — not the courts — to decide .
They say that although Afghanistan was a home base for al - Qaeda before the U.S. - led coalition ousted the Taliban leadership there , the terrorist network 's far - flung activities " have hardly been confined to that country . "
Secret evidence elusive
The court papers also shed light on Guantanamo captives who were caught during the war in Afghanistan .
Abdullah Kamal Abdullah Kamal Al Kandari , a Kuwaiti Ministry of Electricity and Water employee , says he went to Afghanistan after the Sept. 11 attacks to fulfill a duty under Islam to help the poor .
In justifying the military 's reasons for holding Al Kandari at Guantanamo , a review panel cited $ 15,000 he took to Afghanistan and a Casio watch he wore that investigators say is a type often used by terrorists to set off bombs .
" If I had known that , I would have thrown ( the watch ) away , " Al Kandari , 31 , told the panel , according to court papers .
He explained that the watch is popular in Kuwait because its compass can be used to help Muslims pray in the direction of Mecca and its alarm can be set to remind them to pray five times a day .
Al Kandari said he did not know why his name was on an al - Qaeda operative 's computer , other than because Al Kandari was " famous " as a member of Kuwait 's national volleyball team .
" I swear , they do n't know me , " he said .
" The problem is the secret ( evidence ) .
I can't defend myself . "
The review panel found Al Kandari 's testimony " somewhat helpful " but said it " relied heavily " on secret evidence that indicates " he is believed to be a member of al - Qaeda . "
Fouad Mahmoud Hasan Al Rabiah , a Kuwaiti businessman suspected of delivering money to bin Laden in July 2001 , also told a review panel that he had gone to Afghanistan to help the poor .
Al Rabiah , 45 , who denied having any ties with al - Qaeda , said in his review hearing that he weighed 240 pounds when he had to ride a small motorbike while being taken into Afghanistan by guides .
" If I were bringing money to bin Laden , do n't you think he would have sent me a car ? "
Al Rabiah quipped .
The military panel did n't believe him .
" There was more to the story than the detainee would have the tribunal believe , " it said in its report , referring to secret evidence .
Teen among captives Attorneys for Omar Khadr , a Canadian citizen , say he is a boy who is being punished as a man .
At age 15 , Khadr was among the youngest captives from the war in Afghanistan .
Shortly after he turned 16 in September 2002 , he was taken to Guantanamo and housed with adults .
Khadr 's grandmother says he was wounded and nearly blinded in one eye when a house in which he was hiding was bombed and overtaken by U.S. forces .
But the review panel relied on reports that Khadr had acknowledged throwing a grenade that killed a U.S. soldier during the battle .
The military also says he planted land mines in an area used by U.S. convoys .
Court papers reveal that the panels also rely on evidence from informants who are among the Guantanamo detainees .
One detainee said he had seen Faruq Ali Ahmed carrying an assault weapon and wearing a uniform at bin Laden 's private airport in Afghanistan .
Ahmed , 20 , a Yemeni , denied the allegations but acknowledged that he had associated with Taliban members because he had taught the Koran in Afghanistan .
A military officer assigned to be Ahmed 's " personal representative " before the panel wrote that he believes the detainee lied about Ahmed — and other detainees — to get better treatment at Guantanamo .
Turn your heads if it helps .
Put your hands over your ears and sing loudly to drown out the noise .
Yell at anyone who raises the subject .
But it 's still there .
Football is beginning to scare the hell out of football players , and at some point , it 's going to have to start scaring the hell out of you .
As evidence slowly but surely grows from scientists and studies , even one commissioned by the NFL , that the game itself at nearly every level is bad for the human brain , you 're going to have to come to grips with the notion that your favorite sport is not that much different than boxing - a guilty pleasure .
The most disturbing tale of all , perhaps , was a submission from Michael Oriard , the 61 - year - old former Kansas City Chiefs offensive lineman and now an associate dean of English at Oregon State , who wrote a Deadspin.com piece Friday admitting that he essentially has been replaying his entire career , play by play , to try to find the moment he might have started the road to early - onset dementia , or worse .
Telling quotes follow .
" I 've been reading these reports less as someone who has been writing about football for many years than as someone , 61 years old , who played a lot of football a long time ago , and as the father of a son who has played more recently .
The research on the later consequences of early head trauma raises the possibility that my son and I , too , might have tiny bombs planted in our brains with fuses of indeterminate length . "
And :
" As a father , rather than a former player , the research suggesting that football can do long - term damage to even high school players is particularly chilling .
My younger son , who played football , proved to be susceptible to concussions , getting more or less one per season from about the sixth grade through high school .
Lots of parents know the routine : I would awaken him every few hours through the night to ask him his address and phone number , then let him fall back asleep after he delivered the correct answer .
Fortunately , he never played for a coach who tried to get him back onto the field before our doctor had cleared him .
His mother and I are not obsessing about the possibilities of long - term effects , but given parents ' unlimited capacity to worry about our children , that would change the moment he started complaining about headaches . "
And :
" I feel enormous sadness for teammates and other former NFL players who are not as fortunate as I still appear to be .
And the future of football seems uncertain right now .
The Congressional hearing on brain damage to NFL players will not resolve the crucial questions about just how dangerous football is .
For now , parents have more reasons than ever to be wary of letting their sons play football . "
Oriard is not an anti-football crusader , either .
He is a reasonable person who sees football 's benefits as well as its dangers .
He has no axes to grind about his NFL pension , as he did n't play enough to get one .
He wants us all to wrestle with this as he is wrestling with it , and he wants us not to dismiss it as merely some knee - jerk , anti-fun reaction to a couple of academic papers .
He wants us to take our brains , and those of our children seriously , and that means asking bedrock questions about our national sport and our roles in it .
He has no answers .
We have no answers .
But we now have questions , from the Pop Warner coach who might not know his craft as well as he should , to the athletic trainers who will spend more of their working lives wrestling with this , and all the way to the man who leads the largest and most successful sporting organization in the nation .
Again , Oriard :
" We need much more research - on large number of former players , over a long period of time - to know just how dangerous football is to the human brain .
Knowing the answer might be a blow not only to the NFL but to all lovers of football .
But continuing to not know might be considerably more painful for those who play the game .
And the NFL has to worry not only about potential liability for the disabilities of former players , but also about the game 's future .
One of Roger Goodell 's worst nightmares has to be the possibility that football will come to be regarded as boxing is today : a potential and very violent path to celebrity and wealth that only the most economically desperate would consider and that the vast majority of Americans find unpalatable . "
In the meantime , there are 13 NFL , two UFL , four CFL , 206 college and thousands of high school games that have or will be played this weekend .
Some of those players , coaches , administrators and fans will be thinking , perhaps , about Oriard 's words .
If not , they can't say they were n't told .
There 's water on the moon .
As reported by The Times , us , io9 and The Mail amongst others .
But you might be wondering why it's the The Times ' Delhi Reporter who got the scoop and not their Science Correspondent ?
And why the Times posted this story last night and other organisations ( including the BBC ) seem to have been taken by surprise and did n't have anything online till this morning ?
Well in reality most science journalists have known about this story for a few days now .
But the story had been embargoed by Science , the journal publishing the research .
So anyone publishing the story ahead of time would be punished .
If all went to plan this research would suddenly emerge via a big Nasa press conference .
Every news outlet around the world would report this amazing new discovery at the same time .
In fact the last few days have been a behind - the - scenes battle between established media and the internet .
With journalists from the mass media knowing all about the story and being unable to say anything .
While bloggers and twitterers do everything they can to find out what is going on .
In fact as Birmingham science journalist David Whitehouse explained to me you can blame most of this on Twitter ;
Space stories in particular seem to be prone to this .
You have a very active blogosphere and Twitter has made it even worse .
It 's fabulous for sharing gossip but it's also made life hell for this sort of thing .
Here 's what happened .
On Monday Science sends a tip - sheet out to some 2000 journalists alerting them to the moon water story and telling them it will all be announced at a big Nasa press conference on Thursday .
Nasa then sends out another embargoed announcement with a " cast list " of scientists attending the press conference .
And once the blogosphere got hold of that it does n't take long to work out what the scientist have been researching and what the big announcement is .
So now you have thousands of science journalists who know what 's going on but can't say anything and thousands of bloggers who do n't know what 's going on but want to find out .
Then the other parts of the mainstream media start to report the rumours about moon water .
Which is how the story finally emerges in the mainstream press in India , where interest is high because India 's Chandrayaan probe is partly responsible for this data .
This is then picked up by the Times ' Delhi correspondent and makes the top of their website as an exclusive .
Eventually the journal Science sees the cat is out of the bag , drop the embargo at 22.57 our time last night and all the British science journalists who 've obeyed the embargo wake up to find they 've missed one of the biggest days for the moon since we walked on it .
Even those imposing embargoes find they can sometimes cause trouble .
Press Office for the University of Warwick Peter Dunn told me ;
If you embargo something for seven am then Today love you but the Ten hate you .
Embargoing for American time annoys the Brits and visa versa .
Embargoes do have their uses and sometimes ignoring them can have consequences .
I know of one university official who received death threats because of an embargo breaking story .
But in these days of a global , 24 - hour news media the process appears to be broken .
You can't shut up bloggers and you can't shut down Twitter .
The only thing that can go is the embargo system itself .
Speaking of Twitter if you can't beat them , join them .
Follow me here , David Whitehouse here and Peter Dunn here .
Former leading Official IRA member Bobby McKnight , 71 , breaks his 40 - year silence in a new book on the organisation published today .
Belfast man McKnight , who in 1969 was a member of the IRA command staff , states that along with another man he drove to Dublin Airport in September 1969 .
There he met then minister for finance Charles Haughey ’s brother , Jock , and took delivery of several cases of weaponry , which filled his pickup truck , these were then transported to IRA members in Dublin .
In The Lost Revolution – The Story of the Official IRA and the Workers Party , written by Irish Examiner journalist Scott Millar and historian Brian Hanley , McKnight confirms his role in the arms plot which resulted in the major political crisis of the 1970 Arms Trial .
He is the first persondirectly involved in the transportation of arms shipments organised by government ministers to the IRA to confirm the existence of the plot .
McKnight confirms there were contacts between the IRA and Fianna Fáil representatives even prior to the outbreak of widescale violence in Northern Ireland in August 1969 .
The book also reveals the extent of government fears about a resurgent IRA south of the border and plans to split the organisation along left / right lines , a strategy which aided the creation of the Provisional IRA .
A Department of Justice cabinet memo , dated March 18 , 1969 , whose contents are revealed for the first time , states : “ In different parts of the country units of the IRA ( and Sinn Féin ) are uneasy about the new left - wing policy of their leadership and about theviolent methods that are being adopted in the destruction of private property .
“ Their uneasiness needs to be brought to the surface in some way with a consequent fragmentation of the organisation .
It is suggested by the Department of Justice that the Government should promote an active political campaign in that regard . ”
The memo indicates that Jack Lynch ’s cabinet was discussing plans to split the IRA at least five months prior to the outbreak of major violence , and the death of civilians , in the North .
Within nine months the IRA had split into socialist Official and more traditional Provisional factions .
A Simple Extractive Summarisation System
This post talks you through the code of a simple extractive summarisation system written in Python .
There was a bit of interest in a summariser posted to reddit a few days ago , which inspired me to do some tinkering .
I ’ve never really engaged with the extensive summarisation literature , and I doubt I ’ll be publishing in it anytime soon .
I mostly built this for fun , and to teach myself a little about publishing an application with django and Google App Engine .
The system can be found at http://toolongdr.appspot.com
( at least while I ’m within my free quota ) .
The version at app engine is slightly different from the one described below , as I ’ve added a few optimisations to fit within the memory limit and make my CPU time stretch a little further .
You can find a version of the GAE ready code here , under the FreeBSD license .
Overview
We can divide the system into three basic components :
Text pre-processor .
This handles things like dividing the document into sentences , dividing the sentences into words , normalising away suffixes , eliminating common words , etc .
The sentence selector .
This is the engine of the system .
We will base our selection criteria on word frequencies .
This is a common starting point for many NLP tasks .
Sentence sorter .
This sorts the selected sentences to produce a pleasing summary .
We will simply order the sentences by their position in the document .
The Summariser Class
class Summariser ( object ) : def __call__ ( self , doc , n ) : " " " Return the N most pertinent sentences of a document , in the order in which they occur " " " # A ' bag - of - words ' is a sparse vector # of token frequencies .
docBow = doc.bagOfWords #
Get N most similar .
to pN = sorted ( doc , key=lambda s : self.similarity( docBow , s.bagOfWords ) ) [-n :]
#
Sort back into document order .
return sorted ( topN , key=lambda s : s.position ) def similarity ( self , docBow , sentBow ) : #
Sum the frequencies of each token in the sentence # in the rest of the document return sum ( ( docBow [t ] - f ) * f for t , f in sentBow.items ( ) )
The Summariser .
__call__ function takes the processed document and performs two sorts , trimming the document down to N sentences after the first sort by similarity .
The similarity score for each sentence is defined as the sum of the frequency of its words in other sentences of the document .
We exclude the sentence itself , so that we avoid selecting long sentences that contain terms not in the rest of the document .
The idea here is to find sentences that are prototypical of the document — that is , the most like the rest of the document , in terms of their word frequency distribution .
Pre-processing with nltk
The summariser expects the document to have the text divided into sentences , the sentences divided into words , and word frequencies counted within both .
To do this , we call some functions from nltk
The pre-processing stage takes the document from a raw string to a list of sentences , each of which contains a list of tokens .
We will also index the tokens in the document into a “ bag - of - words ” : a sparse vector that stores each word ’s frequency .
This is implemented as a defaultdictionary .
The Document and Sentence classes look like this :
from collections import defaultdict from nltk.
tokenize import sent_tokenize as sent_tokenise from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize as word_tokenise class Document ( list ) : def __init__ ( self , ** kwargs ) : " " " Build a list of sentences and a bag of words " " " list.__init__( self ) if ' text ' in kwargs : text = kwargs .
pop ( ' text ' ) elif ' url ' in kwargs : text = self._urlToText ( kwargs.pop ( 'url ' ) ) else : raise StandardError , " Document requires text or url " assert not kwargs bow = defaultdict ( int ) for i , sentenceStr in enumerate ( sent_tokenise ( text ) ) : sentence = Sentence ( sentenceStr , i ) self.append ( sentence ) for k , v in sentence .bagOfWords.items ( ) : bow[k ] += v self .
bagOfWords = bow class Sentence ( list ) : def __init__( self , sentenceStr , position ) : self.string = cgi.escape(sentenceStr ) # Lowercase the first word if sentence Str [ 0 ] .isupper ( ) : letters = list ( sentenceStr ) letters [ 0 ] = letters [ 0 ] . lower ( ) sentenceStr = ' '.join( letters ) tokens = word_tokenise ( sentenceStr ) bow = defaultdict ( int ) for token in tokens : # Normalise for morphology and case , # and exclude common words term = standardise ( token ) if term : bow [ term ] += 1 self.append ( term ) self .
bagOfWords = bow self .
position = position
All the real work here is done by the nltk Punkt sentence boundary detector , and the tokeniser .
These tasks are n’t that interesting , but they ’re surprisingly hard to get just right .
Sentence boundary detection is a good example of this : good solutions are much more complicated than you might think .
I would advise against rolling your own sentence boundary detector with a regular expression , for the same reason regular expressions are a poor choice for parsing html : it ’s an error - prone strategy that ’s fundamentally not powerful enough for the task .
Use the good solutions that work right out of the box .
Speaking of html parsing , the process that extracts text from web pages is , in my opinion , the weakest part of the system .
I ’d really appreciate feedback on a better way to do this .
The function looks like this :
whiteRE = re.compile ( r'\s +') constraintsRE = re.compile( u'^[ ^\u2022 ] |[.!? ] $ ') def _urlToText ( self , url ) : " " " ( Terrible ) text extraction using that ugly swamp BeautifulSoup " " " page = urllib2.urlopen ( url ) soup = BeautifulSoup ( page ) body = soup. findAll ( ' body ' ) body = body [ 0 ] if body else soup parElements = [ p for p in body ( ' p ' ) if not p.attrs ] brPars = [ p for p in body ( True ) \ if p ( ' br ' , recursive = False ) ] for node in brPars : for par in node.fetchText ( True , recursive = False ) : parElements.append ( par ) paragraphs = [ ] for paragraph in parElements : if isinstance ( paragraph , unicode ) : text = paragraph else : text = ' '.join(paragraph.fetchText( True ) ) text = self.whiteRE.sub(' ' , text.strip ( ) ) if self.constraintsRE.search( text ) : paragraphs.append( text ) title = soup. find ( ' title ' ) . string return title , '
'.join ( paragraphs )
This method looks for text under p elements , and text that is the sibling of br elements .
A few ad hoc constraints were added from manual testing .
This is the part of the program I ’m least happy with , and I ’d love to hear about a more principled solution to finding the body text of an arbitrary page .
I ’m also quite unhappy with the implementation .
Initially I wrote this with pyquery instead of BeautifulSoup , but Google App Engine does not support lxml .
Boo and hiss by starring this issue .
I really do n’t like BeautifulSoup .
It ’s slow , and I find the maze of aliases in the interface incredibly annoying .
Addressing Zipf ’s Law
The pre-processing and summarisation code presented so far is enough to do the job .
However , we can improve the accuracy of the summariser by writing in just a touch more linguistic sensitivity .
Most words in a language are rare , which can be problematic when your application works by counting word frequencies .
To be more precise , word frequencies follow a power law distribution , an observation known as Zipf ’s law .
This means that our frequency distributions will generally be quite sparse , making lexical frequencies less meaningful .
There are a few standard tactics we can deploy to address this .
Standardising Word Forms
The first set of tweaks are stemming , stopping and case normalisation — processes I collectively refer to as “ standardisation ” .
Stemming is the removal of inflexional and derivational suffixes .
For instance , both archeologist and archeology would get stemmed to archeolog .
This might look weird , but it means the terms will match , allowing us to count them together as one term .
Stemming loses some precision , but on the whole it ’s often beneficial when you ’re trying to model the document ’s topic .
I used the nltk implementation of Porter ‘s algorithm .
The ( ugly ) source for this can be viewed here .
Stopping addresses the other side of the problem caused by the unbalanced frequency distribution of words .
Grammatical terms , such as “ the ” and “ of ” , are far more frequent than the interesting content words .
It is therefore useful to discard them from our counts .
I do this with the stop list provided with nltk .
Finally , another possibility is to normalise away case variation .
I ’ve chosen not to do this , because I do n’t want to confuse proper nouns with common nouns .
Instead I just lower case the first word of the sentence .
This will be wrong for sentences that start with proper nouns , but I did n’t want to use a more complicated process , such as part - of - speech tagging .
I implement the standardise processes as a private class inside a module , with only an instance made public ..
This centralises them , so that I can be sure all tokens are being standardised in the same way .
import _stops import nltk.stem.porter as _porter class _ Standardise ( object ) : def __init__ ( self ) : self . stemmer = lambda word : word self .
stopWords = {} self.lower = False def __call__( self , string ) : if string .
lower ( ) in self .
stopWords : return None if self.lower : string = string.lower ( ) stemmed = self.stemmer( string ) return stemmed def config ( self , ** kwargs ) : stemmer = kwargs .pop ( ' stemming ' ) if stemmer == ' porter ' : self.stemmer = _porter .PorterStemmer ( ) . stem_word else : raise StandardError , " Unknown stemmer " , stemmer if kwargs . pop ( ' stopping ' ) : self.stopWords = _stops.nltkStops self.lower = bool ( kwargs.pop ( ' lower ' ) ) standardise = _ Standardise ( )
TF - IDF Weighting
There ’s actually a way that we can use the imbalanced frequency distribution of word occurrences to our advantage , to discover what a document is really about more reliably .
Imagine we have a document where two words occur 5 times each : professional and archeologist .
It seems reasonable to assume that archeologist is a much stronger clue about the document ’s topic , and we should weight sentences that contain this word higher so that hopefully they make it into the summary .
The reason archeologist is a better indication is that we are more surprised to see it .
What we want , then , are statistics about how often a word appears in the language as a whole .
Word which are rare overall will be weighted highly ; words which are common will receive a low weight .
This is called TF - IDF weighting , for term frequency * inverse document frequency .
The weight is calculated by taking the log of the inverse percentage of documents in a sample that the word has occurred in .
I used a sample of 800,000 pages from the English Wikipedia to determine the document frequencies .
The log is taken to avoid having the IDF part dominate the term frequency part .
Consider that we would be weighting single occurrence words by 800,000 if we used a linear weight .
Apart from some boring code to read in the document frequencies and turn them into IDF weights , the TF - IDF weighted summariser simply overrides the similarity method of the Summariser :
class TFIDFSummariser ( Summariser ) : " " " Scores sentences by TF - IDF weighted token frequencies " " " def __init__( self ) : Summariser.__init__( self ) #
The number of documents the frequencies were drawn from .
n = 818741.0 self.idfs = self._loadIDFs(n ) def _loadIDFs ( self , n ) : dfLoc = localPath ( 'wiki_doc_freqs.txt ' ) dfs = collections.defaultdict( int ) # Convenience for codecs.open . lines = utf8open(dfLoc).read ( ) .strip ( ) .split ( '
') # Read in the document freqs .
#
Have to do this first because we collapse some freqs # through standardisation .
for line in lines : token , freq = line.split ( '\t ' ) token = standardise ( token ) if token : dfs[ token ] += int ( freq ) #
Turn the frequencies into IDF weights .
idfs = collections.defaultdict( float ) for token , freq in dfs.items ( ) : idf = log ( n / freq , 10 ) idfs [ token ] = idf return idfs def similarity ( self , docBow , sentBow ) : idfs = self.idfs #
Apply the IDF weight to each term .
return sum ( [ f *( docBow [t ] - f ) * idfs [t ] for t , f in sentBow.items ( ) ] )
This is a little less efficient than applying the IDF weights to the document vector directly , since we may have to weigh the same term multiple times for different sentences .
However , I doubt this will make much difference to overall running time , and it allows a design I think is a little nicer , as the variation is confined to the similarity method .
That ’s it for now …
Well , that ’s the simple extractive summariser , and a tweaked one with TF - IDF .
If there ’s sufficient interest , I ’ll follow this up with a little evaluation experiment .
Summarisation is difficult to evaluate , because quality is subjective , but I have a plan for what seems to me to be a reasonable approximation .
The conservative firebrand David Horowitz has declared the Obama White House a " radical regime . "
For the Republican radio host Sean Hannity , the ousted ex-communist " green jobs " czar Van Jones " signifies the radicalism of this administration . "
Even Andy Williams , the Branson crooner who sang " Moon River " and " Days of Wine and Roses , " has joined the chorus , telling Radio Times this week that Barack Obama is " following Marxist theory . "
For a chunk of the right — the portion that defines itself by its opposition to " the left " — that 's the best explanation for the country 's recent political path : Washington has been seized by radicals .
But compared to a real radical , Obama is about as middle of the road as Andy Williams ' music .
Yes , he gave a job to Van Jones , and if you search his administration you 'll find yet more hires whose views are well to the left of most of the country .
If you looked through George W. Bush 's administration , you 'd find hires with views well to the right of most of the country : Eric Keroack , say , the critic of contraception who landed a job atop the family planning office at the Department of Health and Human Services .
It 's an ideological spoils system , patronage paid to the factions that make up a party 's base .
And sometimes it has policy consequences , so it 's worth monitoring closely .
Yet most people on the right will tell you , quite accurately , that the Bush years did n't do much to shift the country toward greater social or economic conservatism .
I expect most people on the left will say something similar when Obama exits office .
Thus far , the president 's domestic agenda has been many things , but radical it is n't .
Radicals make sudden turns .
Obama sometimes slams his foot on the accelerator — just look at projected spending for the next few years — but he hardly ever tries to change direction .
Radicals tear down centers of power .
When Obama is faced with a crumbling institution , his first instinct is to prop it up .
That was most obviously true with the bailouts , a series of corporate preservation programs that began before he took office and have only increased since then .
Candidate Obama voted for the Troubled Asset Relief Program , the 2008 bailout for failing financial institutions , and he personally intervened to urge skeptical liberals to support it .
After Congress refused to authorize a bailout of the car companies , Obama followed George W. Bush in ignoring the plain language of the law and funneling funds to them anyway .
Like Bush before him , Obama took advantage of such moments to adjust the institutional relationship between these nominally private businesses and the state : firing the head of General Motors , urging the company to consolidate brands , pushing for new controls on Wall Street pay .
But the institutions themselves were preserved , in some cases enriched .
The radical thing to do would have been to let them collapse .
And no , I 'm not using " radical " as a euphemism for " free - market libertarian . "
A radical Obama still might have extended assistance to the people displaced by the corporate failures , perhaps even setting up a generous guaranteed income scheme .
He might have broken up the big banks .
He might have done all sorts of things , some wiser than others .
But he would not have strengthened the corporate - state partnerships bequeathed to him by Bush .
After the bailouts we had the " stimulus " package , which boiled down to this :
You 're cutting back on unsustainable consumption ?
Here : Spend more !
Around the same time we got the cash for clunkers program , which took that same impulse and added incentives that undermined the salvage business and the second - hand car trade — markets that are far more decentralized , dynamic , and open to the participation of the poor than the automakers that accepted Obama 's largesse .
Now we have health care reform .
Here you might actually expect the president to veer in a new direction and let a powerful institution die .
After all , it 's been only six years since he described himself as " a proponent of a single - payer , universal health care plan , " and if he were serious about that it would mean the end of the private health insurance industry .
Single payer is n't on the table right now , but liberal Democrats are trying to push a " public option " — a government - run alternative for people who'd like to opt out of the available private plans — into the legislation .
And the public option is , in the words of single - payer advocate Mark Schmitt , " a kind of stealth single - payer . "
So in health care at least , Obama 's a radical , right ?
I do n't think so , for two reasons .
First , it 's increasingly unlikely that a public option will be a part of the bill that emerges , in which case we 'll be left with an enormous boondoggle for the industry : a law requiring every American to buy health insurance or else face legal sanctions .
Every other powerful institution in the health sector already supports the president 's proposals .
Indeed , the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America , the American Medical Association , and the Federation of American Hospitals are sponsoring a multi-million - dollar ad campaign on the measures ' behalf .
If the public - option - free version of ObamaCare becomes the face of reform , do n't be surprised if the insurers join them .
Second , and more important , a system with more government - provided insurance , even one with only government - provided insurance , would still accept the institutional premises of the present medical system .
Consider the typical American health care transaction .
On one side of the exchange you 'll have one of an artificially limited number of providers , many of them concentrated in those enormous , faceless institutions called hospitals .
On the other side , making the purchase , is not a patient but one of those enormous , faceless institutions called insurers .
The insurers , some of which are actual arms of the government and some of which merely owe their customers to the government 's tax incentives and shape their coverage to fit the government 's mandates , are expected to pay all or a share of even routine medical expenses .
The result is higher costs , less competition , less transparency , and , in general , a system where the consumer gets about as much autonomy and respect as the stethoscope .
Radical reform would restore power to the patient .
Instead , the issue on the table is whether the behemoths we answer to will be purely public or public - private partnerships .
So I can't agree with Horowitz , Hannity , or Andy Williams .
The president could pal around with militiamen , hook a money hose from the Treasury to ACORN HQ , and sleep each night with a Zapatista plush doll , but as long as his chief concern is preserving and protecting the country 's largest corporate enterprises , the biggest beneficiaries of his reign will be at the core of the American establishment .

The technique was pioneered at Maidstone Hospital 's breast cancer unit A new technique using tiny bubbles to detect cancer has been developed by clinicians at a hospital in Kent .
Fifty - four patients were tested in the " microbubble " study at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust .
The results , which were published in the British Journal of Surgery , suggested that breast cancer patients could avoid repeat surgery .
Dr Ali Sever , consultant radiologist , who led the study , said the tests transform the way they treat patients .
He said : " This is a world first .
The test only takes a few minutes to perform and has transformed the way we care for patients . "
Fine needle biopsy Normally , while undergoing surgery to remove breast cancer , surgeons routinely recommend that patients also have an operation to remove glands in their armpit to check if they are cancerous .
It is found during the operation with the aid of a coloured dye and is removed for testing .
If the nodes are found to be cancerous a second operation is required to remove all the remaining glands in the armpit .
Using the microbubble technique pioneered at the breast cancer unit at Maidstone Hospital , radiologists can test for cancer using only a fine needle biopsy .
The use of ultrasound with microbubbles to detect the sentinel lymph node is unique and something that will benefit breast cancer care around the world
Dr Ali Sever , consultant radiologist Surgery is then only necessary if the cancer has spread .
Radiologists inject the microbubbles , which are in a tiny amount of fluid , into the patient 's breast .
The microbubbles travel to the " sentinel lymph node " , the first to be affected if the cancer has spread , and can be spotted using ultrasound .
A fine needle biopsy can then be performed to see if the node is cancerous .
If the test is positive , patients have just one operation to remove all the lymph glands at the same time as their main operation .
Dr Sever added : " The use of ultrasound with microbubbles to detect the sentinel lymph node is unique and something that will benefit breast cancer care around the world . "
The microbubble test was more sensitive than the coloured dye test in 89 % of the cases used in the study .
' Still traumatic '
Sue Jones , a consultant breast and oncoplastic surgeon who helped developed the procedure , said : " Telling women who have undergone breast cancer surgery that they need another operation because the cancer has spread to the sentinel lymph node is the worst news they can hear .
" It is a real emotional set back in their cancer journey .
" While still traumatic , patients seem to deal with this news much better if they find out before operation that the lymph glands have cancer in them . "
About 25 % of breast cancer patients are found to have cancer in the sentinel lymph node and need a second operation .
Consultant breast surgeon Mr Peter Jones added : " It is possible for breast teams to use this test and thousands of women can avoid unnecessary surgery . "

Women who are happy with their sex lives have higher well - being scores and more vitality than women who are sexually dissatisfied , Australian researchers say .
Their study included 295 women , aged 20 to 65 , who were sexually active more than twice a month .
" We wanted to explore the links between sexual satisfaction and well - being in women from the community , and to see if there was any difference between pre- and postmenopausal women , " study author Dr. Sonia Davison , of the Women 's Health Program at Monash University , said in a news release from the journal in which the study was published .
" We found that women who were sexually dissatisfied had lower well - being and lower vitality .
This finding highlights the importance of addressing these areas as an essential part of women's health care , because women may be uncomfortable discussing these issues with their doctor , " Davison said .
She added that the difficulty in interpreting the findings " is that it is impossible to determine if dissatisfied women had lower well - being because they were sexually dissatisfied , or if the reverse is true , such that women who started with lower well - being tended to secondarily have sexual dissatisfaction .
As such , pharmacotherapies aimed to treat sexual dysfunction may have secondary effects on well - being , and the reverse may be true . "
More than 90 % of the women in the study said their sexual activity involved a partner , and that sexual activity was initiated by the partner at least 50 % of the time .
This means that the sexual activity of the study participants may have been affected by partner presence / absence , partner health and sexual function — factors that were n't addressed in the study , the researchers noted .
" The fact that women who self - identified as being dissatisfied maintained the level of sexual activity reported most likely represents established behavior and partner expectation , " senior study author Susan Davis , also of the Women 's Health Program at Monash , said in the news release .
" It also reinforces the fact that frequency of sexual activity in women cannot be employed as a reliable indicator of sexual well - being . "
The study was published Sept. 30 in the Journal of Sexual Medicine .

What Happens If a 9/11 Terrorist Defendant is Found Not Guilty ?
" I am absolutely convinced that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed will be subject to the most exacting demands of justice , " President Obama said in Tokyo .
" The American people will insist on it and my administration will insist on it . "
But what happens if KSM or any of the other 9/11 defendants the Obama administration is bringing to New York for criminal prosecutions -- including Ramzi Bin al - Shibh , Walid bin Attash , Ali Abdul Aziz Ali and Mustafa Ahmed al - Hawsawi -- are somehow found not guilty ?
Attorney General Eric
Holder brushed off the question , saying , " I would not have authorized the bringing of these prosecutions unless I thought that the outcome -- in the outcome we would ultimately be successful .
I will say that I have access to information that has not been publicly released that gives me great confidence that we will be successful in the prosecution of these cases in federal court . "
Not everyone is so confident , of course .
KSM , for instance , was subjected to " enhanced interrogation techniques " that many consider torture .
This includes being waterboarded 183 times in a one month .
Could this undermine the case against him ?
Fears of giving KSM the rights afforded defendants in a criminal case have led some to conclude that a military tribunal might be a better venue for him .
In September 2006 , debating the Military Commissions Act , then - Sen .
Obama said KSM and those like him would get " basically a full military trial with all the bells and whistles .
He 's going to have counsel , he 's going to be able to present evidence , he 's going to be able to rebut the government 's case .
Because the feeling is that he 's guilty of a war crime and to do otherwise might violate some of our agreements under the Geneva Conventions . "
" I think that 's good that we 're going to provide him with some procedure and process , " then - Sen .
Obama said .
" I think we will convict him and I think he will be brought to justice .
I think justice will be carried out in his case . "
But when Holder announced on Friday that five defendants would face military tribunals , KSM was not among them .
In June , Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani , a Tanzanian national , was brought to the Metropolitan Correctional Center to face 286 separate criminal charges stemming from his alleged role in the Aug. 7 , 1998 bombing of the U.S. Embassies in Dar es Salaam , Tanzania and Nairobi , Kenya , including conspiring with Osama bin Laden and al - Qaeda to kill Americans , and a separate charges of murder for each of the 224 people killed embassy bombings .
We asked White House press secretary Robert Gibbs what would happen if Ghailani is found not guilty ?
Gibbs would n't bite but the question is important .
If he will be freed , that prompts questions of national security and whether civilian courts are as appropriate as other venues for such trials .
If he wo n't be freed despite being found not guilty that undermines the credibility of the trial .
" We will talk about what happens about a verdict when a verdict comes , " Gibbs said .
The following day , the Senate Minority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell , R - Kentucky , asked “ if we ’re going to treat this terrorist detainee as a common civilian criminal , what will happen to Ghailani if he ’s found not guilty ?
And what will happen to other detainees the administration wants to try in civilian courts if they are found not guilty ?
Will they be released ?
If so , where ?
In New York ?
In American communities ?
Or will they be released overseas , where they could return to terror and target American soldiers or innocent civilians ? ”
McConnell continued : “ If Ghailani is n’t allowed to go free , will he be detained by the government ?
If so , where will he be detained ?
Would the administration detain him on U.S. soil , despite the objections of Congress and the American people ? ”
McConnell said the questions about Ghailani resemble the questions about Guantanamo in general .
“ On the question of Guantanamo , it became increasingly clear over time that the administration announced its plan to close the facility before it actually had a plan , ” he said .
“ If the administration has a plan for holding Ghailani if he ’s found not guilty , then it needs to share that plan with the Congress .
These kinds of questions are not insignificant .
They involve the safety of the American people . ”

Whether we could win those hearts and minds is , arguably , an open question  though it ’s an objective that would require a partner other than Hamid Karzai and many more troops than even McChrystal is asking for ( or America presently has ) .
But to say that McChrystal ’s optimistic  dare one say politically correct ?
 view of Muslim pliability does n’t square with that of America ’s hawks is the understatement of the decade .
Image Frank Rich Credit ...
Fred R. Conrad / The New York Times
As their Fort Hood rhetoric made clear , McChrystal ’s most vehement partisans do n’t trust American Muslims , let alone those of the Taliban , no matter how earnestly the general may argue that they can be won over by our troops ’ friendliness ( or bribes ) .
If , as the right has it , our Army can not be trusted to recognize a Hasan in its own ranks , then how will it figure out who the “ good ” Muslims will be as we try to build a “ stable ” state ( whatever “ stable ” means ) in a country that has never had a functioning central government ?
If our troops ca n’t be protected from seemingly friendly Muslim American brethren in Killeen , Tex. , what are the odds of survival for the 40,000 more troops the hawks want to deploy to Kabul and sinkholes beyond ?
About the only prominent voice among the liberal - bashing , Obama - loathing right who has noted this gaping contradiction is Mark Steyn of National Review .
“ Members of the best trained , best equipped fighting force on the planet ” were “ gunned down by a guy who said a few goofy things no one took seriously , ” he wrote .
“ And that ’s the problem : America has the best troops and fiercest firepower , but no strategy for throttling the ideology that drives the enemy  in Afghanistan and in Texas . ”
You have to applaud Steyn ’s rare intellectual consistency within his camp .
One imagines that he does not buy the notion that our Army , however brilliant , has a shot at building “ strong personal relationships ” with a population that often regards us as occupiers and infidels .
In a week of horrific news , it was good to hear at the end of it that Obama is dissatisfied with the four Afghanistan options he has been weighing so far .
The more time he deliberates , the more he is learning that he ’s on a fool ’s errand with no exit .
After Karzai was spared a runoff last month and declared the winner of the fraud - infested August “ election , ” Obama demanded that he address his government ’s corruption as a price for American support .
Only days later the Afghan president mocked the American president by parading his most tainted cronies on camera and granting an interview to PBS ’s “ NewsHour ” devoted to spewing his contempt for his American benefactors .
Matthew Hoh , a former Marine and , until recently , a State Department official in Afghanistan , could be found on MSNBC on Thursday once again asking the question no war advocate can answer , “ Do you want Americans fighting and dying for the Karzai regime ? ”
Hoh quit his post on principle in September despite the urging of colleagues , including our ambassador there , Karl W. Eikenberry , that he stay and fight over war policy from the inside .
But Hoh had lost confidence in our strategy and would not retract his resignation .
Now he has been implicitly seconded by Eikenberry himself .
Last week we learned that the ambassador , a retired general who had been the top American military commander in Afghanistan as recently as 2007 , had sent two cables to Obama urging caution about sending more troops .
We do n’t know everything in those cables .
What we do know is that American intelligence continues to say that fewer than 100 Qaeda operatives can still be found in Afghanistan .
We also know that the Taliban , which are currently estimated to number in the tens of thousands , ca n’t be eliminated .
As McChrystal put it to Filkins , there is no “ finite number ” of Taliban , so there ’s no way to vanquish them .
Hence his counterinsurgency alternative , which could take decades , costing untold billions and countless lives .
Perhaps those on the right are correct about Hasan , and he is just one cog in an apocalyptic jihadist plot that has infiltrated our armed forces .
If so , then they have an obligation to explain how pouring more troops into Afghanistan would have stopped Hasan from plotting in Killeen .
Do n’t hold your breath .
If we have learned anything concrete so far from the massacre at Fort Hood , it ’s that our hawks , for all their certitude , are as utterly confused as the rest of us about who it is we ’re fighting in Afghanistan and to what end .
Neighbours said the Cartwrights sex sessions would usually start around midnight and last for two or three hours , every night of the week .
Next door neighbour Rachel O’Connor said she was frequently late for work because she overslept having been awake most of the night because of the noise .
“ It is not very pleasant living there and it has been quite stressful , ” she told the court .
“ I always feel intimidated living there .
I was aware of it when I first moved in but I did not believe it would be this bad . ”
Asked what the noise problem was , she replied : “ The Cartwrights having sex .
It ’s just quite unnatural .
“ The noise sounds like they are both in inconsiderable pain .
Mr Cartwright sounds like he is in inconsiderable pain .
“ I can not describe the noise .
Totally excessive and I have never ever heard anything like it .
“ I put my telly in my bedroom on as loud as it could go and they drown it out . ”

Yesterday Obama kicked off the Federal Government ’s “ Educate to Innovate ” campaign , which will provide $ 4.35 billion in Federal grants to schools that innovate in STEM ( science , engineering , technology , and mathematics ) learning intitiatives .
This campaign will also be helped along by $ 260 million in private sector funding .
This campaign will allow government funding for much more innovative and exciting initiatives than would have been approved under the test - score - centered “ No Child Left Behind ” .
Instead of simply trying to stop the bad , this will help to flourish the good .
This is a great way to get kids interested at a young age in exciting and in demand fields .
From my experience it ’s very hard to get most kids interested in anything that resembles learning .
But introducing them new things on the cutting edge would be something exciting that they would jump at .
When I left for high school in 2001 , my elementary school was still running Macintosh Classics , circa 1990 .
Especially showing kids that they can make real contributions at such a young age can be very inspiring , like what Obama recently did with his White House held Astronomy Night .

Let ’s say you ’re the President of the United States — okay ?
And you ’re on the brink of escalating what promises to be a wider , more intense war than that which George W. Bush launched in Iraq .
You ’ve already sent in reinforcements , but you ’re undecided about just how many more troops you ’re going to send to Afghanistan – could be 20,000 , could be 40,000 , or even 60,000 .
But , in any case , you ’ve ruled out withdrawal and diplomacy : the only option you have left is more war .
In addition , you ’re moving – slowly but surely – toward full - scale involvement in Pakistan , where your drones are daily wreaking death and destruction on innocent civilians , and destabilizing a government that is increasingly hostile to your machinations – even though you ’re bribing them with billions that never reach their ostensible beneficiaries and only serve to fatten the purses of your Pakistani sock - puppets .
On top of that , you ’ve just told the Palestinians that they must live with Israeli “ settlements ” and forced the UN to ignore an official report detailing the killing of thousands of innocent men , women , and children by IDF forces armed by the US .
On top of that , you ’re pushing through Congress a record military spending bill that keeps the US spending more than the top 45 nations on earth combined on weapons and methods of war .
So , naturally , as a reward for all your strenuous efforts on behalf of keeping the world a place that is less safe , less stable , and less worth living in than at any time since the outbreak of World War II , you are bestowed with – yes , that ’s right , the Nobel Peace Prize .
This , however , is n’t just any Nobel Peace Prize – oh no It ’s a Bizarro Peace Prize – the natural result of us having slipped through a crack in the space - time continuum , and landed in a world where up is down , right is left , and war is peace – Bizarro World !
For years – ever since the 9/11 terrorist attacks – I ’ve been saying that the sheer force of the explosions that sent us hurtling into a nightmare world of color - coded terrorist alerts and hunts for “ weapons of mass destruction , ” must have ripped a hole in the very fabric of reality .
So that , today , we ’re living in an alternate universe , where the laws of logic and reason are repealed – Bizarro World .
For a while there I thought we might be heading back toward reality , or at least some more rational version of it , and that what I call the Bizarro Effect might be wearing off .
However , this morning ’s shocker – the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to an American president about to launch a decades - long military occupation , even as he promises ( so far to little effect ) to bring another occupation to an end — has dashed that hope beyond redemption .
And as if to underscore the fact that we are still living in the world we woke up to on September 11 , 2001 , a top official of the Democratic National Committee – communications director Brad Woodhouse – has issued the following statement in response to guffaws from the peanut gallery :
“ The Republican Party has thrown in its lot with the terrorists – the Taliban and Hamas this morning – in criticizing the President for receiving the Nobel Peace prize . ”
As Obama prepares for war , and yet more war , anyone who questions this is a terrorist – and peace be with you , my son .
PRINCETON , NJ --
A new analysis of more than 600,000 Gallup - Healthways Well - Being Index interviews conducted in 2008 and 2009 shows that happiness is highest among Americans who are in their early adulthood .
Happiness drops among Americans in their 30s and 40s , and -- in particular -- among those in their 50s ; it is higher among Americans in their 60s , drops among Americans in their late 70s and 80s , and then rises again among those older than 90 .
Men and women in most age groups have broadly equal happiness scores , with women scoring slightly higher than men in the middle - aged years , and notably higher after age 80 .
This analysis is based on a definition of happiness developed from responses to two questions about mood and one about smiling or laughing , all included in Gallup - Healthways Daily tracking .
The questions are : ( 1 ) Did you experience happiness during a lot of the day yesterday ?
( 2 ) Did you experience enjoyment during a lot of the day yesterday ?
and ( 3 ) Did you smile or laugh a lot yesterday ?
Survey respondents receive a positive happiness score if they respond affirmatively to all three questions .
All other patterns of responses yield a score of zero .
The data reflect a cross-section of the American adult population at a particular point in time -- January 2008 - September 2009 -- and thus do not allow inferences to be made about the " normal " course of life events .
The happiness of the respondents included in this analysis is a combination of the life circumstances into which they were born and through which they have lived , as well as generational circumstances that affect individuals at specific ages .
Thus , it is not possible with these data to determine the degree to which happiness is a result of an individual 's life history and experiences , as opposed to the individual 's current circumstances ( including health , family situation , and economic situation ) .
The Age Spectrum
On an absolute basis , a majority of all Americans of all ages are happy .
Happiness reaches its very lowest point -- 69 % -- among Americans 86 to 90 , meaning that even among this relatively less positive group , over two - thirds said they experienced happiness and enjoyment , and smiled or laughed a lot the day before they were interviewed .
The happiest adult Americans are those aged 18 - 20 , with a score of 79 % .
The variations across age and gender show that at this time , Americans ' happiness becomes progressively lower as one moves from groups of Americans in their 20s to those in their 30s and 40s , and -- in particular -- to American baby boomers who are now in their 50s .
Thereafter , happiness is higher among the very oldest baby boomers and Silent Generation members in their 60s , but drops again among those 76 to 90 .
The data then show that the very oldest Americans , 91 years of age and older ( of whom there are 9,654 in this sample ) , have a modestly more positive level of happiness in these latter years of their lives compared to youngsters only in their 80s .
( Of course , this final " surge " in happiness may apply only to those of this very advanced age who enjoy enough independence to answer telephone calls and respond to the Gallup - Healthways survey ) .
Given the cross-sectional nature of these data , it is not possible to determine whether these same happiness - by - age patterns will persist in the years ahead .
It is possible , for example , that specific life circumstances of the core baby boomer group now in their 50s will stay with them throughout their lives , and that in the years ahead , they will not enjoy the increased happiness levels now apparent among those who are in their 60s .
Gender
Averaging across all age groups , there is only a very slight difference between women's and men's scores , with women , at 73.4 , about one percentage point higher on average than men , at 72.5 .
Given the large sample sizes involved in this analysis ( more than 300,000 men and more than 300,000 women ) , this gender difference is statistically significant , but substantively does not suggest a major gender effect .
The pattern of gender differences varies across age groups .
The female skew in happiness is statistically significant ( although still quite small ) among Americans 36 - 65 , and among those over 80 .
The gender gap in happiness is largest among the oldest Americans , aged 86 and older .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 608,221 national adults ( 306,167 women and 302,054 men ) , aged 18 and older , conducted Jan. 2 , 2008 - Sept. 21 , 2009 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is less than ±1 percentage point .
Margins of error for specific age / gender subgroups range from ± 2 percentage points to less than ±1 point , depending on the size of the group .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones and cellular phones .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

MANILA , Philippines — Political violence on a scale never seen before has rocked the Philippines , with the brutal murders of 46 people , sparking new and grave concerns about the role of family dynasties in the country 's political system .
The victims — relatives of politicians , lawyers and several journalists — were abducted by around 100 armed men in Maguindanao province , in the southern Philippines .
By Tuesday , 46 bodies had been recovered , according to police .
President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo placed two southern provinces under a state of emergency on Tuesday .
Many of the victims were beheaded and brutally shot and hacked , according to Esmael Mangudadatu , a vice mayor of a small town whose wife , sister and other kin were among those believed dead .
The incident blanketed the whole country with a sense of doom , made especially stark since Filipinos have been celebrating the recent victory of boxing phenom Manny Pacquiao and CNN ’s selection for Hero of the Year , Efren Penaflorida , a young man who drives around a pushcart to teach poor kids how to read and write .
The gruesome violence was a brutal reality check that once again underscored just how deadly Philippine democracy can be and , perhaps more importantly , how little has been done to eliminate one of its scourges : political warlordism .
“ [ Monday 's ] outrage brings this country closer to failed state status , ” said Inday Espina - Varona , editor of the Manila newsweekly Philippine Graphic .
It was a “ brutal and barbaric display of naked power , ” said Carlos Isagani Zarate , a lawyer from Mindanao , the main region in the southern Philippines .
Two of Zarate ’s colleagues who were lawyers of Esmael Mangudadatu were among those presumed dead .
“ This is a tragic commentary of our so - called democracy , ” Zarate added .
While often exalted as the epitome of U.S. - style democracy in Asia , the Philippines has not quite lived up to the hype , if we go by the violence Filipinos witness every election season .
In the 2007 midterm elections , more than 100 people were killed in election - related violence .
In the 2004 elections , the number of deaths was even higher , at more than 200 .
But nothing — Zarate said not even during the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos — came close to the brutality of Monday ’s attacks .
What made the incident more incendiary is the fact that at least a dozen journalists , who were covering the relatives of Mangudadatu as they went to the provincial capital to file his candidacy papers , were likewise killed , further cementing the Philippines ’s notoriety as the most dangerous country in the world for journalists next only to Iraq .
“ Never in the history of journalism have the news media suffered such a heavy loss of life in one day , ” the Paris - based Reporters Without Borders reacted in a statement .
Political families or dynasties , with their warlords and private armies , rule the Philippine political landscape , especially in the provinces .
They are products of the Philippines ’ colonial experience , with the Spanish and Americans nurturing them to protect each other ’s interests .
Even after the country gained independence in 1946 , the system — which can only be described as feudal — persisted , with land - owning Filipino families forming their own dynasties , building their own private armies and running for public office to protect their interests .
According to the Center for People Empowerment in Governance , a Manila think tank , there are an estimated 250 political dynasties in the Philippines .
Of the 265 members of Congress in 2007 , it said in a report that year , 160 of them belonged to these powerful families .
In the same report , the center said these political dynasties almost singlehandedly engendered a culture of election fraud .
“ Fraud recycles the political dynasties and keeps them in power .
It breeds generations of cheaters and manipulators , corrupt politicians , mediocre executives , bribe takers , absenteeism in Congress , ” it said .
Apart from fraud , these dynasties flourish because Filipinos tend not to vote according to class , ethnicity , religion or even ideology .
As a result , the Filipino family has become “ the most enduring political unit and the one into which , failing some wider principle of participation , all other units dissolve , ” wrote Brian Fegan , an American anthropologist and historian , in his book “ An Anarchy of Families : State and Family in the Philippines . ”
Monday ’s violence is typical of the dynamic between Filipino political dynasties .
The victims , the Mangudadatus , are themselves a powerful political clan in at least two Muslim provinces in Mindanao .
Esmael Mangudadatu , the vice mayor of Buluan town , is challenging the governorship of Maguindanao province whose governor , Andal Ampatuan , belongs to the Mangudadatus ’ main political rival .
Esmael Mangudadatu alleged on Monday that the Ampatuans launched the attack to frustrate his attempt to become governor , which is perhaps the most important office that a political dynasty should have in order to remain in power .
Prior to this incident , there had been violent attacks perpetrated by either side and Esmael Mangudadatu , in television interviews on Monday , admitted that he had sent his wife and other female relatives to file his candidacy for him , thinking that his opponents would not harm women .
He was wrong :
The military says 13 of the 21 bodies they recovered Monday were those of Mangudadatu ’s women relatives as well as his two women lawyers .
What made this case even more politically intriguing is the fact the Ampatuans are allies of President Gloria Macapagal - Arroyo .
They have thrived in Maguindanao largely because of Arroyo ’s patronage .
In the 2004 elections , Andal Ampatuan , who was already governor at the time , publicly promised to Arroyo that he would deliver most of Maguindanao ’s votes for her and her party .
He did , with two of the towns they controlled delivering zero votes to Arroyo ’s opponent — sparking allegations of massive election fraud .
In fact , the allegation that is hounding Arroyo — that she cheated her way to the presidency in 2004 — had its beginnings in Maguindanao province , with the Ampatuans allegedly behind the whole thing .
The Ampatuans had denied the election fraud charge .
They have not issued any statement to refute the recent attacks , while Arroyo has promised to investigate the carnage and bring the perpetrators to justice .
In any case , there has always been a call over the years for government to dismantle these private armies .
The latest one was sounded off by Amnesty International in a statement on Monday .
“ The government must prohibit and disband private armies and paramilitary forces immediately , ” said Donna Guest , the group ’s deputy director for Asia - Pacific .
Political movements have also been launched to break the stranglehold of political dynasties on Philippine democracy .
These have had some few successes but , overall , the dynasties still rule .
In fact , Arroyo herself has demonstrated that a powerful political family is crucial to survival in the rough - and - tumble world of Philippine politics .
Her two sons and her sister - and brother - in - laws are all members of congress .
Her allies even created a new district in one province so that one of her boys can run there .

( CNN ) --
A mother 's plot to blame a stranger for killing her sons went awry when one of the boys survived and told police how Michelle Kehoe cut his throat , then moved on to his younger brother , an Iowa prosecutor said Thursday .
Police found the 7 - year - old covered in dried blood in the family van the morning of October 27 , 2008 , in a secluded area near a pond east of Littleton .
Beside the van , his 2 - year - old brother lay dead , his throat also slashed .
" She cut me , " the boy said in a high - pitched voice in an audio recording that was played Thursday in Kehoe 's first - degree murder trial .
Kehoe , of Coralville , Iowa , has pleaded not guilty to charges of first - degree murder , attempted murder and child endangerment causing serious injury .
Before the trial , her lawyers filed a notice of intent to present an insanity defense , according to court records .
Kehoe 's lawyers chose to reserve their opening arguments for the start of their case .
Dressed in a blue and white striped blouse , Kehoe frowned as she listened to her son's voice on the recording , occasionally bowing her head .
The boy had locked himself in the van overnight after his mother slashed him and his younger brother the previous day and left them for dead , Assistant Iowa Attorney General Andrew Prosser said in his opening statement .
Kehoe then walked to a nearby pond and attempted to kill herself by slashing her throat with the same weapon , a camouflage - handle Winchester hunting knife she bought the month before , Prosser said .
When it became apparent she was not going to die , the prosecutor said , she staggered half a mile down the road to the nearest home and told a story she 'd concocted weeks before of how a stranger abducted the family , killed her sons and tried to kill her .
But when authorities went searching for the stranger , they instead found her 7 - year - old son in the car and his younger brother dead outside the driver 's side .
" Do you know where you 're injured at ? " Deputy Stephen Peterson asked the boy in the recording .
" Just my throat , " the boy said .
" Who did that to you ? "
" My mom . "
The boy said his mother also put duct tape over his eyes , nose and mouth , but that he pulled them off after his mother left him .
" She was hurting my baby brother , " he said .
Kehoe began plotting the attack the month before with the purchase of the knife and the duct tape , Prosser said .
She allegedly chose the date of the incident to coincide with when her husband , Gene , was scheduled to take a yoga class , telling him they were going to visit her mother at a nursing home in Sumner .
Police also say they found signs of a cover - up at the scene , including pieces of a first - aid kit scattered around the scene and a handwritten note documenting the attack , Prosser said .
The note detailed how a man broke into the car when the family stopped at a gas station and forced them to the area where the van was found .
Kehoe tried to fight him off with pepper spray but he knocked her unconscious , the note said , according to the prosecutor .
Police said Kehoe later told them she had written the note in the midst of the attack to explain what had happened to those who would find the scene , according to the prosecutor .
" And the note , which you 'll see , ends with , ' Oh no , here he comes again ... ' " Prosser told the jury .
Kehoe faces life in prison without parole if convicted of first - degree murder for her son 's death .
The Education Bubble
More people are going back to college and taking on huge debt to do it , despite questions about what the degree is really worth .
Last year , the amount borrowed by students and received by schools grew some 25 % over the previous year , to $ 75.1 billion .
That 's a huge amount , especially with weak , low - paying job prospects for graduates in this economy .
As we 've noted , all this student loan debt is crazy .
Despite the desire to see more subsidization of college , we suspect there will be a collapse in student loan debt availability and desire to take on new debt .
Short of telling kids not to go to college , something 's going to give .
The pop may be starting already .
As Bloomberg reports , as many as one - third of all private colleges surveyed said they expected enrollment to drop in the next academic year .
And almost 40 percent of those colleges said some of their students dropped out due to personal economic reasons and a quarter said full - time attendees switched to part time .
Half said families had to cut back their expected contributions as the value of college savings plans dropped 21 percent last year .

GHC 6.12 has the ability to generate event logs for your Haskell programs that contain concurrency - and parallelism - related information from the runtime .
These event logs can be parsed using the ghc-events package , and visualised using ThreadScope ( developed by Donnie Jones , Simon Marlow and Satnam Singh ) .
I ’ve had a play with the in - development version of these tools ( GHC 6.12 is currently a release candidate , and ghc- events and ThreadScope are under active development ) and wanted to share my experience .
To use ThreadScope at the moment , you need to have both a GHC 6.12 install ( to run your program and generate the event logs ) and a GHC 6.10 install ( to run ThreadScope ) .
This is because the build system of gtk2hs has not yet been updated to work with GHC 6.12 — eventually everything should build on GHC 6.12 .
On your GHC 6.10 system , you must :
Install gtk2hs .
Install ghc -events — probably best to get it direct from the ghc- events darcs repository until it settles down a bit , but in the future , cabal install ghc - events will suffice .
will suffice .
Install ThreadScope — not yet on Hackage , so you ’ll need to use the ThreadScope darcs repository for the moment .
On your GHC 6.12 install , you then compile your program with the - eventlog flag .
I ’m using my boids program which is already cabalised , so I just had to add - eventlog to my ghc - options : field .
When you run the compiled program , you need to pass the - ls option to the RTS , and you ’ll probably also want to pass - N as usual to get it running on multiple cores ( in GHC 6.12 , if you do n’t give - N a number , it uses all your cores ) .
So the full command - line might be boids + RTS - ls - N .
This will generate a .eventlog file for you — which can get quite large : my boid program ( which admittedly has a lot of concurrency ) generated a 100 MB file , so I scaled back the number of cycles it was performing by a factor of 10 .
You can then load the event log in ThreadScope .
The eventlog of my quick first run of the boids program gave me this in ThreadScope ( click to see more detail ) :
Each green bit is code executing , and each orange bit is garbage collection ( GC ) .
The two cannot overlap ( this would be termed a concurrent garbage collector , but Haskell has a parallel garbage collector ) , so all the orange is bits where your code is not executing — this is confirmed if you zoom in .
If your ThreadScope profile looks like a green millipede with lots of orange legs , GC is happening very often .
One common way to alleviate this problem is to increase the heap size by passing + RTS - H100M ( or similar ) to your Haskell program .
I added this greater heap size to my options , and when I re-ran I got this :
The green is now denser , and the program runs quicker .
( My previous benchmarking results already used this increased heap size , but it ’s nice to see the visual explanation of how it helps . )
This zoomed out view gives a useful overview : I could see the rough profile of my GC , and I can see that all eight cores are being used roughly equally and constantly .
Something I have learnt about ThreadScope is that while this zoomed out view is useful , the really interesting stuff only appears when you zoom in ( and turning on labels helps too ) .
Here is a teaser shot of a zoomed - in view of that file with labels turned on :
You can now see information on thread migrations — and you can see that my seemingly dense blocks of green actually contain some gaps in them .
Intuitively , reducing the white and increasing the density of the green will make my program go faster .
I ’m hoping to become a bit more familiar with the GHC RTS to understand how to reduce those white gaps , both for my boids but also for other CHP programs .
ThreadScope certainly looks like a very promising tool for increasing concurrent and parallel Haskell performance .

A Web of Lone Wolves
Upon learning of the reported " missed " link between the alleged culprit responsible for the massacre at Ft. Hood — Maj.
Malik Nidal Hasan — and Anwar al Awlaki , my heart sank for a multitude of reasons .
Al Awlaki is an infamous character in the halls of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , and he has been for several years at least .
The cleric ’s recurring presence again in the Ft. Hood case seems to be powerful and disturbing evidence of how fringe extremists — who otherwise might remain in obscurity with no real means of living out their private jihadi fantasies — are quite literally being equipped for battle by so - called " theological " advisors known only to them through the Internet .
In short , it is a reminder of how real online terrorism networks have become .
In mid-2008 , I was invited by the FBI to look at the voluminous evidence they had gathered against a group of defendants who were caught plotting to attack various military installations on the East Coast , including Fort Dix in New Jersey .
At first , I was a skeptic .
Most of the men under scrutiny were Westernized Albanian Muslims who spoke little to no Arabic , were into hip - hop music , and were working as pizza delivery boys and taxi drivers .
They did n’t have any obvious connection to al Qaeda or Osama bin Laden , they had never visited a real terrorist training camp , and they cut a pretty kooky appearance .
They certainly did n’t seem to fit the classical terrorist stereotype .
But to my surprise , this motley crew of would - be homegrown killers turned out to be much more sophisticated than I had initially given them credit for .
Aside from having an unsettling interest in acquiring assault rifles , these young men had separately downloaded hundreds of megabytes of hardcore terror propaganda videos from the web , including the wills of Sept. 11 hijackers and the July 7 London suicide bombers , and instructional materials on how to build improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) and carry out sniper attacks — and they knew all about radical Yemeni- American cleric Anwar al - Awlaki and his online lecture series " Constants on the Path of Jihad . "
In " Constants , " al Awlaki argues , " Jihad does not depend on any particular land .
It is global . …
No borders or barriers stop it . "
He continues , " If a particular people or nation is classified as … ‘ the people of war ’ in the Shariah , that classification applies to them all over the earth .
Islam cannot be customized to suit the conditions where you are , for instance Europe . "
Al - Awlaki ’s fanatical " lone wolf " approach to jihad — broadcast virally over the Internet — was adopted with terrific gusto by , among others , the Fort Dix plotters , who were caught by the FBI in early 2007 discussing the extent of their devotion to al - Awlaki .
In a conversation taped by the FBI in 2007 , one said , " [ T ] his brother locked up in Yemen , Anwar al Awlaki the Imam in Washington D.C. , they kicked him out of the U.S. and now they locked him up in Yemen .
He was talking about jihad , the truth , no holds barred , straight how it is ! …
In his own country they locked him up for speaking like this . "
In another conversation recorded by the FBI in February 2007 , convicted Fort Dix conspirator Eljvir Duka repeatedly instructed other " recruits " to download copies of Anwar al - Awlaki ’s lectures .
" It ’s called the Constants of Jihad , the Constants of Jihad and this , ever since I heard this lecture brother I want everyone to hear about it , " he said .
" You know why , because he gives it to you raw and uncut … this is the truth I do n’t give a damn what everybody says this is Islam , this is the truth right here . …
So this lecture is very necessary for people today , if you ’re concerned . …
[ It is ] verbal , audio , you have to download it . "
Perhaps this is the most frustrating aspect of transnational vendors of hate and mayhem like al Awlaki .
The Internet has inadvertently become a powerful tool in their hands , offering easy access to an interactive virtual universe where they can mobilize vulnerable , unstable people around the world and incite them to carry out acts of violence .
And because the message is spread to individuals scattered across the globe , the violence comes in seemingly random bursts from unexpected sources – like pizza delivery boys , or even an Army psychologist .
Even Web - savvy Holocaust Museum shooter James Von Brunn , for example , turned to the parallel virtual world of neo -Nazi radicals for instruction and support .
With such a generalized threat , it will be a continuing challenge for Western governments and societies to draw the fine line between what is protected under the freedom of speech and what is criminalized as direct incitement to murder .
In order to help address those critical determinations and intercept potential threats , the FBI and other government agencies must redouble their efforts at sharing intelligence in a timely and effective manner .
They must train and empower agents and analysts , who are on the frontlines of the battle against terrorism , by training them about the players and issues peculiar to the blight of international terrorism .
Surely , if homegrown extremists can train themselves to be al Qaeda aficionados using only their own home computers , then it is within the capabilities of a determined U.S. government to thwart them .
Proceedings have been issued against party leader Nick Griffin
The UK's equalities watchdog has begun legal action against the British National Party over concerns about ethnic restrictions on its membership .
The Equality and Human Rights Commission said limiting membership to those of an " ethnic origin " described as " indigenous Caucasian " was illegal .
It has issued proceedings against BNP leader Nick Griffin and two officials .
The party called this a " pathetic attempt " by the commission to divert attention from its own problems .
But equality minister Harriet Harman said : " No party should be allowed to have an apartheid constitution in 21st Century Britain .
I welcome the action . "
The commission has issued county court proceedings against the BNP after voicing concerns in June .
' Not willing '
In a statement it said : " The BNP 's membership criteria appear to restrict membership to those within what the BNP regards as particular ' ethnic groups ' and those whose skin colour is white .
This exclusion is contrary to the Race Relations Act .
" The commission believes the BNP 's constitution and membership criteria are discriminatory and , further , that the continued publication of them on the BNP website is unlawful .
" It has therefore issued county court proceedings against party leader Nick Griffin and two other officials . "
John Wadham , director of legal affairs at the commission , said : " The BNP has said that it is not willing to amend its membership criteria which we believe are discriminatory and unlawful .
It has nothing to do with discrimination ; it 's all to do with internal politicking
Lee Barnes , BNP , on commission 's legal action " The commission has a statutory duty to use our regulatory powers to enforce compliance with the law , so we have today issued county court proceedings against the BNP .
" However , the party still has an opportunity to resolve this quickly by giving the undertaking on its membership criteria that the commission requires . "
The BNP 's constitution - last framed in September 2008 - does not explicitly mention the word " white " when talking about restrictions on membership .
The term is only used in the section on the party 's political objectives : " It is ... committed to stemming and reversing the tide of non-white immigration and to restoring , by legal changes , negotiation and consent , the overwhelmingly white make - up of the British population that existed in Britain prior to 1948 . "
' Galvanising '
The BNP 's constitution limits membership to a group it describes in this way : " The indigenous British ethnic groups deriving from the class of ' Indigenous Caucasian ' consists of members of : i ) the Anglo - Saxon folk community ; ii ) the Celtic Scottish folk community ; iii ) the Scots - Northern Irish folk community ; iv ) the Celtic Welsh folk community ; v ) the Celtic Irish folk community ; vi ) the Celtic Cornish folk community ; vii ) the Anglo - Saxon - Celtic folk community ; viii ) the Celtic - Norse folk community ; ix ) the Anglo - Saxon - Norse folk community ; x ) the Anglo - Saxon Indigenous European folk community ; xi ) members of these ethnic groups which reside either within or outside Europe but ethnically derive from them . "
Lee Barnes , legal officer for the BNP , told the BBC : " We think that the commission has brought this action at the behest of the Labour Party .
" It is also a galvanising thing to focus the commission 's attention away from its own problems and internal issues . "
Four commissioners have have left the EHCR in recent months and there have been criticisms of the leadership of chairman Trevor Phillips .
The communities and local government committee is set to investigate how the watchdog is run later this year and may ask Mr Phillips to give evidence .
Mr Barnes said : " It has nothing to do with discrimination ; it 's all to do with internal politicking . "

We shall use the axiom of choice to prove an extremely wimpy version of the Banach Tarski paradox , to wit :
Proof :
Use the axiom of choice to find a subset X of [ 0,1 ] which contains exactly
one element of each equivalence class .
( Intuitively speaking , we are taking each
equivalence class in turn and picking one element from each , and throwing it into the
set X ) .
This set is what logicians call " non-constructive " ; there is no recipe
or formula for this set , because we can't specify exactly how we pick an element from
each equivalence class .
All we know is that such a set exists by this abstract axiom .
Since X does not contain two or more elements from any equivalence class , we see
that the translates X + q are all disjoint for all rational numbers q .
In particular , the translates X + q for all q \in Q \cap [ 0,1 ] form a disjoint
partition of some subset Y of [ 0,2 ] .
You can think of Y as all the " small "
rational translations of X .
Now the sets Q \cap [ 0,1 ] and Q are both countably infinite , and so there is some
( constructive ! ) one - to - one correspondence q --> f( q ) between them .
Now what we do is that we take our set Y , which is the union of translates X + q
of X , and shift each translate so that X+q shifts to X + f( q ) .
If we do this ,
we get the union of all the rational translations of X ( not just the small ones ) .
But this set is all of R , since every element of R is the member of some equivalence
class , and is therefore in some rational translate of X , since X contains one element
from each equivalence class .
This proves the theorem .
At The Law Office of Judith A. Descalso , we help people and small businesses struggling with debt get the lasting relief they need .
Just when they thought it was safe to go back to the office , working mothers were last week given yet another reason to whip themselves with birch branches in an orgy of self - imposed guilt .
It came courtesy of an Institute of Child Health study of more than 12,500 five - year - olds that suggested the children of working women are less active and more likely to eat unhealthy food .
The subsequent reaction was rather predictable .
There was the usual thrown - together media debate between muffin- baking housewives and BlackBerry - wielding career women and the stripped pine kitchens of middle England reverberated with the sound of rustling crisp packets as harassed nannies rapidly emptied the cupboards of junk food
But amid all the fuss there was a conspicuous silence from the nation 's men .
Interesting though the findings were , it was striking that there was no comparative evaluation of what impact a working father might have on his children .
In fact , the role of the male parent had been quite deliberately ignored : according to Professor Catherine Law , who led the study , there was no need to include them because fathers ' employment levels had not substantially changed whereas the numbers of working mothers had increased dramatically in the last few years .
This might be true , but simply because a status quo has existed for a long time does not mean that it should remain unchallenged .
Yes , the traditional family structure in Britain is overwhelmingly one in which a father is the main breadwinner , but this does not lessen the impact that a male parent has on his children , nor does it give us licence to marginalise his influence .
It seems not to matter that a father with a full - time job does not have as much time to spend with his family .
Yet when a woman with children goes to work , we automatically expect the impact of an absent mother to be negatively felt .
In the same month that the Institute of Child Health published its findings , the Joseph Rowntree Foundation questioned 29 two - parent families across four ethnic groups in England and reported that , although lip service was paid to notions of shared childcare , economic provision was still seen as a male responsibility and viewed as evidence of " good fathering " .
This in spite of the fact that the number of men staying at home to raise children has doubled since 1993 to more than 200,000 .
Our cultural mindset has not kept pace with this social change .
Although we like to think of ourselves as enlightened standard - bearers for gender equality , in reality we have spent most of the last 30 years redressing discrimination against women without challenging the received wisdom that fathers should support their families .
While the feminist movement of the 1970s fought for a woman 's right to be treated on equal terms with men in the workplace , there has been no similar revolution in thinking for men who wish to be taken seriously in the domestic sphere .
A man who chooses to be a full - time father in 2009 confronts a similar barrage of sexist assumptions that , say , a female surgeon would have faced in the 1950s .
From pregnancy onwards , the modern father will find himself systematically excluded from the process of parenthood .
It is the little things that are the most telling .
Although 86 % of fathers now attend the birth of their child , the vast majority of them will not be allowed to stay overnight in hospital .
The only information a midwife requires from a father - to - be is whether he has any genetic abnormalities .
In some parts of the country , a magazine entitled Mum Plus One is distributed by healthcare professionals to new mothers : the father is simply not part of the equation .
According to one man who contributed to " The Dad Deficit " , a 2008 report for The Fatherhood Institute : " The real meaning [ of childbirth ] is locked away in a bed in a ward in a building where you are not welcome . "
The male disenfranchisement continues as children get older .
Contributors to a recent internet discussion on the marginalisation of fathers in the classroom spoke of feeling " irrelevant " at the school gates , where teachers are " only ever interested in Mum " .
And that is assuming they manage to get time off in the first place – a 2002 report for The Work Foundation found that working fathers were nervous about asking for flexible hours in order to attend school sports days or parents ' evenings because they feared their employers would discriminate against them .
Fathers are not expected to have the same attachment to their children : there are scores of baby books devoted to the idea that women are genetically predisposed to have a closer bond with their children because they are the ones who give birth and breast - feed .
Motherhood is seen as immutable ; fatherhood as an optional extra .
The facts tell a different story .
A study published by New Scientist magazine in July proved that fathers are " biologically programmed " to help raise children .
A separate study using a monogamous breed of mice found that the absence of a father during the first few weeks of life causes their offspring to be less socially engaged .
Of course , there are some men who might rather like the way things are , who prefer the adult interaction of office life to the screaming protestations of a baby whose nappy needs changing .
But until the choice is there to be made , we do a disservice to parents of both genders who wish to step away from the cultural norm and raise their children as best they can – without being forced to justify their decisions to the rest of us .

Konservative Angeordnete des ägyptischen Parlaments sind schwer erregt - wegen eines Importartikels aus dem erfindungsreichen Japan : Das ( im Doppelpack ! ) knapp 30 US - Dollar teure künstliche Jungfernhäutchen , vertrieben von der chinesischen Firma Gigimo , " animiert " dem prominenten Islamgelehrten Scheich Abdel Moati Bayoumi zufolge " zu unerlaubten sexuellen Beziehungen " .
" Wer auch immer dieses Produkt importiert " , so Bayoumi , " gehört bestraft ! " Scheich Sayed Askar von der Muslim - Bruderschaft , Mitglied des Parlamentsausschusses für religiöse Angelegenheiten , bezeichnet es als " ein Zeichen der Schande , würde die Regierung dieses Produkt auf dem Markt zulassen . "
Die Muslim - Bruderschaft verfügt als zur Zeit stärkste Oppositionspartei über 88 der 454 ägyptischen Parlamentssitze .
Eingestielt wurde die Affäre durch die arabische Übersetzung einer chinesischen Anzeige auf der Website von Radio Nederland Wereldomroep .
" Nie mehr Sorgen um verlorenen Jungfernschaft " , verspricht die Werbung ; vorsichtig eingeführt , sorge das Produkt dafür , " dass Sie sich eng anfühlen " .
Erfolgreich penetriert , leckt die falsche Jungfer eine blutähnliche Substanz , " nicht zu viel , sondern genau die richtige Menge .
Dazu sollten
Sie etwas ächzen und stöhnen , dann wird Ihnen niemand etwas nachweisen können . "

The thing DJ , producer , writer and academic Steve Goodman wants you to know about his record label is that it's not really a record label : it 's a virus .
" That 's the way I understand music culture .
There 's a history of music , particularly dub and reggae , being described as a virus – Hyperdub is a mutation of British electronic music , infected by Jamaican soundsystem culture : from dub and reggae , through jungle , right up to grime , dubstep and funky .
It 's a way of thinking about how musical change and evolution takes place . "
The label that brought Burial to the world is now celebrating five years of these mutations with a double - CD compilation of new and classic material , called simply Hyperdub 5 – spanning the various genres mentioned above , as well as lots of gloriously twisted electronic music so new that it has yet to take a street name .
Originally from Glasgow , Goodman moved to London to be closer to the music he loved at the end of the 1990s , and started Hyperdub as a web magazine in 2001 .
" The main editorial remit was the Jamaican influence on London electronic music , " he says .
Under the name Kode9 , Goodman has been making music since 1995 , and turned Hyperdub into a label to put out his own Sine of the Dub in 2004 , after prompting from Kevin Martin , aka the Bug .
" I was interviewing him for XLR8R magazine and he said , ' You should release it yourself , ' " Goodman says .
There 's never been any grand plan though : " The whole thing 's been a series of accidents . "
Without an A&R policy , an office , or even any employees , Hyperdub is a remarkably successful one - man empire , although that does have its drawbacks : he gets sent a lot of music .
" It 's just painful , " he says , " I 'm really drowning in it .
Especially now I 've broadened out the remit of the label , so it 's not just one genre of stuff I 'm being sent . "
Key among the series of accidents that has seen Hyperdub championed from the NME to the New Yorker , presumably , was releasing Burial 's music , and it becoming unexpectedly popular .
" Yeah , that was completely unforeseen , " he laughs .
" I was worried about putting his album out – I did n't think anyone would be into it .
It was quite a weird take on garage . "
Goodman was " hugely relieved " when Elbow pipped Burial , who had been the bookies ' favourite , to last year 's Mercury Music Prize , so protective is he of Will Bevan , the man behind the music , who was desperate to avoid the full glare of the media spotlight .
" There are certain tunes on there that are obviously not that sophisticated , " Bevan told me self - deprecatingly in a Film & Music interview prior to the album 's release , when he was still able to protect his identity .
" I 'm just pretty defensive about it , because I was never really expecting so many people to hear the record . "
With Bevan clear that all he wanted was a quiet life , Gordon Smart , editor of the Sun 's Bizarre gossip pages , started a campaign to unmask Burial last summer .
That forced Bevan to reveal his identity – he was not , as Smart had suggested , Fatboy Slim working under an alias – and triggered a litany of revenge fantasies for Goodman .
" I went through how each one of these scenarios would play out , and they all seemed to result in me imprisoned for the rest of my life – you know , ' Sun Journalist Kneecapped ' – it 's not a good look , " he sighs .
" So it was just me quietly , in the privacy of my own home , cathartically burning a copy of the Sun .
That was as close to voodoo as I could get on a Wednesday afternoon . "
A more positive effect of Burial 's success was that it meant Goodman could plough the money Hyperdub made off the album back into the label – into releasing more regular vinyl releases , into compiling Hyperdub 5 , into imminent albums by the likes of Darkstar and Ikonika , who grew up on dubstep and garage , but are now taking it into bold , bright new directions .
It 's a mutation Goodman has been eager to incubate .
' It 's like hearing circuitry cry '
By about 2007 I was getting left a little cold by the greyness of dubstep : stuff that is literally just drum and bass , with no tone colour .
That minimalism felt fresh at the time , but that freshness does n't last , it leads to stagnation , and gets predictable . "
So the virus mutates ?
" Yeah , your immunity to it increases .
And like any drug experience , your response becomes , ' I do n't get high off that anymore . ' "
The new Hyperdub sound is all about synthesisers : sci-fi melodies as the host for this restlessly progressive London dance aesthetic .
" It 's like hearing circuitry crying , " Goodman has said of this recent output , and for new signings Darkstar this idea of computer love is a real fascination .
The duo talk with gusto about studying film post - production , about 2001 : A Space Odyssey , John Carpenter , and the " robot dialogues " on their forthcoming album .
Their new single Aidy's Girl Is a Computer is one of the stand - out tracks on Hyperdub 5 , and the pair tried to use a particularly robotic vocal on it : " When we were making it we did actually spend a lot of time trying to get our Mac to sing to us … but it started to get a little bit too strange , " says Darkstar 's James Young .
As with Burial 's new contribution to the compilation , Fostercare , you can hear discernible syllables in the distorted , chopped - up vocal that Darkstar eventually used , and your brain tricks you into thinking you 're singing along ; but listen more closely and you realise the vocals have been tuned just beyond recognition .
The sense you get from Aidy's Girl is that the human , physical world has revolved ever so slightly out of reach .
It 's heartbreakingly beautiful .
For Goodman , the way forward seems to be akin to taking a set of felt - tip pens to dubstep 's blank , monochrome outlines .
" It 's the tone colour of synths that 's become important to the sound , how to fill in the mid-range without becoming annoying . "
For him – and for so many of this new generation of Hyperdub artists – synths are there " to create euphoria , or to create hooks , or to create something that 's colourful and memorable and catchy , that 's maybe slightly unsettling at the same time .
I 've always been fascinated by these little squiggly synths , whether it 's been in jazz funk , or gangsta rap , or 80s synth - pop .
That 's what I love most about grime , too , that hyper - coloured sound . "
' I 've always been fascinated by these little squiggly synths … that hyper - coloured sound '
Sometimes this relationship with colour and art takes on a truly vivid quality : one can find blogs where the parallels between Hyperdub 's music and abstract art are discussed in detail .
One of those cited in such discussions is Zomby , another maverick , anonymous producer .
" It 's quite an odd sensation , " he tells me about his occasionally synaesthesiac relationship with music .
" The colours are intermittent , " he says , " but the chemical that shoots through your body is the same . "
He cites the tonal language and " colour representation of scales " explored by Russian composer Alexander Scriabin as an inspiration .
Hyperdub artists make dance music that is hedonistically enjoyed in clubs – but with an undeniably cerebral approach that comes from the man at the top .
As well as teaching the music culture BA at the University of East London , Goodman has just finished writing a book , Sonic Warfare : Sound , Affect , and the Ecology of Fear , which will be published by MIT Press in December .
This covers the use of the Sesame Street theme tune as a military torture device , worrying new police technology such as Long Range Acoustic Devices ( " they 're like acoustic water - cannons " ) , and the " infrasonic hum " the planet has endured since the dawn of time : " We live in the echo of the Big Bang , so the heat death of the universe is the dying out of this echo . "
Another mysterious strain of the Hyperdub virus is the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit ( CCRU ) , which Goodman helped create in the late 1990s , while studying at Warwick University .
" We were all graduate philosophy students , but writing about jungle and philosophy , or Cronenberg films and philosophy , for example .
We were told it did n't fit into the discipline – it never really got acknowledged by Warwick .
" It was an attempt to look at popular culture , cyber culture and rave culture , and bring it together with difficult French philosophers .
We were treating popular culture as serious cultural production because it has inherent value , not just as pop … " he pauses , and self - corrects .
" But that 's not fair on pop – it's exactly because it was pop that it was interesting . "
Despite having DJed in more than 20 countries , and having signed tracks by artists from America , Japan and Denmark , Goodman emphasises that London is still very much the heart of the label .
" Even when you leave London , you do n't really leave London – you still carry it with you , like a thin layer of grime on your skin .
London music culture is so strong because every few years it manages to refresh itself , and rejuvenate what has become staid .
Just as you 're getting bored , the elements twist in a different way . "
Musical mutations ... five essential Hyperdub recordings
Burial : Etched Headplate ( 2007 )
From the Mercury - nominated album Untrue , this encapsulates Burial 's unique and astonishing ability to turn an emotional breakdown on a London night - bus into six minutes of absolute musical transcendence .
Ikonika : Please ( 2008 )
Sara Abdel - Hamid grew up on Pretty Girls Make Graves and R&B , rather than weary cliches about the greats of the UK dance music canon .
This utterly addictive single combines the urgency of the former with the hooks of the latter to take electronic music to strange , punch - drunk new places .
Kode9 ( right ) : Black Sun ( 2009 )
With Steve Goodman 's early releases drawing deep on the well of Jamaican dread , it was his boredom with dubstep 's monochrome landscapes that prompted this new direction .
It 's the sound of a true auteur donning the cloak of house music for the first time : but only after deliberately putting it on too hot a wash , so that all the colours run into one another .
2000 F + Jkamata : You Do n't Know What Love Is ( 2009 )
A one - off by two Danish producers , this is arguably the greatest example of the " purple funk " that is currently steering dubstep towards the sexy and psychedelic , featuring a towering vocoder - treated vocal with synths straight from the west - coast G- funk of Nate Dogg and Warren G .
Darkstar : Aidy's Girl is a Computer ( 2009 )
The newest Hyperdub 12in vinyl release , an NME favourite and one of the singles of the year .
Remember in the 1990s when cyborg theorists talked about our increasing dependence on technology , about post - physical humans , and about computers with emotions ?
Well they only sounded slightly silly at the time because their soundtrack had not arrived ; it has now .

A couple of weeks ago , ABC’s Dr. Oz pulled a propaganda stunt by lauding the virtues of the H1N1 vaccine and apparently getting injected with it live on his show .
However , when asked by a CNN anchor if he would be making his kids take it , the doc was less gung - ho .
Perhaps he knows what ’s actually in the vaccine , namely mercury , squalene and a host of other nasties .

UPDATE !!!
WATCH THIS VIDEO ( thanks Jordan ) :
Everyone knows that the ability for developers to upload and users to view screenshots on Android Market is a HUGE and unmet need that has been repeatedly addressed .
Today Google got one step closer to making it reality – Android Developers can log into their accounts and upload screen shots and a promotion image for their application .
Android Market screenshots are imminent !
Here is what we saw when logging in to upload screenies for Phandroid News :
AWESOME !
But there is one HUGE thing to note :
“ Screenshots are available only on the market .
android.com website at this time and will not show on the device ”
That kind of stinks but is understandable .
When adding an update of this magnitude it makes sense they would do it in stages and roll out slowly .
So I quickly put together a screenshot just to test if it would allow me to upload along with one of the promotional images , keeping their size demands in mind :
Then I hit the SAVE button and was met with an error :
I went ahead and added a second screenshot and included the promotional text that they required , clicked SAVE again and all was good in the hood .
The only question now is will it show my screenshots on the Market Website ?
Unfortunately because of Android Market ’s limited ability to display applications in the FIRST place , Phandroid News is n’t anywhere to be found .
Maybe that is the market ’s first problem … do n’t you think our App should be FEATURE ? :)
In any case , developers should get their screenshots up and consumers should keep an eye on this because a big market update seems imminent .
The quicker devs move to supporting this upgrade feature the quicker I imagine Google will try to implement .
Two cheers for continued improvement !
Keep up the good work GOOG .
UPDATE # 2 : I just found the Android Dev post referencing all this … surprised nobody posted it before Phandroid !
Looks like in addition to screen shots they ’ve also updated the directory categorization by adding a few more cats .
Here is the content from that post which you can read in full here :
Some News from Android Market
Posted by Eric Chu , Android Mobile Platform on 03 September 2009 at 3:30 PM
I ’m pleased to let you know about several updates to Android Market .
First , we will soon introduce new features in Android Market for Android 1.6 that will improve the overall experience for users .
As part of this change , developers will be able to provide screenshots , promotional icons and descriptions that will better show off applications and games .
We have also added four new sub- categories for applications : sports , health , themes , and comics .
Developers can now choose these sub-categories for both new and existing applications via the publisher website .
Finally , we have added seller support for developers in Italy .
Italian developers can go to the publisher website to upload applications and target any of the countries where paid applications are currently available to users .
To take advantage of the upcoming Android Market refresh , we encourage you to visit the Android Market publisher website and upload additional marketing assets .
Check out the video below for some of the highlights .

Streaming Models both Old and New
Streaming models were started decades ago and continue to be even more exciting
Ian Munro is one of the world ’s experts on data structures .
If you need to know anything about data structures , either lower bounds or upper bounds , he is one of the few people I would call for advice .
If he does not know , or he does not know who knows , or he cannot suggest an approach , you are in deep trouble .
Today I will present some work that Atish Das Sarma and Danupon Nanongkai have recently done on a variation of the streaming model , which was just presented at TAMC 2009 .
Ian also wrote one of the first papers on streaming , before there was streaming .
More on this later .
Atish and Danupon are two graduate students who are working with me , but they are both quite independent and have already written papers with various colleagues from various places on various topics .
How is that for a vague statement .
In any event , I want to come clean , since I worked with them on their results .
Ian Munro is a long - time friend , and I have many stories about him , which could fill up an almost infinite number of posts .
Ian ’s great sense of humor always makes it a pleasure to work with him .
Whenever we have worked on a problem and gotten stuck , Ian has a trick that he uses to get us back on track .
He says ,
“ let ’s make a list of what we need to do . ”
He then proceeds to take a piece of paper and writes on the paper :
. . .
Make a list .
where are the detailed things that we need to do in order to solve the problem in question .
For example , the first item might be : Find an algorithm that converts any into a in linear time .
He then takes the list and with his pen writes on it : now the list is ,
. . .
Make a list .
He then would say ,
“ well we can take a break , since we have done 25 per cent of the work . ”
And off we go to get a drink , and hopefully also get an inspiration .
One of my other favorite Ian stories is about the time he got tenure .
At STOC that year , he told a group of us that he had just gotten tenure .
We all congratulated him — it was wonderful news .
He then proceeded to point out that at Waterloo — where he was and still is — tenure is not official until the next trustee meeting .
The trustee ’s signing off on all the year ’s tenure decisions was , of course , pro forma .
But , it would not happen for about a month .
Ian then raised an interesting “ open problem : ” what could he do , in the next month , to get his tenure decision reversed ?
What behavior would undo tenure ?
Only Ian .
It was a fun discussion , as we argued over which behaviors would lead to tenure being revoked , and which behaviors would not .
The group sometimes agreed that this behavior would lead to a revoke , and that behavior would not .
Sometimes we were divided .
Thankfully , Ian decided not to test the various hypotheses and he got his tenure .
Let ’s now turn to talking about the streaming model , and the work of Atish and Danupon .
The Streaming Model
The streaming model is both new and old .
In computer science we sometimes create entire new areas of study .
However , more often than not , a hot new area is an old one in disguise — or an old one with a slight twist .
I think this is the case with the current area that is called streaming .
As you probably know , in the basic streaming model , data is send one bit after another to the algorithm , which must compute the answer after the last bit has been sent .
So far the model does not restrict the algorithm at all — just have the algorithm store the input , and then run any method to solve the given problem .
This strategy would make the streaming model trivial , so the rules of streaming are that the algorithm is always space limited .
That is , if the stream is bits long , then the algorithm is only allowed to store bits , where is always much smaller than .
For example , might be restricted to be or even to be polylog in : that is might have to be bounded by .
The space restriction makes the model interesting , but does it make the model new ?
I think no and yes .
The basic setup is nothing more than asking : what is the smallest number of states that are needed by a finite state automata ( FSA ) to solve the given problem ?
You know I love FSA , and have previously shown their power .
So what is new with streaming ?
Partly it ’s that usually streaming algorithms use randomness , but we could of course replace a FSA by a random finite state automata .
So that is not new , since such models have been studied for decades .
I think streaming is new for several reasons — even if the basic model is not really new .
The reasons are :
The motivation is new .
The size of inputs has increased to the point where they are extremely large .
So large that the basic streaming model is no longer a theoretic model , but has become a practical model .
If the data you wish to process is huge , then you may be forced to use the streaming model .
For example , the new accelerator at CERN will generate so much sensor data that they plan on using streaming algorithms — the amount of data created per second is so large that they really have no choice .
The the class of problems is different .
Studying FSA ’s involved very different problems , which were often artificial ones .
Now the main problems are more “ real ’ problems : graph problems , linear algebra problems , statistical problems , and many others .
The results are new .
Many new and extremely clever ideas have been found by researchers working on the streaming model .
The general streaming framework has been studied extensively since the seminal work of Noga Alon , Yossi Matias , and Mario Szegedy .
Their beautiful results and new ideas excited the theory community tremendously , which led to their receiving the Gödel prize in 2005 for their work .
The best reason — in my opinion — is that the streaming model generalizes the notion of input that was previously used in the study of FSA ’s .
Streaming models allow more complex rules on how the data arrives to the algorithm .
Let ’s call this the order type of the streaming model .
I will , in the next section , explain this in detail .
Yet , already in 1978 Ian Munro and Mike Paterson had results on computing the median in a model that was essentially the streaming model .
They proved :
Theorem :
The median of numbers can be computed in space with high probability in one pass over the numbers .
And ,
Theorem :
The median of numbers can be computed in space deterministically with two passes over the numbers .
So is streaming new ?
You decide .
Order Types of Streaming Models
In the classic FSA model the order of the data is set by the definition of the problem .
I have already talked about BDD ’s which allow the input order to be selected so that the task of solving the problem is as easy as possible .
Streaming models allow an even richer class of order types , which is the principle reason they are exciting .
To explain the notion of order type let us focus on problems that concern matrices .
The general ideas apply to many other areas , but I think that the explanation will be easier if we focus first on matrices .
Let be an matrix of integer values .
We assume that entries of the form make up the input : means that
Here are some possible input order types :
Natural :
This is an order that only depends on the input being a matrix .
Some choices include row order and column order .
Note the order has nothing to do with the problem being considered .
Best Oblivious :
This is the order that is used by BDD’s .
The entries of the matrix are sent in the manner that is best for the problem .
However , the order can only depend on the problem , not on the actual matrix .
This is why the order is called “ oblivious . ”
Adversarial :
This order allows an adversary to look at the input matrix and then decide what order to send the matrix entries to the algorithm .
The order thus can be non-oblivious , and the adversary can try to make the input ordering as nasty as possible .
This is the most popular , and standard order type for streaming models .
Random :
This is just what you would guess : the entries of are send in a random order .
Sorted :
This order sends the entries of after they have been sorted according to some rule .
For example , the order could be : send the entries sorted first by the value , and then by the indices .

The Noel Kempff Mercado climate action project in Bolivia
Why would America 's largest coal utility and Britain 's biggest oil company invest in protecting a remote plot of Bolivian rainforest ?
American Electric Power and BP invested in the pilot project alongside environmental groups such as the Nature Conservancy to find out if protecting forests compensates for their own pollution .
The burning of tropical forests emits more carbon dioxide every year than all the cars , planes , and boats on the planet - between 15 and 20 % of global emissions .
A deal at Copenhagen could mean both governments and businesses paying billions to keep the forests standing .
With agreement looking unlikely on many other areas , some negotiators feel a deal aimed at preventing deforestation may be the most concrete outcome from the talks .
Valuing a forest Professor Geoffrey Heal is working out how this money would be spent .
The Columbia University economist used to advise Opec on how to manage the oil market .
Now he teaches courses on corporate social responsibility and energy to Business MBA students .
In 2004 , he was approached by a student who knew the prime minister of Papua New Guinea .
The student had been sent to New York on a mission .
" Deforestation was a big issue there , " he says .
" The prime minister had asked him when he was in New York to look into whether there was any way to make money from the forests without cutting them down . "
The Rainforest Coalition - a loose grouping of more than 20 nations - grew up in response to that question .
Their first task was to find a way to reward nations for not cutting down their forests .
" Basically the mechanism we 've come up with is the following ; countries reduce their rates of deforestation below what they historically have been and in exchange for that , they get carbon credits which they can sell on world carbon markets , " says Heal .
To work out exactly how much money each country would get , they needed to calculate how much carbon was released by burning their forest .
They get paid for every tonne they keep trapped .
Different forests contain different amounts of carbon .
So teams of conservationists turned economists are being dispatched around the world to work out a forest 's value .
" It is possible to calculate the amount of carbon in a hectare of rainforest to a reasonable amount of precision , " he says .
Data from numerous plots is then combined with satellite imagery of the forest .
Once the carbon stock is calculated , satellite pictures are used to track the impact of any deforestation .
Nations would be paid from annuities - the money would only keep coming if the forest kept standing .
Creating a market Valuing the forest is complex - finding the money to pay for it even harder .
The movement has turned biologists into entrepreneurs .
Andrew Mitchell is one .
He is a director at the Global Canopy Programme which published the Little REDD Book , on plans to fund forest protection .
Some biologists are becoming entrepreneurs " Well , I 've been a biologist up in the trees and I realised that with all the scientists I worked with around the world , it 's time we got out of the trees and the green jungles and into the concrete jungles .
I spend a lot of time now talking to businesses , " says Mr Mitchell .
He his helping with another project , Canopy Capital , which encourages investment in the ecosystem of the Iwokrama forest in Guyana .
The forest 's carbon is one product of the ecosystem which investors - and forest residents - may earn money from in the future .
Mr Mitchell says you need private and public sector funds to raise the money to prevent deforestation .
The British government 's Eliasch Review put the cost of paying nations not to deforest at between $ 17bn and $ 33 bn a year .
One way to raise that would be to allow polluters in the west to make a portion of their agreed emissions reductions by investing in preventing pollution from deforestation .
That 's what drove AEP , BP and Pacific Corp to invest in the Noel Kempff Mercado Climate Action Project in Bolivia 's north - eastern rainforest a decade ago .
The public purses of developed countries will not be able to produce all the finance needed ... in the latter stages we hope it will be significantly a carbon market and that market will be global
Joan Ruddock , UK climate change minister Like most countries , the British government supports the idea .
Joan Ruddock is the UK climate change minister .
Her team leads the EU 's negotiations on avoided deforestation .
She says national governments will provide funding at the start - until the market kicks in .
" The public purses of developed countries will not be able to produce all the finance needed .
In the latter stages , we hope it will be significantly a carbon market and that market will be global , " she says .
The new US senate bill on climate change would force US firms to make tough emissions cuts .
But the bill would allow them to make some of these cuts , 500 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year , by paying for emissions reductions in other countries .
Firms such as American Electric
Power are lobbying for the limit to be far higher .
Their spokesperson , Melissa Chenry , argues preventing deforestation is a cheap way of cutting emissions .
It " provides a very economical way to reduce atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide " , she says .
Reducing emissions by keeping trees standing is likely to be far cheaper than other solutions , such as converting power stations to capture their carbon dioxide .
Ultimately , it means consumers will have to pay less .
Funding dilemma
The economics pose a dilemma at Copenhagen .
Businesses will only pay to protect rainforests if it means they can avoid making more costly reductions to their own emissions .
Greenpeace 's senior climate adviser , Charlie Kronick , worries protecting forests might provide a " get out of jail free card " to polluting western firms .
Few believe preventing deforestation can be a substitute for substantial emissions reductions in developed countries .
Paven Sukhdev , a career banker for Deutsche Bank who now works on the issue for the UN and EU , argues that at least 65 % of reductions must be made within developed countries .
That means firms such as AEP may still be limited in how much they can invest in projects abroad .
Firms in developing countries may not have to buy credits at all .
That has led to worries in the City that there wo n't be enough money to buy all the forest carbon .
London 's financial centre is the main home to the incipient global carbon market .
Prof Heal believes that in a decade , the trade could be worth trillions of dollars .
But recently falling carbon prices and uncertainty have reduced demand for the few international schemes which currently exist .
Rupert Edwards , the managing director of Climate Change Capital , believes rainforest carbon could swamp the market - if not enough money is allowed in .
Rainforests " might be a big part of the potential supply , but it could swamp all the demand " , he says .
The numbers could add up , he admits , but only if polluters around the world are forced to buy credits as well as making drastic reductions to their own emissions .
Such a solution may be more costly to firms and consumers than many are willing to accept .

see deal Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 $ 19.99 on Gamestop
Controversy arose yesterday when a leaked video hit the internet showcasing what appeared to be a level found in Infinity Ward 's upcoming shooter Modern Warfare 2
Publisher Activision has spoken out about the video , not only confirming its legitimacy to IGN , but also saying players are warned beforehand about the level 's upcoming violent sequences .
"
The leaked footage was taken from a copy of game that was obtained illegally and is not representative of the overall gameplay experience in Modern Warfare 2 , " an Activision spokesperson told IGN .
" Infinity Ward 's Modern Warfare 2 features a deep and gripping storyline in which players face off against a terrorist threat dedicated to bringing the world to the brink of collapse , " the spokesperson added .
" The game includes a plot involving a mission carried out by a Russian villain who wants to trigger a global war .
In order to defeat him , the player infiltrates his inner circle .
The scene is designed to evoke the atrocities of terrorism .
" Right now , Activision is saying players may choose " not to engage in the gameplay . "
That could mean choosing not to fire your weapon or the possibility of an " opt- out " from the level entirely .
We wo n't know until we play for ourselves .
" At the beginning of the game , players encounter a mandatory " checkpoint " in which they are warned that an upcoming segment may contain disturbing elements and they can choose not to engage in the gameplay that involves this scene , " Activision says .
" Consistent with its content , the game has been given an " M " for Mature by the Entertainment Software Ratings Board .
The rating is prominently displayed on the front and back of the packaging , as well as in all advertising .
" Does this change your view on Modern Warfare 2 ?
Eat Less Protein , Get The Same Muscles
Body builders will tell you that protein is key to bigger , stronger muscles .
For the truly elite , that may be the case but for the all but 50 of you who are not elite muscle builders , a recent study by University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston metabolism researchers provides evidence that a more normal eating pattern is going to get you the same results as wolfing down protein shakes ; something your commission - based , fitness - center trainer does not want you to read .
The study 's results , obtained by measuring muscle synthesis rates in volunteers who consumed different amounts of lean beef , show that only about the first 30 grams ( just over one ounce ) of dietary protein consumed in a meal actually produce muscle .
" We knew from previous work that consuming 30 grams of protein — or the equivalent of approximately 4 ounces of chicken , fish , dairy , soy , or , in this case , lean beef — increased the rate of muscle protein synthesis by 50 percent in young and older adults , " said associate professor Douglas Paddon - Jones , senior author of a paper on the study published in the September issue of the Journal of the American Dietetic Association .
" We asked if 4 ounces of beef gives you a 50 percent increase , would 12 ounces , containing 90 grams of protein , give you a further increase ? "
The UTMB researchers tested this possibility by feeding 17 young and 17 elderly volunteers identical 4 - or 12 - ounce portions of lean beef .
Using blood samples and thigh muscle biopsies , they then determined the subjects ' muscle protein synthesis rates following each of the meals .
" In young and old adults , we saw that 12 ounces gave exactly the same increase in muscle protein synthesis as 4 ounces , " Paddon - Jones says .
" This suggests that at around 30 grams of protein per meal , maybe a little less , muscle protein synthesis hits an upper ceiling .
I think this has a lot of application for how we design meals and make menu recommendations for both young and older adults . "
The results of the study , Paddon - Jones points out , seem to show that a more effective pattern of protein consumption is likely to differ dramatically from most Americans ' daily eating habits .
" Usually , we eat very little protein at breakfast , eat a bit more at lunch and then consume a large amount at night .
When was the last time you had just 4 ounces of anything during dinner at a restaurant ? "
Paddon - Jones said .
" So we 're not taking enough protein on board for efficient muscle - building during the day , and at night we 're taking in more than we can use .
Most of the excess is oxidized and could end up as glucose or fat . "
A more efficient eating strategy for making muscle and controlling total caloric intake would be to shift some of extra protein consumed at dinner to lunch and breakfast .
" You do n't have to eat massive amounts of protein to maximize muscle synthesis , you just have to be a little more clever with how you apportion it , " Paddon - Jones said .
" For breakfast consider including additional high quality proteins .
Throw in an egg , a glass of milk , yogurt or add a handful of nuts to get to 30 grams of protein , do something similar to get to 30 for lunch , and then eat a smaller amount of protein for dinner .
Do this , and over the course of the day you likely spend much more time synthesizing muscle protein . "
The best reason to support President Obama ’s decision to dump Bush ’s Star Wars program is that the neocons are outraged .
They ’re wrong about everything : the geopolitical world ’s biggest losers , punditry ’s equivalent of the Chrysler car design unit .
Everything that comes out of the neocons ’ brains is a guaranteed lemon .
It ’s hard to understand why the Hell these people still have jobs , let alone citizenship in the nation they ruined–until you remember that America stopped being a meritocracy a few decades ago , and only shamelessness and bluster are rewarded .
Now the neocons are back to try to ruin us again .
This time they ’re screaming treason and stab - in - the - back at Obama for the crime of canceling a corrupt , failed , and ultimately dangerous - to - ourselves missile shield that was to be set up in the Czech Republic and Poland .
I was in Russia when the ABM Treaty was scrapped back in 2001 .
We ’d just taken Kabul , the Russians had already rolled out the red carpet for us opening up their former bases in the ex-Soviet Central Asian republics , and so naturally the neocons told Bush that we did n’t need the Russians anymore , so fuck ‘ em .
The day America announced its withdrawal from the ABM treaty , Putin gave an address to the nation that was one of the few , if only times , I recall him looking actually shaken–after 9/11 , his KGB / military base was furious that Putin cooperated with America , arguing that America could n’t be trusted and letting America into Central Asia “ temporarily ” was like inviting Dracula into your home–he ’d never leave until he ’d drained every last person .
By ripping up the ABM treaty that quickly after we ’d taken Kabul , Putin was made to look like a fool , and it showed in his television address that night .
I was also in Moscow in the spring of 2006 , when Foreign Policy magazine published an article by two American experts arguing that the only purpose of setting up the missile shield in Poland and the Czech Republic was to give America first - strike primacy over Russia .
The American academics , Keir Lieber of Nortre Dame and Daryl Press of the University of Pennsylvania , argued that the missile shield being set up in Eastern Europe only made sense if its design was to give America the capability to launch a successful nuclear first - strike on Russia and shoot down whatever remained of their arsenal–as Lieber told me in an interview , it made no sense to place the shield on Russia ’s northwestern border if the object was Iran or North Korea , because the shield is designed to take out the missiles as close to their launching point as possible .
The only possible reason for setting it up in Poland and the Czech Republic was to first - strike Russia .
The Russian media went apeshit when the Foreign Policy article was published , and the country ’s leadership has been furious about the missile shield ever since .
But what I find really idiotic is that the neocons who pushed it did n’t plan on the Russians taking counter - measures to get some negotiating leverage against the missile shield .
They just figured , like Dr. Evil when he has Austin Powers sent off to be assassinated out - of - view , that “ I ’ll just announce the shield and take a decade to set it up on Russia ’s borders , and assume that the Russians wo n’t cause problems for us in the 10 years it takes to set it up , and everything goes according to plan , what ? ”
And so ever since Bush announced he was scrapping the ABM treaty in 2001 , Russia has become a growing menace to America ’s hegemony around the world , arming everyone from Venezuela to Hezbollah and of course Iran , not to mention whatever shenanigans they ’ve been playing in Afghanistan and Iraq .
But really , even if Russia is “ evil , ” can you blame them ?
It worked : now we ’re doing a deal to get rid of a system we do n’t need , so that they ’ll stop causing problems we can’t handle .
It takes a functioning brain to understand that the world does n’t always work the way you want it to–and now that America has been so weakened by all the other neocon - designed disasters , we ’re too weak to pick a global fight with Russia .
That ’s why Kissinger , Scowcroft , Gates , and other “ realist ” Republicans pushed Obama to throw in the towel on this loser program , and instead focus on trying to undo all the damage done by the neocons .
You ’d think they ’d be gone forever , but no : now the neocons are back , telling us that scrapping the missile shield is surrender .
It ’s Munich 1938 , for the 1 billionth time repeated over and over like some neocon Groundhog Day–that ’s their favorite idiotic historical analogy , and they ’ll never tire of dragging it around like some Halloween pumpkin to scare us .
It ’s like bad slapstick from a shitty Hanna - Barbera cartoon , the way these neocons constantly whisper disastrous advice into America ’s ear .
Yep , I ’m talking about “ The Great Gazoo , ” the snobby , sexually - ambiguous martian who tormented Fred Flintstone with his catastrophic advice , always abandoning Fred after disaster struck .
The neocons are Gazoo : Charles Krauthammer , John Bolton , Mona Charen , Max Boot , Fred Barnes , The Weekly Standard , The National Review , the Washington Post editorial page …. and of course , Dick Cheney .
Now Obama ’s announced one of his rare brave / intelligent decisions –to scrap Bush ’s Star Wars project–and the Great Gazoo does n’t like it one bit .
The neocons are screaming that President Obama ’s plan to scrap the missile shield in eastern Europe will lead to the destruction of Western civilization as we know it .
That Obama is some kind of blackface version of Neville Chamberlain .
It ’s pure Gazoo comic relief of the lowest Hanna - Barbera sort , and the repeats are worse than the first - runs were .
Just in case anyone ’s forgotten , below I ’m recounting some of the highlights from the Great Gazoo / neocon show over the past decade , to get a flavor of the hijinks and knee - slappers that they wreaked to our poor nation :
2002 :
POOF !
“ Oh Mister Preeeesident , it ’s meeeee , Gazoo .
You let Bin Laden get away , dumb - dumb , and now you ’ve got a country called Afghanistan that ’s of no use .
Pretty soon , people are going to start asking questions about 9 - 11 … ”
“ Boy am I glad to see you , Gazoo .
What should I do ? ”
“ If you just listen to me , Mr. President , I can solve your problems . ”
“ Really ?
How ? ”
“ It ’s not that difficult , dumb - dumb .
Invade Iraq .
You earthlings are soooo slow . ”
“ But my dad says invading will be a problem . ”
“ You ’re dad ’s an earthling , dumb - dumb .
It ’ll be a cakewalk .
The entire Middle East will become pro-American .
I told him that a decade ago but he would n’t listen , because he ’s a dumb - dumb . ”
“ I ’ll listen to you , Gazoo . ”
“ I know you will , George .
It seems you ’re the only earthling who is n’t a dumb - dumb .
Now do as I say and invade Iraq . ”
“ What sort of planning should I do ?
How many troops should I use , Gazoo ? ”
“ It does n’t really matter , just have your troops bring lots of vases because the locals will greet them with flowers .
Now , about North Korea … ”
“ I did as you said , Gazoo .
I stopped talking to North Korea completely , and pulled everyone out of negotiations . ”
“ Good , North Korea should be begging to surrender to us in a matter of weeks , not months .
Toodle - loo , dumb - dumb ! ” POOF !
2004 :
“ Gazoo , where are you ?
You gotta help me out , this Iraq thing is turning into a disaster ! ”
POOF !
“ Do n’t be a dumb - dumb , Mr. President !
If you ’d listened to me and done it right , you would n’t be in this mess . ”
“ But you told me to invade Iraq , Gazoo ! ”
“ Of course I did , dumb - dumb .
And everything would have turned out perfectly if only you ’d bombed Iran and Syria in the aftermath .
Those two are mucking up a perfectly good occupation .
Clearly I wasted good advice on a dumb - dumb .
Now it ’s your mess , not mine . ”
“ But Gazoo , I ca n’t invade Iran right now , our forces are overstretched , the Shia in Iraq are in revolt – ”
“ That ’s not my problem , dumb - dumb .
I told you to invade Iran , and you did n’t .
If you do n’t want to listen to me , do so at your own peril , dumb - dumb . ”
“ No wait , Gazoo , do n’t leave me !
You gotta help get me outta Iraq ! ”
“ Toodle - loo , dumb - dumb ! ” POOF !
2006 :
POOF !
“ Oh Ehuuuud Olmert , Mr. Prime Minister ?
I know how to get rid of the threat on Israel ’s northern border .
If you just listen to me , I can solve your problems , dumb - dumb . ”
“ Gazoo , is that you ? ”
“ No , it ’s Baal .
Of course I ’m Gazoo , dumb - dumb . ”
“ I ’m sorry , Gazoo , it ’s just . ”
“ Listen to me and shuttup , dumb - dumb .
Now , here ’s how to get rid of Hezbollah and win the next elections .
Bomb the Shia villages and invade the south of Lebanon with armored columns .
It ’ll be a breeze , dumb - dumb .
They ’ll never bother Israel again . ”
“ Really , Gazoo ? ”
“ Of course , dumb - dumb .
You ’re the one with the air force and tanks .
Use them .
Toodle - loo ! ” POOF !
TWO WEEKS LATER :
“ Gazoo !
Help me , it ’s Ehud !
Where are you , Gazoo ? ”
POOF !
“ I ’m trying to have a bath , dumb - dumb .
You earthlings have no manners . ”
“ But Gazoo , we ’ve bombed and bombed and invaded southern Lebanon just like you said , and it ’s turning into a military defeat .
We ’re losing to Hezbollah ! ”
“ Of course you ’re losing dumb - dumb , because you did n’t listen to me .
Iran is the real problem , so you have to bomb Iran .
Do I have to tell you everything , dumb - dumb ? ”
“ But I ca n’t bomb Iran unless America bombs Iran with me .
You said President Bush wouuld bomb Iran if I got in trouble , and they ’re not bombing .
What happened ? ”
“ He ’s a dumb - dumb too , just like his father .
Just wait until he finds out that North Korea will set off a nuclear test bomb in a month–of course , if the dumb - dumb listened to me and continued not talking to North Korea , he would n’t be in this mess in the first place . ”
“ But Gazoo , I ’m ruined if the war ends in a defeat like this ! ”
“ You ’re still here , Ehud ?
Well look , I ca n’t help a dumb - dumb who does n’t listen to me , now can I , dumb - dumb ?
Call me when you ’ve bombed Iran .
They would n’t dare to retaliate , that ’s for certain .
Toodle - loo , dumb - dumb ! ” POOF !
2008 :
POOF !
“ Oh Miiiiiisha , Mr. President of Georgia ?
Helloooo , it ’s me , Gazoo .
I know how you can regain South Ossetia and overcome your domestic political problems , if you just listen to me , dumb - dumb . ”
“ Gazoo ?
Boy am I glad to see you . ”
“ I ’m sure you are , dumb - dumb .
So here ’s my plan , if you ’re not too much of a dumb - dumb to understand it : invade South Ossetia with the troops that America trained up for you .
It ’ll be a cinch –the Russians wo n’t even know what hit them . ”
“ Really ? ”
“ Yes , really , dumb - dumb .
You have Gazoo on your side , and the Russians do n’t have Gazoo .
Anyone who ’s not a dumb - dumb realizes that the side with Gazoo wins . ”
“ I ’m glad I have Gazoo on my side ! ”
“ I see you ’re learning , Misha .
Maybe you ’re not such a dumb - dumb . ”
“ How will my military victory in South Ossetia solve my political problems , Gazoo ? ”
“ Well , dumb - dumb , you ’ll be so popular you wo n’t need to kill or jail your political opponents anymore , because everyone will support President Saakashvili , war hero ! ”
“ Gazoo , you ’re a genius ! ”
“ Tell me something I do n’t know , dumb - dumb . Toodle - loo ! ”
TWO WEEKS LATER :
“ Gazoo , help me !
Where are you Gazoo ???
The Russians destroyed my army , and they ’re deep inside Georgian territory ! ”
POOF !
“ Do I have to do everything for you , dumb - dumb ? ”
“ But Gazoo , I thought you said that the Russians would never invade after I took South Ossetia . ”
“ That ’s not what I told you , dumb - dumb .
I said that Bush would never let Russia invade .
Unfortunately , Bush is a dumb - dumb .
And even I , the Great Gazoo , am powerless to help a dumb - dumb . ”
“ What do I do now ?
I ’m ruined ! ”
“ Gazoo has it all worked out .
Your friend John McCain is much smarter than the dumb - dumb Bush , and he agrees that it ’s time to start a New Cold War with Russia .
He understands how easily America will win the New Cold War , unlike dumb - dumb .
As soon as McCain is the new president , everything will work out fine .
Toodle - loo , dumb - dumb ! ”
* * *
Now it ’s 2009 , and Gazoo , who laid low for awhile , is back with a vengeance , particularly since there ’s no caveman president to take his advice seriously .
So instead , Gazoo is bullhorning his message to the tens of millions of cavemen Flintstones across America who might heed his message .
And his message is this : by scrapping a loser weapons system that cost America dearly in all kinds of ways while gaining it nothing , Obama is worse than a “ dumb - dumb ” –he ’s opened up the castle gates to the Russians , and any day now , they ’re going to re-invade Europe and destroy Western civilization as we know it .
How hard can it be to understand that , dumb - dumbs ?

To no one 's surprise , the commander of the Russian Air Force has refused to accept any of the new UAVs offered by Russian manufacturers .
Colonel General Alexander Zelin put it rather bluntly ; " To put such drones into service is simply a crime . "
Russian military commanders have known of the shortcomings of Russian UAVs for years .
They learned the hard way when they tried to use them in the Caucasus .
Russian UAVs have short endurance ( a few hours ) and are unreliable .
They are difficult to operate and not popular with the troops .
Several years ago , Russian generals began suggesting the unthinkable ; that they be allowed to buy Western UAVs .
American ones were unobtainable ( all that were being built were taken by U.S. forces ) , but the Israelis were willing to sell .
Earlier this year , the Russians placed an order for over fifty UAVs , including the Bird - Eye 400 , I - View MK150 and Searcher 2 .
The Bird - Eye 400 is a nine pound micro-UAV with a maximum endurance of 80 minutes , max ceiling of 1,000 feet and can operate 15 kilometers from the operator .
It is mainly for the use of small infantry units .
The I - View MK150 is a 550 pound aircraft with an 7 hour endurance , max altitude of 17,000 feet and can operate up to 150 kilometers from the operator .
It can carry a 44 pound payload , which enables day and night vidcams .
It can take off using an airfield or from a truck mounted launcher .
It can land on an airfield or via parachute .
It is usually employed to support brigades .
The Searcher 2 is a half ton aircraft with an endurance of 20 hours , max altitude of 23,000 feet and can operate up to 300 kilometers from the operator .
It can carry a 264 pound payload .
This is closer to the U.S. Predator , and usually supports a division or brigade .
Russia has been building UAVs for several decades , but has not achieved the kind of performance found in Israeli and American UAVs .
With this $ 50 million purchase of Israeli UAVs , the Russians get some hands on experience with the best stuff out there , and their engineers get a close look at how competitive UAVs are put together .
Russian manufacturers now say that , once they get a close look at the Israeli UAVs , they can have adequate Russian ones built in a year .
Russian commanders will believe it when they see it , and will use the Israeli equipment in the meantime .
The United States had a similar problem with UAVs , and were also rescued by Israeli success in this field .
The U.S. lost interest in UAVs after Vietnam , while in Israel , work proceeded .
And UAVs figured prominently in the spectacular Israeli aerial victory over the Bekaa Valley in 1982 .
Using UAVs in cooperation with their warplanes , Israel was able to shut down the Syrian Air Force ( and destroy 86 aircraft ) in a few days .
Israel pioneered the use of UAVs for real - time surveillance , electronic warfare and decoys .
But in the U.S. , there was either no interest , or some inexplicably botched UAV development projects .
Americans wondered how the Israelis did it while the Department of Defense continued to screw up attempts to create useful UAVs .
Russia is now in a situation similar to that of the United States in the 1970s .
The Russian UAVs consistently had short duration ( a few hours ) and reliability problems .
But the U.S. eventually solved its problems .
With some urging ( and ridicule ) from Congress , the Department of Defense began to buy UAVs from Israel .
The Navy bought the Israeli Pioneer UAV , which is still in use .
Many of these Israeli UAVs ( plus some newly developed U.S. ones ) were used in the 1991 Gulf War .
There were n't that many of them , but the army and Marines noted that the Air Force and Navy were stingy with answering requests for recon missions .
This made the ground troops aware of how they could create their own Air Force of UAVs .
All of a sudden , the Army and Marines were back in the UAV development business .
This time they were serious and a number of successful UAVs were developed .
The Predator entered service in 1995 .
Russia is apparently seeking to shape up using the same route the U.S. choose .
If you ever want to annoy a native speaker of a language you 're learning , translate idioms from your primary language literally into the other language .
For example , if you 're learning Spanish and you come across something surprising or perplexing , yell out " ¡Santa vaca ! " as loudly as you can within earshot of native Spanish speakers .
The best response I usually get is " That ... does n't mean what you think it means . "
I smile knowingly .
It 's easy to see similar behavior from novice programmers who have n't learned the idioms of their new language , as well .
Baby Perl can be clunky due to lack of understanding of language features , but it can also be clunky due to lack of understanding of language idioms .
You can see this in iterating over arrays :
# Baby Perl for ( my $ i = 0 ; $ i < scalar @items ; ++$ i ) { my $ item = $ items [ $i ] ; ... }
... which uses the C - style for loop , introducing a temporary variable unrelated to the problem , and often succumbs to fencepost errors .
The Perl 5 idiom is simple iteration with a foreach loop ( spelled for because it 's shorter and equivalent , keyword - wise ) :
for my $ item ( @items ) { ... }
( Amusingly , when I wrote the C - style loop , I left the sigil off of $ i .
Although you occasionally need this type of loop in Perl 5 , it 's rare .
I write it often enough in C that my fingers write C and never Perl here . )
Another Perl 5 idiom causes a semi- frequent misunderstanding .
Here 's the idiom for reading from a file through iteration , assuming you have a lexical filehandle stored in $ fh :
while ( < $ fh > ) { chomp ; ... }
It 's common to see Baby Perl which reads all of the lines of a file into an array and then iterates through that array with a C - style loop :
# Baby Perl my @lines = < $ fh > ; for ( my $ i = 0 ; $ i < scalar @lines ; ++i ) { ... }
One problem here is the missing chomp to strip off the input record separator from each line ; that bites a lot of people .
Another problem is that Perl 5 is n't lazy enough to read lines only as you access them in @lines ; it populates the entire array in memory .
The while version is much more parsimonious .
That 's subtle , but it surprises people .
The biggest surprise comes from people who consider < $ fh > to refer to the filehandle , when it 's mere syntax for an operator named readline ( ) .
This leads to code that appears to skip every other line in a file :
# probably buggy code while ( < $ fh > ) { my $ line = < $ fh > ; ... }
There are plenty of other interesting idioms , such as list and hash slices , true - or and defined - or assignment , the temporary empty list operator , and more .
The best way to learn these idioms is to read good code .
I spent a lot of time browsing PerlMonks and trying to answer questions ( even if I did n't post answers ) .
Another good approach is to browse perldoc perlfaq .
Mostly , I believe there 's no substitute for experience and code review from experienced developers .
It may be painful to expose your hard work to a harsh and unforgiving world , but if you can get past your ego and take the hard - won advice of others to heart , you 'll always learn something interesting .
That does n't excuse harsh , demeaning , and abusive behavior , of course -- but that 's a different problem .
Your local Perl Mongers group or mailing list can be a friendlier place to start than many Perl IRC channels or newsgroups .
The Perl Beginners mailing list is a great resource as well .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Researchers have engineered artificial penises in rabbits , using cells from the animals , who then used their new organs to father baby rabbits .
The work takes scientists closer to making other complex solid organs such as livers using a patient ’s own cells , the researchers reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday .
It provides a tailor - made transplant , said Dr. Anthony Atala of Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center ’s Institute for Regenerative Medicine , who led the study .
“ Once the tissue is there , the body recognizes the tissue as its own , ” Atala said in a telephone interview .
Atala focused on the penis because he is a pediatric urologist , who has specialized for years in disorders and congenital defects of the bladder and sexual organs .
“ That was the inspiration for this work .
We are seeing babies born with deficient genitalia all the time .
There are no good options , ” Atala said .
He is also a specialist in regenerative medicine , which uses the body ’s own cells to repair damage .
In this case , Atala ’s team used ordinary cells , not the stem cells often used in such research .
Companies such as Geron and privately held Advanced Cell Technology have business models based on such technology .
Atala ’s team first created a scaffold using the penis of a rabbit , and removed all the living cells from it , leaving only cartilage .
They then took a small piece of tissue from the penis of another rabbit and grew the cells in a lab dish .
Atala said the work has taken his team 18 years to complete .
“ We had to find the right growth factors , the right soup to grow the cells in , ” he said .
They made sure to have two cell types , smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells , the same type of cells that line blood vessels .
The smooth muscle cells made the organ ’s spongy tissue and the endothelial cells grew into blood vessels -- very important in an organ like the penis , which requires good blood supply .
The cells were seeded onto the scaffold , and six weeks later the researchers had penises to graft onto rabbits that had their penises removed .
MAKING BUNNIES
The animals seemed to realize they had working organs again -- the 12 with the grafts tried to mate with female rabbits within one minute of being put into cages with them , and four of the female rabbits became pregnant .
Those with the scaffolding alone and no working tissue did not even try .
Atala is hoping the procedure will work with people , perhaps starting with adult men who have had damage to their organs .
“ Patients with congenital anomalies , penile cancer , traumatic penile injury , and some types of organic erectile dysfunction could benefit from this technology in the future , ” the team wrote in the report .
The process takes six weeks from beginning to end , he said , and there is reason to believe a penis grafted onto a baby would grow with the child .
Atala hopes the approach will work with other organs .
“ We have made clitoral tissue in the past , ” he said .
“ We have extensive work going on with kidneys and livers . ”
Atala ’s team started their experiments with replacement bladders grown from patients ’ cells .
Patients fitted with artificial bladders have been enjoying good function for 10 years now , Atala said .

We set up our worm bin today !
I 'm not sure who was more excited - me or the boys !
The following are the steps I followed to set up my worm bin , and I 'm too excited to wait to share them , but I 'm adding a warning that you should probably wait to see if I kill off all my worms before trying this yourself .
STEP 1 : Read Worms Eat My Garbage .
STEP 2 : Obtain a container .
I used an 18 gallon plastic container with a lid , but Mary Appelhof ( author of Worms Eat My Garbage ) says that a shallow container would be better .
The size of container you will need depends on how much food waste your family produces a day .
Appelhof recommends that you " plan on one square foot of surface for each pound of garbage per week . "
STEP 3 : Drill ventilation holes in the sides and lid .
A friend of mine put this container together for me as part of a class for the Raleigh Community Gardens Meetup Group , and she used special grommets to fill in the holes , but you could also just use some wire mesh .
STEP 4 : Obtain worms .
You need red wigglers , which are available at bait shops .
The goal is a worm to garbage ration of 2:1 ( 2 pounds of worms for every pound of food waste your household produces a day ) , but because worms multiply , you can start with less if the worms seem too pricey .
We bought a pound of worms for $ 17 .
The sales clerk asked us if we were setting up a compost bin " because fishermen never ask for worms by the pound . "
STEP 5 : Prepare bedding .
We used eight pounds of shredded newspaper for our size of container .
You need three pounds of bedding per cubic foot volume of the bin .
Appelhof implied that newspaper was the best type of bedding , though you could also use a mixture of newspaper , leaves , manure , and wood chips .
Avoid newspaper with colored print .
STEP 6 : Wet the bedding .
For plastic containers , you need to add water equal to two times the weight of the bedding .
So for our container , we added 16 pounds of water .
If your container is made of another material besides plastic , add water equal to three times the weight of the bedding .
( Plastic bins tend to accumulate more water over time . )
STEP 7 : Add one or two handfuls of soil .
Mix well .
STEP 8 : Add the worms on top of the bedding .
Leave the lights on in the room , and the worms will move into the bedding within an hour .
If any are left on the surface , remove them .
STEP 9 : Feed your worms by digging a hole big enough for the amount of food you 're going to add .
Put the food in the hole and cover with bedding .
If you 're using a plastic container , add dry shredded bedding to the surface every two or three weeks .
What can you feed your worms ?
vegetables
fruits
coffee grinds
tea leaves
pulvarized egg shells
Cost : $ 10 for the bin + $ 17 for the worms + FREE newspaper obtained from friends = $ 27
Related Posts :
Do not feed them too much citrus , meat , bones , feces , and preferably no dairy .
I'm thinking we 're going to need another bin or two for the amount of food waste we produce , but I 'm going to experiment with this one for now and see how it goes .

BOSTON — Some area lawmakers are supporting legislation on Beacon Hill that would allow students to openly engage in prayer and other religious activities during the school day by defining the students ’ rights and protecting school districts from potential lawsuits .
The Joint Committee on Education heard testimony yesterday on a bill confirming students ’ rights to express religious sentiments during school ceremonies such as commencement or sporting events .
Such expressions have happened in Tewksbury , where Superintendent of Schools Christine McGrath said students have referenced their religion in speeches .
“ Unless something is offensive , we give students a pretty broad latitude , ” she said .
“ We ’ve had respectful students who chose not to stand for the national anthem , and teachers that have given thoughtful answers to questions about Jesus .
This year , we ’ve also tried to reach out more to our Jewish community by putting the High Holy Days on our school calendar . ”
Tewksbury ’s representative , Jim Miceli , D - Wilmington , signed on as a co-sponsor of the bill .
He said he remembered being an elementary student in Boston at a time when voluntary religious education was part of the school day .
“ There was no marginalization of students of different faiths .
If you did n’t want to participate , you just stayed in class and did other things , ” he said .
“ This bill makes sense , it does n’t single out one religion or the other . ”
The bill would not permit students to proselytize their beliefs to others , and the schools would issue a disclaimer that all views expressed were the students ’ alone .
The intent is to protect schools from lawsuits if students choose to pray .
“ What this bill aims to do is codify the rights of schools and students , ” said Rep. Vinny deMacedo , R - Plymouth , the bill ’s chief sponsor .
“ One of the cornerstones of our Constitution is the protection of religious liberty . ”
DeMacedo said the bill would not be used to push any religion over another , and that all prayer would be voluntary .
“ All of us have a different religious background , this is n’t just a Christian , or Jewish , or Muslim thing , ” he said .
“ Right now schools are so concerned because of lawsuits that they do n’t allow anything . ”
Some school officials , however , said controversies over prayer or other religious activities during the school day have not come up in their districts .
“ I have n’t had this issue cross my desk , ” said Lowell School Superintendent Chris Scott .
“ This is the first I ’ve ever heard about it . ”
The bill , which is sponsored by legislators on both sides of the aisle , is the brainchild of the Massachusetts Family Institute , best known for supporting a failed bill to bar same - sex marriage in the state .
MFI President Kris Mineau said that , along with blocking an attempt to extend anti-discrimination protection to transgendered individuals , this bill is one of their top legislative priorities .
“ There ’s nothing new here , nothing controversial , ” Mineau said .
“ This bill puts down on one sheet of paper what students have a right to do . ”
Seventeen legislators are listed as supporters of the bill , including Sen. Bruce Tarr , R - Gloucester , and Rep. Stephen DiNatale , D - Fitchburg .
Rep. Kevin Murphy , D - Lowell , was mistakenly listed as a sponsor .
He said he had never signed the bill .
“ Frankly , I think the language is a little nebulous , ” Murphy said .
“ I ’m a lawyer by trade , and it ’s hard to tell from this bill exactly what kinds of expression are protected . ”
Lowell City Solicitor Christine O’Connor said she had examined similar questions when she recommended that the City Council remove their opening prayer in 2007 .
“ Providing time to pray might be inappropriate , even if students can say any prayer they want or no prayer at all , because it could be taking time from a public school day , ” she said .
“ But I am sure that all this will be vetted by the House counsel . ”

A little after the reports for a beginning of the end of the recession , fears rose that because of the good economic outlooks for improvement of the global economy and that of the US , in particular , it is possible the plans for tightened regulation to be abandoned .
Those plans were one of the first tasks in the agenda of president Barack Obama when he assumed office .
The EU has started yet in the end of last year discussions about the regulation of the financial system and the G20 dealt with the matter several times .
So far the EU is performing slowly but steadily in tightening the supervision and control over the financial markets in the Union but in the US the process is seriously lagging behind .
That is why the chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke , who is pending an approval for a second term , called in Friday the Congress to speed up its work on the financial regulation .
On Thursday a committee in the Congress approved creating a new regulator meant to protect consumers of financial products .
But still many key questions remain in unclear , such as how much power the Fed or another regulator should have to oversee large , complex firms , the Washington post reports .
Ben Bernanke said in Boston that regulators and supervisors can really do a lot of work in preventing future crises but it was necessary the Congress to take comprehensive actions to reform the financial system .
More specifically , Mr. Bernanke called regulators to receive new powers to oversee financial companies whose size and complexity threaten the entire financial system .
Beside this , the new regulators should have the power to close them down in an orderly way should they fail .
He also said that a new approach is needed toward the large complex firms to impose losses on shareholders and creditors of firms that fail , while shielding the overall economy .
He added that any costs should be paid by the financial industry , not taxpayers as president Obama did in the first days of his presidency .
He passed a rescue plan for over $ 700 bn to save the US financial system for which he was criticised .

Bradley Kuhn , the technical director of the Software Freedom Law Center ( SFLC ) , has published a helpful set of guidelines about the most productive way to respond to a suspected violation of GNU 's General Public License ( GPL ) .
The guidelines caution against jumping to conclusions and encourages free software enthusiasts to give violators the benefit of the doubt .
GPL violations are extremely common , he says , but most of them are accidental .
The SFLC , which was founded in 2005 with the aim of providing legal support for the free and open source software development community , has played a key role in resolving numerous GPL enforcement conflicts .
Its approach to GPL enforcement is typically instructive and non-confrontational .
Lawsuits are used as a last resort and have consistently resulted in out - of - court settlements .
The organization is perhaps best known for litigating a series of high - profile GPL violation cases on behalf of the developers of the open source BusyBox embedded tools .
In his role as the SFLC 's technical director and in his previous position as the executive director of the Free Software Foundation , Kuhn has had extensive involvement in GPL enforcement efforts .
His commentary on the subject is , needless to say , very well informed .
He published the guidelines this week in response to a recent incident of alleged GPL infringement that was attributed to Microsoft .
An independent programmer found evidence suggesting that Microsoft 's proprietary Windows 7 USB / DVD Download tool was potentially built with source code that was misappropriated from a GPL - licensed project called ImageMaster .
The evidence is ambiguous but compelling .
Microsoft apparently thought so too , because it pulled the tool in question from its website and is said to be investigating the matter .
Kuhn 's guidelines put the matter into perspective and provide some insight into how such issues should be handled .
Kuhn says that he has found , on average , one new company violating the GPL every day over the past few months .
GPL violations are so common , he says , that he could easily keep it up for a whole year .
He regards it as important work , but does n't consider any individual instance of GPL infringement to be a significant revelation .
Finding and resolving these issues is a lot like fixing bugs , according to Kuhn .
Single cases do n't mean much , but the ongoing effort contributes to a healthier and better - informed commercial ecosystem around free and open source software — one in which companies understand and appreciate their licensing obligations .
Most GPL violations are mere accidents or the result of simple negligence .
Instead of immediately publicizing a suspected case of infringement , Kuhn suggests that the best way to start productive enforcement action is to privately contact the company and submit a for request source code and clarification .
The next step is to contact the actual copyright holder — the author of the code that is being misused — as they are empowered to legally enforce the licensing terms .
This should be done privately , he says , rather than on public mailing lists .
He feels that attempting to publicly shame a company into compliance will undermine communication and make it more difficult to proceed .
" Do n't go public first .
Back around late 1999 , when I found my first GPL violation from scratch , I wanted to post it to every mailing list I could find and shame that company that failed to respect and cooperate with the software freedom community .
I 'm glad that I did n't do that , because I 've since seen similar actions destroy the lines of communication with violators , and make resolution tougher , " Kuhn wrote .
" Remember that the primary goal of the GPL is to encourage more software freedom in the world .
For many violators , the first experience the violator has with FLOSS is an enforcement action .
We therefore must ensure that enforcement action is reasonable and friendly .
I view every GPL violator as a potential FLOSS contributor , and try my best to open every enforcement action with that attitude . "
Kuhn 's complete blog entry is worth a look and offers a number of additional recommendations that are equally important .
It 's a good resource for free software enthusiasts and developers who are concerned about license violations and want to contribute to productive enforcement efforts .
Companies that are looking for additional details about how to avoid accidental GPL violations might want to have a look at the SFLC 's handy compliance guide , which was published last year .

A Langara College student says she feels violated after two RCMP officers approached her on the Vancouver campus to question her about a friend who is an Olympic protester .
Danika Surm said she told the plainclothes officers that it was n't a good time , but they insisted they would find a time .
They called her on her cell phone the next day .
" I felt violated to tell the truth .
I do n't know how they found me .
I was tracked down , " said Surm , who says she does not belong to any anti-Olympic groups .
The officers were from the RCMP 's 2010 security unit , which has questioned more than a dozen people related to the anti-Olympic movement .
The officers wanted to know about her friend , Chris Shaw , who has been a vocal Olympic opponent .
Shaw said it 's one thing for police to ask him questions .
Approaching his friends goes too far , he said .
" This is becoming a big deal because it 's no longer just protesters they want to intimidate , " he said .
" It 's no longer the realm of activists .
It could be anybody . "
An RCMP official acknowledged Tuesday that the agency has been questioning people connected to the anti-Olympic movement , but says it's in the name of keeping the event safe .
" It 's basic police work , looking to speak to people , gathering information , " said Const .
Mandy Edwards .
The NDP in Victoria accused the Liberals of intimidating their political opponents .
" Who in this government authorized these investigations and harassment of ordinary citizens ? " asked NDP MLA Leonard Krog .
" As you can understand , the RCMP have a very important function , " replied Solicitor General Kash Heed .
" Can you imagine if they did n't check out the information they get ?
They have the duty to prevent anything from happening . "
Surm said she was n't politically involved before the RCMP confronted her .
She says that has now changed .
" What are they driving at ?
What are they trying to find ?
What are they going to do until they satisfy that craving to prove that something untoward is going on ? "

Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening .
We 'll have another update for you on Thursday morning .

Last Wednesday night , during a BBC2 drama about sixteenth - century witch - hunts , BBC airwaves played host for the very first time to what I believe the more delicate members of society refer to as ' the c-word ' .
When I read Tuesday 's papers and learned what was due for broadcast the following night , I was deeply shocked .
Horrified , in fact .
I could barely believe what I was reading .
Nobody had ever said ' cunt ' on the BBC before ?
Incredible !
I assumed they 'd been saying it for years .
It was like reading the reports of Eugène Ionesco 's death in 1994 - all you could think was : ' Ionesco was still alive ?'
We have settled into a rather strange relationship with swearing .
We expect to hear it on TV after nine o'clock at night , but phone to complain if we hear it in the daytime .
We do n't mind it in gritty dramas about domestic abuse , but we find it gratuitous in comedy .
Away from television , we 'll happily say ' fuck ' in a pub but not in church .
We turn all matey and familiar if a builder swears , but would be horrified to hear the same language from a policeman .
Even a student friend of mine who insists : ' Swearing is never inappropriate ! ' adds thoughtfully , ' except perhaps during the marriage vows . '
It does n't add up .
Surely these words are either rude or they 're not ?
We 've either moved on or we have n't .
In 1914 , when Mrs Patrick Campbell shouted : ' Not bloody likely ! ' on stage in Pygmalion , the tabloids announced their outrage at 'a word which the Daily Sketch cannot possibly print , and is certainly not used in decent society ' .
We smile at that preposterous innocence now , but nodded sagely over the tabloids of 2002 when they raged about Ali G saying ' motherfucker ' on Radio 1 .
The certain knowledge that 90 years from now our own great - grandchildren will be saying : ' How sweet , they actually used to think that " motherfucker " was rude ! ' seemed to make no difference at all .
Some people believe that it's all about when kiddies might be listening .
Ali G was condemned because he used that word on breakfast radio ' during the school run ' .
And how precisely do people imagine conversation in the school playground ?
' Good morning Cyril ; I eagerly anticipate our football game this afternoon and I trust you feel the same ' ?
I suspect the kids are already pretty familiar with swearing .
In fact , they 're far more comfortable with it than adults are .
Similarly , Caprice ( the model ) declaimed the word ' cunt ' merrily every night on stage in The Vagina Monologues but got into terrible hot water when she used the same word on ITV1's This Morning .
Pre -watershed , you see .
But do n't tell me the kids would be offended to hear slang on This Morning - they'd have greater objections to the gardening segment .
Small ears are a red herring ( if that 's not too peculiar an image ) because grown - ups have all sorts of separate rules about when they themselves can tolerate sailor talk .
A survey issued in 2000 by the BBC , ASA , BSC and ITC found that three - quarters of responding viewers had no problem with expletives uttered ' in shock ' , but did n't like them used as a matter of routine .
So : fine when you stub your toe , but not good when you ask someone to ' pass the fucking salt ' .
Of course , we can all sympathise with a loud toe - stubbing curse .
The word ' cunt ' , often mistakenly called ' good old Anglo - Saxon language ' , is in fact related to Old Norse - you can quite understand why those poor ancient Scandinavians ( stuck in pitch darkness for six months of the year ) would come up with a fair few swear words .
If nothing else , they must have been constantly banging their knees on things .
Nevertheless , if I had taken part in that survey I would have argued the precise opposite .
Casual , ' routine ' expletives do n't bother me , but I do n't like angry or violent swearing because I do n't like anger or violence .
There 's no point having rules about language , because location , audience and hour of day are utterly irrelevant - the key thing is the sentiment expressed .
And you can express foul sentiment in any words at all .
During the Oz trial in 1971 , George Melly told the court that ' liberated ' people swear happily all the time .
The horrified prosecutor asked : ' Would you call your 10 - year - old daughter a little cunt ? '
And Melly gave what is surely the only right answer : ' No , because I do n't think she is . '
Speaking of answers , they say a politician can never give a straight one .
Just in case , I tuned in to hear Iain Duncan Smith discussing immigration on Radio 2 last Tuesday .
During the opening chat , Jeremy Vine asked the Opposition leader if he liked the music of Fatboy Slim .
' Well ... he 's OK , ' said Duncan Smith .
' It 's yes and no really . '
I decided not to stick around for the asylum discussion .
Obama ’s claim that vaccines will be voluntary deceptive and misleading as thousands of professionals face losing their jobs
Paul Joseph Watson

Tuesday , September 22 , 2009
A daycare worker employed by Northeast Health in Albany New York was shocked to be told by her boss that she would be fired if she refused to take a seasonal swine flu shot on the spot .
Similar stories have been pouring in to us from all over the country as fears that the upcoming H1N1 shot will also be mandatory continue to grow .
The case emphasizes why President Obama ’s claim that the swine flu shot will be voluntary is completely deceptive and misleading .
Americans across the country , even those not directly connected with health care work , are being ordered to take the mandated seasonal and swine flu shots or lose their jobs .
The story of what happened to the daycare worker , who would like to go by the pseudonym “ Clare , ” was sent to us by her sister who also provided Clare ’s real name and the full name of the facility she is employed with .
Clare works in a daycare center which is affiliated with the local hospital but in a completely separate building .
It was reported earlier this month that all hospital workers in the entire region would be forced to take the seasonal flu shot or lose their jobs and that the vaccine would become a condition of employment .
“ On the Tuesday morning following the Labor Day weekend ( Sept 8th ) , the director of the daycare of Northeast Health announced to employees on the spot ( without a meeting , memo or discussion ) that everyone had to go get a flu shot immediately and staff would be rotated so that everyone would be inoculated by the end of the day , ” writes Clare ’s sister .
“ Clare said “ I do n’t get flu shots ” and was told “ well then you ’ll be fired . ”
The director told Clare that the H1N1 shot would also be mandated in the same way when it becomes available .
When Clare warned the director that the swine flu shot contained mercury , squalene and other dangerous additives , the director told her that regardless of her objections , if she refused to be vaccinated she would be suspended from November 13th and then formally fired on November 30th .
“ Clare asked how she can be fired for something that was not a condition of her employment when she was hired ?
She was told it was not Northeast Health ’s policy , it was the director of the New York State Department of Health who made the shot mandatory , ” writes her sister .
However , according to the NYSDOH decree for mandatory vaccinations , exemptions exist for “ personnel who have a medical contraindication and for workers , such as those offsite , who would have no contact with patients and only incidental contact with direct - care staff . ”
Clare clearly falls into this category as she works in a separate building from the hospital and has no direct regular contact with hospital workers .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Clare demanded answers to the following questions , none of which have been addressed by the daycare director .
1 . The regular seasonal flu has n’t even hit so how will this first mandated shot provide any immunity when it is clearly the vaccine from last year ?
2 . When the H1N1 is mandated – as I believe it will be – and if I did get the shot to save my job and should I have one of the adverse reactions that the CDC has predicted , will I be covered under Workers Comp since the action that caused the injury was job related ?
( The cost of which will fall on the employer NOT the State of New York . )
3 . Should I refuse the shot will I be eligible for Unemployment Compensation since I did nothing to warrant being terminated ?
4 . Malpractice insurance providers in Australia are refusing to extend coverage to their clients who give the shot ; will this be the case in New York ?
5 . Are insurance companies going to cover subscribers who fall ill as a result of the H1N1 inoculations that were mandated by the NYS Department of Health ?
After concerned parents started to ask Clare why she was leaving , it some became apparent that the director had immediately produced a letter and circulated it around the daycare , claiming that Clare was leaving for “ personal reasons , ” without mentioning the real reason , that she refused to take the vaccine .
Clare took the letter to the head of human resources but was told that , “ the New York State Labor Department would probably be instructed to side with the Department of Health and determine that you were fired for not following an order from your employer and not approve Unemployment Compensation .
The meeting ended with him stating that it was the NYS Department of Health ’s call and not Northeast Health and there was no way around it . ”
“ Not only have my sister ’s rights as an employee been violated but her employer ’s justification for terminating her is based on a falsehood on top of which she may be prevented from receiving Unemployment Insurance for this wrongful termination , ” writes Clare ’s sister .
As an addendum , Clare ’s sister informs us that one of the daycare teachers who did take the seasonal flu shot on September 8th suffered a reaction less than a week later .
Clare ’s sister takes up the story ;
“ It began with symptoms similar to Pink Eye on her left side and then her eye swelled ; the swelling then spread further down her check and then into her neck where a mass formed .
This 30 year old mother of three has been unable to work since the symptoms in her eye surfaced , around the 14th .
My sister Clare asked school officials if her ill coworker would be covered by Workers Comp and was told they believe she would be .
The co-worker has been on antibiotics that do n’t seem to be working .
Her doctor told her if the RX does n’t clear it up the “ infection ( ? ) ” soon they ’ll have to take more drastic action .
My sister was told by her ill co worker : “ Clare you were right to say no to the shot , the job is n’t worth it , I should never have gotten the shot . ”
Clare is now facing unemployment as a result of refusing to take the seasonal flu vaccine , not to mention the H1N1 shot .
Thousands of other health workers are now in a similar position whereby they will be forced to take the dangerous swine flu shot or be fired over the course of the next few weeks .
Polls indicate that at least a third of nurses and health workers will refuse to take the vaccine and another third are still unsure .
If even as little as a quarter of health care professionals stand up in unison and refuse to be intimidated into taking the shot , authorities will probably have to back off and make the shot voluntary .
However , Clare ’s deeper concern is that another primary target of the first round of swine flu vaccinations , young children , will be even more vulnerable to having the shot forced upon them with no warning or notice whatsoever .
“ My sister has three children in public school and is extremely concerned that the head of the New York State Department of Health , Dr. Richard Daines , will next decree the shots are mandatory for all school children , ” writes Clare ’s sister .
“ She is prepared to home school them but is scared to death that in the mean time an UNANNOUNCED flu shot clinic will be sprung on school districts some morning to get around parental objections to having their children vaccinated .
She has told her children in no uncertain terms are they to accept the shot (s ) but realizes the Hobson ’s choice they too may soon face and that they are so much less prepared than she to fight this unconstitutional authority . ”

Comment on this article
Malcolm Gladwell is one of the few journalists who can claim to have had a phrase coined in his honour .
He has spawned a new way of looking at the world – or at least at book publishing .
I ask him what he thinks of the term " Gladwellian " when we meet in lower Manhattan .
Is he proud of the flattery , or embarrassed by it ?
" I do n't think it 's true , " he replies firmly .
" I do n't think there 's such a thing .
I do n't think what I do is worthy of its own name . "
He might say that , but in the boardrooms of publishing houses in New York and London , editors regularly deploy the phrase .
As in ( spoken with faint hysteria in voice ) : " Will someone please tell me where our next Gladwellian book is coming from ? "
He continues to protest : " I 've never thought I was doing anything unusual ; it 's just intellectual non-fiction , and that 's been around as long as non-fiction . "
We are drinking coffee at Morandi , a homely trattoria in Waverly Place .
When we were exchanging emails about our rendezvous , Gladwell told me that he does much of his writing in this restaurant , adding in explanation : " I am a public writer . "
That seems a peculiar phrase , but when I quiz him about it , he says he only meant that he writes in public places .
He rides around on a bicycle with his laptop , setting up office in cafes and restaurants around lower Manhattan and Brooklyn .
That too puzzles me , because his friends say he is a deeply private person , verging on the introverted .
So why hang out in public like that ?
" It 's not because I 'm engaged in conversation with people , " he explains .
" It 's because I spent 10 years in a newsroom and I can no longer write when it 's quiet .
I like people around me ; but I do n't want to talk to them . "
Germaine Greer recently derided the current vogue for Big Ideas titles that Gladwell , above all , has inspired , as the bookish version of male display .
But that gives the wrong impression of him .
In the flesh he cuts a very different figure : more metrosexual than macho .
His most famous physical characteristic is his hair – a result of his mixed - race background , as his mother is Jamaican - born .
Before we meet I had imagined encountering the spitting image of Art Garfunkel , whose likeness Gladwell has himself recognised – at a speaking engagement with the shorter , stockier New York Times columnist Tom Friedman , Gladwell introduced them both to the audience as Simon and Garfunkel .
In fact , the comparison that hits you when you come face - to - face with Gladwell is with a young Bob Dylan .
He tells me he has just had his annual haircut and so has lost that Garfunkelesque blooming afro .
He also dresses in the Dylan style – blue jeans , black trainers , several layers of vests and T - shirts .
As if he has n't made fellow writers jealous enough already with three bestselling books that have turned him into a brand , Gladwell is now bringing out a fourth , though this one is more modest than the preceding trilogy : it is a collection of his New Yorker essays , selected by himself from his 13 years on the magazine .
Tina Brown , who now edits the current affairs website The Daily Beast , brought him on board at the start of 1996 as one of her happening young things .
She recalls that , " We were on a talent - spotting spree and it was clear that Malcolm Gladwell was very bright . "
What she did n't know then was that he would turn out to be , as she puts it , " a natural editor of the culture , a force of nature in the way he propels his work into the conversation " .
Gladwell 's breakthrough idea came almost immediately .
He wanted to find out why crime in New York City , his adoptive home , had plummeted since 1990 .
He began digging , and was surprised by what he found .
There was no dramatic cause for the steep decline , no draconian police roundup or seismic demographic shift .
Rather , a sequence of seemingly trivial acts – removing grafitti from subway cars , apprehending fare dodgers , mending broken windows on housing estates – had combined to contain and then eradicate the city 's crime wave .
Brown , who had plucked Gladwell from relative obscurity on the Washington Post , was pleased with the piece and displayed it prominently on her magazine 's cover .
She took the expression he used in the article for the headline : it was The Tipping Point .
But Gladwell felt there was more juice to be squeezed from the theory that human behaviour is often like an epidemic , starting small then growing until it reaches a critical mass and tips into a phenomenon .
It could be applied as equally to the spread of products , messages and fads as to murder rates ; to the selling of Hush Puppies as much as to fare - dodging on the Manhattan subway .
Put like that , this was a Big Idea that could unlock the secrets of how modern change happens the way it does .
The publisher Little , Brown was impressed , and reputedly backed him with an advance of $ 1.5 m .
Its faith was richly rewarded .
The book version of The Tipping Point came out in 2000 and has sold more than 2 m copies .
Blink , a romp through the power of instinctual thinking , followed in 2005 with equally astonishing results .
Then Outliers , last year 's exploration of the social factors behind individual success , earned him another seven - figure advance .
The essays in his new book , What the Dog Saw and Other Adventures , bear many of the classic Gladwellian hallmarks .
They are simply and directly told , with the aid of a dizzying array of illustrations to support his argument .
He moves effortlessly from individual stories to learned academic treatises to sociological observation and back to the individual .
The writing is vibrant , colourful and packed with surprises .
Writing about the plane crash that killed John Kennedy Jr , Gladwell commissions a pilot to take him on a simulated nosedive of the sort Kennedy must have fallen into , known as a graveyard spiral .
He profiles a so - called dog whisperer who tames violent dogs – hence the book 's title .
In another piece – Gladwell 's favourite , he says – he spends time with Ron Popeil , a manufacturer of kitchen appliances , giving the reader a wonderful insight into the mindset of a minor genius from New Jersey .
The small - scale nature of Popeil 's genius is an important clue as to why Gladwell has gone on to such gargantuan success .
He scrupulously sets his sights not on the rare or unfamiliar , but on the ordinary and mainstream .
As such , his writing talks to all of us , by dint of the common questions he seeks to ask , such as how can you tell if someone is going to be good at their job , or why is there no alternative to Heinz Tomato Ketchup ?
" I 'm interested in slightly dumb , obvious questions , right , " he says .
" I 'm not interested in really deeply weird , obscure things .
My tastes are not idiosyncratic .
What I 'm interested in turns out by happy circumstance to be what lots of people are interested in . "
To make his point , he deploys a very Gladwellian trick : he shoots off on an anecdote .
" I 'm a car lover , but a paradoxical one because I do n't love expensive cars .
I drive a Golf .
And the reason I love the Golf is that it is the most interesting solution to a problem – how to make a great car to sell for $ 23,000 .
Now that 's hard ; that 's really interesting .
The Ferrari is beautiful but so what , you charge $ 250,000 for it , what 's hard about that ?
The Golf GTi is a really amazing car for $ 23,000 .
That notion of battling constraints , of the degree of difficulty , is what impresses me . "
This fixation on the middling has earned Gladwell brickbats that he specialises in the art of the obvious .
They do n't bother him at all .
" I do n't mind the criticism that I explore the obvious , because that says I 'm still trafficking in those familiar common questions , which is where I want to be . "
Where did that interest in middle - of - the - road values , assumptions and products come from ?
He launches into a discussion of his half - English roots .
" We 're not exotic , the Gladwells .
We do n't have exotic tastes .
My father is from Kent .
He 's from a middle - class family from Kent – this is who we are . "
He giggles , in a way that is part pride , part mischievous self - deprecation .
So is there a part of him that is forever Kent ?
" I suppose there is .
My father grew up in Sevenoaks .
I once told that to a Londoner , who burst into gales of laughter .
I did n't realise Sevenoaks was symbolic of a certain solid middle class . "
Yes , accountants , I say .
" My grandfather was in insurance , so there you are .
And the town I grew up in in Canada was a little farming town , so I 'm not constitutionally focused on the exotic . "
Indeed , Gladwell is an English Canadian New Yorker with Caribbean roots who rarely writes about race – although he did bring his great - great - great - grandmother , who had a child by her white slave master , into Outliers .
That book also points out that former US secretary of state , Colin Powell , is a distant relative .
Otherwise , though , he has never made much of his blackness , having never felt it to be a description of himself to which he can relate .
" I do n't know what I am .
I 'm part West Indian : what does that mean ?
I had my DNA tested and I am 23 % black , or whatever the term is – that 's a meaningless thing .
I guess I 'm a quadroon , or whatever it is . "
There is , though , one label he attaches to himself with certainty : outsider .
Gladwell feels himself to be mainly Canadian , which in America is to be an outsider – as he has frequently been reminded in recent weeks by the US healthcare debate .
" You feel so non-American when you see these crazy people who have no clue about what it means to have universal healthcare .
Never before have I been so reminded of my outsiderness than during this debate . "
His father is a mathematician , and from him , he says , he acquired a tremendous respect for academics .
" I realised when I was older that there 's a persistent attitude in people that academia is farcical .
I 've never had that .
I 've had exactly the opposite .
My assumption has been that there 's value in almost all of it , if you take the time to read it properly .
And that comes from being in a family in which you were taught to revere expertise . "
Such reverence is another Gladwellian hallmark .
He is constantly turning to experts of various shades to elucidate a problem .
He likes to think of himself as a " translator " of learned thinking for the mass reader .
At best , that enriches his writing with intriguing detail drawn from sociology , psychology , anthropology and a host of other ologies , which he uses to challenge received wisdom and open up new debates .
In particular , he turns to science to support the argument that underpins so much of his writing – the idea that no man is an island .
We are all subject to social forces that impact on our behaviour ( as in The Tipping Point ) , governed by our subconscious thoughts ( Blink ) and blown around like leaves by the vicissitudes of timing and social privilege ( Outliers ) .
This may be an unrevolutionary thought in the UK , where Margaret Thatcher long ago failed to convince us there was no such thing as society .
But in the US , where the American dream and individualism still reign supreme , it remains a central intellectual battleground .
At worst , though , Gladwell is at times guilty of taking deep intellectual work and making it shallow , like spreading Marmite so thinly it loses its bite .
One reviewer of Outliers slated it as an intellectual striptease .
Again , Gladwell professes to be unfazed by the criticism .
" There 's a constant issue of tone : who do you want to read these pieces , and how do you want them to be read ?
I can write them in a way that is deeply satisfying to a professor of philosophy at Princeton , but we all know if I do that I 'll lose everybody else , and I can do it at the other end of the spectrum for a 10 - year - old .
You have to pick where you want to be , which for me is somewhere around the middle .
Maybe a little to one side of the middle . "
Which side ?
He looks slightly taken aback by the question .
" I like to think I 'm on the high side of the middle .
Upper-middlebrow .
That 's what I am .
Upper-middlebrow . "

Gladwell 's day
8.30 am I lead an astonishingly boring life .
I always wake up at 8.30 , unless I 've set the alarm for 8.30 , in which case I wake up at 6.30 .
Why is that ?
I 'm not one for breakfast ; just a cup of tea maybe at one of the cafes down the street from my apartment , where I sit and try to figure out what 's wrong with whatever it is I 'm writing .
I always have one thing I 'm writing that 's working , and two that are n't .
10 am - 1 pm Brood for a while .
Write a little .
Then ride my bicycle to New York University Library and nose around the stacks .
1.30 pm Have a panini at an Italian place near the library , and read the New York Times .
Then I answer emails , maybe read something that just came in from Amazon .
5 pm Go for a run along the river .
Then if there 's football on , I 'll watch that .
11 pm - midnight If Lee Child has a new book out , I read – but really slowly , so I can make it last .
Sleep .
Repeat .

Covid 19 Downgraded By Gov Due to Low Mortality , Despite This They Lock Us Down In Our Houses 4 Days Later
https://www.gov.uk/guidance/high-consequence-infectious-diseases-hcid?fbclid=IwAR3vN34_ewOX8okRx7x1oITl3XlPxe3EiRTGAW2G3SSgJKPmuRLVDwiCN6M
According to the government website ( accessed 24/03/20 ) : ‘
As of 19 March 2020 , COVID - 19 is no longer considered to be a high consequence infectious diseases ( HCID ) in the UK .
The 4 nations public health HCID group made an interim recommendation in January 2020 to classify COVID - 19 as an HCID .
This was based on consideration of the UK HCID criteria about the virus and the disease with information available during the early stages of the outbreak .
Now that more is known about COVID - 19 , the public health bodies in the UK have reviewed the most up to date information about COVID - 19 against the UK HCID criteria .
They have determined that several features have now changed ; in particular , more information is available about mortality rates ( low overall ) , and there is now greater clinical awareness and a specific and sensitive laboratory test , the availability of which continues to increase .
The Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens ( ACDP ) is also of the opinion that COVID - 19 should no longer be classified as an HCID .
The need to have a national , coordinated response remains , but this is being met by the government ’s COVID - 19 response .
Cases of COVID - 19 are no longer managed by HCID treatment centres only .
All healthcare workers managing possible and confirmed cases should follow the updated national infection and prevention ( IPC ) guidance for COVID - 19 , which supersedes all previous IPC guidance for COVID - 19 .
This guidance includes instructions about different personal protective equipment ( PPE ) ensembles that are appropriate for different clinical scenarios . ’
If the disease was downgraded on the 19th of March , WHY has the government put the whole of the UK population on lockdown in their houses ?
People ’s civil liberties have been removed without good reason or justifiable explanation .
VAN UK is concerned that this is merely an exercise in how to remove human rights from the public .
News about how this group will move forward
The charity commission has made it a requirement that charities must have at least £ 5,000 a year in donations .
V.A.N never made that much in donations .
Neither did we want to sell things as our main priority is providing vaccine information to parents .
We did not want finances to prevent parents from accessing information that they needed , so fund raising was only ever done in a small way to cover costs of the website , postal costs and occasional leaflet printing .
Due to this , we will no longer be a registered charity .
However , we were considering making this move anyway since registered charities cannot be political .
In light of the current sustained hate speech against what the press refer to as ‘ anti-vaxxers ’ and calls to mandate vaccines and ban healthy children from schools , we feel that it is time V.A.N became more political in the upcoming fight to maintain parental rights and informed patient consent in medical decisions .
We will be looking to actively oppose potential mandates in the UK as well as mandates in other European countries and we hope to raise money for legal costs or potential fines incurred by parents who opt out of the vaccine programme as well as those who would like to selectively choose which vaccines their children have .
In the coming weeks we will be moving this group in a new direction and will post updates of this process .
Thank you to all our past and present supporters .
What We Do
V.A.N provides information about vaccinations that is fully sourced to enable parents to make a fully informed choice about their child ’s vaccinations .
What you 're seeing is a WebGL port of Auld 's amazing 1 K demo , Chocolux from to WebGL .
Chocolux is a real - time recursive GPU raytracer using four spheres .
There are only 2 triangles on screen ; all of the ray tracing happens in the fragment shader !
I adapted Auld 's code to run in the OpenGL ES 2.0 subset that WebGL supports .
Some webby parts are also from Dag Ågren .
To see this demo , you 'll need 1 ) a PS 3.0 video card and 2 ) the latest WebKit , Chromium or Firefox nightly with WebGL enabled .
My MacBook can sustain about 60 fps in " Large " mode .
Firefox nightlies seem to have a bug in resizing the canvas .
If you do n't have the right video hardware , here 's Auld 's video of Chocolux in action .
Chocolux 's ray tracer does a few things for distortion ( reuse of a loop variable in an inner loop ) to achieve the stylized effect and the small footprint .
The implications of this are pretty mind blowing .
WebGL now allows compiled code to run on the GPU .
Imagine what games , image processing , and applications will be possible with compiled shaders and general GPU computing ( OpenCL ? ) now in the browser .
And with WebGL gaining widespread adoption , it 's going to be here fairly soon .

BioWare has " no regrets " over it 's much - loved Baldur 's Gate games , but admits it's " frustrating " not to be able to continue to develop the characters it created for the RPG series .
Baldur 's Gate , released in 1998 for the PC and published by Interplay , was a high fantasy role - playing game based on the Dungeons & Dragons rule set .
Its success spawned a sequel and a spin - off series .
The final game , 2001 's expansion pack Throne of Bhaal , closed the story arc .
In August 2008 , Interplay and Atari settled a long - standing dispute , giving Atari all of Interplay 's previous D&D game rights , including the Baldur 's Gate license .
Speaking to VideoGamer.com , vice president of entertainment and miscellaneous at BioWare , and vice president of Electronic Arts , Greg Zeschuk , said that the development of the upcoming Dragon Age : Origins , described by the company as " the spiritual successor to Baldur 's Gate " ( head over to our game page for more ) , was in part due to BioWare 's inability to create Baldur 's Gate 3 .
" The Baldur 's Gate and Dungeons and Dragons property is of course controlled by Atari , and owned originally by Hasbro , so it 's a complicated , convoluted way of getting there .
For us it 's more a function of ... because we were n't in a position to do Baldur 's Gate ... hey well let 's create our own !
That 's effectively what this [ Dragon Age : Origins ] is .
It 's funny , we took a page from Fallout , not Fallout 3 but Fallout 1 .
Fallout 1 was basically a game called Wasteland - that was the spiritual successor to Wasteland . "
When asked if BioWare would have liked to have made Baldur 's 3 if it had had the opportunity , Zeschuk replied : " Maybe .
The things we miss more than anything else are some of the characters we created .
It 's frustrating - like Minsc and some of the other characters we built over the years - not being able to continue to stem that is a bit frustrating .
Though , to be fair , we feel like we closed the series .
" There are a lot of video games that - like the original Wasteland - never had a sequel , but there are a lot of games that never actually end .
Whatever happens , they 're left hanging and fans are like , ah I wish I 'd finished it .
But because we were able to finish the sequence of games in Baldur 's Gate : Throne of Bhaal ... it 's funny , we were satisfied that we were able to deliver that entire arc .
Go ' there it is and that 's the story of Baldur 's Gate ' .
We feel like we finished our work at that time . "
So no regrets then ?
" No , we do n't have regrets . "
In December last year then Infogrames president Phil Harrison said that Atari plans to revisit the likes of Baldur 's Gate , Dungeons & Dragons and Neverwinter Nights ( originally a BioWare game ) , but not in the next 12 months .
No mention has since been made of those games .
Would you like to see Baldur 's Gate 3 ?

A leading human rights group has suspended its senior military analyst following revelations that he is an avid collector of Nazi memorabilia .
The group , Human Rights Watch , had initially thrown its full support behind the analyst , Marc Garlasco , when the news of his hobby came out last week .
On Monday night , the group shifted course and suspended him with pay , “ pending an investigation , ” said Carroll Bogert , the group ’s associate director .
“ We have questions about whether we have learned everything we need to know , ” she said .
The suspension comes at a time of heightened tension between , on one side , the new Israeli government and its allies on the right , and the other side , human rights organizations that have been critical of Israel .
In recent months , the government has pledged an aggressive approach toward the groups to discredit what they argue is bias and error .
Injected suddenly into that heated conflict , word of Mr. Garlasco ’s interest seemed startling to many .
The disclosure ricocheted across the Internet : Mr. Garlasco , an American , was not only a collector , he has written a book , more than 400 pages long , about Nazi-era medals .
His hobby , inspired he said by a German grandfather conscripted into Hitler ’s army , was revealed on a pro-Israel blog , Mere Rhetoric , which quoted his enthusiastic postings on collector sites under the pseudonym “ Flak88 ”  including , “ That is so cool !
The leather SS jacket makes my blood go cold it is so COOL ! ”
How the One Million Signatures campaign , winner of this year 's Raw in War Anna Politkovskaya award , aims to change Iranian society guardian.co.uk
Iran today is a country where women are more educated than their male compatriots ; more than 60 % of university students are female , as are many university professors .
Iranian women obtained the right to vote and become members of parliament half a century ago – earlier than women in Switzerland , who achieved this right in 1971 .
Since that time at least a small number have been present in Iran 's parliament .
Even the present parliament , which is monopolised by hardliners , has 13 women members .
In governments , women have often held senior positions .
Even the health minister in Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's cabinet is a woman .
All this is proof that women have managed to rise within the ranks of the fundamentalists .
And yet despite the cultural , social and historical heritage of Iranian women , the Islamic Republic has imposed discriminatory regulations against them .
A man may marry up to four wives and divorce them whenever he desires .
But mere will is not enough for a woman to divorce her husband .
Similarly , according to Iranian law , the life of women is worth half of the man 's life in terms of blood money .
When drawing up compensation after an accident , women receive half the amount allocated to men .
During a trial , a declaration by a man is worth twice that of a woman .
Women also require their husband 's permission to work , travel or leave the country .
These laws run counter to the role of women within Iranian society .
Should the health minister wish to attend a meeting of the World Health Organisation , she must receive her husband 's assent .
It remains unclear what would happen if her husband refused – Iran 's seat at the WHO might remain vacant .
The laws imposed on Iranian women are incompatible with their status and , consequently , the equality movement is very strong .
Although lacking a leader , headquarters , or branches , the movement is located in the home of any Iranian who believes in equal rights for men and women .
Iranian women have chosen different ways to demonstrate their objection to this discrimination .
One of the most important is the One Million Signatures Campaign , aimed at collecting signatures from Iranian men and women to demonstrate their opposition to the discriminatory laws .
It is committed to dialogue and co-operation as a means to increase and improve knowledge of discriminatory legislation .
This campaign is a peaceful protest which , unfortunately , the Iranian government has refused to tolerate .
More than 50 campaigners have been prosecuted and some deprived of basic social rights , such as being able to travel freely or leave the country .
The most severe sentence has been handed down to Aliyeh Eghdam Doust , who is serving a three - year prison term .
She is one of the activists arrested in the June 2006 protest in support of women 's rights in Haft - e - Tir Square in Tehran .
These convictions , however , have not dampened the women 's determination in their struggle for equality .
Following the June presidential elections , women of all ages took part in demonstrations against the official results .
Armed forces shot dead a young woman , Neda Soltan .
She has now become a symbol of the Iranian demand for democracy .
Women are at the forefront of this struggle , well aware that they will obtain equality only within a truly democratic political order .
Shirin Ebadi is one of the founders of the One Million Signatures Campaign for Equality in Iran , which last night received the 2009 Reach All Women in War Anna Politkovskaya Award .
The US Department of Energy , which runs the largest supercomputing centers in the country , is using some of the Obama stimulus money to take a gander on how parallel HPC applications might be deployed on cloud - style , virtualized infrastructure instead of on the less malleable parallel supers that the DOE 's labs spend big bucks building , housing , and operating .
The project , which is known by the code - name Magellan , is being funded with a $ 32 m splash that comes from the $ 787bn trough of cash that is the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 , signed into law by President Obama back in February .
ARRA is being used to prop lots of IT - related scientific research around the country , notably a $ 62 m project being funded by DOE to create 100 Gigabit Ethernet switching gear that was announced in August ; this project is being headed up by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , which runs the network linking the big DOE labs .
( Sandia , Lawrence Livermore , Lawrence Berkeley , Oak Ridge , Los Alamos , Brookhaven , Argonne , Pacific Northwest , and Ames are the key DOE labs . )
The Magellan project is exploring how cloud tools for virtualizing and provisioning servers might be used by researchers wanting to run their applications on a cloud that is actually a subset of the capacity available through the DOE labs .
The idea is that it may be more cost - effective to give people pieces of the DOE supercomputer centers that look and feel like a local HPC cluster than actually have them plunk down $ 50,000 to buy a baby cluster .
The problem is not the initial hardware and software support , according to Katherine Yelick , director of the National Energy Research Scientific Computing ( NERSC ) division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , which is one of the leaders on the Magellan project .
" You can buy a small computer cluster for $ 50,000 , but the cost of ownership often exceeds the cost of hardware when you factor in floor space , power demands , and staff support . "
This is not the kind of talk that Cray , Silicon Graphics , Penguin Computing , and others who are peddling baby HPC clusters want to hear .
At first , the Lawrence Berkeley and Argonne National Laboratory centers are going to carve out around 100 teraflops of computing capacity and set it up as a cloud , allowing university and DOE researchers to schedule jobs on the cloud .
And the servers will be backed up with lots of storage and I/ O capacity so large datasets can be thrown against this relatively modest amount of computing capacity .
This , says Yelick , is where in - house baby HPC clusters often fall short , frustrating researchers who bought gear believing they would get better performance than they see when they actually run their workloads .
The exact software technologies that the Magellan project will deploy have not been finalized yet , and it is not clear if and how the underlying servers and storage will be virtualized .
Ironically , most of the $ 32 m will be spent on build new clusters based on Intel 's Xeon 5500s for the cloud testbeds being installed at Lawrence Berkeley and Argonne .
The latter lab will be monkeying around with the open source Eucalyptus framework for creating a clone of Amazon 's EC2 compute cloud , and apparently the project also has some money left over to do comparisons of the Magellan internal cloud with various cloud services from Amazon , Microsoft , and Google .
Some 3,000 researchers at Lawrence Berkeley are going to be given access to the Magellan cloud to kick the tires over the next several years , to see which of their codes work well on the cloud and which do not .
Incidentally , the two cloud setups at Lawrence Berkeley and Argonne will be linked using that 100 GE network also being funded by ARRA . ®
Michael Steele is either delusional or a liar :
INSKEEP : Do you find it challenging to get into this complicated debate and explain things to people in a way that it ’s honest to the facts and still very clear –
STEELE : That ’s a good point .
INSKEEP : — and does n’t just kind of scare people with soundbites ?
STEELE : Well , no .
Look .
No one ’s trying to scare people with soundbites .
I have not done that , and I do n’t know any leaders in the House and the Senate that have done that .
So yeah , it ’s complicated and you want to do that .
Bananas down to 38 p per kilo in Asda , 35 p per kilo in Tesco this week .
A supermarket price war over a fruit with as much comic potential as the banana ought to be funny .
Asda has said that it will take the cost of slashing the retail price from its own margins and not pass the pain on down the supply chain , so surely consumers can only benefit as the big four rivals slug it out for market share .
Except , of course , we know that 's not how the script usually runs when UK supermarkets start price wars .
If anyone thinks supermarkets are in the business of simply handing cash back to customers , they are being naive .
I 've been analysing data on price rises in Asda on some of the biggest - selling brands between 8 July this year and last week – when the banana wars got heavy .
There 's been a 72 % increase in PG
Tips tea , a 45 % rise on some Colgate top - selling toothpastes , a more than 100 % increase on some Pringles crisps , 38 % on Rich Tea biscuits , and 85 % on single cream .
These are steep rises , not on goods that were previously on promotion , but on the usual price .
That looks to me remarkably like a supermarket increasing its margin to build a war chest of cash .
Can I be sure ?
No .
Like most shoppers , I find it impossible to keep track of supermarket pricing because it is so variable and opaque .
Even the competition authorities have admitted they do not have the resources to monitor what the big picture is .
But it 's a fair bet that what supermarkets give back to us with one hand , they are taking , or have already taken , with the other .
In the short term , cutting the price of bananas and selling them below the cost of production is a game for them , a paper exercise in shifting profits around , designed to grab publicity , pull shoppers in to spend on other highly profitable goods , and squeeze their competitors .
But in the medium and long term , it 's no game for the rest of the banana industry .
A phony supermarket price war is a real war for them – one in which they tend to suffer the collateral damage .
We know from the bitter history of such price wars that the costs have been passed down the chain , if not immediately , then over the subsequent months .
Asda / Wal - Mart was able to fund its early banana war in 2002 on the back of a global deal with Del Monte , which gave the transnational retailer an extraordinarily low price .
Fair trade campaign groups have documented the conditions that were behind that price .
In 1999 , Del Monte sacked all 4,300 of its workers on one of its biggest plantations in Costa Rica , the country that supplies much of UK demand .
They re-employed them on wages reduced by 30 - 50 % , on longer hours , with fewer benefits .
This model was subsequently rolled out across the industrial banana sector .
Aid organisations say that a deterioration in conditions has accompanied each banana war .
That around 50 % of workers on these plantations are now migrants within Latin America is a reflection of how poor pay and conditions became .
For all their protestations that the cuts are not passed on , the fact remains that the world price of bananas has been driven down relentlessly since the 1970s .
On the ground , fair trade campaigners say they still find evidence of poverty wages , excessive hours , poor health and safety standards , intimidation of union members and environmental degradation .
Under pressure from bad publicity about these conditions , the big global banana traders – Del Monte , Chiquita and Dole – were actually pushed into working with aid organisations and local unions to do something about them .
They have seemed concerned to distance themselves from the trade 's banana republic legacy .
All that work , however , may be put at risk by Asda 's gaming .
Most British shoppers do not want to be part of the exploitation that has historically been associated with the fruit .
One third of banana sales are now fair trade , helped by Sainsbury 's and Waitrose making the commitment to buy all their bananas from fair trade sources in 2007 .
But the current race to the bottom will put enormous pressure on them as they subsidise the difference .
The smaller farmers , many of them in the Windward Islands , who produce that fair trade fruit fear the downward pressure on their prices the price war will build .
At some point , Asda will decide that the benefit of this particular loss leader has run its course .
It will move on .
But by then the damage to other people 's livelihoods may have been done .
It 's a zero-sum game , and if you want to know what happens when they play it , you need only look at the fate of British dairy farmers .
Squeezed by the supermarkets over many years , the British dairy sector has been brought to the brink of collapse .
We now cannot even meet demand for fresh milk , but have to import millions of litres each day from mainland Europe .
Did consumers benefit from this assault on sustainable farming and our long - term food security ?
The office of fair trading thought not , finding Asda , among others , guilty two years ago of price - fixing .
So , please , do n't fall for their bananas .

Update
190 Adverse Reactions 1 Suspected DeathYesterday 30 people had been reporting to the authorities in Sweden that they experienced such severe side effects that they felt the need to contact a hospital .
Today the number is 140 .
The Swedish newspaper Expressen is the only one in Sweden reporting on these cases and as usual this is most likely only the tip of a rather large iceberg . : According to Dagens Nyheter , .
1 person dies after the injection but " no direct relation with the injection has been established " .
The biggest medical scandal in the history of Sweden has just started .
Even so , Annika Linde , director of The Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control ( SMI ) manages to spin this into something positive by stating " The vaccine has more side effects than the normal flu vaccine .
It is a sign that proves that it gives an effective protection .
" Thousands of Swedes have been vaccinated so far and the reports of side effects are " flooding in " to The Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control ( SMI ) .
Annika Linde : " It is obviously so that the vaccine against the swine flu results in more side effects than the normal flu vaccines .
That is because the swine flu vaccine contains adjuvants , shark liver oil , which triggers the immune defense to respond .
That also results in that the protection against the virus becomes better .
" Several severe cases of allergic reactions are reported to the unit for medicinal safety .
" So far the reported side effects are not unexpected " , says Gunilla Sjölin Forsberg .
This unit has now asked some of the many units that vaccinate to report side effects to better get a grip on the situation .
This statement alone is shocking since according to normal practice , all side effects should automatically be reported - right ?
A nurse who took the shot on Wednesday last week is still feeling sick .
She got high fever and shivers from the swine flu shot .
" - I was shaking in my whole body .
It was so sever that I could not even hold a glass of water in my hand . " , Lotta Lindström says . "-
I am now thinking about what it is I have been injected with .
I really was affected .
It feels really unpleasant .
" They got sick from the vaccine - Health - Expressen.seMaria
Strindlund is not so sure she made the right choice to take the shot .
She also got a severe fever and shivering reaction . "-
Since I work as a nurse , I decided it was the best thing to do . " , she says .
At first she felt nothing from the vaccination , but a few hours later the side effects kicked in . "- I got a extreme pain in my arm .
I could no longer lift it . "
The came the fever and the shivering . " _ I was lying in bed shivering and was feeling very cold and stood in a hot shower to get warm . "
She says many colleagues who also took the vaccine have had similar reactions .
She has been taking many vaccines in the past without any reactions whatsoever .
Maria , 27 : " Got in terrible pain " - Health - Expressen.seRebecka
Andersson was the first person to get the shot in Sweden .
She became feverish and felt sick to her stomach from the shot .
" - I lost all energy " , she says .
" - I am normally never sick so I understood it must be the vaccine . "
Her class mates was vaccinated at the same time and Rebecka , 32 : " I became lethargic " - Health - Expressen.seLotta
Lindström , a nurse , states that she got the shot a week ago and still is not well . "-
It feels very worrying " , she says . "- I did not sleep anything the night after the shot since the pain in my arm was so severe . "
The day after , at work , the fever came .
She later had headaches .
She still today , a week after the shot feels sick .
Lotta , 49 : " I did n't sleep anything during the night " - Health - Expressen.seAnother .
She was completely healthy when she got the shot but the day after she had 39 degrees centigrade fever ( 102.2 F ) . "- I could hardly walk the five meters I had to the bathroom " , she says .
The fever lasted for three days .
Several of her colleagues at work had similar experiences . "- I know of at least ten that got fever , we are about 80 people at my workplace .

Afghanistan ’s fraud - scarred presidential election drama came to an apparent end Nov. 2 as Azizullah Ludin , chair of the country ’s Independent Election Commission , announced cancellation of the presidential runoff vote slated for Nov. 7 and declared the incumbent , Hamid Karzai , “ the elected president of Afghanistan . ”
A day earlier , former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah , who finished second in the Aug. 20 presidential election , withdrew from the runoff because his demands were not met for measures to cut down on widespread fraud experienced in the earlier vote .
Ballots thrown out in a partial review of that election brought Karzai ’s total to less than 50 percent , triggering plans for the Nov. 7 runoff .
Asserting that the Afghan constitution did not require a runoff , Ludin said the commission wanted to avoid the security risks and high costs of another election .
Both the Obama administration and United Nations Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon congratulated Karzai .
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton called Abdullah ’s withdrawal a “ personal choice ” that would not affect the validity of the outcome .
But foreign affairs commentator Simon Tisdall wrote in the UK Guardian , “ This creative interpretation of the weekend ’s events ignored the fact that it was Hillary Clinton and Richard Holbrooke , the U.S. special Afghanistan - Pakistan representative , who only a few days ago strong - armed Karzai into accepting a second round ” because the Aug. 20 vote was riddled with fraud .
Abdullah , a former eye surgeon , was once a top aide to Afghan mujahedin commander Ahmad Shah Massoud , who led the U.S. - backed fight against Afghanistan ’s People ’s Democratic Party government which had Soviet support in the 1980s .
Abdullah was later associated with the notoriously corrupt Northern Alliance of warlords led by Massoud and Burhanuddin Rabbani , which opposed the Taliban in the late 1990s and was allied with the Bush administration in its October 2001 invasion of Afghanistan .
Speaking to his supporters Nov. 1 , Abdullah urged them not to take to the streets in protest , and referred to his decision as “ not the end of anything , but it is the beginning of something else , ” fueling speculation that he plans a future political role .
Meanwhile , at least 57 U.S. personnel died in Afghanistan last month , making it the deadliest month so far for the U.S. and bringing the overall total to a reported 831 .
In a Nov. 1 posting , commentator Tom Engelhardt noted that insurgent attacks are rising and insurgent groups have made significant gains in eastern provinces .
Attacks involving IEDs ( improvised explosive devices ) are three and a half times greater than in 2007 , he said , while Taliban forces are increasingly able to conduct raids in the capital , Kabul .
As the Obama administration continues its in - depth review of U.S. policy in Afghanistan , including whether to accede to the request of Gen. Stanley McChrystal for tens of thousands more troops , a broad spectrum of antiwar organizations is urging that U.S. military involvement not be escalated , as a first step to the withdrawal of U.S. and NATO forces .
Peace Action , United for Peace and Justice and others are calling for support of HR 3699 by Rep. Barbara Lee , D - Calif. , which would bar funding for more troops , and HR 2404 by Rep. James McGovern , D - Mass. , for a military exit strategy .

Vaccination against swine flu has started in the US and will soon begin in Europe , but many of those who should be first in line are having second thoughts .
Healthcare workers are a top priority for vaccination because they can infect vulnerable people and because their services are vital in a pandemic .
Yet in a survey of UK nurses last week , 47 per cent said they would not get vaccinated .
Meanwhile , British hospital bosses quizzed by The Guardian newspaper claim that as few as 10 per cent of staff will have the shot .
In the US , many hospital employees are protesting against rules saying they must be vaccinated or lose their jobs .
Children are also at the top of the vaccine list .
In the US summer outbreak , the age group most hospitalised was children under 4 .
Yet 40 per cent of US parents say they wo n’t vaccinate their kids , according to a poll by the University of Michigan .
Many parents and health workers argue that swine flu is not dangerous enough to justify the potential side effects of a vaccine , but this week there were fresh warnings that the virus can cause serious illness .
In Canada and Mexico respectively , 17 per cent and 41 per cent of people admitted to intensive care with the virus have died .
In Mexico , half had no underlying health problems ; in Canada 70 per cent had no major illness beforehand .

The former Bush ’s Brain , Karl Rove was on Fox News Sunday today where defended Fox News and compared Obama to Richard Nixon .
He also claimed that the president is demeaning the presidency by keeping an enemies list , and picking out enemies in the media .
Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters :

Terry McAuliffe said that people were annoyed that Fox did n’t cover Obama ’s healthcare address to Congress , this led to Rove to reply , ” Fox News carried the president ’s speech to Congress it was Fox the entertainment channel , so Anita Dunn was not attacking Fox the entertainment channel , they were attacking Fox News , and look there are lots of objectionable things said on MSNBC , and NBC , on cable channels , and CNN for every president for them or against it , and that ought not to be the standard by which a White House determines whether or not it is going to demonize a news channel as an enemy , and they called it an enemy , a White House enemy . ”
He then compared Obama to Nixon , “ That is over the top language .
We heard that before from Richard Nixon , and we have this White House prone to that kind of attitude , and it ’s not helpful .
It is demeaning to the president .
The president of the United States should not be picking out enemies in the media like that , personalizing it , and allowing his people to personalize it as well . ”
Rove later added , “ Let ’s not kid ourselves , this is a White House engaging in its own version of the media enemies list , and it ’s unhelpful for the country , and undignified for the president to do . ”
Oh how soon they forget .
Has Karl already forgotten about the Bush administration ’s very public war with the New York Times and other media outlets ?
Rove constant mention of Obama being undignified and demeaning the presidency is straight out of the playbook he devised to defeat the Democrats in 2000 .
George W. Bush campaigned for his first term on the basis of restoring honor and dignity to the White House after the Clinton / Lewinsky scandal .
Rove was trying to paint Obama with the same broad brush .
All presidents and the media have an adversarial relationship , but it is hypocritical for Rove to be complaining about Obama and FNC when he worked in administration that constantly political motivated revenge .
From the outing of Valarie Plame to firing of the US attorneys , the Bush administration was all about abusing power for the purpose of political payback .
The case of Obama and Fox News is different from the traditional hostility between the White House and the media due to the level of political advocacy that FNC engages in .
Fox News has been openly advocating and promoting Republican events and causes .
Rove is not only ignoring his own past , but also forgetting that it was Fox News that labeled itself the enemy of Obama , and with the tea parties moved from journalism to partisan political activity .

The man who walks with bears

Advertisement Black bears are often considered among the most dangerous animals in North America , depicted down the years as ferocious predators threatening to man .
But , says one man , that perception could not be further from the truth .
For 43 years , Professor Lynn Rogers has studied wild bears , walking and playing with them , gaining amazing insights into their behaviour .
His studies reveal the bears as peaceful , playful creatures , which even hum when they are content .
The new understanding of wild black bear ( Ursus americanus ) behaviour unveiled by Prof Roger 's research is depicted by the BBC natural history programme Natural World : " Bearwalker of the Northwoods " .
For the first half of my life , I struggled to control my fear of bears .
But bears like June have taught me that they are not the ferocious animals we once thought
Professor Lynn Rogers
As part of the programme , the BBC film crew working with Prof Rogers recorded wild black bears mating for the first time .
When the male bear mounts the female , his body shakes in a behaviour that Prof Rogers calls " fluttering " .
Contrary to popular opinion , mating bears are n't particularly dangerous .
In all his years observing the black bears , he has never been threatened by a black bear that is attempting to attract or mate with another .

In fact , he has never been attacked by any bear .
Black bear attacks on humans are incredibly rare , with most happening in the remote parts of Canada and Alaska , says Prof Rogers , who is director of the Wildlife Research Institute and the North American Bear Centre in Ely , Minnesota , US .
" In the eastern US , there have been only three fatalities caused by black bears in the last hundred years , " he says .
When Prof Rogers started his research in the 1960s , they had to tranquilise bears to get close to them .
But now he has worked out how to get the bears ' trust .
A classic depiction of the black bear
One bear , which Prof Rogers has named June , is particularly amenable , allowing him to walk and rest with her in the forest .
" Everyone warns you never to go near a mother bear with cubs , " says Prof Rogers .
Yet he is able to sit alongside June and her cubs as they exit their den and play .
He is also able to do the same with another bear , named Juliet .
Before June hibernates for the winter , the bear allows Prof Rogers to monitor her heart rate on a daily basis .
Each day , prior to her entering her den , June 's heart rate falls .
" It is not that she likes me , she trusts me , " says Prof Rogers .
" For the first half of my life , I struggled to control my fear of bears .
But bears like June have taught me that they are not the ferocious animals we once thought . "
BEAR FACTS
Black bears once ranged over most of the forested regions of North America .
Their current distribution is restricted to relatively undisturbed forested regions
Their population is estimated at 750,000 Wild males weigh between 125 and 500lbs .
Females weigh between 90 and 300 lbs
Black bears groom each other for parasites as primates do This species does not growl .
Black bears make loud blowing noises and clack their teeth when frightened A knee jerk fear of bears often leads to people attempting to hunt them , says Prof Rogers , even out of season when it is illegal to do so .
" Walking with bears allows us to see the dangers they face , " says Prof Rogers .
" Some people are so afraid of bears , they shoot them on sight , even when they pose no threat . "
In the film , Prof Rogers and his field researcher Ms Sue Mansfield can be seen approaching a 400 lb male bear that they believe had earlier been shot and wounded by a hunter .
Yet even this wounded bear is not aggressive towards them .
During the six week annual hunting season , Prof Rogers and his team tie pink ribbons around the bears they are researching , so that they are obvious to hunters , which hopefully will spare the animals .
Bears temporarily marked in this way are four times less likely to be shot by hunters .
There is also an assumption that feeding black bears may cause the animals to aggressively seek food out from walkers and campers .
" The funny thing is , there is no scientific evidence to support this , " says Prof Rogers .
" It is not what we see . "
Other revelations gleaned by Prof Rogers during his research include the fact that black bears are susceptible to a parasite of deer .

Young bears can die after being infected by the pathogen , and Prof Rogers and his colleagues are now studying its impact on the black bear population .
Along with colleagues Dr Gustav Peters and Dr Megan Owen , Prof Rogers has also studied in detail a particular behaviour of bears , known as " humming " .
While humming , bears will exhale producing a series of between nine and 15 loud sounds a second .
When they reach the end of each breath , they quickly and silently inhale , before exhaling loudly again , continuing the humming sound .
As yet , it is unclear why bears do this .
All bear species hum in this way , apart from giant pandas .

HUGO CHAVEZ ELECTED PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA IN 1998 , IS A COLORFUL , UNPREDICTABLE FOLK HERO , beloved by his nation 's working class and a tough - as - nails , quixotic opponent to the power structure that would see him deposed .
Two independent filmmakers were inside the presidential palace on April 11 , 2002 , when he was forcibly removed from office .
They were also present 48 hours later when , remarkably , he returned to power amid cheering aides .
Their film records what was probably history 's shortest - lived coup d'état .
It 's a unique document about political muscle and an extraordinary portrait of the man The Wall Street Journal credits with making Venezuela " Washington‚s biggest Latin American headache after the old standby , Cuba . "

Apple 's new Core i7 - based iMac might be a performance monster , but it looks like the whole family 's having some problems getting out of the gate : in addition to the previously - noted performance issues with the Core 2 Duo models , a quick glance across Apple 's support forums and on other Mac boards around the web reveals that some machines are showing up DOA and / or with cracked screens .
We 're a little more familiar with the DOA issue , since the new i7 we just bought does n't boot at all , but the cracked screen issue seems to be equally common and mostly affecting the bottom left corner , from what we can tell .
Now , our review Core 2 Duo 27 - inch iMac is perfectly fine , and Chris Ziegler 's new Core i7 machine does n't have any problems either , so these obviously are n't universal issues , but if you 're about to stick one of these under the tree for someone it might be wise to do some surreptitious testing first .
The FBI has made two arrests in the last 48 hours in separate undercover operations in which would - be bombers were given fake explosives which they proceeded to try to detonate near major buildings .
Below are excerpts from FBI press releases .
Springfield , Il . :
[ O ] n September 23 , 2009 , [ Michael C. ]
Finton drove a van containing what he understood to be explosive material and parked it directly in front of the northwest corner of the federal building .
Finton got out of the van , locked the door and got into another vehicle driven by the undercover FBI officer and drove away .
Within a few blocks of the federal building , Finton made a cell phone call to remotely detonate the purported bomb in the van .
FBI agents arrested Finton immediately after he attempted to detonate the device .
Dallas , Texas :
Hosam Maher Husein Smadi , 19 , has been arrested and charged in a federal criminal complaint with attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction .
Smadi , who was under continuous surveillance by the FBI , was arrested today near Fountain Place , a 60 - story glass office tower located at 1445 Ross Avenue in downtown Dallas , after he placed an inert / inactive car bomb at the location .
Smadi , a Jordanian citizen in the U.S. illegally , lived and worked in Italy , Texas .
He has repeatedly espoused his desire to commit violent jihad and has been the focus of an undercover FBI investigation .
In both cases , the FBI said there was no connection to the alleged terror plot in New York and Colorado , though I wonder if they did n’t bring these cases to conclusion as a result of the widespread coverage of the NYC investigation , which was apparently terminated prematurely because an alleged misstep by the NYPD tipped off the target .
I knew I wanted to be a screenwriter from the time I was nine years old in the parking lot of the movie theater where my father and his girlfriend took me to see Terry Gilliam ’s Brazil .
That movie spoke to me on a visceral level with its major theme of antiestablishmentarianism and its protagonist fighting to realize his dreams .
I already knew I was different from the other kids my age .
I had skipped second grade , been placed in split grade classes and given the coursework of the older kids .
My biological mother had tried to impose her will upon me in any number of ways , including using her diabetes as a weapon in an attempt to emotionally enslave her own children .
My parents divorced when I was six and I was at the mercy of the court , which assigned custody to my toxic mother .
At nine I fled the prison of her custody and found support in my father ’s home .
Shortly after moving in with my father I changed my name as a way of declaring my independence .
I threw off an imposed personality and staked my own ground .
Brazil spoke to me in such a deep way I decided to focus all my energy on becoming a screenwriter .
Over the next few years of my adolescence I would beg and plead to work at the local video store just for access to movies .
I delivered flyers and handed out advertisements until I looked old enough to work behind the counter .
At 13 I knew my employer was breaking some labor laws in letting me work there , especially renting X - Rated movies to customers .
But I acted older than I was and watched 3 movies a day for summers and after school .
To communicate effectively in English one needs a working vocabulary of about 5,000 words .
In order to discuss film intelligently , I believe you have to have seen at least 5,000 movies .
I guess you could make the comparison to the 10,000 hour theory of mastering something , but I suspect there ’s quite a number of people that have watched 5,000 movies and still have shitty taste in movies .
Rather , watching those movies and pulling them apart , reading their screenplays to see the blueprint from which they were built , and trying to craft my own stories were all part of my early film education .
In sixth grade I was tested for a new magnet program with a focus on the humanities as well as a television studies and production component .
I was part of the first year of the Communication Arts Program that included access to a full TV production lab .
I threw myself into learning these skills and found that I really enjoyed directing live television segments produced for the school ’s news channel .
I lived in the TV lab , learned as much of the equipment as I could get my hands on , and found that I was adept at telling a story .
The program did n’t have a high school so my father and many of the CAP parents fought for the program to be continued past middle school .
They won and our small pilot class was inserted into a high school that already had a math and science magnet but was still large enough to support our needs .
By ninth grade my grades were slipping .
I had never been a great student , but had managed to get by in my weak classes and excel so strongly in my element I got away with a decent average .
At the same time my relationship with my mother was deteriorating along with an abusive relationship with my sister .
My sister had finally come to live with my father and I after trying to live with our mother for a few years .
( To be fair my sister did n’t feel like it was a choice when she stayed with our mother ; I had already fled .
Our mother would allow herself to slip into a diabetic shock in order to manipulate her children into calling the paramedics to revive her .
Without me around this responsibility fell to my sister , so she felt she could not abandon her mother in need .
This behavior began when I was six and my sister was eight .
My sister was trapped in this web of guilt . )
In a horrible psychological twist my sister and I essentially resumed the combat roles of our parents .
School was n’t working for me , either .
The course material was excruciatingly boring , and even the Humanities work that used to be my passion was feeling tired , a chore .
In tenth grade things exploded .
I had begun writing stories and creating self - published ‘ zines , handing them out to friends to fuel my creative need .
They were experiments in wordplay and seeing how far I could push tasteless ideas .
I wrote that one of our teachers was carrying Satan ’s child .
The administration did n’t think too kindly on this .
Is clear hyperbole slander ?
I channeled my frustration into my creative work at the sacrifice of my schoolwork .
I began work on a novel , essentially a precursor to today ’s narcissistic blogs .
The first half were chapters on my life and experiences , the second half rambling essays pontificating on the world .
I fancied myself a Dave Barry to the high school set , unaware of how cloying and callow the self - aggrandizing work really was ( is this work any different other than being aware of how self - aggrandizing it is ? ) .
The first chapter compared my caesarian section birth to a scene in one of the Friday the 13th movies where Jason rips a co-ed from a tent .
I turned in the chapter to a creative writing class and the teacher thought I had written a rape scene .
She escalated this to the principal who in turn banned my writing from campus .
The administration ordered an Emergency Management Team meeting , a witch trial if ever there was one , where the head of the communication program , my guidance counselor , and the school nurse judged my sanity .
It was Brazil in high school form .
A local journalist caught my story and I ended up on the front page of the local county newspaper .
This escalated my situation to local talk radio as well as gaining the involvement of the ACLU .
The principal became more entrenched in his position until the ACLU sent a letter showing that he was fundamentally wrong in his censorship .
By then , though , the damage was done .
I had no interest in school whatsoever .
Because of the local radio show my sister ’s guidance counselor heard my story and sent her home with information about an early entrance college in Massachusetts .
I was also seeing a psychiatrist who thought it would be a good idea to look at some colleges for early admission .
I applied to Simon ’s Rock College in the Berkshires and got a call to come up for an interview .
From the first visit I was hooked .
Simon ’s Rock was a way Out .
It did n’t matter that it did n’t have a film program , they wanted me as long as I could prove that I was n’t a complete failure of a student .
They looked at my essays and my interview and saw that I was a creative , anarchic thinker who desperately needed a challenging environment .
On their insistence I went to summer school to re-do algebra and managed a decent grade .
They let me in on academic probation , resolute that I keep at least a C average to keep my enrollment .
The summer before Simon ’s Rock I worked for a psychiatrist doing officework and transcribing the couples therapy sessions of his patients .
I learned serious relationship kung fu in a matter of months , even though I did n’t present a sexually mature body .
My hormones were raging , but I was still an asexual overweight kid who was n’t being considered in the way I wanted by the opposite sex .
I was tremendously honored when at the end of the summer the psychiatrist offered to mentor me through college , pre-med , and medical school to become a psychiatrist .
He was serious enough to incentivize my education by offering to set me up in private practice once I finished my residency .
He recognized in me a strong empathic quality that could be harnessed and trained for the good of others and he was looking for a student .
I thought long and hard on this offer .
At the end of the summer before heading off to school I thanked him and told him I was going to become a screenwriter .
I had wanted it for many years and I was going to see if I could make it happen .
By this point I had read all the screenwriting books I could get my hands on , and this was well before it was a fashionable cliché to be a starving , unsuccessful screenwriter .
I discovered that a screenplay is a very simple structure , but what is complex that most people miss is how to create a believable character .
Human beings are a jumble of dichotomies .
Some of my closest friends have huge conflicts within themselves that shape the nature of their character .
Their character dictates their actions , so when they do something that seems crazy it is always quite consistent with their well - established personality .
Fictional characters are the same way .
As an audience we know when something feels false because we are invested in a character or not .
Moviegoers may not be able to put their finger on why they hated a movie but they know when something feels off .
More often than not it ’s because the writer failed from the beginning to create believable characters , then forced these fakes through a plot that made no organic sense .
A good story is made of believable characters who create conflict and are changed permanently by going through that plot .
That ’s it .
That ’s the whole secret of good storytelling .
It covers every genre on earth and every medium .
Experimental work operates in contrast to that formula in such a way as to prove it true .
We revisit the same stories again and again because we want to spend time with these characters like old friends , and experience their transformation again – the vicarious joy in role play .
I worked hard at Simon ’s Rock to quickly learn proper study skills and keep my grades above failing .
When I rejected my public school education I also rejected a lot of good study habits and had to make up for lost time .
My first two years were n’t stellar academic achievements but I managed to pass my classes .
I spent my junior year abroad in London studying Sociology and Film at a University of London school , made all the more difficult by having a focus on British cinema with a focus on English class and race relations .
I returned from the UK with pink hair , a more hands - on understanding of the female anatomy , and a giant CD collection culled from the punk bins of the London High Road stalls .
Simon ’s Rock requires a senior thesis as well as matriculation into a department .
Before I left for the UK I was accepted into the Social Sciences , specifically the Sociology department .
I declared my intent was to develop my fictional writing techniques by studying human behavior .
Secretly I was planning on writing a screenplay for my yearlong senior research paper .
At the end of my first semester back I was informed that due to my father ’s remarriage my financial aid was being drastically reduced .
Secondly , the bills were overdue and I would not be able to return to college unless those bills were paid .
This also happened to coincide with my falling in love with a tornado of a girl , a maelstrom of sexual and wicked intellectual energy that intoxicated me completely .
When I was officially informed that I could not return to college for the next semester I moved back home to Maryland and worked in Macintosh computer sales again .
When a friend invited me to share his apartment in Los Angeles I moved to Sherman Oaks , California April 1 , 1994 , just after the massive earthquake destroyed most of the buildings in my friend ’s neighborhood .
I transferred my job working in retail to the west valley store of the same chain .
At night I would go to the patio of Jerry ’s Famous Deli and chain smoke , drink coffee , befriend wannabe hoodlums , and work on my screenplays .
My first screenplay was the obligatory cathartic emotional purge of my own life .
It was the story of a young man obsessed with pornography whose only real female contacts in the world were an abusive , domineering mother and combatative sister .
He finds solace in writing and uses his gift to liberate himself from an oppressive environment in an early entrance college .
He finds love there and she makes him see her as a real person , not a sexual object or frightening authority .
It was a fantasy of my own unrequited love for the girl I met that last semester who was on her own self - destructive path from which I could not rescue her .
As all self - indulgent first scripts , it sucked .
Never read someone ’s first script .
It ’s always drek .
They hear “ write what you know ” so they do and it ’s awful stuff .
It ’s locked to their real lives instead of the emotional truths of their characters .
Any criticism offered is taken as personal offense – judging them , not the work .
They have no distance , they will not make the brutal changes necessary , and it reeks of ego .
My next few scripts were better , learning as I went about how to execute structure and pacing , proper placement of gags and direction .
I wrote a script that was a satire of conspiracy movies , quirky criminal movies that were the fashion , and alien invasions .
A producer team was interested and shopped it around , though they had no money to option the material .
I offered them a non-exclusive option on deferred payment .
When we started taking meetings at John Cusak ’s production company I was giddy and thought things were about to break open .
They even brought in a potential director who prompted a whole ton of changes .
I went to work doing rewrites , all without ever being paid a dime , and was goofy at the prospect of success .
When John Cusak and his partners came back from shooting their latest film and the communication abruptly ended it was clear that the fellow we were dealing with had no power whatsoever .
It all went away overnight .
The script had been tailored into an empty suit .
Moreover , I learned that when someone says “ I love it ” , they say that because it is free .
Putting up money involves real risk , and if your producers can’t raise the money for a legitimate option they sure as shit ca n’t raise the funds to produce a multi-million dollar production .
By this time I was working for Digital Domain , one of the best visual effects companies in the business .
I was doing computer support for the producers and overhead staff – not even working in the production pipeline .
I was n’t even the janitor sweeping the elephant shit in the parade in the old joke .
I was the guy fixing the janitor ’s computer .
Eventually the CEO of the company would declare that he wanted to produce movies and he was extending the intellectual property agreement all employees signed to include screenplays .
It did n’t matter if you were hired to paint textures on rocks , if you wrote something while employed there he would exercise his right and steal it .
( And this piece of human excrement has had the temerity to ask for my Facebook friendship over and over again . )
My third year working there I met and fell in love with a woman who was rapidly changing my life for the better .
In the euphoric state of new love I banged out a screenplay in a matter of weeks – a story about a creative person stuck in a job that was paying handsomely but denying his growth as a person .
It is through a new love he is able to break free and find his true voice .
It was a love letter to my girlfriend .
In hindsight it also sucked as a screenplay .
A good idea poorly executed .
But still , I got the girl and she moved in with me after we did long distance for nine months .
With her encouragement I quit Digital Domain so I could focus full time on my writing career , unencumbered .
I made the big leap , putting all my energy into my writing and getting my work out into the market .
I poured myself into a story about the commodification of dissent , the seizure of revolutionary imagery for corporate gain , the deep irony of a band like Rage Against the Machine being a Sony band .
The main character begins as a devoted marketing guru , looking for product and brand synergy for his corporate overlord .
When his grand marketing plan backfires – he tries to turn revolution itself into a pop movement – he is fired , and swearing revenge on the biggest media empire on earth , he uses the tools of social movements and advertising to bring down the company .
He becomes a revolutionary .
I went to market with this script August of 2001 .
When your great work opens with a group of domestic terrorists blowing up what is obviously the Times Square Disney Store and you do n’t understand why a Hollywood executive would turn pale , you are clearly operating with a pre-9/11 paradigm .
By this point I had to increase my IT consulting business because our nest egg was out and bills had to be paid .
My personal life was great – I had incredible support and love from my girlfriend and she was finding new work and a new career in the art education world .
A neighbor was tired of the acting game and became determined to learn how to make movies .
He took the advertised classes , including the one where you learn which checks you need to write to make a low budget film .
He and I would talk a lot about what he was learning and eventually I offered to help by providing him with a script to shoot .
We would go after a proven market – the direct to video “ urban action ” genre .
Basically , modern blaxploitation movies .
In the same tradition , a loutish jew would be writing the script .
I vowed , however , no use of the N word .
Everything else was fair game .
Locations would be streets , alleys , anywhere that could be filmed with no money , no permits , on the run .
I hammered out a script in about a month and handed it over .
My friend assembled a crew , he knew an action director , and they shot GAME OVER in about two weeks for $ 27,000 .
I was promised $ 500 for the script and was given a check for $ 250 with the promise if the film made money I ’d see more .
While they were shooting the movie I was in New York shooting footage with a friend for a fake documentary we had written about a WWII superhero manufactured by the military to end the war .
We putting together footage for a trailer so we could shop it around for funding .
That summer was pretty amazing , having a script shot in LA while I worked in New York on my own film .
GAME OVER took over a year to finish editing , scoring , and for my friend to secure video distribution .
I never found out how much money it made since they chose to roll their funds into a second urban action movie , written by someone else .
GAME OVER is mostly dreadful , though friends have said they can hear my voice from behind the curtain .
My mistake was in structuring a plot with a twist at the end , requiring a deft hand in exposing the reveal .
The main character is released from prison and just wants to see his son .
But the only thing he ’s ever been good at is fighting , so he is easily recruited into a game where he can be attacked at any time , any place and he must win to advance to the next round .
A rich woman hires him as her driver and bodyguard , but at the end she reveals she is behind the entire game itself .
He was supposed to reject the life of fighting to redeem himself , and his bad choices pushed him away from his son .
This reveal was delicately hinged on a piece of dialogue and because the filmmakers were n’t experienced , did n’t care much about the material , and the actress was awful the whole third act falls apart and the story makes no sense .
It was my huge mistake in writing plot that relied on dialogue .
A rookie move , but I was aiming for the bleachers in my story .
I wanted to write a real redemptive tale , not just a bunch of minorities beating each other up .
Afterwards I found myself enthralled with Liberia .
I had been hearing about the insane civil war and the mind - bending horrors that occurred there and a story started forming .
I wrote a script about the collision of a hip - hop artist with no street cred being chased down by a horrifying Liberian warlord diamond merchant .
It was fake black violence against real - world African violence .
AFRICAN -AMERICAN is one of the most insane stories I ’ve written and it made it as a semi-finalist in a screenplay competition .
My urban action producers could n’t do anything with it because they found the direct to video market was drying up rapidly as DVD sales plummeted and internet was killing the bottom feeding media .
It did n’t go anywhere .
Shortly afterwards I was hired to write a treatment by a wealthy fellow who had the money and interest to have an old idea he ’d been carrying around written for him .
I spent a few months creating a custom work for him and when he wanted changes made that I felt would gut the story , I made those changes and let go of any personal attachment I had to the contents .
He was happy , I was paid , and that was the end of that .
The last script I ’ve written materialized after my father ’s hospitalization .
His lifestyle habits put him in the hospital and almost killed him and I flew back to Maryland to spend a week taking care of him alongside his wife , who I will refer to as my mother from here on out .
She has earned that title over the last twenty years in being unconditionally supportive , non-judgmental , constantly helpful and patient , and being the very definition of a maternal figure .
I am very lucky to have Mom 2.0 .
My father and I both love modern magic and classic , Victorian - era magicians .
The middle period of Vegas glitz and ugly showmanship we can do without , but new and old are bonded by their skepticism and respect for the audience .
Douche bags like David Copperfield condescend to people with their magic as if they ’ve never seen someone turn a tiger into a girl .
Magicians like Penn & Teller , Jamie Ian Swiss , and mentalists like Banachek all know their audiences have seen these tricks a million times and so they subvert those expectations and play with that knowledge .
I offered to write a script with my father once he got out of the hospital .
It would be good for both of us – incentive for him to get better and a goal for me to keep writing .
We spent the next year crafting a story about three generations of magicians in one family , their lives destroyed by a terrible accident involving the bullet catch , magic ’s deadliest trick .
The main character is the man in the middle – the son who accidentally shot his father on stage , and the father to an estranged child that has grown up to become a con man .
Recruited by the CIA he spent his adulthood using stage magic to kill for America , constantly reminded of the accident that almost killed his own father .
When his son finds him living in secret , he is forced to confront his father and the demons of his past all of which revolve around the bullet catch .
I do n’t mind saying it , CATCHING BULLETS is the best thing I ’ve ever written .
My dad let me drive , offering input and edits , we brainstormed together , and the result is one hell of a story .
It ’s ambitious because it is three generations of men , a story about fathers and sons and it uses magic as metaphor for the lies within family .
It took over a year to write , rewrite after rewrite , and it reflects that long process .
I ’ve written already about how I started running after my father ’s hospitalization , how running led me to triathlon , and so on .
I met Damon through triathlon and it was n’t until we got to know one another that we discussed our other lives .
Damon was transforming from a successful producer into a director .
He was doing a workshop and was looking for material to shoot .
I offered him CATCHING BULLETS without expectation .
When he came back and said how much he liked the material I was flattered , but floored when he offered to develop it and shop it around .
I spent the next few months doing rewrites for Damon .
Unlike in the past when I worked with people who thought they were producers , Damon had actually produced several movies and was good at it .
We went through a lot of iterations and through Damon ’s valuable input the script became even better .
It was the best thing I had ever written .
It now absolutely is .
My dad hung on for the ride , proud of his contribution , thrilled he could be a part of the development process .
He trusted me completely with decisions .
It was a big growth in our own relationship , working together for the first time as creative equals .
Damon got behind the script and sent it to over a half dozen studio development executives all of whom passed .
They all read it themselves , they did n’t hand it off to an underling for coverage .
But each of them passed for different reasons – no one criticized the writing , they just did n’t think it was right for their slate .
Additionally , the spec market has dried up .
Very few sales are being made right now in this economy and no studio is taking risks with unknown writers , unknown material , and especially adult dramas .
The movie business is risk - averse , even though its greatest successes are in new ideas .
New ideas that are then milked dry in sequels and ancillary venues .
What is selling now are existing assets – toys , comic books , old TV shows .
Original material is going largely untouched .
My greatest weakness as a screenwriter had been a difficulty in showing a character ’s growth .
It took me years to understand how to plot the arc of change , to show through smaller conflicts how a person responds can shift and adjust so that by the end of a story that person is permanently different .
I never liked television because those characters never permanently change .
There is a dollar investment in cast , location , and the audience wants predictability .
I love movies because things have to change or the story is dead .
Perhaps the greatest irony here is that my own journey towards an Ironman is that very incremental , permanent change in real life , in real time .
Moment by moment , crucible by crucible .
Friends have recently commented that I ’m too big to be defined by a single word like Screenwriter , or that no person is ever defined by what they do .
And yet , when you focus on something so furiously the way I have since I was nine years old it becomes an intrinsic part of your personality .
When I say , “ I am a screenwriter ” it yields a very different conversation than , “ I fix famous people ’s computers ” , or “ I swim , bike , and run really far ” .
There are a lot of people in Los Angeles who say they are a screenwriter but have never actually written a screenplay .
I ’ve written fifteen .
There ’s a lot of people who say they are a screenwriter and talk about “ traction ” and are doing rewrites ( for free ) for a producer who “ loves it ” .
I wish them luck .
I ’ve been there .
There are loads of screenplay competitions where aspiring screenwriters can spend $ 50 or more to win – what ?
The chance to be read by development executives and producers .
Take a look at the long list of Nicholl Fellowship winners , one of the most prestigious writing fellowships .
Then compare those names against the IMDB and you ’ll find there ’s a lot of good press in being a Nicholl Fellow but not a lot of their movies get made .
No , there ’s a lot of money to made on the dreams of people who say they are Screenwriters .
In screenwriting you can create what could be the greatest screenplay ever written , but if you ca n’t sell it or get enough momentum behind it to get it made it has failed .
Every day is an emotional war to convince yourself that you have worth and should keep on going , regardless of the whim of the marketplace .
Even if you do succeed in getting that sale it ’s unlikely the movie will get made .
If it does get made , your chances of seeing your vision on screen are slim to none .
My wife does n’t understand why anyone would want to become a screenwriter – it is constant heartbreak , rejection , and a feeling of career impotence year after year .
I contrast all this to what it means when I say , “ I am a triathlete ” .
I work every day towards that goal and when I cross a finish line it is because I made it happen .
Yes , I have the support of friends and family and without them it would not be possible .
But it ’s my arms turning over and pulling water .
It ’s my legs pushing the cranks .
It ’s my mind willing the legs to move forward with purpose .
It is my mind overriding the desire to quit that gets me across the finish line .
When I am done I can say that I made it happen , I willed it into existence , and the only person who could stop me was myself .
I may not ever be done writing screenplays .
I love movies , I enjoy the format ( as weird as it is and by how much writing is NOT on the page ) , and I have many more ideas .
But more and more I am discovering that I can use my ability to tell a story to help other people reach their own goals , or inspire them to create their own new definition of self .
I was honored and pleased to see how my wedding ceremony has affected people in ways and places I had n’t expected .
I co-own a triathlon coaching business and we ’re building a wonderful community .
Soon I will be a triathlon coach myself .
Sooner , I hope to become an Ironman .
In writing about my life I am reaching people in new and surprising ways and changing myself .
I am expanding my definition of who I am .
Am I Screenwriter ?
I used to be .
Let us assume for a moment that the pilots actually were n't asleep as Northwest 188 flew 150 miles past its destination ( unlikely , but go with it ) .
Then what WERE they doing ?
They 've denied sleeping , fighting , and arguing .
Any bets ?
Associated Press , MINNEAPOLIS ( AP ) --
The first officer of the Northwest Airlines jet that missed its destination by 150 miles says there was no disagreement in the cockpit , neither he nor the captain was napping and the passengers were never in any danger .
But in an interview with The Associated Press two days after he and a colleague blew past their destination as air traffic controllers tried frantically to reach them , pilot Richard Cole would not say just what it was that led to them to forget to land Flight 188 .
'' We were not asleep ; we were not having an argument ; we were not having a fight , '' Cole told the AP .
Air traffic controllers and pilots tried for more than an hour Wednesday night to contact Cole and the flight 's captain , Timothy B. Cheney , of Gig Harbor , Wash . , using radio , cell phone and data messages .
On the ground , concerned officials alerted National Guard jets to prepare to chase the airliner from two locations , though none of the military planes left the runway .
'' It was not a serious event , from a safety issue , '' Cole said in front of his Salem , Ore. , home .
'' I would tell you more , but I 've already told you way too much . ''
Unfortunately , the cockpit voice recorder may not tell the tale .
New recorders retain as much as two hours of cockpit conversation and other noise , but the older model aboard Northwest 's Flight 188 includes just the last 30 minutes -- only the very end of Wednesday night 's flight after the pilots realized their error over Wisconsin and were heading back to Minneapolis .
Cole would not discuss why it took so long for the pilots to respond to radio calls , '' but I can tell you that airplanes lose contact with the ground people all the time .
It happens .
Sometimes they get together right away ; sometimes it takes awhile before one or the other notices that they are not in contact . ''
A police report released Friday said the pilots passed breathalyzer tests and were apologetic after the flight .
Cheney and Cole had just started their work week and were coming off a 19 - hour layover , the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported Saturday , citing an internal Northwest document it said was described to the newspaper .
The police report said that the crew indicated they had been having a heated discussion about airline policy .
But aviation safety experts and other pilots were deeply skeptical they could have become so distracted by shop talk that they forgot to land an airplane carrying 144 passengers .
The most likely possibility , they said , is that the pilots simply fell asleep somewhere along their route from San Diego .
'' It certainly is a plausible explanation , '' said Bill Voss , president of the Flight Safety Foundation in Alexandria , Va .
Cheney and Cole have been suspended and are to be interviewed by National Transportation Safety Board investigators next week .
The airline , acquired last year by Delta Air Lines , is also investigating .
Messages left at Cheney 's home were not returned .
FAA spokesman Tony Molinaro said in general , an unsafe condition created by a pilot could lead to the suspension of the person 's pilot license and possibly a civil penalty .
With worries about terrorists still high , even after contact was re-established , air traffic controllers asked the crew to prove who they were by executing turns .
'' Controllers have a heightened sense of vigilance when we 're not able to talk to an aircraft .
That 's the reality post -9/11 , '' said Doug Church , a spokesman for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association .
NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway said fatigue and cockpit distraction will be looked into .
The plane 's flight recorders were brought to the board 's Washington headquarters .
The pilots were finally alerted to their situation when a flight attendant called on an intercom from the cabin .
Voss said a special concern was that the many safety checks built into the aviation system to prevent incidents like this one -- or to correct them quickly -- apparently were ineffective until the very end .
Not only could n't air traffic controllers and other pilots raise the Northwest pilots for an hour , but the airline 's dispatcher should have been trying to reach them as well .
The three flight attendants onboard should have questioned why there were no preparations for landing being made .
Brightly lit cockpit displays should have warned the pilots it was time to land .
'' It 's probably something you would say never would happen if this had n't just happened , '' Voss said .

Cain reported from Salem , Ore .
The CRTC kicks off two weeks of hearings next week that place the spotlight on the fee - for - carriage fight .
Last night , I participated in an interesting debate on the issue on TVO's The Agenda called A Pox On Both Their Houses : Cable and TV .
The program is embedded below .
One issue that was not raised – indeed it has not received any real public attention – was noted earlier today by Alan Sawyer .
He notes that CTV and Canwest have quietly asked the CRTC to order cable and satellite companies to establish a new policy of " program deletion . "
The new policy ( which is supported in a Toronto Star piece today ) would mean that when a Canadian broadcaster buys the Canadian rights to a U.S. program , the U.S. broadcast would be blocked in Canada for a seven - day window .
In other words , rather than the current simultaneous substitution policy , which allows for the programs to air at the same time and for the substitution of the Canadian broadcast on the U.S. channel ( thereby leading to the annual complaints about Super Bowl commercials ) , the U.S. broadcast would be blocked altogether .
That would allow Canadian broadcasters to air the U.S. program whenever they like and block the U.S. version altogether .
In a world when consumers expect to view programs on their schedule , CTV and Canwest seek a return to a prior era when the broadcaster retains ( now illusory ) control over access to the broadcasts in Canada .
To see Clay Marzo drop into an enormous wave , carving under its barrelling lip then emerging , in a vibrant flash , to throw his surfboard into a series of elaborate leaps and twists , is to witness a jaw - dropping display of raw sporting talent .
Watch the professional surfer totter on to dry land , however , and an unfortunate transformation occurs .
In the time it takes to shower and throw on a hooded top , he 'll turn from swaggering athletic hero into an awkward , troubled recluse .
Sometimes , Marzo will sidestep autograph - seeking fans , rubbing his hands , or anxiously pulling at his hair .
Other times , he might give a withdrawn TV interview that redefines the meaning of monosyllabic .
Occasionally , he can even turn aggressive , or come across as just plain rude .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In truth , he 's no such thing .
Instead , Clay Marzo , who exploded on to the scene at Puerto Escondido in Mexico last month with his first pro victory , and is now being dubbed the most naturally gifted surfer of his generation , has a high - functioning form of autism called Asperger 's syndrome .
The condition makes it difficult for the 20 - year - old wunderkind to interact with other people .
He finds crowds unnerving , conversation perplexing , and is unable to " read " emotion on someone 's face .
In social situations he is often – if you 'll pardon the expression – a fish out of water .
Yet Asperger 's is also the secret of Clay Marzo 's incredible sporting ability .
According to an acclaimed documentary called Just Add Water , it actually helps him succeed in the glamorous field of professional surfing .
He is a unique talent because of the condition , rather than despite it .
Some believe it could eventually make him the greatest surfer in history .
" There 's no one of his age in the world right now who does what he does , " says Kelly Slater , the legendary , nine - times world surfing champion .
" When I first saw him , I remember thinking , ' This kid knows things I do n't know .'...
He knows things all the guys I 'm surfing with do n't know . "
Some people with Asperger 's are genius mathematicians , scientists or musicians ( many believe that Albert Einstein , Mozart and Isaac Newton had it ) .
Others have brilliant memories , such as Dustin Hoffman 's character in the film Rain Man .
Marzo may very well be the first person with the condition to have developed a genius for surfing .
In Just Add Water , which will be released in major stores and on iTunes next month , one of the world 's leading specialists on the condition , Dr Tony Attwood , explains how it has left Marzo with a unique ability to be able to predict how a breaking wave will evolve , and ride it accordingly .
" In Asperger 's , the brain is wired differently , " he says .
" Some things are processed so superbly that the person has areas of excellence .
There 's a tendency to have what we call a special interest .
It means that when the person with Asperger 's chooses to do something , they will become an expert at it , probably one of the best in the world at it . "
As the film 's extraordinary footage of Marzo cutting up famous surf breaks in France , Tahiti , Australia and California shows , Marzo has harnessed his amazing memory ( he can quote every word of the films Harry and the Hendersons and Elf ) to compare every approaching wave , with other , similar waves he has encountered in the past .
" He 'll have a schema of many waves that he 's ridden before , so he 's able to predict what to do in that situation , " adds Dr Attwood .
" His brain disconnects from everyday functions , and becomes one with the wave : he 'll intuitively know what the wave 's doing , so he 'll anticipate that , and be ahead of everyone else . "
Marzo's style of surfing is creative and spontaneous .
Unlike most professional surfers , he does n't plan different manoeuvres in advance , but instead adapts instinctively , suddenly spinning his board into reverse , perhaps , or flipping into mid-air to land audacious 360 - degree turns .
The result is a uniquely extravagant style that marks him out from his peers .
Having been blessed with a hefty dollop of physical talent , he can pull off even the most ambitious manoeuvres , sometimes landing a jump when a " wipeout " looks inevitable , or returning to an upright position after falling on to his back .
Other surfers joke that he boasts double - jointed knees .
" Clay 's an incredibly creative aerialist , and has this flexible thing in his legs that means he looks super loose and gets an incredible amount of velocity , " says Just Add Water 's director , Jamie Tierney .
" Everything he does is over - rotated , but he 's also got a real nice flowing style . "
" He remembers absolutely everything .
He can describe a wave to you from four years ago , just like that , and tell you everything about it .
In the way someone like Mozart hears music in a different way to everyone else , he does that with a wave .
He 's one of the best young surfers we 've ever seen .
Period . "
Marzo's career has n't always been plain sailing , though .
Before he was formally diagnosed with Asperger 's , at the relatively late age of 18 , his eccentric behaviour had prevented him reaching anything like his full potential in the sport .
A lifelong surfer , he had been born in Maui , one of Hawaii 's larger islands , and brought up 30 yards from a beach .
He got his first body - board at the age of two , graduated to stand - up surfing at four , and entered his first contest at five .
By 11 , he had signed pro contracts with Quiksilver , and at 15 won one of his two national amateur championships , going into the history books as the first junior ever to record two perfect 10 scores in the final .
However , out of the water , things soon went downhill .
Though clearly talented he hated the wetsuit modelling , magazine photoshoots and interviews that come with being a professional surfer .
His difficulty in holding regular conversations made it tricky for him to charm fans at autograph - signing sessions , and other meet - and - greets .
He did n't understand the concept of marketing himself ( one sponsor dropped him after growing tired of erratic behaviour ) and fell out with some peers because of what they regarded as his anti-social behaviour .
More troublingly , Marzo 's undiagnosed Asperger 's also hindered his performance in professional surfing contests , since it made him tactically naïve .
Competing in events that are strictly timed to last 30 minutes , for example , he would n't wear a watch , and would often fail to " hustle " competitors for the best waves .
Sometimes , when needing just a low - scoring ride to guarantee victory in an event , he would instead go for a recklessly ambitious one , fall over , and end up failing to post any score at all .
" Clay does n't like being on a crowded beach when a contest is happening , so he wo n't watch conditions , and he did n't always do as well as he should , " adds Tierney .
" I remember one time when to win a heat all he needed to do was to score a ' one , ' which basically means standing up on your board and riding it to the beach .
But instead , he hung around trying to do something better and the contest just ended .
He lost . "
For a time , Marzo became troubled .
He quit school , withdrew from formal competitions , and devoted himself to " free - surfing , " travelling with camera crews to distant breaks , where he could be filmed doing what he loves best , away from the prying eyes of judges .
In one such project , two years ago , Tierney was asked by Quiksilver to make a surf film called Misunderstood .
After they 'd met , he realised that Marzo might have Asperger 's ( both Tierney 's parents are psychologists ) and persuaded him to visit a specialist treatment centre .
Marzo was formally diagnosed in December 2007 and has since been undergoing fortnightly therapy .
He recently eased his way back on to the competitive scene and destroyed his rivals in Puerto Escondido last month .
He will spend this weekend trying to repeat the trick in Bali .
Elsewhere in the film , which swiftly had its title changed to Just Add Water , Tierney deftly explains how diagnosis has allowed Marzo to finally understand and feel at ease with himself .
It has also helped others get to grips with his personality .
" The main treatment for Aspergers is self - understanding and self - acceptance , " adds Dr Attwood .
" The problem is that people will talk of suffering from it .
No .
You do n't suffer from Aspergers , you suffer from other people .
I want people like Clay to be admired , for people to say they 've got talent .
Do n't feel sorry for them , applaud them . "
If he fulfils even half of his enormous potential , applause could be one thing that Clay Marzo ends up hearing an awful lot of .

They 're coming .
They convinced us it was going to be a Zombie attack .
Clever .
Statues of children with Ronald McDonald stand at the entrance to the Oak Brook Public Library .
Telling her mother that she wanted to come to the aid of a library under attack , 11 - year - old Sydney Sabbagha stood at the podium before the Oak Brook village board .
" I used to go to the library knowing there were people there to help me find a book .
Now there is no one to help me , " Sydney said solemnly .
" It will never be the same without the people you fired . "
Sydney nestled back into her seat , but that did n't stop 69 - year - old criminal attorney Constantine " Connie " Xinos from boldly putting her in her place .
" Those who come up here with tears in their eyes talking about the library , put your money where your mouth is , " Xinos shot back .
He told Sydney and others who spoke against the layoffs of the three full - time staffers ( including the head librarian and children 's librarian ) and two part - timers to stop " whining " and raise the money themselves .
" I do n't care that you guys miss the librarian , and she was nice , and she helped you find books , " Xinos told them .
" Do n't cry crocodile tears about people who are making $ 100,000 a year wiping tables and putting the books back on the shelves , " Xinos smirked , apparently referencing the fired head librarian , who has advanced degrees and made $ 98,676 a year .
He said Oak Brook had to " stop indulging people in their hobbies " and " their little , personal , private wants . "
Sydney was upset and " her little friend was in tears " after Xinos spoke at the meeting last week , says mom Hope Sabbagha .
" I wanted that kid to lose sleep that night , " a grinning Xinos says Wednesday , as he invites me for a nearly two - hour interview in his Mercedes - Benz in the gated Oak Brook community where he lives .
" This is the real world and the lesson , you folks who brought your kids here , is if you want something , pay for it . "
Xinos , who unsuccessfully sued to stop the building of the new library , which opened in 2002 , sits on one side of the issue .
He lost his election bid to be a village board member , but has been president of his home association since 1983 and worked to elect board members who agree with him about the library .
On the other side sits Barbara Benezra , the longtime president of the Friends of the Oak Brook Public Library , who considers the library " my third child . "
" This is the heart of the village , " Benezra says as she tours the library and surrounding gardens under a sign sporting a Cicero quotation reading , " If you have a garden and a library , you have everything you need . "
" We do n't have a grocery store , " Benezra says .
" We have this . "
While Benezra acknowledges the need for some budget cuts at the library , given the recession , she says , " There 's always been a faction of this town that 's been anti-library . "
The librarians , who stereotypically remain hushed for this story , obviously feel a bit threatened .
They have turned to the Teamsters for some labor help .
Teamster librarians in Oak Brook ?
Mercy .
" We get good contracts for all kinds of professionals , " says Brian Rainville , executive director of Teamsters Joint Council 25 , which oversees 100,000 Chicago - area Teamsters , from pharmacists to zoo keepers .
" They have given us petitions , " Village Manager David Niemeyer says of the Teamsters .
" Assuming they do become certified , we 'll have to negotiate with them . "
Other village employees are unionized and the village works out contracts with them .
" Everybody thinks Oak Brook is rich and has all kinds of resources , but we don't , " Niemeyer says .
" Oak Brook has very low taxes and that 's a point of pride in this town . "
Begun as a volunteer effort in 1961 with donated books , the library occupied a small space in village hall until it moved into an old school two years later .
It stayed there until the village built the new library .
The library is a village department funded by the general fund , same as the police , fire department and public works .
It has no taxing power .
Its budget comes from the village , and much of that money comes from sales tax , as there is no property tax .
And sales at the mall and other businesses are down .
" We 're probably going through what a lot of towns are going through , " Niemeyer says of the budget cuts .
" None of these things are easy . "
It 's not complicated for Xinos .
" You may like the library , but when you call 9 - 1 - 1 , you want a policeman or a fireman before someone to tell you where the books are in the library , " says the man who has talked of privatizing , outsourcing or even closing the library .
" I understand that my philosophy is conservative , " Xinos says , adding that government just needs to catch bad guys , put out fires , fix the streets and make sure buildings are sturdy .
He campaigned , successfully , against a plan to bring subsidized housing for seniors into town by declaring , " I do n't want to live next to poor people .
I do n't want poor people in my town . "
A poor kid who grew up in Berwyn and worked in his dad 's cafeteria in Chicago , Xinos went to law school and served in the Marines .
Xinos says he speaks for Oak Brook 's view of the Teamsters when he says , " Nobody here likes those kind of people . "
Xinos , who says he never had children in part because he was n't sure he'd be able to support them , sprinkles the F - word throughout his conversations .
He dismisses a recent library event involving dogs with a blunt three - word rant in which he bookends swear words around the word " that . "
That attitude does n't represent the silent majority in Oak Brook , who support the library , Benezra says .
" There 's been no discussion on the village board about closing the library , " Niemeyer notes .
" There is great pride in our library .
We have an outstanding library . "
What the library will look like in the 2010 budget depends on Xinos , Benezra , Teamsters , librarians , the village board and the people of Oak Brook .

Tisztelt Uram !
Idézem a cikkét :
„ A Nyelvtudományi Intézet szótári osztályának vezetője , a Nagyszótár főszerkesztője , Ittzés Nóra arról beszélt , mit csinál a szótáríró , hogyan készül a Nagyszótár , és mire való .
És egyáltalán , mitől nagyszótár a Nagyszótár , sőt mi az , hogy szó , és mi az , hogy tár . ”
„ Hogy mi a szó , meglehet ősen nehéz kérdés .
Megközelíthetjük grammatikai oldalról , szemantikai oldalról , pragmatikai oldalról vagy a szöveg felől is ; a szótárírónak inkább azt a kifejezést kell használnia , hogy lexéma .
Lexémának , úgynevezett szótári szónak a nyelvnek azokat a legkisebb , önállóan is használt egységeit tekintjük , amelyek jelentése vagy a használata valamilyen módon már társadalmi érvényűvé vált . ”
Hogy mi a szó , az egyáltalán nem nehéz kérdés :
A szó nem más , mint a beszéd legisebb értelmes része .
Ez a meghatározása a szónak , ezt így tanították , nem pedig lexéma , vagy valami latin ( os ) kriksz - kraksz ... meg „ társadalmi konszenzus ” , és a többi túlbonyolított meghatározás ...
A mondat pedig szavakból áll .
A szavakat osztályozhatjuk alakjuk ( egyszerű és összetett ) és nyelvállásuk ( magas , mély , vegyes hangrendű ) szerint .
Valószínűleg Ittzés Nóra még sohasem gondolkodott el ezen a kérdésen , hogy mi az a „ szó ” , ezért jut eszébe ilyen nyakatekert – vagy inkább kitérő ?
– magyarázat .
De én nem vagyok magyarnyelv - tanár , és szótárszerkesztő sem .
üdv .

Hogy mi a szó , a nyelvtudomány egyik legnehezebb kérdése .
Más a szó hangtanilag ( fonológiailag ) , szószerkezettanilag ( morfológiailag ) , mondattanilag ( szintaktikailag ) , szótártanilag ( lexikológiailag ) , jelentéstanilag ( szemantikailag ) , helyesírásilag .
Függetlenül attól , hogy mit tanítottak az iskolában .
Egy rag vagy képző nyilvánvalóan jelentéssel bír , azaz „ értelmes ” , egyértelműen a beszéd része , többnyire „ kicsi ” is , mégsem szó .
A vízvezetékszerelő - tanfolyam nyilvánvalóan szó , de egészen biztosan nem a „ beszéd legkisebb [ tovább nem szegmentálható ] értelmes része ” .
( Ittzés Nóra pedig minden bizonnyal évtizedek óta gondolkodik ezen a kérdésen .
Ez a szakmája . )

Szegény szavak ! ...- tanilag : akár valami ú jat is ki lehet találni , pl. „ hány betűből áll a szó- tanilag ” .
A rag vagy a képző nem szó , hanem toldalék , és egyiknek sincs önálló jelentése , csak a szóval együtt kap értelmet .
Önállóan egyik rag vagy képző sem értelmes .
Attól , hogy a beszéd része , még nem szó .
A „ vízvezetékszerelő - tanfolyam ” is egy szó , egy többszörösen összetett szó .
Adott szövegkörnyezetben ez „ csak egy ” szó lesz , ami a beszéd legkisebb értelmes része .

Nem cukkolom , dehogyis !
De ezt én is kérdezhetném Öntől !
Azért az is érdekes lehet , hogy Ittzés Nóra mit írt a Nagyszótárába a „ szó ” címszó alá értelmezésként .
Ehhez nem kell a tudományos tanulmány ( ...tanilag , ...lógiailag ) , csak magyarázat .
Ön sem úgy kérdezte tőle , hogy morfológiailag mondja meg , hogy mi az a szó , vagy fonológiailag .
Hanem csak úgy EGYSZERŰEN : mi az a szó ?
Amikor megkérdezünk valakit , hogy hány óra van , akkor nyilván abban az időpillanatban szeretnénk tudni „ általános ” id ő szerint , és nem pedig egy atomfizikus vagy egy csillagász meghatározásával .

Úgy kérdeztem tőle , hogy „ a lexikográfusnak mi az , hogy szó ” , vagyis arra kértem , mondja el , mi az a szótári egység , szakszóval lexéma .
I.N. még nem írta meg a szó lexéma jelentését , még csak a c betűnél tartanak .
De ha megnézi az Értelmező kéziszótárban , ott a szó hét jelentéséből az idevágó az , hogy „ a nyelvnek meghatározott hangalakú és jelentésű , viszonylag önálló egysége ” .
Egy büdös hang sincs legkisebbségről .
És értse meg : nem lehet csak úgy megmondani , mi a szó .
Mert attól függ , honnan nézem .
És amikor olyanokat ír , hogy egy toldaléknak „ nincs önálló jelentése ” , akkor mit gondol , mi az a „ nem önálló ” jelentés ?
Egy toldaléknak minimum viszonyalkotó ( nyelvtani ) jelentése van , méghozzá önállóan ( magában létezően ) , és az is jelentés , nagyon is .

Ön valóban erre módosította a bevezet őjében feltett egyszerű kérdést ( „ mi az , hogy szó , és mi az , hogy tár ” ) : „ a lexikográfusnak mi az , hogy szó ” .
Persze erre ő sem a legegyszer űbben felelt , hanem inkább tudományosan , mert tudományoskodni akart .
Egy gyereknek is másképpen magyarázunk , és másképpen egy szakmabeli tudományos munkatársnak .
Két orvos pedig nem azt mondja egymásnak , hogy vakbél , hanem appendix .
De miért ?
Ma már miért nem beszélünk pl. így : Explicite apprehendálok , hogy negligálod instaciámat ?
A „ Toldalékok ” nyelvtanilag az alábbiak :
1. KÉPZŐ : Megváltoztatja a szó jelentését , gyakran szófaját is .
Hal -> hallgat ( ige -> ige ) , hang -> hangos ( főnév -> melléknév ) .
Magánhangzó a toldalék előtt : előhangzó ( vagy kötőhangzó ) A szótővel együtt már új szót alkot .
2. JEL : A szó jelentését módosítják , utalnak a szavak kapcsolatára a mondatban .
A szó mondatbeli szerepét nem jelölik .
Példa : egyes szám jele , múlt idő jele stb .
A szótővel együtt nem alkot új szót .
3. RAG : A szó jelentését nem változtatja meg , csak mondatbeli szerepét jelöli .
Példa : könyv -> - et , - ről , - nek stb .
A szótővel együtt nem alkot új szót .
Ezek közül egyiknek sincs önálló jelentése – a magyar nyelvben .
Önálló jelentés : ami önmagában , tehát más szó nélkül is még értelmes .

Szóval az Indexen csak gyerekeknek szóló cikkek jelenhetnek meg ?
Azt mondja , van szó , annak önálló jelentése van , és van toldalék , annak nincs .
Mondja meg , szó-e az igekötő ?
A nyelvtanok többsége annak veszi .
Mi az „ önálló jelentése ” annak , hogy meg ?
Ha nem szó , miért viselkedik mégis folyton úgy , mint a szavak ( pl. hogy tud elválni attól , amit módosít ) ?
Szó-e a névutó ?
A nyelvtanok többsége annak veszi .
Mi az „ önálló jelentése ” a házhoz és a ház felé izékben a felé - nek a hoz - hoz képest ?
Mi az „ önálló jelentése ” annak , hogy hogy ?
( Miért nevezik a nyelvtanok aszemantikus – jelentés nélküli – kötőszónak ? )
Szavak-e a következő izék , és ha szavak , van-e bármivel „ önálóbb ” jelentésük , mint bármelyik toldaléknak : ő , az , ami , és , pedig , nem , féle , úgy , bár , viszont , csak , bizony stb .

És azt sem tudtam javasolni neki , hogy mielőtt általános iskolai definíciószurrogátumoknak vetve a hátát megszól egy tudóst , előbb talán olvashatna kicsit .
Például a kolozsvári kognitív nyelvész , Szilágyi N. Sándor pompás kis könyvét ( Hogyan teremtsünk világot ?
Rávezetés a nyelvi világ vizsgálatára ) .
Megmutatja , hogy mennyi gondolkodni valót találhatni abban a problémadágványban , amit mindközönségesen nyelvnek hívunk .
És nemhogy hallatlanul körülményes megmondani , mi az , hogy szó , meg mi az , hogy jelentés , az sem biztos , hogy ezek az izék egyáltalán vannak .
Az értelemről nem is beszélve .

Portsmouth 's owner , Sulaiman al - Fahim , will this weekend make a desperate attempt to attract fresh finance to the club after the chief executive , Peter Storrie , admitted " there is no money left " .
The move comes after another turbulent day at Portsmouth on which they were forced to admit that their first - team squad and executive board , including Storrie , had not been paid September 's wages .
The club rely on Fahim to pay those salaries but the owner has not yet delivered the £ 50 m which he last week promised to provide within a month .
At the weekend Fahim will meet representatives of two Saudi - based businessmen , the Faraj brothers , who were the leading members of the consortium fronted by Storrie which tried to buy the club this summer .
" All the money from all the player transfers and the Sky TV money – all of the £ 35 m from January – has gone straight to the Standard Bank , " Storrie said yesterday , referring to Portsmouth 's need to pay off a sizeable debt with the South African bank .
" There is no money left . "
" Whatever we spend on a monthly basis comes channelled through from [ Fahim ] .
He has promised to refinance and he has shown me all the documentation but I have no idea about the conditions of the £ 50 m he says will be arriving in a few weeks .
We need to refinance , it is as simple as that .
As for the players wages for the last month I would imagine it's a blip and they will be paid . "
Fahim 's proposed meeting with the Faraj brothers , which is understood to be scheduled for Sunday , appears to strengthen Storrie 's position given thathe fronted a consortium led by them which came close to taking over Portsmouth in late August before the then owner , Alexandre Gaydamak , sold to Fahim .
Last night Fahim confirmed he was open to new investors and said he felt " sorry " for the club : " I was always open for any investors if they will add value .
No matter who they are . "
But he hinted the Farajs may have only a short - term interest .
" I need people who want to stay with me and the club for the long term . "
Storrie said he was working tirelessly to keep the club afloat .
" We have been very close to administration a few times in the last nine to 10 months but I am not about to give up now , " he said .
" I 've no idea of the timescale about how long this can go on .
I do n't want to frighten people .
I am sure that if the refinancing that has been promised fails for some reason there will be other people ready to step in . "
Fahim said the players and three fellow board members – Storrie , Roberto Avondo and the finance director , Tanya Robins – would get their money today .
" The club needs time to be on track , " he added .
" And this is the worst [ period ] .
By the end of October [ we ] will see the light and we need everybody 's support in these few days .
And , the players will be paid . "
Pressed over whether there was any chance that he would put the club into administration if this was the best option for Portsmouth in the long term , Fahim seemed to rule this out .
" I am always there for the club , " he said .
Paul Hart , the embattled Portsmouth manager , said yesterday that Robins had spoken to the players to assure them they would be paid " in the next day or so " .
" We had a meeting this morning and assured them this would be sorted out , " he said .
" They turned it into a little bit of fun and have been terrific . "
Hermann Hreidarsson , the club's Professional Footballers '
Association representative , added he was not overly concerned .
" We did n't get paid but someone came down from the payment department and reassured us we will get paid tomorrow , so everyone 's a winner , " the defender said .
Gordon Taylor , chief executive of the PFA , said his organisation had discussed the situation at Portsmouth but chosen not to intervene because of promises that the players would be paid imminently .
" But , of course , this is a very serious matter from our point of view and , if the delay in payments are prolonged or repeated , we would consider intervening and taking action on behalf of our members , " he said .
" That could involve speaking directly to Portsmouth and seeking guarantees that payments are forthcoming . "
A couple of media reform groups have sent the Second Circuit Court of Appeals a brief urging it to kick the legs out from under the Federal Communications Commission 's shiny new rules against " fleeting " expletives — singular bleep words said on the fly .
That crackdown has already resulted in " a palpable chill on free speech , " complain the Center for Creative Voices and the Future of Music Coalition .
" Without coherent and consistent guidelines as to what constitutes indecent programming , creators are literally at a loss for words . "
The filing was written up by the Media Access Project .
But the brief also grapples with a very sticky wicket that the Second Circuit may or may not take up : whether there 's a scarcity of broadcast spectrum any more , and whether the legal precedent empowered by that assumption — a case called Red Lion — still authorizes the FCC to regulate the airwaves .
An extreme approach
To most media advocates , the FCC 's indecency rampage has been a disaster .
It 's almost impossible to predict what the FCC will decide is or is n't indecent , they charge , since the agency keeps changing its enforcement standards .
So broadcasters and content providers have to guess what they think the Commission wo n't like — effectively censoring themselves .
The big media companies keep a huge stable of First Amendment lawyers handy to respond to whatever crackdown comes next , but smaller broadcasters have no recourse against the potentially huge fines the FCC can now mete out .
As we 've reported , the big networks tried to throw out Fox Television 's spanking for various fleeting curse words that aired during the Billboard Music Awards , and they won the support of the Second Circuit in New York .
But the Supreme Court , by the narrowest vote ( 5 - 4 ) , ruled that the agency 's sudden decision to go medieval on broadcasters in the case of a single f- bomb or s-word did n't violate the Administrative Procedures
Act 's ban against " arbitrary and capricious " decision making .
So the case is now back on Second , where the court will review its decision based on constitutional rather than technical issues like the APA .
Central to the new brief is that the FCC 's recent indecency decisions offer no consistent guidance to broadcasters .
" How is a writer or musician to reconcile the FCC ’s acceptance of repeated use of strong expletives in Saving Private Ryan with the FCC ’s disapproval of the culturally contextual use of milder expletives in a documentary on the Blues music ? " it asks .
And the Commission has gone way past the authority granted to it in the Supreme Court 's 1978 Pacifica vs. FCC ruling , the groups argue .
That case only approved the agency 's sanctioning of a single radio station for broadcasting George Carlin 's famous " Seven Dirty Words " monologue .
And one justice who backed the decision noted that the FCC did n't issue any new regulations in the case , and so " may be expected to proceed cautiously , as it has in the past . "
It has n't turned out that way , the groups charge .
The agency has taken an " extreme " approach to Pacifica " which will have a profound impact on artists seeking to express themselves as creatively as possible . "
Rights of the viewers and listeners
But for these interested parties , there 's an interesting problem in trying to limit the FCC 's indecency authority .
The briefs of various TV networks to the Supreme Court did n't just ask the court to throw out the FCC 's sanctions because the agency did a whack job on Pacifica .
They also argued that the court should reconsider its Red Lion decision of 1969 — the case that upheld the Commission 's long abandoned Fairness Doctrine policy .
But the Center for Creative Voices and the Future of Music Coalition worry about such a move .
It 's not like these groups are asking for the Fairness Doctrine back .
They 're not .
But they also do n't want the Second Circuit to dump one of the basic legal underpinnings of media regulation .
In Red Lion Broadcasting vs. FCC , the broadcasters argued that Fairness Doctrine enforcement ( mandating that stations give air time to " both sides " of disputed questions ) violated the First Amendment rights of a radio station and should be repealed .
The high court disagreed .
The " scarcity of radio frequencies , " Justice Byron White declared , complicates the First Amendment 's applicability in this matter .
Since most people cannot buy or run radio stations , license owners have an obligation to share the publicly owned airwaves with the public .
" It is the right of the viewers and listeners , not the right of the broadcasters , which is paramount , " White wrote .
" It is the purpose of the First Amendment to preserve an uninhibited marketplace of ideas in which truth will ultimately prevail , rather than to countenance monopolization of that market , whether it be by the Government itself or a private licensee . "
Although the FCC abandoned the Fairness Doctrine over two decades ago , CCV / FMC say that Red Lion provides precedent for a host of crucial FCC powers : setting limits on media ownership , regulating non-commercial broadcasting , and managing spectrum .
" The major , and minor , decisions of communications policy should not be subject to second - guessing by non-expert judges , who could ' constitutionalize ' and handcuff the FCC ’s broad , flexible mandate to regulate the spectrum to serve the public ’s interest , " they argue .
Crucial services like WiFi have depended on the agency 's spectrum allocation authority , as does the FCC 's ability to rule on the " white spaces " surrounding television signals .
" Even if some Court would someday subject spectrum policy to intrusive second - guessing by the judiciary , this case is not the appropriate vehicle for that decision . "
The FCC mutated its indecency policies into what they are today based on Pacifica , not Red Lion , so it is Pacifica that should be examined , the brief advises .
Red Lion should remain in place .
But is spectrum still scarce ?
Perhaps the most interesting question that this case raises is whether spectrum is still hard to come by .
In their brief , NBC , CBS , and ABC argued that the scarcity days are long gone .
" The fact is that , today , ' spectrum ' is not ' scarce , ' " they told the Supremes .
There were 7,411 terrestrial broadcasting stations in 1969 when Red Lion was argued .
Today there are 15,736 .
" Moreover , this explosion of traditional broadcast outlets has been accompanied , recently , by an explosion of new broadcast technologies — satellite television , satellite radio , HD radio , and low power FM , to name a few of the many , " the networks ' lawyers added ( this line of reasoning almost never mentions the fact that the population of the United States also grew by 80 million people during those years ) .
Creative Voices and and Future of Music say that the spectrum scarcity argument remains valid in large part because spectrum value has dramatically grown , reflecting demand .
The FCC 's 2008 auction of the old 700 MHz television bands brought in over $ 19 billion in cash to the treasury , they note .
And Congress boosted the value of local TV licenses in the 1990s by reviving " must carry " rules — these requiring cable companies above a certain size to transmit local TV signals .
" The proper question is not how many outlets there are , or how many outlets are technologically feasible , but how much demand is there for the available spectrum in light of the regulatory scheme , " the brief concludes .
How will the Second Circuit deal with this scarcity conundrum ?
If the court takes it on , the judges might ask the FCC , as the " expert agency " involved , to come up with a position on the problem .
Rest assured that quite a few people would be anxious to help the Commission out with that task .

10 Iraqis were killed in political violence on Wednesday , including Brig .
Gen. Abdulhameed Khalaf Asfoor of troubled Ninevah Province .
Al - Hayat reports in Arabic that that January 15 will probably be the day on which Iraqi voters decide the shape of Iraq ’s next parliament and decide on two national referendum questions .
They are approval of the Status of Forces Agreement with Washington , specifying that US troops leave Iraq by the end of 2011 ; and approval of amendments to the 2005 constitution , which it is hoped will have been passed by the Iraqi parliament by the end of this autumn .
The Shiite religious parties in Iraq that have been so dominant since 2005 because of their alliances with one another appear to be going their own ways .
Every day there are new reports in the Iraqi press about new coalitions being formed that would break up what might be called the “ Sistani machine ” ( Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani was behind the United Iraqi Alliance , which brought together the religious Shiites and even some moderate independents from a Shiite background . )
AFP reports that al - Maliki will likely form a nationalist bloc with Sunni tribal parties , rather than continuing as part of the specifically Shiite UIA .
The Dawa or Islamic Mission Party that he heads is a Shiite fundamentalist party , but it is leavened with Iraqi nationalism and has often been ecumenical .
In its first golden age , of the 1960s and 1970s , it is said that 10 % of its members were Sunnis .
I argue in my new book , Engaging the Muslim World , that the Sunni Arab guerrilla war against the US was wrongly interpreted as religious in character when mostly it was a manifestation of Sunni Arab nationalism , and that most Sunni Arabs in Iraq are secular - minded .
That is , the Bush administration propaganda about fighting “ al - Qaeda ” in Iraq was just that .
The US military is supporting what I said .
According to a poll it carried out among the Iraqis in its custody , some 36 % percent of the 26,000 prisoners held by the US at the peak of the arrests said that they had never been inside a mosque , and 70 percent said that they were not regular mosque attenders .
The Sunni and Shiite Iraqis in US detention centers got along fine and played soccer quite amicably with one another ( why would n’t they– they were in agreement on the need to push the US military out of Iraq and were all paying the price together for their determination to do so ) .
But all through this decade we were bombarded by the corporate media and the White House and Pentagon with with the message that the US was fighting religious forces in Iraq , specifically “ Islamofascism , ” and that in fact it was the ‘ central front ’ in the war on ‘ Islamic terrorism . ’
In fact , the prisoners were mostly not religious .
The US was fighting secular Iraqi nationalists and could n’t admit it for fear of looking like an occupier .
Hence , its spokesmen lied about the guerrillas and made them out to be religious fanatics .
Sawt al - Iraq reports in Arabic that the Iraqi Oil Ministry , led by Husain Shahristani , is rejecting the protests of its own ministry employees against the terms of the contract being offered the Chinese National Petroleum Company to develop the southern Rumaila fields further .
The Ministry maintains that the protesting employees are being instigated by neighboring oil states that do not want Rumaila ’s daily production to be substantially increased .
The ministry employees ’ protest comes on top of that of the 10,000 unionized oil workers of Basra ( out of 45,000 such workers , who , Reuters has said , maintain that the bids are illegal because parliament still has not passed a petroleum bill and because the fixed - fee contracts may give away too much to the foreign firms and may actually result in less employment of Iraqis and worse wages for them .
An Iraqi court has fined the Dubai - based al - Arabiya satellite channel $ 87,000 for reporting incorrectly on the words of an Iraqi general .
Al - Arabiya was quoting an article from the London - based pan-Arab daily , al - Hayat , which is Saudi - owned .
Al - Hayat issued a retraction the next day , but the lawsuit sought to close down its Iraq offices .
It had alleged that Maj. Gen. Qasim al - Musawi had said that he would re-arrest prisoners freed by the US military .
He had actually just said that he would review their files to make sure they were not engaging in violence on their release .
It is disturbing to have al - Arabiya fined for relying on an al - Hayat article .
There is something of the Shiite - Sunni feud about the whole incident , with the Shiite generals of the new government upset by what they see as a pro-Sunni and even pro-insurgent bias in much of the Arab press .
The Iraqi government is now inspecting book imports to Iraq , saying it wishes to exclude works that promote sectarian violence .
AFP says that many Iraqi intellectuals worry that the new procedures put the country on a slippery slope back to censorship .
There are also plans to filter the internet .
Xinhua reports that Turkey ’s exports to Iraq in 2009 are on track to amount to $ 7 bn .
this year , up 80 % from 2008 ’s $ 3.8 bn. total .
Turkey is the most advanced economy in the Middle East , and its firms are clearly becoming important to the reconstruction effort .
Some 500 Turkish firms have completed $ 7 bn. in projects in Iraq .
The cloud over this Turko - Iraqi efflorescence is the substantial dispute between the two country over water resources , with Turkish damming of the headwaters of the Euphrates badly hurting Iraqi agriculture .

With Pam and Jim's wedding coming up next week , there was n't much in this episode for story or humor .
There were funny moments , but nothing that really caught my attention other than Dwight trying to bring down Jim .
Dwight is still an awesome character and his absurdity bridges the gap between annoyance and hilarity .
There was an expected showdown between Michael and Jim .
They have a hard time deciding what to do with limited raises and Michael lets Jim take the reins hoping for a disaster .
Of course , anything over money turns into a huge fight , and Jim is roundly criticized .
They try a few more tactics before resorting to gin .
Pam is trying to get real money instead of gifts which does n't go too well .
There were funny moments between the supporting cast ( Meredith telling Creed they slept together ) , but overall , this episode was missing a lot of what makes The Office great .

Criss from Romania tags Kirk and Ray ...
Yes it 's true Kirk Cameron and Ray Comfort are involved in a project to destroy the The Origin Of Species .
As Criss notes in the above video , Kirk is still arguing that there are n't any transitional fossils .
If you recall in the Nightline debate against the Rational Response Squad , Kirk and Ray were told that every fossil ever found is a transitional fossil .
In fact Kirk and Ray were invited to visit the the Hall of Human Origins courtesy of Brian Sapient and they never took him up on the offer .
In fact after being schooled in that debate ( and we do mean schooled , literally ) , they continued to parrot the same misinformation over and over .
They never for a second stopped arguing the extremely inaccurate case that there are no transitional fossils ... and they likely never will .
And with good reason , they are liars who must lie to support their idealogical agenda in which they are making a fortune off of you .
It just so happens that Eugenie C. Scott has uncovered some more of the scandalous dishonesty from the Way of the Master team .
Although she writes about it so pleasantly ...
Unfortunately , it will be hard to thoroughly read the version that Comfort will be distributing on college campuses in November .
The copy his publisher sent me is missing no fewer than four crucial chapters , as well as Darwin 's introduction .
Two of the omitted chapters , Chapters 11 and 12 , showcase biogeography , some of Darwin 's strongest evidence for evolution .
Which is a better explanation for the distribution of plants and animals around the planet : common ancestry or special creation ?
Which better explains why island species are more similar to species on the mainland closest to them , rather than to more distant species that share a similar environment ?
The answer clearly is common ancestry .
Today , scientists continue to develop the science of biogeography , confirming , refining , and extending Darwin 's conclusions .
Likewise missing from Comfort 's bowdlerized version of the Origin is Chapter 13 , where Darwin explained how evolution makes sense of classification , morphology , and embryology .
To take a simple example , why do all land vertebrates ( amphibians , mammals , and reptiles and birds ) have four limbs ?
Not because four limbs are necessarily a superior design for land locomotion : insects have six , arachnids have eight , and millipedes have , well , lots .
It 's because all land vertebrates descended with modification from a four - legged ( " tetrapod " ) ancestor .
Since Darwin's era , scientists have repeatedly confirmed that the more recently two species have shared a common ancestor , the more similar are their anatomy , their biochemistry , their embryology , and their genetics .
You can read her entire article How Creationist ' Origin ' Distorts Darwin here .
Here is a letter previously written by one of our associates , sent to the National Center for Science Education :
I 'm unsure if you 're already aware of this or not , but the ' Way of the Master ' organization has decided to commemorate the upcoming anniversary of The Origin of Species by distributing an altered version of the original work to students on various campus grounds * without * giving proper attribution of what is original in the book and what is not .
You may hear the words right from the horse 's own mouth right here .
Public domain or not , there ' no way that this sort of perverse plagiarism and libel can possibly be legal .
Do you know anything that can be done about this atrocious alteration of such a wonderful piece of work ?
I would love nothing more than to finally see Kirk Cameron and Ray Comfort shelling - out lawsuit fees until they cry like the snake oil salesmen that they are , but I 'm not a resident of the U.S. and do not know what legal channels I could possibly turn to .
This is simply a bridge too far .
These recent antics deserve swift and terse consequences .
Thank you very much for reading this .
Best regards ,
Kevin R Brown

Brütal Legend might actually be the best use of Jack Black yet , affording him a starring role that caters to his comedic roots and sensibilities while allowing everything around him to be more over the top than he is .
A RedState blogger demands the RNC names name and fire people involved in designing ( long before Steele assumed his post ) its health care plan , and opting in to abortion coverage :
For thirty years , we have fought tooth and nail to prevent our tax money from being used to pay for abortions .
Turns out , we were apparently doing it through donating to the political party that was ostensibly on our side .
This betrayal is so fundamental to the majority of people who donate to the RNC that it ’s almost unspeakable .
I have no doubt that many of the staffers there will miss the point , so allow me to make it clearly : you have caused every person who donated to support your livelihood to become involved in what they perceive to be a grave moral evil .
The RNC ’s defense thus far seems to be excusable negligence ; blaming it on some ( surely departed ) staffer who checked a box almost 20 years ago , and whoops , we were n’t careful enough .
So sorry .
It wo n’t happen again .
Not good enough ....
In order for the RNC to regain the trust of their donors , they must disclose the names of all people involved in any way of the selection of their health care plan .
And those people must be summarily fired .
No severance packages , no golden parachutes ; fired .
For cause .
No pro-lifer in good conscience can give them a dime until this happens .
J. Am. Chem . Soc. Replacement Parts Selected pieces of GFP can be removed by cutting a cleavage site in an inserted loop and denaturing the protein .
Replacing the excised portion with a synthetic peptide restores the fluorescence .
Text Size A A
A new in vitro method for splitting and reassembling green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) gives scientists synthetic control of the composition of this common fluorescent tag .
The method will not only help scientists better understand the workings of GFP but also inspire the design of improved proteins for fluorescent labeling in cells .
GFP consists of β- strands that form a barrel and a chromophore - containing α- helix inside the barrel .
In the new method , GFP is cut at predetermined sites , and to reassemble the protein , the parts removed by the cuts are replaced with synthetic components .
The method was inspired by so - called split GFP assays , which are widely used to detect protein interactions in vivo .
In these assays , GFP is expressed as two pieces , each fused to proteins whose interaction is being probed in cells .
When the proteins interact , GFP forms from the two pieces , and the assembly fluoresces .
Although studying the properties of these smaller pieces of GFP in vitro would help scientists understand how this fluorescent tag works , doing so is difficult because the pieces tend to be unstable or produced at low levels .
Stanford University chemistry professor Steven G. Boxer and graduate students Kevin P. Kent and Luke M. Oltrogge avoid those problems by expressing the intact protein first and then splitting it ( J. Am. Chem .
Soc. , DOI : 10.1021/ja906303f ) .
They engineer a loop containing a cleavage site into the protein before the portion they want to remove .
They snip the protein at the cleavage site and denature the protein to pull the pieces apart .
They then reassemble the protein , replacing the removed piece with a synthetic peptide .
Even before reassembly , the refolded protein with one particular β- strand removed still fluoresces , although the fluorescence differs from that of the native protein .
To Boxer , the difference suggests that the refolded protein missing this β- strand still retains a rigid barrellike structure .
“ Otherwise , the chromophore would not fluoresce , ” Boxer says .
Removing the central helix kills the fluorescence by eliminating the chromophore , but the fluorescence can be restored .
“ We bring back to this empty barrel a completely synthetic peptide .
It has no chromophore — just the amino acids that can become the chromophore , ” Boxer says .
“ When those two come together , that empty barrel catalyzes the reaction that leads to the formation of the chromophore . ”
Boxer ’s group is currently using the method to dissect the chemical and physical steps of chromophore formation in GFP .
“ The simple yet elegant protein - engineering approach presented here is a true success story in ongoing efforts to combine molecular biology tools with the tools of synthetic organic chemistry , ” says Rebekka Wachter , a GFP expert at Arizona State University .
“ The ability to carry out systematic , atom - by - atom chemical modifications anywhere in the protein scaffold is highly significant , as the semisynthetic approach eliminates the necessity to evolve complex enzyme systems to achieve similar goals . ”
PHILIPPINE ARMED forces trying to free Irish missionary Michael Sinnott have asked the country ’s largest Muslim rebel group , the Moro Islamic Liberation Front ( MILF ) , for their help to free the 78 - year - old priest .
Hundreds of troops have sealed off the area in the southern region of Mindanao where gunmen believed to be pirates are holding Fr Sinnott .
Fighting in the southern Philippines , where Muslims have fought a separatist uprising for years in what is a predominantly Catholic nation , has killed thousands and displaced more than half a million people .
The Columban priest was abducted at gunpoint from his home in Pagadian City on Sunday .
Witnesses said the priest was bundled into a mini-van and later dragged to a boat .
“ We ’re trying to seal off the area where the priest was last seen over the last 24 hours , ” Maj - Gen Ben Dolorfino , western Mindanao commander , said .
Troops were trying to prevent the kidnappers from moving the priest to another location , he added .
It is looking increasingly likely that Fr Sinnott was abducted by a gang of pirates looking for a ransom , rather than a group allied to MILF or to the al - Qaeda - funded Abu Sayyaf .
A local pirate helped the kidnap group bring Fr Sinnott across southwestern Mindinao .
Guingona Samal , also known as Commander Inggo , took Fr Sinnott across Ilana Bay .
Maj - Gen Dolorfino said he believed Mr Samal was an accomplice rather than the mastermind of the operation .
“ His water craft was used because he owns the most powerful water craft in the area , ” said the major - general .
“ We have a complicated situation on the ground .
These areas are heavily infected by the MILF and we do n’t want to start any fight .
So , we informed the MILF about the kidnapping and asked them to help free the hostage , ” he added .
Although the army and MILF have fought pitched battles in recent years in which hundreds have died , it now appears they are co-operating to try and release the Wexford - born cleric .
It looks possible that the kidnappers could be Muslim rebels who disobeyed a guerrilla edict prohibiting ransom kidnappings and other acts of banditry .
Fr Sinnott is believed to be near Sultan Naga Dimaporo township , where Moro guerrillas keep a heavy presence , he said .
Getting the rebels to co-operate will ensure the safety of Fr Sinnott and avoid accidental clashes between them and troops , said Maj - Gen Dolorfino .
Mohaqher Iqbal , a senior leader of the 11,000 - strong MILF and head of the rebels ’ peace negotiating panel , mobilised his forces to pinpoint the exact location of the priest .
“ We ’re ready to help the government recover the priest , ” Mr Iqbal said .
Fr Angel Calvo , president of a group called Peace Advocates Zamboanga , called for Fr Sinnott ’s release in a public statement run widely in the Filipino media .
“ The value of Fr Sinnott ’s life and work is beyond any ransom price .
For its despicable and unspeakable evil and barbarity do we strongly condemn this kidnapping of a holy man , ” he wrote .
The military is now focusing on stopping the kidnappers handing over Fr Sinnott to the Abu Sayyaf extremist group .
This 400 - strong terror outfit has been blamed for deadly bombings , beheadings and kidnappings of foreigners , including priests .
BISHOP Colm O’Reilly , chairman of the Irish Catholic Bishops ’ Commision for Missions , yesterday pleaded “ with those who have influence to expedite the release of this true servant of the people ” .
Fr Sinnott , he said , had “ dedicated his pastoral work to supporting the most vulnerable ” and he commended the priest ’s “ courage and generosity in returning to active missionary service following major surgery ” .
Bishop O’Reilly also appealed for the release of Goal volunteers Sharon Commins and Hilda Kawuki , who were kidnapped in Sudan last July .
It sounds like the best job in journalism , provided you can be bothered to turn up for work : a Denver newspaper is advertising for a marijuana critic to review Colorado 's hundreds of legalised cannabis dispensaries and their products .
The appointment of the nation 's first professional " pot correspondent " comes amid progress towards ending prohibition of the drug .
This week , the White House told federal prosecutors to stop pursuing certain users and vendors in the 14 states where it is permitted for medical reasons .
More than 120 applications for the job have already been received by Westword , a weekly newspaper with a circulation of 100,000 owned by the prestigious Village Voice group .
Whoever eventually gets the job will be paid to write a weekly column entitled " Mile Highs and Lows " .

The reviewer will be expected to rate the service , and ambience in the outlets that he or she reviews , said Tone .
They are also required to help readers negotiate the often bewildering variety of marijuana products on sale .
There will certainly be demand for an impartial guide to medical marijuana stores .
Thousands have sprung up across America in recent years , but they vary wildly .
Some are run-down operations ; others are comfortable , cafe - style venues where customers can buy food and drink , and enjoy acupuncture and massage .
Most offer dozens of " brands " of cannabis of varying strengths and intensities , with names like White Widow and Afghan Gold Seal , displayed in jars , like in an old - fashioned sweet shop .
They sell for around $ 130 ( £ 80 ) an ounce , but the quality can vary dramatically .
Despite a softening in public attitudes towards marijuana , law governing the drug remains riddled with inconsistencies .
In the 14 mostly liberal states where medicinal use has been " legalised " , federal law still forbids cultivating , selling and using the drug .
This week , however , President Obama 's Attorney General , Eric Holder , announced : " It will not be a priority to use federal resources to prosecute patients with serious illnesses or their caregivers who are complying with state laws on medical marijuana . "
After complaints about American dominance of the internet and growing disquiet in some parts of the world , Washington has said it will relinquish some control over the way the network is run and allow foreign governments more of a say in the future of the system .
Icann – the official body that ultimately controls the development of the internet thanks to its oversight of web addresses such as .com , .net and .org – said today that it was ending its agreement with the US government .
The deal , part of a contract negotiated with the US department of commerce , effectively pushes California - based Icann towards a new status as an international body with greater representation from companies and governments around the globe .
Icann had previously been operating under the auspices of the American government , which had control of the net thanks to its initial role in developing the underlying technologies used for connecting computers together .
But the fresh focus will give other countries a more prominent role in determining what takes place online , and even the way in which it happens – opening the door for a virtual United Nations , where many officials gather to discuss potential changes to the internet .
Icann chief Rod Beckstrom , a former Silicon Valley entrepreneur and Washington insider who took over running the organisation in July , said there had been legitimate concerns that some countries were developing alternative internets as a way of routing around American control .
" It 's rumoured that there are multiple experiments going on with countries forking the internet , various countries have discussed this , " he said .
" This is a very significant shift because it takes the wind out of our opponents . "
He added that the changes would prove powerful when combined with upcoming plans to allow web users to use addresses with names in Chinese , Arabic or other alphabets other than Latin .
Many countries have lobbied for the shift in recent years , as the expansion of the web reaches out deeper into society and business .
While the issue reached critical mass in emerging economies such as China , it is not the only country that has lobbied for a change .
Earlier this year European officials said that they did not think it was proper for America to retain so much control over the global computer network .
Viviane Reding , the EU 's commissioner for information society and media , said she was pleased that Washington chose to make the shift .
" I welcome the US administration 's decision to adapt Icann 's key role in internet governance to the reality of the 21st century , " she said .
" If effectively and transparently implemented , this reform can find broad acceptance among civil society , businesses and governments alike . "
Meanwhile Nominet - the British organisation that handles the day - to - day running of .uk domain names - said that Icann had started a trend for companies with internet influence to appear more open and accountable .
" Putting public interest first will also be a focus for the UK internet community over the coming months as there is growing support for Nominet to develop more of a public interest role , " said Nominet 's chief executive , Lesley Cowley .
The new agreement comes into force immediately .
It replaces the old version which had been in place since 1998 and was scheduled to expire today .
Beckstrom suggested that bringing more countries to the table was the best way of ensuring the long term future of the internet .
" We 're more global , period .
The chances of the internet holding together just went up , the cohesion just went up , " he said .
" We expect more active involvement from governments , a higher level of participation from many governments and we 're already hearing about more governments joining the team …
This was , ironically , a power move from the US . "
Challenger Kevin Andrews has threatened to delay a vote on the Government 's emissions trading scheme if he unseats Malcolm Turnbull in a possible Liberal leadership spill this afternoon .
Mr Turnbull has put his leadership on the line by calling a party room meeting for 1 pm AEDT to decide on whether or not there will be a leadership spill .
Mr Andrews has confirmed he will run if a spill is called after the initial show of hands in the party room .
But Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey say they will not stand against Mr Turnbull .
Speaking at Parliament House this lunchtime , Mr Andrews said he was offering to stand because he did not believe that Mr Turnbull 's decision to back the Government on emissions trading represented the views of the majority of Liberal Party members .
Mr Andrews said he would refuse to back the emissions scheme in the Senate this week if he was elected .
" The reason I 'm doing this is because I believe that the decision , or the reported decision that was taken yesterday did not reflect the views of the majority of Liberal Party members throughout Australia about this issue .
" [ The ETS scheme would ] make the GST pale into insignificance in terms of its impost on the nation . "
He said he would withdraw support for the emissions trading scheme if elected as leader , and would seek to send the legislation back to a Senate committee for more scrutiny .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has said he wants the legislation passed by the end of the week before parliament rises for the Christmas break .
Mr Andrews denied suggestions he was not a legitimate leadership candidate .
" I would n't be standing here if I did n't want the job , " he said .
And he said he was " quite sceptical " on whether humans were causing climate change .
" The jury is still out . "
The ABC has confirmed that three senators who have previously spoken out against supporting the ETS have offered their resignations from the frontbench - Mitch Fifield , Brett Mason and Mathias Cormann .
Mr Andrews has held the Victorian seat of Menzies since 1991 .
He first rose to prominence in 1996 by sponsoring the private members bill to overturn Northern Territory legislation legalising euthanasia , and is a prominent member of the now - defunct conservative Christian Liberal faction , the Lyons Forum .
Mr Andrews has also been outspoken in his opposition to a number of birth control reforms as well as the use of human stem cells for research .
In the Howard Government he served as minister for ageing , before being appointed the minister for employment and workplace relations and finally immigration minister .
It was during his tenure as immigration minister that Mr Andrews came under fire for his handling of the Mohamed Haneef scandal .
He has also been criticised for his outspoken stance on Muslim immigration , recently being branded as racist for his claims Muslim immigrants were not assimilating into the community .
Mr Turnbull last night stamped his authority on the party by declaring it would support the Government 's revamped emissions trading scheme and vote for it this week .
This morning he reiterated his position that there was a clear majority from the party room endorsing his position and dismissed calls for a spill , saying there was no credible support for one .
The initial motion for a spill has been brought on by backbenchers Wilson Tuckey and Dennis Jensen , who were calling for a party room meeting tomorrow morning .
But a party room meeting to have a vote on Mr Tuckey 's motion today was later confirmed by Mr Turnbull 's office .
Mr Turnbull 's earlier refusal to agree to hold the meeting prompted accusations from Mr Tuckey he was running from a ballot .
" I know now that Malcolm Turnbull has dodged the spill he said we should call , " Mr Tuckey told ABC 2 .
" Yes , I 'm destabilising the Opposition leadership - quite deliberately - but during proper process .
Yes , it 'll shut me up if the party endorses him , but if he does n't front , it wo n't shut me up .
Mr Tuckey says Mr Turnbull 's leadership must be tested with a vote and he believes the numbers in the party room yesterday were clearly against the scheme .
" I 've never , ever , seen the day when the leader would question whether we 're going to have a meeting as called , " he said .
" He believes that he 's been elected and nobody else 's opinion matters
" In my opinion he will continue to drag us to a position where we 'll be lucky to return to this place with 10 or 12 seats and he wo n't be one of them . "
Mr Jensen has accused Mr Turnbull of " ripping our party apart " and says there is more support within the party for a spill than just him and Mr Tuckey .
" This is something that happened as a result of the behaviour of Malcolm last night , " he said .
Mr Turnbull has refused to spell out how many spoke for and against the scheme but Dr Jensen says the numbers who spoke against were " well over 40 " .
Meanwhile , another backbencher Peter Slipper has likened Mr Turnbull to Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe .
" Look , the result of the party meeting as declared by the leader last night was about as dodgy as a Zimbabwean election organised by Robert Mugabe , " he said .
But senior shadow cabinet members have rallied around Mr Turnbull this morning , scoffing at suggestions there are any serious challengers who could topple Mr Turnbull .
" If a meeting arises Malcolm will secure the numbers comfortably , " climate change spokesman Ian Macfarlane said .
The Family 's Response to Critics
Do you come across a lot of negative reactions being such a large family ?
Michelle Duggar : Typically when we 're out as a group , there 's probably more positive response , just the children seem to get along well and move about easily .
For the most part , people are like , " Wow , your kids are really well behaved ! "
That 's quite amazing for today 's day and time .
But , there 's always those other ideas and thinking , of overpopulation or whatever .
Everybody 's entitled to their opinion .
But , some may get very offended by the whole idea of having a large family .
There 's just different concepts and views on how life really is .
What do you say to those critics ?
Jim Bob Duggar :
As far as like overpopulation , I mean , there 's really a myth of overpopulation .
The whole world 's population could fit into the city limits of Jacksonville , Florida .
Michelle Duggar : Shoulder to shoulder .
Jim Bob Duggar : Yeah , and have room to spare .
Michelle Duggar :
So , it 's not like that 's a real issue .
The issues of food being available in certain places or seeing poverty and different things like that , there 's different issues that maybe are spurring that on .
But , in reality , every family has to do what they feel they 're called to do .
We 're not out there telling people this is the way everybody else needs to live , because by all means , this is not for everyone .
God would n't give everybody 19 children .
That 's just not the way it 's gonna happen , and maybe one or two is the number for someone else , or maybe God does n't allow any children in a family .
And then , others may choose , to adopt or have ministry with children in other ways .
That 's what makes the world go around .
We 're willing to realize that and be open that there 's a different calling for different people .
We 're not about to judge anybody and tell them what they ought to do .
That same kindness can be extended both directions .
Back when Discovery wanted to do a documentary with our family , we were the first ones to say we are not a perfect family .
We feel so inadequate .
We 're still learning every day .
We 're not finished raising our family .
And yet , as we prayed about it , we really felt like there have been many people , many families , many others that have shared things with us that have encouraged us along the way .
And if we can share anything like that with somebody else that will help them to look at life from a brighter side and realize these children really are a blessing and a gift from God and I 'm really thankful for them , then we'd be willing to let the cameras come and film our imperfect family , as long as they did n't edit out our faith because the faith was the core of our life .
The Bible is the owner 's manual for life and in it are contained all the answers to life 's questions .
Jim Bob Duggar :
All the time , we 're running into families or different individuals that come up and say , " I was one of 10 children " or 12 children or 15 children .
And of course , they 're from the older generation .
It 's just amazing how many people are from large families .
But , a lot of it's the older generation .
Up until 50 years ago , almost all the families were six to 12 children .
This is a new thing the last 50 years with birth control and other ways to stop conception and abortion and everything taking place that family sizes have shrank .
For a lot of countries , this is really causing a problem with their economic situation .
Matter of fact , we 've had like reporters from all these different countries come over and saying they 're having a crisis in their country because their people are not reproducing .
Michelle Duggar :
They do n't have people who are marrying age for people , and so they 're having to go to other countries to find spouses .
And typically , it 's mostly females .
They do n't have enough females .
We were shocked because we had television crews coming from other places asking to show with our family in hopes that they could encourage the birth rate to go up .
They 've already done incentives like giving them $ 4,000 per birth , giving them a refrigerator .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Here 's a Black Friday reality check :
Of the hordes of pre-dawn shoppers who line up for hours outside stores on the day after Thanksgiving , most will not bag the best bargains that appear in merchants ' circulars .
Look at the fine print that appears next to an advertised " doorbuster deal " at the bottom of the page in this year 's circulars .
It will either say " While supplies last , " " Minimum 2 per store , " " No rainchecks " or " All items are available in limited quantities . "
A quick scan through a few of this year 's Black Friday circulars show quantities as low as a " minimum of 5 per store " on some models of large plasma and HDTVs and popular brands of home appliances such as a washer - dryer pair .
Should Black Friday deal hunters feel cheated ?
Yes they should , say some retail experts .
" It 's a sleazy practice , " said Craig Johnson , retailing expert and president of retail consulting group Customer Growth Partners .
" I am old school , " said Johnson .
" If a retailer is advertising a juicy deal and they are not prepared to have in sufficient quantity , do n't advertise it .
Or give consumers a raincheck . "
Johnson said it 's not enough for retailers to mention that they 'll have such limited quantities of a product on one of the most - hyped shopping days of the year .
" Retailers are n't winning any customers .
They are just pissing off people , " he said .
" It 's poor retailing practice . "
Unfortunately for consumers , more examples abound .
CNNMoney.com spoke to industry experts to uncover a few dirty secrets of Black Friday deals .
Limited quantities .
Advertising a Black Friday deal as " limited quantities " is bogus , said Johnson .
" The only time it makes sense to have only two or three [ items ] in stock is if the deal is on a $ 2 million gift product that appears in the Neiman Marcus holiday catalog , " he said .
Edgar Dworsky , a consumer advocate and editor of Consumer World , agreed with Johnson .
" C'mon guys .
Give me a break , " said Dworsky .
" How can you be the size of a retailer like Sears and only get a minimum of five per store , yet devote big space in your circular to advertise that deal ?
Sears ( SHLD , Fortune 500 ) has not officially revealed its Black Friday sales .
However , the company confirmed to CNNMoney.com that two of its post - Thanksgiving deals include a Samsung 40 - inch 1080 p LCD HDTV for $ 599.99 , " Only while quantities last , minimum three per store , no rainchecks . "
The other is a Kenmore 3.5 - cubic - foot high - efficiency washer and 5.8 - cubic foot dryer pair for $ 579.98 , " Limit four per store , no rainchecks . "
" Sure , you probably have more , but how do you put out a circular to millions of households and only have three ? , " Dworsky asked .
When asked for a comment , Sears spokesman Tom Aiello said he was " not comfortable " addressing the issue of limited quantities for some Black Friday deals .
Such short supply on deals are not only annoying but can also be dangerous to Black Friday shoppers .
" We saw the stampede at a Wal - Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) store in New York last year on Black Friday that led to an employee 's death , " said Burt Flickinger , managing director of consulting firm Strategic Resource Group .
" The stampede happened because so many of the deals were advertised as limited supply . "
One retailer , while not explaining why its advertised deals are in such limited supplies , said it is taking measures to better handle the Black Friday rush .
" From going down the line and handing out doorbuster tickets that guarantee a purchase in advance of the store opening , to printing the minimum quantities in the circular , we go to great lengths to ensure that the Black Friday consumer knows exactly how many items will be at the store and whether or not they will be able to purchase one prior to entering the store , " Best Buy ( BBY , Fortune 500 ) wrote in an e-mail .
What do you mean this HDTV is a " derivative ? "
Some of the holiday electronics with those low sale prices are derivatives , models that have a few less features than a standard model in that product line , said Dworsky .
The difference can be subtle .
" The image contrast ratio might be 20,000 in a derivative model versus 30,000 in a standard model , " he said .
" Most consumers probably wo n't even notice the difference . "
A report earlier this month in Consumer Reports called attention to HDTV models from Samsung and Sony advertised in Black Friday deals that appear to be " derivatives . "
The report said these one - off TVs " with unfamiliar model numbers " are usually cheaper than the standard model in their class .
Dworsky cautions that retailers usually do n't advertise these models as derivatives .
" There 's no way the average consumer will know that the TV model they are buying is not the standard one unless they are savvy enough to compare their model numbers , " he said .
Which Black Friday deals are online ?
" Many retailers will say that their Black Friday deals are available online , " said Dworsky .
" But they 're not nice enough to tell you which ones . "
" How about telling me which exact ones so I can shop online from home and I 'm not in my pajamas at 5 a .m. in front of your store , " he said .
Online deals that never get shipped .
Case in point : Sears .
Last year , one of Sears ' hottest Black Friday doorbuster deal was on a Kenmore washer - dryer pair for $ 600 .
Even though the retailer advertised that deal to be in " limited quantities , " the company decided to honor every customer order made on that deal last Black Friday .
Big mistake .
The manufacturer could not ramp up production fast enough .
Some customers waited months before their order was shipped .
Others were sold a substitute model , that was " comparable or even better " for the same deal price , said Sears ' Aiello .
Lesson learned .
" We will not be doing that again this year , " he said .
Be careful if you 're shopping online on Black Friday , said Dworsky .
" Since retailers do n't have a live inventory online you run the risk of getting an e-mail weeks later that your order had been delayed or worse , cancelled , because the product is out of stock , " he said .
About those rainchecks .
Finally , if a retailer does offer you a raincheck on a deal , it could still turn out to be an empty promise , Flickinger warned .
" A raincheck does n't guarantee that you will eventually get that elusive Black Friday deal , " he said .
" Consumers can go weeks waiting and hoping , and the retailer may never get more of the product shipped to its stores . "
An elderly Sikh who describes Islam as a " beast " and once provided a character reference for Nick Griffin during his racial hatred trial is set to become the British National Party 's first non-white member .
Rajinder Singh , an anti-Islam activist in his late seventies who blames Muslims for the death of his father during the Partition of India in 1947 , has been sympathetic towards Britain 's far - right party for much of the past decade even though he currently remains barred from becoming a member because of the colour of his skin .
But last weekend the BNP 's leadership took their first steps towards dropping its membership ban on non-whites after the Human Rights Commission threatened the party with legal action .
The move will be put to a vote of members soon .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Martin Wingfield , the BNP 's communications and campaigns officer , has already put forward the case for Mr Singh 's membership , telling members on its website : " I say adapt and survive and give the brave and loyal Rajinder Singh the honour of becoming the first ethnic minority member of the BNP . "
A BNP spokesman said last night : " He is perhaps the kind of immigrant you want if you are going to have them . "
Mr Singh , a former teacher from Wellingborough , Northamptonshire , says he would be " honoured " to become a card - carrying member of the BNP .
Explaining his motives , Mr Singh said : " I am a retired teacher , living a quiet life .
I got in touch with the BNP on certain core policies that appeal to me .
I also admire them since they are on their own patch , and do not wish to let anyone else oust them from the land of their ancestors . "
Mr Singh and another Sikh from Slough who goes by the pseudonym Ammo Singh have previously co-operated with the BNP and have been used by the party 's leadership to try to woo Asian supporters , particularly Hindus and Sikhs living in areas where tensions with Muslims run high .
The party has had little success , however , with all mainstream Sikh and Hindu groups widely condemning the BNP .
But Rajinder Singh and Ammo Singh – who keeps his identity secret but is thought to be an accountant in his late thirties – have answered Mr Griffin 's call , thanks to the BNP 's staunchly anti-Islamic rhetoric since September 11 .
In December 2001 , Ammo Singh claimed he had helped the BNP distribute thousands of anti-Islamic leaflets in Southall , west London , but recently he has kept a low profile .
Rajinder Singh , on the other hand , has begun to appear in BNP literature more frequently , writing for the party 's newspaper , Freedom , and appearing on the internet television channel , BNPTV .
His intense dislike of Islam appears to stem back to his father 's death during the Partition of India , which led to the deaths of an estimated two million Sikhs , Muslims and Hindus .
" I come from partitioned Punjab that saw a lot of bloodshed in 1947 , " he said .
" Anyone escaping that genocide would pray to God , [ say ] never again and vote for BNP . "
Mainstream
Sikh groups said they were appalled .
Dr Indarjit Singh , director of the Network of Sikh Organisations , said : " Sikhism stresses equality for all human beings .
Therefore Sikhs who are true to their faith , will having nothing whatsoever to do with any party that favours any one section of the community . "

Can a virtual cancer help design better
treatments ?
[ Image NCI ]
Cancer is one of the major causes of death in the world ( particularly the developed world ) , with around 11 million people diagnosed and around 7 million people dying each year .
The World Health Organisation predicts that current trends show around 9 million will die in 2015 , with the number rising to 11.5 million in 2030 .
Cancer is the focus of much medical research , but perhaps surprisingly , mathematical research is also playing its part .
Mathematician Mark Chaplain and an interdisciplinary team at the University of Dundee , have been awarded 1.7 million euros to develop a virtual model of cancer growth and spread .
A tumour initially starts when a DNA failure leads to uncontrolled division of a cell , with the growing tumour absorbing nutrients and expelling waste through its surface .
However the requirements of a tumour depends on its volume — that is , its width to the power of three — while the amount that can be transported through its surface depends on surface area — that is , its width squared .
So once the tumour grows over a certain size these requirements can no longer be met , leading some tumours to become a more dangerous , invasive form of cancer .
Cells on the surface of the tumour release chemicals to degrade surrounding tissue to encourage movement of cancer cells , and securing a blood supply to the tumour .
Mathematics is already used to study tumour growth , the pre-invasive stage is fairly well modelled mathematically .
In contrast , Chaplain and his team want to create a complete model of a tumour .
Such a model will have to operate on many levels : on the subcellular ( such as gene expression and cell division ) ; the cellular ( such as the location and interactions of cells ) ; and the macrosopic level ( such as the transport of nutrients and changes to surrounding tissue ) .
The aim of the project is to produce a virtual cancer — a mathematical model that can be used to design treatments for individual patients .
" One of the big challenges in addressing cancer treatment is that you can have two patients with the same kind of tumour in the same area of the body , but they will react to it completely differently , " said Chaplain .
" The factors which contribute to the creation and growth of cancerous cells can all be measured — most biological processes in the human body involve many different but interconnected phenomena to which mathematical values can be applied . "
Such a virtual cancer would be a hybrid of two types of mathematical models .
The discrete part of the model would examine each cancer cell as a free particle in space , interacting with other cells and the local environment .
For each of the tumour cells at a particular time , the model would include information on its position , its rate of cell division ( which changes either due to an internal genetic messages , or from external growth factors released as the surrounding tissue degrades ) , and its movement ( affected by chemical stimulus , adhesive attraction to nearby cancer cells , and proximity to empty space ) .
The continuous part of the model would involve a system of reaction - diffusion equations modelling changes in concentration of chemicals released by tumour cells and surrounding tissue , and the resultant changes to the tissue and the tumour .
( You can read more about reaction - diffusion equations in the Plus article How the leopard got its spots . )
Chaplain said : " By using cutting - edge applied and computational mathematical techniques to track the many factors involved in cancer growth and spread we can develop a virtual model of how cancers can be expected to grow , which would give clinicians another valuable tool in diagnosing and treating individual patients . "

Coq and Types
I once asked a fellow summer school - participant if he used the Coq theorem prover .
He replied that his professor discouraged him to do so since he thought it was completely incomprehensible due to all the types .

What the rings would look like from different cities and latitudes accross the world .
It 's interesting to imagine how it would effect culture throughout time .
It would have influenced religion , mythology , navigation , etc ..
Personally , I think the blue hue of earth 's atmosphere would partly be reflected in the rings .
In the artists conception of what they would look like from space , they look exactly like they look on the frozen desert of Saturn .
Correct me if I 'm wrong .

Over the years , I ’ve had the opportunity to work with “ Viral Marketing Scientist ” Dan Zarrella on special projects related to Twitter .
His focus on social science and psychology as it relates to new media and online interaction and behavior is in line with my philosophy and approach to understanding and documenting socialized media .
Zarrella recently debuted TweetPsych , a sophisticated system that uses two linguistic analysis algorithms ( RID and LIWC ) to build a psychological profile of a person based on the content of their tweets .
He also adapted the service to analyze a site URL and the content on that page to create a list of the 50 Twitter users who ’s profiles are psychologically aligned with the site you provided .
It ’s a fascinating service for those actively seeking to expand their contextual networks .
One of the most actively discussed aspects of Twitter is the art and science of retweets .
Retweets , in my opinion , are one of the most sincere forms of recognition and validation , empowering users to pay it forward through the recognition of noteworthy content .
According to Dan , retweets also serve as the foundation for assessing the qualities of viral content , “ You do n’t spread ideas just because they are “ good ; ” you spread them because of some other trigger or set of triggers has been pulled in your brain .
We can now compare millions of viral ideas to uncover the building blocks of contagiousness . ”
Aside from my very simple advice to leave room in your tweets for people to add RT and their username , “ 120 is the new 140 ” and to also tweet something worth retweeting , Zarrella studied the science of retweets over a period of nine months to discern the attributes and characteristics of tweets that spawned memes and those that did n’t .
His sampling group was not insignificant either .
He analyzed roughly five million tweets and 40 million retweets to discover the art and science of getting retweeted .
He published the results in a 22 - page report , which you can download here .
Zarrella ’s initial finding estimated that 1.44 % of all tweets are ReTweets .
From there , he recognized other important common traits for successfully getting retweeted .
Links are the Currency of Twitter
According to Zarrella , links were three times more prevalent in RTs over normal tweets , 19 % to 57 % .
The study also found that the URL shortener used also had an effect on the potential resonance of tweets .
For example , bit.ly , ow.ly , and is.gd , were much likelier to get retweeted than older , longer services , such as TinyURL .
Choosing Words Carefully
Pandering or soliciting for retweets might seem tacky , but asking politely for a retweet actually works according to the research .
The top 20 retweetable words and phrases include :
1. You
2. Twitter
3. Please
4. Retweet
5. Post
6. Blog
7. Social
8. Free
9. Media ( note , most likely tied to social media , which demonstrates the interest in related tweets and links )

11 . Please Retweet ( personally i’ve found that adding “ please share ” or “ pls share ” to the tweet helps as well )

Chatter is n’t Worth Sharing
As I ’ve shared numerous times , literally answering Twitter ’s question of “ What are you doing ” engenders uninteresting tweets .
The research found that verbs ending in “ ing ” were among the least retweetable words .
Although , I ’ve personally found in my research that “ reading , ” “ reviewing , ” and “ looking ” trigger significant activity .
People generally want to know what has your attention at the moment and if they can look at something through your eyes , it helps spark retweets and clickthroughs .
The least retweetable words :
1. Game
2. Going
3 . Haha
4. lol
5 . But
6. Watching
7. Work
8. Home
9 . Night
10 . Bed
11 . Well
12 . Sleep
13 . Gonna
14 . Hey
15 . Tomorrow
16 . Tired
17 . Some
18 . Back
19 . Bored
20 . Listening
Do n’t take intelligence for granted
While many suspect that simple language is preferred , retweets contained an average of 1.62 syllables per word with normal tweets boasting an average of 1.58 syllables per word .
It may seem insignificant , but per a Flesch - Kincaid test , comprehending RTs required 6.47 years of education , while normal tweets require just 6.04 .
The Novelty of Novelty
One of the most interesting aspects of viral content is its freshness , insinuating that the newness of the content was a significant factor in RTs .
For example , Zarrella created a measure of novelty by counting how many times each word in his sample sets occurred .
In random tweets , each word was found an average of 89.19 times , while in the ReTweet sample each word was only found 16.37 other times .
It ’s Not Just a Figure of Speech
The analysis of words indicated that nouns and third - person singular present words led to the proliferation of headline style tweets that triggered retweets .
The pervasiveness of verbs and proper nouns were also factors .
To observe this activity , Zarrella used Part of Speech ( POS ) tagging , an analysis technique in which an algorithm is used to label each word in a piece of content as a specific part - of - speech–noun , verb , adjective , etc .
The Power of Punctuation
The power of punctuation is n’t necessarily relegated to grammar or sentence structure .
The use of punctuation could also represent the difference between a tweet and a retweet .
85.86 % of normal tweets contained some form of punctuation compared to 97.55 % in retweets with colons leading the way .
Of the most common punctuation types found in retweets , colons , periods , exlamation points , commas , and hyphens led group with semicolons ranking last .
In fact , Zarrella observed that the semicolon appears to be the “ only unretweetable punctuation mark . ”
What ’s interesting however , is that the question mark ranked second - to - last .
I would have guessed that questions would have been more prominent in RTs , but after further thought , I would imagine the any tweet containing a question would trigger more answers than the RT of the original question .
There is no “ I ” in ReTweet or Tweet
LIWC measures the cognitive and emotional properties of people based on the words they use .
Applying this lexicon to tweets and retweets , LIWC analysis shows that Tweets about work , religion , money and media / celebrities are significantly more retweetable than tweets with negative emotions , sensations ,
swear words and self - reference .
The Attention Aperture : Time and Day Count for Everything
I have also studied the time / day significance applied to what I call the attention aperture ( the state of attention and its ability to be captured ) .
I believe that the results vary depending on the nature of the content , specific to whether or not the nature of the Tweet was professional or personal in nature .
Among the most usable findings from Zarrella ’s study is the analysis of when individuals appear to be more susceptible to retweeting .
According to the research , the window for retweets is at its widest between 2 p.m. to 11:59 p.m. ( however , I ’d like to know if time zone played a factor in RTs ) .
Match the time to the most active days for retweeting , in this case Thursday and Friday , and surely , we have identified the attention aperture for RTs .
In my research , I found that educational , news - focused , or work - related tweets found its greatest traction between 3 a.m. and 9 a.m. Pacific time .
I suspect that this range casts a wider net reaching professionals during work hours with the East Coast and Europe prompting RTs that bring it back to the attention of those on the West Coast as individuals prepare or arrive at work .
As such , I asked Dan to create a new graphic that visualizes days and times in a way that might be easier to reference .
This study was as fascinating as it was informative .
But I needed a personal touch to close close the chapter and remind us that there are real people behind the data and the tweets that were analyzed .
I asked Dan to share what he learned from his research , and he readily obliged , “ My favorite takeaway from the data is that while having more followers definitely makes it easier to get more ReTweets , even if you do n’t have tens of thousands , the data shows that if your content is contagious enough , it will spread just as far .
I think this also has to do with the hyper - connected , seven degrees nature of the Twitter network . ”
In the end , as publishers , it is our responsibility to ensure that our Tweets not only speak for themselves , but also represent our purpose , mission , and values .
While this data suggests that the mechanics for posting viral tweets is a matter of formula , I believe that affinity , respect , and stature also play prominent roles in the art and science of retweeting .
Concurrently it is also our obligation to also retweet as a form of giving back to the community , recognizing those who actively contribute to a more meaning Twitterverse .

Marsh Ray has published a new attack on the TLS renegotiation logic .
The high level impact of the attack is that an attacker can arrange to inject traffic into a legitimate client - server exchange such that the TLS server will accept it as if it came from the client .
This may allow the attacker to execute operations on the server using the client 's credentials ( e.g. , order a pizza as the client ) .
However , the attacker does not ( generally ) get to see the response .
Obviously this is n't good , but it 's not the end of the world .
More details below .
TLS Details
The attack exploits TLS 's renegotiation feature , which allows a client and server who already have a TLS connection to negotiate new parameters , generate new keys , etc .
Renegotiation is carried out in the existing TLS connection , with the new handshake packets being encrypted along with application packets .
The difficulty is that they 're not otherwise tied to the channel , which gives the attacker a window .
The simplest form of the attack is shown below [ cribbed from draft - rescorla - tls- renegotiate.txt ]
Client Attacker Server ------
-------
------ <======= Initial Traffic ======== >
<========================
Client Traffic ==========================>
So , in order to mount the attack , the attacker first connects to the TLS server .
He can communicate with the server as much as he wants , including making an arbitrary number of requests / responses , etc .
This traffic is all encrypted and shown as == .
Then when he 's ready , he hijacks the client 's connection to the server ( in practice he might start by hijacking the connection and then connect to the server but it does n't matter ) and just proxies the client 's traffic over the encrypted channel .
The client negotiates with the server and from that point on the client and the server communicate directly .
Note that the client is communicating with the attacker in the clear but the second handshake is encrypted and goes over the attacker 's channel .
Thus , the client does not know that he is renegotiating .
However , the server thinks that the initial traffic with the attacker is also from the client .
There are also other ( probably less useful ) variants where both sides see a renegotiation but of different connections .
Impact on Existing Applications
TLS itself is just a security protocol , so the impact of this attack depends on the application protocol running over TLS .
The most important of these protocols is of course HTTP over TLS ( HTTPS ) .
Most Web applications do initial authentication via a username / password pair and then persist that authentication state with HTTP cookies ( a secret token that is sent with any request ) .
An attacker might exploit this issue by sending a partial HTTP request of his own that requested some resource .
This then gets prefixed to the client 's real request .
E.g. , the attacker would send :
GET /pizza?toppings=pepperoni;address=attackersaddress HTTP/1.1 X - Ignore - This :
And leave the last line empty without a carriage return line feed .
Then when the client makes his own request
GET /pizza?toppings=sausage;address=victimssaddress HTTP/1.1 Cookie : victimscookie
the two requests get glued together into :
GET /pizza?toppings=pepperoni;address=attackersaddress HTTP/1.1 X - Ignore - This : GET / pizza?toppings=sausage;address=victimssaddress HTTP/1.1 Cookie : victimscookie
And the server uses the victim 's account to send a pizza to the attacker .
You can mount a similar attack if the server uses certificate - based client authentication : it 's common ( well , common in the small number of cases where client certs are used at all ) for the server to let the client connect and request a resource and then if the resource is protected renegotiate asking for a certificate .
The attacker can exploit this by doing the initial handshake and asking for the resource and then letting the client do the renegotiation , at which point the server acts as if the initial request was made by the client .
It 's important to note that in both the cases we just described the attacker does n't get to see any sensitive information directly : that 's just sent back encrypted to the client .
However , he can exploit side effects of the exchange , e.g. , to get a pizza .
It may also be possible to exploit HTTP features to directly access the data .
For instance , he might be able to generate a combined request that would cause the server ( or perhaps somehow mirrored through the client ) to send the original client request to the attacker .
If the request contains the client 's cookie or password , this would cause their credentials to leak .
It 's not clear to me if this is possible , but I 'm hoping some of the Web security specialists will weigh in .
The impact on other protocols ( IMAP , SIP , etc. ) would depend on those protocols and I have n't seen complete analyses of these yet .
Mitigations
Eventually there will be a TLS level protocol fix ( see below ) .
However , in the meantime options are limited .
For 99 + % of applications , the mitigation is very simple : the server should simply disable all renegotiation , which stops the attack .
( OpenSSL will helpfully automatically renegotiate which facilitates the attack even if the application is n't otherwise set up to do renegotiation ) .
Unfortunately , there is no similar defense on the client side .
In the example I showed above , the client is unaware that renegotiation happened .
Moreover , the client can't tell that the server will refuse renegotiation ( it could explicitly probe but the attacker could of course fake a failure ) .
So , the client can't really do anything useful to protect itself .
The second drawback is that there are a small number of cases ( e.g. , the certificate authentication one I described above ) where renegotiation actually should happen .
The most practical defense on the server side is to restructure the site so that requests which require client auth are redirected to a different address or port which always requests a certificate and itself refuses renegotiation .
However , this obviously requires major work on many sites .
There are a few other legitimate reasons for renegotiation , but they 're mostly things one does n't need to do .
For instance , people sometimes renegotiate to force the generation of fresh keying material .
This is not necessary with modern cryptographic algorithms .
Another example provided by Ray is sites that support algorithms with differential strength .
Again , this is n't really necessary .
Unless you 're doing certificate - based client authentication it 's very unlikely you need to renegotiate and if you are using it , the workaround above is the simplest .
Long - Term Defense
Despite the existence of some defenses , it seems clear that TLS should really defend against this .
There 's a fairly obvious defense that at least three people have independently come up with : carry information about handshake n- 1 in handshake n ( if n==1 you just carry an empty field ) .
This prevents attacks where the client and server have different views of the negotiation state .
The predisclosure group that worked on this after Ray discovered this worked to develop a draft describing this technique which can found at draft - rescorla - tls - renegotiate.
txt and we 'll be submitting it to the TLS working group shortly .
Of course , this will take a very long time to make it into enough clients and servers to make a real difference , so for now we 're mostly stuck with the mitigations I 've described .
The Software Situation
People have also developed patches for existing implementations .
These fall into two categories :
Just disable renegotiation ( really important for OpenSSL because of the aforementioned automatic renegotiation ) issue .
Implement the long - term fix .
As far as I know none of these have been formally released yet .
Ben Laurie 's OpenSSL disabling patch can be found here .
I 've developed a patch that performs the long - term fix protocol pieces but it does n't disable non-fixed renegotiation so it 's usable primarily for interop testing right now .
That can be found here .
Expect both of these to eventually appear in official OpenSSL distributions / patches .
I do n't know the release status of other fixes .
Big Picture Perspective
Now that we 've covered how this attack works , how bad is it ?
It 's being billed as a man - in - the - middle attack , but it 's really far more limited than your classic MITM .
Rather , it 's a plaintext injection attack .
I 'm not saying that 's good , but we need to put it into perspective : over the past two years , we have seen two separate issues that allow a complete TLS server impersonation : the Debian PRNG bug ( see our paper here for a description of the issue [ which we did not discover ] and its impact ) and the TLS certificate " NULL " issue .
Both of these issues had much more severe impact since they allowed the attacker access to all the data sent by the client .
However , it 's worth noting that they differed from this issue in that they were detectable / fixable on the client side so people could in principle protect themselves .
As a practical matter , however , most clients never checked the Debian keys against a blacklist , so that protection was minimal at best .
Second , it 's important to remember that even simple MITM attacks with fake certificates do n't seem that hard to mount .
Cranor et al. report that users very frequently ignore browser warnings of bad certificates , which more or less obviates any security protections TLS provides .
If the user will accept the attacker 's certificate , there 's no need to do anything as limited as the attack described here .
Obviously , that 's not information that should give you a huge amount of confidence in any form of Internet communications security , but it does provide some perspective on the marginal impact of this attack .
One other comparison point is a remote vulnerability in the server .
TLS implementations have historically had and continue to have remote vulnerabilities which would allow an attacker to subvert the server .
Such an attacker could read all your traffic to that server .
As with this issue , you can't really detect that from the client side and need to rely on the server being upgraded .
So , this issue is somewhat less serious than a remote vulnerability in a really popular server stack like OpenSSL .
It 's primarily unusual because it's an issue in the protocol not the software and those are quite rare .
Bottom Line
As I said at the beginning , this obviously is n't good .
We 'd like SSL / TLS to provide it 's nominal security guarantees and it clearly does n't .
There likely to be exploitable attack paths using this issue .
It 's far less clear whether they will actually see exploitation , given that these attacks are n't necessarily as powerful as other already known paths .
In the not too distant future you should expect most important servers to have fixed , at which point most of your Web server interactions will be safe ( even though you can't verify it easily ) .
In the long term , most clients and servers will adopt the protocol fix at which point clients will be able to be sure that the servers they are interacting with are safe .
Toronto's Reference Library will get $ 3 million from Ottawa toward its $ 34 million modernization and renovation , Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced Friday in Toronto .
The two - stage overhaul , starting soon and ending in March , 2011 , will create a new two - storey rotunda , a " spectacular entrance " and updated computer stations , Harper said .
Ajon Moriyama , the son of celebrated architect Raymond Moriyama who designed the building , will oversee the renovation to make sure it adheres to the original vision , Harper said .
Ajon Moriyama is a partner in his father 's firm .
The $ 3 million is Ottawa 's share of a $ 34 million library renovation project for which the city will contribute $ 14 million and the province $ 10 million .
The Toronto Public Library Foundation will raise the rest .
The money , said Toronto Mayor David Miller , is in addition to the federal stimulus money for Toronto announced last month .
The library , on Yonge St. north of Bloor St. , houses " one of the country 's most important reference collections , " Harper said , but it and the world had both changed greatly since he used the facility as a student in Toronto in 1977 .
The project will create local construction jobs " when they are most needed , " he said , and is part of Canada 's economic stimulus plan .
" The challenges of the global recession are great but greater has been our resolve as a country , " Harper said in thanking Miller and the library foundation for helping make the project a reality .
The project will " keep us in the forefront of library science , " Miller said at the news conference just before noon in toronto .
" An economy recovery may be on its way but we cannot and will not take it for granted . "

The Speech Obama Needs to Give
Note from the speech - writer :
In one illuminating sense , the future is a probability distribution .
Unfortunately , a host of not - so - nice futures are now more probable than others at this point .
Every species we eliminate ; every ton of fossil - carbon we release ; every gallon we pull from fossil aquifers ; every cubic meter of top soil washed to the sea lowers the probability of the more livable futures .
So trouble ’s a - comin ’ in what will likely be a many - act play headed downward over the next few decades -- it just remains to be seen what costume it ’ll be wearing in each scene .
At some point the general public may be told the truth about our predicament -- but maybe not .
I suspect the revealing of the truth would be a sort of last - resort for those in power to try to keep things together .
This speech is my take on “ telling the truth . ”
Setting for the speech : Several “ bad ” things have happened in the span of a year or two ( ex : sharp economic downturns , petroleum shortages , extended blackouts , acts of terrorism , flare - ups of civil unrest , storms or other natural disasters , etc. ) .
America is reeling , but the center is still holding -- for now .
A slightly drawn Obama sits down at his desk in the Oval Office … microphones on …the cameras roll …
Our Predicament
As I ’m sure all of you are painfully aware , the United States , along with the rest of the world , is in the midst of some of the most profound economic , environmental , and energy troubles ever experienced by modern civilization .
I understand the deep pain , anger , and confusion many of you are feeling at this moment , and I sympathize .
My goal tonight is to try to clarify our situation a bit , and in doing so , perhaps channel some of those feelings towards more constructive ends .
The economic , environmental , and energy problems we are currently experiencing are not ultimately the fault of any one person , political group , ethnic group , religious group , country , or region .
They go much deeper than that .
They are , instead , manifestations of the ongoing conflict -- a war really -- between a finite planet and a human species with infinite aspirations .
In such a war -- a war we are waging against our very life - support systems -- we have no hope of winning .
Our best hope is to , as quickly as possible , call off the war , regroup , and fundamentally restructure our society around the acceptance of our planet ’s finite nature – around limits .
My words here are , no doubt , striking to you .
These are not ideas commonly expressed in “ polite ” circles -- in the national print media , on television , in board rooms , in Congress , in addresses from the President .
They are revolutionary .
But they are true and they are necessary .
Let me use an analogy from my experience as a father .
As children grow towards adulthood , one of the most painful experiences – for both the child and the parent – is the child ’s slow realization and eventual acceptance of limits .
Such an embrace of limits is , in fact , one of the hallmarks of “ growing up . ”
My fellow Americans , we need to grow up .
Limits
We , as a species , are now bumping up against -- slamming into , really -- some very immutable biophysical limits on a global scale .
These limits and the mounting consequences for their continued violation have been predicted and well documented by our best scientists for many decades -- complete with dire warnings for the consequences of failing to change our course .
We have not heeded these warnings and we are now suffering the predicted consequences .
It is our own fault .
We have reached limits in two very real and dangerous senses .
Firstly , our voracious material wants have outstripped the Earth ’s physical limits -- hard limits on how much and how rapidly the Earth can provide us with material and energy resources to run our industrial lifestyles .
A partial list of these increasingly scarce resources includes fossil and nuclear energy sources , freshwater for drinking and irrigation , phosphate fertilizer , and various key metal ores .
Even theoretically renewable resources such as our ocean fisheries , fertile soil , and forest products are being destroyed by persistent abuse .
In short , we cannot have infinite wants on a finite planet .
These were childish wishes .
Secondly , the almost - unimaginable volumes of waste arising from our industrial activities have overwhelmed the Earth ’s waste - disposal systems .
The list of accumulating toxins is long and growing : greenhouse gases , PCBs , mercury and other heavy metals , radioactive waste , various endocrine disruptors , silt from eroded forests and farmland , excessive fertilizer , pesticides , and antibiotics from industrial factory farms in our estuaries and drinking water , as well as many others I could list .
Most notable among this shameful list are the greenhouse gases arising from our civilization ’s terminal addiction to fossil fuels .
These have accumulated in our atmosphere to such an extent that a potentially disastrous suite of climatic changes has already been initiated – changes that may ultimately endanger our very survival as a species .
We have fouled our nest .
Again , we are guilty of childish behavior – mindless , reckless , and irresponsible .
The End of Growth
Having recognized these limits , we are immediately challenged to renounce one of our most cherished beliefs as a civilization -- the idea of continuous material growth .
Perpetual growth in the economy ; in wealth ; in consumption ; in production , have been viewed for over a century as both desirable and possible .
Continued growth in all things material has , in fact , been the very lifeblood of our Industrial Civilization .
Socialist / Capitalist , First - world / Third - world , Democrat / Republican -- all have worshiped faithfully at the alter of material growth .
Eminent economists and others in the social sciences , heads of state , and religious leaders have sung its praises .
As recently as a year ago , I myself was guilty of promoting renewed economic growth as the solution to our current troubles .
Taking stock of our current national and global situations , we can now see that the quest for material growth beyond some level is both dangerous and impossible -- our scientists and feedback from the Earth itself have clearly shown us that .
We must now recognize this quest as a profoundly tragic mistake ; a blunder of monumental ignorance and hubris ; an infantile desire of our limited minds projected grotesquely and tragically onto the entire Earth .
Simply put , the ideology of perpetual growth is the ideology of the cancer cell .
We were horribly wrong to use this as a foundation of our civilization .
Horribly wrong .
So now what ?
Growth , in any sense beyond the spiritual , is simply no longer an option -- it ’s not even on the table anymore .
In fact -- and these are words I never imagined I ’d hear in my lifetime -- we have begun the decline phase of our Industrial Civilization .
There will be no recovery in the sense promised in years past .
For the foreseeable future , contraction in all things material will be the rule of the day -- decreased economic activity , decreased production , decreased consumption , decreased material wealth .
This contraction is unavoidable , as it simply follows the advancing depletion of all the material and energy resources that made growth possible in the first place .
All the advanced technology in the world cannot and will not revoke the Laws of Thermodynamics and the finite material limits of the Earth .
For all our accomplishments and pride as a civilization , the Industrial Age will turn out to have been a brief , intensely bright , historical aberration made possible only by the one - shot burning of irreplaceable fossil fuels and the destruction of a good part of the pre-existing biosphere – our very life support system .
It pains me beyond words to admit this , but these words are true and we must move on as best we can .
The Way Forward
So where are we ?
We have admitted to some serious fundamental problems with our Industrial Civilization , we have recognized our earthly material and energetic limits , and we have renounced the quest for perpetual material growth as both dangerous and ludicrous .
If your head is spinning , I understand .
Change is never easy , and this one ’s a doozy .
But now what ?
I suppose if we are proposing to do away with some of the major ideological foundations of Industrial Civilization , we should also outline an alternate path .
I think we can do this .
So here are our main questions :
If material growth beyond a certain level is neither desirable nor possible , what is the level we should aim for ?
Is that level even possible ?
How do we get there ?
And how do we stay there without tragically replaying our recent past on a smaller scale ?
We need to begin this conversation now .
In truth , we needed to begin this conversation forty years ago .
This conversation should perhaps start with the principles of Ecology .
This branch of the natural sciences investigates the web of relationships between organisms and the material world .
The idea of material and energetic limits is pervasive in this discipline , which is why it may suit our newly - limit - conscious - selves just fine as a starting point .
The Laws of Thermodynamics , with their inviolable limits and penalties associated with matter and energy changes will also be appropriate as a starting point .
The application of both Ecology and the Laws of Thermodynamics to human affairs has already been investigated in the fields of Steady - State Economics and Permaculture .
I suggest we review that literature for some guidance .
We will perhaps need also to look to the world ’s religions and moral thinkers to afford us some guidance along the treacherous road down from our civilization ’s peak .
Authors Wendell Berry , Aldo Leopold , and E.F.
Schumacher come to mind , among others .
Our physical needs during this contraction will have to be balanced by moral guidelines if we are to avoid the unspeakable atrocities that have characterized declines of past civilizations .
In short , we will need to find a path that sustainably nourishes both our bodies and our spirits in the trying times ahead .
Some First Steps
So how do we start down this necessary path ?
First , let ’s start with a few things we cannot do -- some doors that are now closed to us due to our decades of profligate resource destruction .
Firstly , anything requiring significant amounts of energy is out of the question .
The era of cheap , abundant fossil energy is behind us -- forever .
Despite repeated warnings from our best scientists , we failed to make the transition to renewables in time .
Now it ’s too late .
Every year from now on will afford us less and less energy -- possibly significantly less in the coming years .
Secondly , anything requiring significant amounts of money in the form of credit is out of the question .
In a future of a continually - declining resource base , there is simply no such thing as economic growth , and thus no credit .
Basically , we play with what material resources we have at this point -- which is a lot less than we used to .
But enough with the negatives -- let ’s start with some concrete positive steps that we can accomplish .
I can think of three that deserve our immediate attention :
1 . I see no more crucial place to start than with food and our country ’s food - security .
We will change both the way we grow food and the food we eat .
We will create more small local farms , more small farmers , more ecologically - sane fertilization methods , more seed saving and exchanging , more farmers markets and CSAs .
We will grow food on our city ’s rooftops , windowsills , and front stoops .
We will grow food in our suburban lawns , parking lots , and golf courses .
We will become self - sufficient in food - production with a smarter kind of agriculture that does not waste soil , pollute water , and poison our children .
This , my fellow Americans , is true “ homeland security . ”
2 . Next up is transportation .
We will need to move ourselves and our products around largely without the aid of fossil fuels , as these will become only more expensive and unavailable in the years ahead .
Is transportation with minimal fossil fuels even possible ?
Of course it is !
We did it for centuries before the Industrial Age , and we need only to reclaim those technologies .
Bicycles with trailers , hand - carts , and electric scooters will be made available as much as possible .
Mules , oxen , and draft horses will be bred as rapidly as possible for distribution to our farms , towns , and cities .
These will not allow us the mobility of former years , but that is the price we pay for thoughtlessly squandering our fossil fuels .
3 . If we are to be a less - mobile , more - localized people , we will need to start producing most of the necessities of everyday life in the places where we live .
Globalized trade was a brief artifact of the now - ended age of cheap fossil energy .
We will need to re-learn lost manufacturing skills and regain the proud craftsmanship of our forebearers .
This great re-skilling of America will be a high priority in the coming years .
The list of self - manufactured goods we ’ll need is long .
It includes tools , clothes , blankets , furniture , housing materials , bikes , wood - burning stoves , solar cookers , and rainwater collection systems -- among many other items .
Trade of these goods will again take place locally -- within and between our regions , rather than across oceans and hemispheres .
Now I know what many of you are thinking :
Must we really throw out our 20th century technological gains ?
Is the reclaiming of 19th century technology really necessary ?
Are n’t we giving up ?
I respond by saying this :
What choice do we have ?
Where is the fossil energy to run our computers , cars , and tractors ?
I ’ll tell you -- it ’s gone ; sqandered by seven generations of tragic excess .
Gone forever .
Can We Do This ?
So can we do this ?
Can we make this monumental transition towards some sort of lower - energy , lower consumption , humane living arrangement that can persist within the limits now pressing down upon us from all sides ?
Can we humans carve out our necessarily - limited niche on this planet without overstepping our boundaries ?
Can we do it without the violent convulsions to which humans are historically prone ?
I , of course , am confident that we can , and I am willing to make great personal sacrifices to achieve this success .
I hope many of you share my confidence and my resolve .
Make no mistake – our journey forward will not be easy .
Change of this magnitude will be a monumental task with no guarantee of success .
There will be pain and suffering -- our past excesses have guaranteed this .
Our only hope is to minimize this suffering as much as possible while resolutely pursuing some sort of livable future for our children .
So it ’s time to get down to work .
May we manage the decline phase of our civilization with every bit of intelligence , kindness , and dignity our species can summon .
Now if you ’ll excuse me , I ’ve got to go outside and dig a garden .

In a show of courage and good sense , Turkey ’s government has announced a plan to grant long - denied rights to its Kurdish minority , and , it is hoped , finally end an insurgency that has cost more than 40,000 lives .
Kurds compose as much as 20 percent of Turkey ’s population , yet for decades the government banned their political parties and denied them the most basic cultural rights , including the right to use their own language .
This mistreatment helped fuel Kurdish demands for independence and two decades of bloody attacks by the Kurdistan Workers Party , or P.K.K .
Although some 12,000 militants are still hiding in northern Iraq along the Turkish border , the P.K.K. has been steadily losing popular support .
The new initiative is designed as further pressure and incentive for the group to disband .
Last year , Parliament legalized private Kurdish language courses and created the first public television channel in Kurdish .
New regulation lets Kurdish prisoners speak to visitors in their native language .
Parliament is now debating an initiative that would allow the Kurdish language to be used in all broadcast media and political campaigns .
It would restore Kurdish names to thousands of towns that were given Turkish ones .
And it would establish an independent committee to fight discrimination and investigate torture allegations .
The economy has shed 7.6 million jobs since the recession began
The US economy lost 263,000 jobs in September , which was more than had been expected , according to official non-farm payrolls figures .
The jobless rate rose to a fresh 26 - year high of 9.8 % from August 's figure of 9.7 % .
The number in employment has now fallen for 21 consecutive months .
There was more bad news from the Labor Department , which revised its figures for July and August to show 13,000 more jobs lost than previously reported .
The economy as a whole is expected to have grown in the past three months , but recovery in the jobs market tends to lag behind the rest of the economy .
' Pattern of weakness '
Since the start of the recession in December 2007 , the number of people out of work has risen by 7.6 million to 15.1 million .
Expectations for recovery may have gotten a little ahead of the reality
Gary Thayer at Wells Fargo Advisors in Missouri
US unemployed despair as benefits run out " Together with the ISM data , delinquencies data and even the consumer confidence data we had , we 're starting to see a pattern of weakness emerge , " said Kevin Caron , market strategist at Stifel , Nicolaus & Co in New Jersey .
" We saw a lot of artificial involvement by the government to prop up the markets , and now that that is starting to end the private sector is n't yet showing signs of life . "
Government employment , which has been one of the factors boosting the economy in the past year , fell by 53,000 in September .
The other big areas of job losses were construction , manufacturing and retail .
Confidence needed " It shows expectations for recovery may have gotten a little ahead of the reality , " said Gary Thayer at Wells Fargo Advisors in Missouri .
" The trend is still improved from earlier this year , but employers need to feel more confident about the economy before they start hiring again . "
The US is not alone in seeing rising unemployment , with the 16 nations that use the euro announcing on Thursday that its seasonally adjusted rate rose to 9.6 % in August , putting the number of people without a job at 15.2 million .
Earlier on Friday , Japan unexpectedly announced that its jobless rate had fallen to 5.5 % in August from July 's record high of 5.7 % , but the number of people unemployed still hit a six - year high of 3.61 million .

The $ 80 oil price is starting to worry me a little .
Translate it into gasoline and you get somewhere around $ 2.50 per gallon or a little higher , depending on where in the US you fill up your tank .
Add to that a little cold weather and expanding crack spreads in refineries , and the price will edge toward $ 3 .
History - derived economic models show that the US consumer starts to change behavior as the price of gas approaches $ 3 , and then goes into a more pronounced state of shock when it ranges higher , in the $ 3 to $ 4 corridor .
The reaction is to cut spending and retrench if the consumer thinks the price is going to stay at the new higher level for a while .
When the consumer thinks the price will not stay higher , he keeps on spending and buying on credit .
BUT –
That history is derived , and has been modeled , from a time period when household balance sheets were relatively solid and when credit was flowing easily and when the unemployment rate was close to 5 % , not 10 % .
So that is why I am starting to worry .
There are no solid models of rising gas prices that I can find which give good estimates of what happens to consumers when the unemployment rate is 10 % instead of 5 % and when many household balance sheets are wrecked , and when the credit mechanism is damaged .
SO –
The issue now is what gasoline price change it takes to impact consumer ’s behavior .
Does the price have to go as high as previously to hurt ?
Some retail experts I consulted say yes and that there will be no change in the relationship .
Others disagree and say there is a new lower level , but they have insufficient experience to estimate what it is .
SO –
We asked some fellow economists if they thought the relationship was linear or something else .
There was consistent disagreement .
Five two - handed economists had ten opinions .
Some said yes to linear and others said no .
Most thought that the impact of a change in gas price is much more severe in the current environment .
No one said it was milder .
SO –
If a rising gas price is going to crunch the consumer more than normally , the fragile economic recovery may be about to be derailed .
Remember that every penny on the gasoline price acts as a $ 1 - billion direct tax on the consumer .
This rule - of - thumb estimate is used to guess at the normal effect .
But if this time is not normal and if the effect is magnified and more severe , who knows what the new rule of thumb should be ?
We do n’t .
AND –
We worry that this issue is not being discussed by the policy makers , who are still wringing their hands over inflation fear .
And we see an energy policy coming from the Obama administration that will only serve to raise the price of gasoline and tax the extraction industries .
That explains why the drill rig count is down even as the oil price is going up .
Energy and oil may be the next “ sleeper ” to awaken and jolt markets .
However , we think it is more likely to slow down the fragile recovery .
When it does , oil and gasoline demand will shrink , not grow .
That will put downward pressure on the oil price , even if the dollar is weak .
This will be even more pronounced if the dollar rallies
Oil is now $ 80 .
We may just see $ 60 sooner than we see $ 100 .
I will take the “ under ” on this trade as long as there is no outbreak of war in the Middle East , no rumbling from Russia , and I will hope there is no tax policy in the US that hits the energy consumer in the middle of a recession that features a 10 % unemployment rate .
We already have a no-exploration policy in all but four of these United States .
The first two risks are geopolitical .
The last one is just political , no “ geo ” needed .
As my friend Loren Scott likes to say in his speeches , “ All the oil in America is in four states : Texas , Louisiana , Mississippi and Alabama , and the dipsticks are in Washington . ”

PORTSMOUTH — A Lincoln Avenue resident was charged with aggravated drunken driving early Monday morning after police say he drove off Miller Avenue and smashed into a stack of pumpkins for sale on a church lawn .
PORTSMOUTH — A Lincoln Avenue resident was charged with aggravated drunken driving early Monday morning after police say he drove off Miller Avenue and smashed into a stack of pumpkins for sale on a church lawn .
According to Lt. Dante Puopolo , the incident occurred around 4:13 a.m. and involved Thomas Brennan , 26 , of 322 Lincoln Ave. driving off the road and onto the property of the First United Methodist Church .
" He hit a bunch of them , " said Puopolo .
The 129 Miller Ave. church routinely places hundreds of pumpkins for sale on the lawn every fall as part of its annual fundraising efforts .
Police were notified of the accident by a passerby and once on scene issued Brennan a field sobriety test , said Puopolo .
He was charged with aggravated driving while intoxicated due to his high blood alcohol concentration at the time of his arrest , the police spokesperson said .
The city 's public police log indicated Brennan 's red Toyota Camry was towed away from the scene .
Following his arrest , Brennan was released on $ 1,500 personal recognizance bail and is scheduled to be arraigned in Portsmouth District Court on Nov. 13 .

This is the fifth post in the article series " Vim Plugins You Should Know About " .
This time I am going to introduce you to a nifty plugin called " a.vim " .
A.vim allows you to quickly switch between related source code files .
For example , if you 're programming in C , you can alternate between source.c and the corresponding header source.h by just typing : A .
It saves you only a few seconds every time you use it , but do n't forget that these seconds can add up to hours during several weeks .
This plugin was written by Mike Sharpe .
For the introduction of this article series see part one - surround.vim .
Other bindings in a.vim
Besides the " : A " command that alternates between source files in the same buffer , a.vim also defines several other commands :
: AS -- alternate in a horizontal split ,
-- alternate in a horizontal split , : AV -- alternate in a vertical split , and
-- alternate in a vertical split , and : AT -- alternate in a new tab .
The author of the plugin also defines the command " : IH " , which opens the file under cursor , but it 's really unnecessary because " gf " already does that .
Extending a.vim
By default a.vim defines alternation for the following languages :
C -- .c <-> .h ,
C++ -- .c / .cpp / .cxx / .cc <-> .h / .hpp ,
lex and yacc -- .l / .lex / .lpp <-> .y / .ypp / .yacc ,
ASP.NET -- .aspx <-> .aspx.cs / .aspx.vb
The alternation can be extended to other extensions by defining the following variable in your .vimrc :
let g:alternateExtensions_foo = " bar , baz "
This will set up alternation between . foo , .bar and .baz files .
How to install a.vim ?
To get the latest version :
1. Download a.vim .
2 . Put a.vim in ~/.vim / plugin ( on Unix / Linux ) or ~\vimfiles \plugin ( on Windows ) .
3. Download alternate. txt from the same page .
4 . Put alternate. txt in a.vim in ~/.vim / doc ( on Unix / Linux ) or ~ / vimfiles / doc ( on Windows ) .
5. Run : helptags ~/.vim /doc ( on Unix / Linux ) or : helptags ~/ vimfiles /doc ( on Windows ) to rebuild the tags file ( so that you can read : help alternate . )
6. Restart Vim .
I have mapped the : A command to " , a " .
You can also map it to the same combination by putting " map , a : A < CR > " in your .vimrc file .
Have Fun !
Have fun with this plugin and until next time !

Hugo Gaston , a 20 - year - old wildcard ranked 239th in the world , is the last French man standing at the French Open after Benoit Paire crashed out meekly and Pierre - Hugues Herbert missed an opportunity to beat sixth seed Alexander Zverev on Wednesday .
While qualifier Benjamin Bonzi can be excused for being humbled 6 - 2 6 - 4 6 - 4 by NextGen ATP
Finals winner Jannik Sinner of Italy , Paire again under - performed in a 7 - 6 ( 3 ) 4 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 1 defeat by Federico Coria .
It is the first time since 2010 that only one French man reached the third round at Roland Garros , but Paire , who admitted this week that he was " tired mentally " after being confined to his hotel room at the U.S.
Open after mixed COVID - 19 test results , would not say it was the end of a generation .
The present study investigated voters ' testosterone responses to the outcome of the 2008 United States Presidential election .
183 participants provided multiple saliva samples before and after the winner was announced on Election Night .
The results show that male Barack Obama voters ( winners ) had stable post - outcome testosterone levels , whereas testosterone levels dropped in male John McCain and Robert Barr voters ( losers ) .
There were no significant effects in female voters .
Political elections are dominance competitions .
When men win a dominance competition , their testosterone levels rise or remain stable to resist a circadian decline ; and when they lose , their testosterone levels fall .
However , it is unknown whether this pattern of testosterone change extends beyond interpersonal competitions to the vicarious experience of winning or losing in the context of political elections .
Women 's testosterone responses to dominance competition outcomes are understudied , and to date , a clear pattern of testosterone changes in response to winning and losing dominance competitions has not emerged .
Funding :
This research was supported by departmental funds from Duke University ( to KSL ) and the University of Michigan ( to JCB ) and a McClelland Postdoctoral Fellowship ( to SJS ) .
The funders had no role in study design , data collection and analysis , decision to publish , or preparation of the manuscript .
We predicted that males who voted for the losing presidential candidates would have post - outcome testosterone decreases , and that the males who voted for the winning candidate would have either stable post - outcome testosterone or testosterone increases .
On the basis of inconclusive but principally null findings in past research and the evolutionary perspective which suggests that testosterone plays a lesser role in female mammalian competition , we predicted that female voters would not show differential testosterone changes according to the election outcome .
In comparison to the numerous studies of men , far fewer studies have explored women 's testosterone responses to winning and losing dominance competitions .
Moreover , the existing evidence is inconsistent .
While a recent study has shown that winning and losing can drive differential changes in women 's testosterone levels ( e.g. , soccer [ 10 ] ) , other studies have not documented this effect ( e.g. rugby [ 11 ] ; soccer [ 12 ] ; video game [ 13 ] ; computer - based cognitive game [ 14 ] ( also see Archer [ 4 ] for a meta- analysis in both sexes ) ) .
Sex differences resulting from competition outcomes extend beyond differences in testosterone levels .
There are also sex differences in aggression , risk - taking , and responses to threat – all behaviors which are more prevalent in men , are generally associated with testosterone increases during young adulthood , and have been shaped in male mammals through sexual selection [ 15 ] – [ 17 ] .
In addition to providing more evidence in the general study of women 's testosterone changes in response to competition , the present study aimed to provide the first evidence of the effects of vicarious victory and defeat on women 's changes in testosterone .
What if the vicarious dominance contest is not just a sports game as tested by Bernhardt and colleagues [ 9 ] , but rather it is to select the political leader of one of the most powerful countries in the world ?
The extent to which the described patterns of testosterone change extend to vicarious victory and defeat in broader aspects of dominance competition like political elections is unknown .
Tens of millions of United States ( U.S. ) citizens engage in the election both directly , by voting , and vicariously , since they do not personally win or lose .
This combination of direct and vicarious involvement for voters makes democratic political elections unique dominance contests .
Moreover , a party - based realignment of the U.S. political leadership of profound historical significance occurs rarely .
Capitalizing on this research opportunity , the present study sought to measure voters ' testosterone responses to the announcement of the outcome of the 2008 United States Presidential election .
Dominance contests are a critical component of determining the leadership of social hierarchies across a wide range of species [ 1 ] – [ 3 ] .
In modern human societies , this dominance contest can take the form of a democratic election .
Across mammalian species , testosterone is critically linked to dominance competition for hierarchical advancement in males [ 3 ] – [ 5 ] .
When males win a dominance contest , their testosterone levels rise or remain stable to resist a circadian decline , and when they lose , their testosterone levels fall [ 3 ] – [ 5 ] .
In men , the described pattern of testosterone change after winning or losing has been demonstrated in the context of direct , interpersonal competition ( e.g. , sports matches and non-physical competitions ) [ 4 ] , [ e.g. 6 ] – [ 8 ] .
In addition , Bernhardt and colleagues [ 9 ] measured World Cup soccer fans ' testosterone changes after the outcome of a World Cup match , and they found that vicariously - experienced competition ( i.e. watching one 's favorite sports teams win or lose ) drives testosterone increases in winners and decreases in losers [ 9 ] .
However , this single report of the vicarious - competition effect on testosterone changes is based on a small sample , tested only men , and has never been replicated [ 9 ] .
For the analyses , salivary testosterone on the night of the election ( T1 , T2 , T3 , T4 ) and self - reported mood were the dependent variables , and the 2008 Presidential candidate for whom participants voted ( Obama ( winner ) , McCain or Barr ( losers ) ) , right - wing authoritarianism , saliva collection times , and other self - report data were the independent variables .
SYSTAT 12.0 statistical software was used for all analyses , with a statistical threshold of P < 0.05 .
Descriptive statistics are shown as mean ( ± SEM ) .
Salivary testosterone levels were assessed with solid - phase Coat - A - Count 125 I radioimmunoassay for testosterone ( Diagnostic Products Corporation , catalogue number : TKTT ) .
This radioimmunoassay yields high correlations between salivary testosterone and free testosterone in serum in both men and women [ 24 ] – [ 26 ] .
To determine salivary testosterone concentrations , we prepared water - based dilutions of all standards ( with a resulting range of 5 to 400 pg / mL ) and controls .
400 uL of the saliva samples , standards , and controls were pipetted into antibody - coated tubes and allowed to incubate overnight .
Next , 1 ml radio - labeled testosterone tracer was added to each tube and allowed to incubate overnight .
Finally , tubes were aspirated and counted for 3 minutes [ 23 ] .
Assay reliability was evaluated by including control samples with known hormone concentrations in each assay ( Bio - Rad Lyphochecks from Bio-Rad Laboratories , Hercules , CA ) .
For samples of known concentration ( 89.7 pg/ mL and 151.8 pg/mL ) , inter - assay CVs were 10.64 % and 8.55 % , respectively .
Participants ' six saliva samples were counted in duplicate and had a mean intra-assay CV of 14.26 % .
Analytical sensitivity ( B 0 - 3 SD ) was at 2.47 pg/mL .
Mean testosterone levels for both sexes ( see Table 1 ) are closely aligned with previous studies that employed and behaviorally validated this assay protocol [ 27 ] – [ 30 ] .
For each of the six saliva samples , participants used a stick of sugar - free chewing gum to facilitate collecting up to 7.5 mL of saliva in a sterile polypropylene vial and discarded the gum [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
Participants sealed the vials immediately after each collection .
Participants stored their samples in refrigerators overnight .
When participants returned their samples to the lab on Nov. 5 th , the experimenter placed the samples in frozen storage .
Samples were freed from mucopolysaccarides and other residuals by three freeze thaw cycles followed by centrifugation .
In our retrospective affective state questionnaire , we used 9 - point , Likert - scaled items to assess participants ' self - reported feelings of pleasantness ( unpleasant to pleasant ; unhappy to happy ) and dominance ( dominant to submissive ; controlled to controlling ) at the moment when Barack Obama was declared the winner .
This questionnaire also asked participants if they had consumed alcohol on the night of the election , where they viewed the election results ( home , bar , campus hall , etc. ) , and with how many other people they viewed the election results .
In our biographical data questionnaire , we also used 9 - point , Likert - scaled items to assess participants ' candidate support intensity ( ‘ not at all ’ to ‘ as much as possible ’ ) and participants ' estimation of their candidate 's likelihood of winning ( ‘ not likely ’ to ‘ very likely ’ ) .
Participants came to the laboratory on November 3 rd , 2008 between 10:00 am and 5:00 pm , at which point , they provided informed consent and completed a biographical questionnaire and the right - wing authoritarianism scale [ 18 ] .
Participants were provided with a take - home saliva collection kit which included sampling vials , chewing gum , markers , and saliva collection instructions .
On Election Night ( Tuesday Nov. 4 th ) , participants provided saliva sample 1 ( T1 ) at 8 pm Eastern Standard Time ( EST ) , a time at which many election polls were closing on the east coast of the United States .
Both study sites ( Durham , NC and Ann Arbor , MI ) are on EST .
Participants provided saliva samples 2 , 3 , and 4 ( T2 , T3 , T4 ) at 0 , 20 and 40 minutes , respectively , after they had learned that Barack Obama had been declared the winner .
For all samples collected at home , participants recorded the exact time of collection on the vials .
On average for all participants , saliva samples 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 were collected at 8:08 pm , 11:35 pm , 11:57 pm , and 12:20 am , respectively ( all times are EST ) .
These times reflect participant compliance with the prescribed timing schedule of 20 minute spacing between post - outcome samples and alignment with when television networks were declaring Barack Obama the winner of the election .
Participants returned their samples to the laboratory on Nov. 5 th between 10:00 am and 5:00 pm .
On Nov. 5 th , participants completed an endocrine health questionnaire and a retrospective affective state questionnaire .
Participants also provided saliva samples at various times on Nov. 3 rd and Nov. 5 th .
Upon completion , participants were paid or given course credit for their participation and were debriefed .
The presidential candidates on the ballots in both recruitment states used in this study were Barack Obama ( Democratic party ) , John McCain ( Republican party ) , and Robert Barr ( Libertarian party ) .
This study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki .
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Duke University and the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor .
All participants provided written informed consent for the collection of samples and subsequent analysis .
Data were collected from 80 participants ( 27 men ) in Durham , North Carolina and from 103 participants ( 34 men ) in Ann Arbor , Michigan .
Eleven Durham and nine Ann Arbor participants ' data were omitted from the analyses , because they did not vote or failed to complete all aspects of the experiment .
The final Durham sample consisted of 69 participants ( 24 men ) ( 21.07±0.46 years old ) .
The final Ann Arbor consisted of 94 participants ( 33 men ) ( 21.12±0.49 years old ) .
Results
To examine the impact of candidate choice on testosterone levels after the election outcome announcement , a repeated - measures ANCOVA was run with post - outcome testosterone at T2 , T3 , and T4 as a within - subjects factor and testosterone at T1 as a baseline covariate .
A significant Time x Outcome ( Win / Loss ) interaction was observed in men ( F ( 2 , 100 ) = 3.40 , p = 0.04 ) , but not women ( F ( 2 , 188 ) = 0.39 , p = 0.68 ) ( Fig. 1 ) .
To quantify the effect of the outcome on relative changes in testosterone from before to after the election , residualized testosterone change scores were calculated from T1 to T4 , where effects were predicted to be maximal according to time - course changes in salivary testosterone [ 31 ] .
Residual testosterone change scores measure testosterone change between two time - points ( T1 & T4 ) while controlling for variance in testosterone at baseline ( T1 ) .
Using ANOVA , candidate choice predicted differences in men's testosterone residuals ( F ( 1 , 51 ) = 4.72 , p = 0.03 ) , with supporters of John McCain or Bob Barr having significantly larger testosterone decreases from T1 to T4 than supporters of Barack Obama ( Fig. 1 ) .
Moreover , the candidate choice effect on men's testosterone change remained even when participants ' conservatism , as measured by the RWA scale [ 18 ] , was partialled out of the analysis ( F ( 1 , 49 ) , = 5.39 , p = 0.03 ) .
Further still , the candidate choice effect was maintained when adding an additional covariate which accounted for voters ' intensity of support for their candidate ( F ( 1 , 48 ) , = 5.37 , p = 0.03 ) .
Using ANOVA , voter group failed to predict differences in women 's testosterone residuals ( F ( 1 , 97 ) = 0.12 , p = 0.74 ) ( Fig. 1 ) .
When including the RWA scale and voters ' support intensity as covariates , voter group still failed to predict differences in women 's testosterone residuals ( F( 1,91 ) = 0.71 , p = 0.71 ) .

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0007543.g001
We also repeated the analyses excluding the participants who voted for Robert Barr , who arguably did not have a chance of winning .
The results were essentially unchanged .
A significant Time x Win / Loss interaction was still observed in men ( F( 2 , 98 ) = 3.94 , p = 0.02 ) , but not women ( F ( 2 , 186 ) = 0.22 , p = 0.80 ) .
Voter group still predicted differences in men's testosterone residuals ( F ( 1 , 50 ) = 4.94 , p = 0.03 ) , including when differences in participants ' conservatism was partialled out ( F ( 1 , 48 ) , = 5.94 , p = 0.02 ) and when voter support intensity was also partialled out ( F ( 1 , 47 ) , = 5.81 , p = 0.02 ) .
Voter group still failed to predict differences in women 's testosterone residuals ( F ( 1 , 96 ) = 0.00 , p = 0.97 ) .
We wanted to rule out other factors that might have contributed to men's changes in testosterone levels .
To do so , we examined the effects of male participants ' social surroundings and alcohol consumption on the evening of the election on their testosterone responses .
We examined the effect of alcohol consumption , because alcohol consumption can lead to decrements in testosterone in men [ 32 ] .
We performed a repeated - measures ANCOVA with post - outcome testosterone at T2 , T3 , and T4 as a within - subjects factor and testosterone at T1 as a baseline covariate , and also added covariates that accounted for where the participants viewed the election ( home , bar , campus hall , etc. ) , with how many people they viewed the election , and whether or not they consumed alcohol on the night of the election .
None of these factors absorbed a significant portion of the variance ( all Fs < 1.0 ) , and the Time x Outcome ( Win / Loss ) interaction was still significant and of the same magnitude ( F( 2 , 94 ) = 3.27 , p = 0.04 ) .
We also included the same three covariates in an ANOVA testing the effect of candidate choice on testosterone residuals .
Again , these factors failed to absorb a significant portion of the variance ( all Fs < 1.0 ) , and candidate choice significantly predicted the difference in testosterone residuals ( F ( 1 , 48 ) = 4.45 , p = 0.04 ) , with supporters of John McCain or Bob Barr having significantly larger testosterone decreases from T1 to T4 than supporters of Barack Obama .
In female voters , we also confirmed that these factors ( alcohol consumption , social setting , number of co-viewers ) failed to account for a significant portion of the variance in the Time x Outcome repeated - measures ANCOVA and the test of candidate choice on testosterone residuals .
Lastly , for men , we also wanted to rule out the influence of the timing of post - outcome saliva collection on testosterone change .
To do so , we performed a repeated - measures ANCOVA with post - outcome testosterone at T2 , T3 , and T4 as a within - subjects factor and testosterone at T1 as a baseline covariate and added the time of day at T2 , T3 , and T4 as covariates .
The Time x Outcome ( Win / Loss ) interaction was still significant ( F( 2 , 84 ) = 3.21 , p = 0.05 ) .
Moreover , candidate choice still predicted differences in men's testosterone residuals ( F( 1 , 43 ) = 4.39 , p = 0.04 ) .
These results suggest that variation in saliva collection times did not alter the effect of candidate choice on testosterone change .
We repeated these analyses with time covariates for women , and we still failed to find a Time x Outcome ( Win / Loss ) interaction ( F ( 2 , 158 ) = 0.83 , p = 0.83 ) or a candidate choice effect on women 's testosterone residuals ( F ( 1 , 83 ) = 0.08 , p = 0.78 ) .
In order to address potential explanations of the sex differences in testosterone responses , we tested sex differences in participants ' candidate support intensity , their levels of right - wing authoritarianism , their estimates of “ their ” candidate 's likelihood of winning the election , their consumption of alcohol , and their social surroundings on the night of the election .
There were no differences between the sexes in their candidate support intensity ( t( 161 ) = 0.30 , p = 0.77 ) , their estimates of “ their ” candidate 's likelihood to win the election ( t( 161 ) = 1.12 , p = 0.27 ) , their degree of right - wing authoritarianism ( t( 155 ) = − 0.06 , p = 0.96 ) , their consumption of alcohol ( t( 161 ) = − 0.853 , p = 0.40 ) , the type of social setting where they watched the election ( F ( 1 , 159 ) = 0.11 ) , p = 0.74 ) , or the number of people with whom they watched the election ( F ( 1 , 159 ) = 0.05 ) , p = 0.82 ) .
In retrospective reports of their affective state upon the announcement of Obama as the president - elect , McCain and Barr voters felt significantly more unhappy ( t( 159 ) = 22.98 , p<0.001 ) , submissive ( t( 160 ) = − 11.30 , p<0.001 ) , unpleasant ( t( 160 ) = − 20.10 , p<0.001 ) , and controlled ( t( 158 ) = 6.42 , p<0.001 ) than Obama voters .
Seeing is believing when it comes to emotions .
We smile , we gasp , we yawn when we see others do the same — a phenomenon called emotional contagion .
A new study published last week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences finds that emotional contagion occurs even if the " seeing " step is bypassed .
The blind patients in the study could not consciously see images of the faces of happy or fearful people that they were shown .
Although their eyes and optic nerves were functional , the region of their brains involved in visual processing had been damaged .
Instead , other parts of the brain took over , allowing the subjects to still respond normally with their own happy or scared facial expressions .
These patients also made the appropriate happy or fearful face in response to emotions that were communicated through bodily expressions , suggesting that blind empathy can happen even without a facial template to imitate .
" We 're actually infected by the emotions of others .
[ This study shows ] this phenomenon can be carried out in the absence of visual awareness , " says Marco Tamietto , a neuroscience researcher at Tilburg University in the Netherlands and lead author of the study .
" We can say that emotional contagion can not be reduced to a simple mimicry . "
To tease apart the mechanism underlying emotional contagion , Tamietto and his colleagues took advantage of what is known in neuroscience as " blindsight " .
Starting a few decades ago , researchers found that patients who have damage to the part of the brain called the visual cortex , which processes visual information , retain a sort of sixth sense of sight .
Although they are not aware of information in their visual fields , that input , whether it is a color , shape or facial expression , is still entering their eyes and being sent to and processed by other regions of their brains .
One area known to receive visual information independently of the visual cortex is the amygdala , the brain 's emotional control center .
" With these patients , they feel they 're blind … .
If you flash them [ an image of ] something , they claim they do n't see anything , but they guess reliably above chance " what the image is , says Marco Iacoboni , a professor of psychiatry at the University of California , Los Angeles , ( U.C.L.A. ) and author of the book Mirroring People .
Iacoboni was not involved in the recent PNAS study .
Tamietto and his colleagues studied two adult patients whose visual cortices had been damaged — one because of surgical removal at age 33 , the other by a traumatic brain injury at age seven .
As a result , each was blind in either the right or left side of the visual field .
Even though both of their eyes was sending information from both sides of the visual field to the visual cortex , damage to the left side of the visual cortex , for example , made the patient effectively blind in the right side of the visual field .
The authors showed them pictures of faces of people with happy or fearful expressions on either the right or left side of a computer screen while the patients kept their eyes fixed on the center of the screen , and measured the spontaneous change in their facial muscles via electromyography ( EMG ) .
The patients responded by smiling at happy faces and frowning at faces showing fright that were shown to both their sighted and blind visual fields .
As Tamietto says , these facial responses could still be the result of the patients automatically mimicking the expressions that they see , even if they are seeing them on an unconscious level .
The alternative is that the expressions on the screen are actually eliciting the same mood in the subjects .
To distinguish between these two possibilities , Tamietto and his colleagues showed the patients images of happy or fearful body postures that would be emotional cues but not provide the information needed for facial imitation .
The response was the same :
In both visual fields , the patients responded by smiling at happy bodies and frowning at fearful bodily postures .
These results suggest , " you are really into the same emotional mood , so you are not simply imitating but you are unknowingly driven to the same emotional mood , " Tamietto says .
Iacoboni at U.C.L.A. , however , is not convinced that mimicry is not involved .
Because the study did not look at muscle movement in the body , only the face , it remains possible that the patients adjusted their bodily positions to imitate those on the screen , and then that emotion spread to their faces .
One way to examine the role of imitation , he says , would be to look if the parts of the brain where there are mirror neurons are active in these studies .
In addition to suggesting that we can empathize with others ' emotions on an unconscious level , the authors also noticed that this reaction was faster than the one that involved the visual cortex .
Whereas patients took about 1.2 seconds to respond to images
on their functional side , they reacted in 0.9 second to images in the blind visual field , according to the EMG recordings .
When the visual cortex is working , most of the visual information is routed through this part of the brain , says Alan Pegna , director of the Laboratory of Experimental Neuropsychology at Geneva University Hospital in Switzerland who was not involved in the current study .
He has studied patients with blindsight , or the type of seeing that does not involve the visual cortex .
" The idea is the information is reaching the amygdala in a kind of direct , quick and dirty route , " he says .
When the visual cortex is out of commission , more of the visual information could be fast - tracked to the reflexive regions of the brain .
Tamietto says the unconscious route could also process visual information for other basic human emotions , including anger and sadness .
" Those were events relevant for survival of our ancestors that required a rapid reaction to the environment mediated by phylogenetically ancient pathways that bypass the visual cortex , " he says .
But lest we forget the importance of the visual cortex , he adds : " To really understand the intentions of others , we have to be conscious . "
For that , we need the awareness that arises from those perceptions derived from the visual cortex .
UPDATE 10.28.2009 :
This post was originally entitled , " Cockroach Superpower No. 42 : They Don't Need to Pee , " and described how the nitrogen recycling system of roaches freed them from need to urinate — i.e. , excrete nitrogenous wastes in liquid form .
This was due to my misinterpretation of cockroach physiology .
Cockroaches possess structures called Malpighian tubules , which pull wastes from their internal liquids ; the liquids return to circulation , and the wastes are excreted in solid or semi- solid form , and can contain excess nitrogen .
However , Malpighian tubules are common to insects , so cockroaches are not unique in this regard .
The bottom line : cockroaches do n't pee , but neither do most insects , and what makes roaches special is their bacterially - enhanced nitrogen efficiency .
My sincere apologies for this mistake .
To survive in hostile environments , cockroaches rely on their own vermin : Blattabacterium , a microbe that hitched a ride inside roaches 140 million years ago , and has n't left since .
Researchers who sequenced the Blattabacterium genome have found that it converts waste into molecules necessary for a roach to survive .
Every cockroach is a testimony to the power of recycling .
" Blattabacterium can produce all of the essential amino acids , various vitamins , and other required compounds from a limited palette of metabolic substrates , " write entomologists in a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Researchers have known that cockroaches need the microbes to survive : Kill Blattabacterium with antibiotics , and the insects die .
They also knew that roaches store excess nitrogen — one of life 's essential elements , needed to make proteins , amino acids and DNA — inside their bodies , in tiny deposits of uric acid .
But researchers did n't know exactly what became of the uric acid after it was stored , or precisely what Blattabacterium did .
Sequencing the microbe 's genome made the links clear .
The microbe contains genes that code for enzymes that break down urea and ammonia , the components of uric acid .
Other genes instruct the microbe to take the resulting molecules and use them to make amino acids , repair cell walls and membranes , and perform other metabolic tasks .
This allows cockroaches to subsist on nitrogen - poor diets , an ability " critical to the ecological range and global distribution of the cockroach species , " write the researchers .
And what a range it is :
There are nearly 5,000 species of cockroaches , spread on every continent , even Antarctica .
At this point in cockroach evolution , roaches are utterly dependent on Blattabacterium , said Kambhampati .
" They 've lost the ability to produce their own amino acids , like other animals do .
They can't live without the bacteria , " he said .
That raises the possibility of designing pesticides " that somehow interfere with the function of Blattabacterium , rather than directly killing cockroaches , " Kambhampati said .
But he doubted that any such pesticide would work for long before resistance developed , and seemed glum at the prospect of his research being used to exterminate an animal that 's proved so fascinating to study .
" There 's about five or six species associated with humans , and unfortunately they give a bad name to the 4,900 species that live quietly in the forest , " said Kambhampati .

An Oz woman suspected of having caused a 33 - year - old man to prang his ute has strenuously denied she was administering him oral pleasure at the time of the crash .
According to the Northern Territory News , police believe " amorous activities " were behind the crash last week in Humpty Doo* , in which the driver of a Toyota Hilux was " distracted by the female passenger and veered into a concrete drain on the opposite side of the road " .
Police Duty Superintendent John Emeny said : " It is believed that the driver and his passenger were engaged in amorous activities at the time of the accident .
Whilst there may be a humorous element to this incident there is also a very serious one and that is the devastating consequences that can result from inattentive driving . "
The vehicle was " extensively damaged " , and the owner charged with an impressive roster of " drink driving , driving without due care and unlicenced driving " .
A couple of days later , though , the alleged todger - sucker inisted that the injury across her chest caused by her seat belt proved she had not been bent double at the moment of impact .
Allyson
White , in a truly magnificent outburst , told the Northern Territory News : " I was not **** ing his **** - and it 's pretty obvious that was n't the case ... you only have to look at the mark on my chest .
Clearly I had my seat belt on , so it 's impossible I 'd be leaning over **** ing his ***** unless he is hung like a donkey or I 've got a ******* rubber neck . "
She continued : " If it was true I 'd just cop it sweet and think 'how embarrassing , I got caught **** ing someone 's ****'.
But it is not true and that 's what is p***ing me off .
It did n't happen like that at all - he was just going too fast . "
She did , though , admit : " It may have looked bad when police first arrived as my ' girls ' were hanging out all over the place .
I also had a $ 5 note wedged between my boobs so they probably just assumed I was a sex worker or something ... but $ 5 is a bit cheap for a **** job . "
Readers can see White 's injury , her impressive " girls " and her evident penchant for beer and cigarettes right right here . ®

Jetstar executives say they are investigating a complaint from Paralympian Kurt Fearnley who says he was forced to crawl through Brisbane Airport because the airline would not let him take his wheelchair on board the flight .
The airline offered him one of their chairs , but he says he could not move it properly .
The Federal Discrimination Commissioner says he is shocked that this sort of thing still happens in 2009 .
Fearnley has become a household name after crawling the Kokoda Track less than a week ago .
But he says when he returned to Australia he was forced to crawl through Brisbane Airport when Jetstar demanded he check his wheelchair in as luggage .
Fearnley says he was offered an airline owned chair but it was unsuitable .
He says it was humiliating .
" I had been looking forward to the relief of getting home for two weeks .
Every night I said I 've been sore , " he said .
" Every night I was just looking forward to getting back to my place and relaxing and then I 'm an hour away from home and this happens , and for the last three days it has not been relaxing . "
Fearnley says longstanding cultural prejudices still exist for people with a disability .
" If this happened in America , the airline would n't be functioning tomorrow , " he said .
" If this happened in Australia to someone of a different race , if this happened to someone of a different sexuality , someone who is against the norm , someone who is obese , the airline would n't be functioning tomorrow .
" I feel like tomorrow I will be locking myself in a room and going to sleep .
Right now I just feel like there is a burden , a sense of relief that hopefully in a couple of days things will be a little bit different . "
The Government has announced a review of how the system can be changed to improve the quality of life for people with a disability .
Jetstar says it has not received a formal complaint from Fearnley or was aware of the problem when it happened four days ago .
The airline is now trying to clarify why Fearnley was prevented from using his own wheelchair after checking in at Brisbane Airport .
Normally disabled passengers are allowed to take their own wheelchairs to the gate before being transferred to the airline 's wheelchair for boarding
Jetstar 's head of corporate relations , Simon Westaway , says the processing of the chair was done at the check - in rather than at the gate .
" We are just getting to the bottom as to why that occurred .
In an ideal world we would consistently do it at the gate but at busy airports , sometimes it is not always possible to do it exactly how we would want to always do it , " he said .
Federal Disability Discrimination Commissioner Graeme Innes says it is tragic that Fearnley was refused permission by Jetstar to use his own wheelchair .
" I would have to say that it is tragic to think that an Australian such as Kurt Fearnley , who in recognition of the war service of many other Australians , came back from crawling the Kokoda Track ... and had to experience disrespect and poor treatment when he arrived in an Australian airport .
" He was given the choice of sitting in a wheelchair which he could n't use or control for an hour - and - a - half or crawling to a plane by himself and in this day and age , in modern Australia , this just should not occur . "
How I ran AMD CodeAnalyst on an Intel CPU
It 's been asked how I managed to run AMD CodeAnalyst on an Intel CPU , since the documentation and Wikipedia page says that it requires an AMD CPU .
Someone suggested that I might have hacked out the CPUID check .
I actually used the following very sneaky technique :
Install CodeAnalyst .
Run CodeAnalyst .
CodeAnalyst works fine on an Intel CPU , as long as you use Time - Based Sampling ( TBS ) .
It will blue - screen the machine if you use Event - Based Sampling ( EBS ) or Pipeline Simulation , or at least it used to .
Call graph profiling might not work either , but I never use that anyway .
As for why CodeAnalyst works on Intel CPUs , only AMD knows for sure , but there are good reasons for doing so .
One reason is that you can analyze runs on a different machine than the one that did the profile ; another is that the vast majority of optimization benefits execution on any CPU .
A third possible reason is simply that it happens to work and there 's no reason to spend time breaking it .
In any case , I 'm glad that this is the case , because CodeAnalyst is free and easy to install , and even though it 's not the fanciest sampling profiler , it works .

The American energy giant ExxonMobil today won the right to develop one of the world 's most prized untapped oil reserves , in a $ 50 bn ( £ 30 bn ) deal that will entrench the company as one of the largest players in postwar Iraq .
Exxon was awarded a contract to extract oil from the West Qurna reservoir near Basra in Iraq 's south during an extended tender process that has seen the Iraqi government partner foreign firms in a bid to get its reserves of oil out of the ground as cheaply and quickly as possible .
West Qurna was considered the jewel in the nine Iraqi oil and gas fields up for grabs , with verified reserves of 15bn barrels and a strong chance that exploration will reveal significantly more .
Iraqi oil minister Hussain Shahristani said the contract stipulated a $ 25bn investment and $ 25 bn more in operating fees .
It is also expected to yield up to 100,000 jobs in the impoverished deep south of the country that was heavily blighted by insurgency throughout the past five years .
" Iraq will get great benefits from developing the sector and providing services for the people , " said Shahristani in Baghdad 's oil ministry .
" After decades of oppression and tyranny , Iraq is getting back its riches for this generation and for the next . "
ExxonMobil , the world 's largest publicly traded oil company , has agreed to ramp up oil production from current levels of 270,000 barrels a day to 2.25 million barrels a day , within seven years , after which a licence fee of $ 1.90 a barrel will be paid by the Iraqi government .
In the opening round in July , BP and CNPC won the rights to develop the Rumaya oilfield , also near Basra .
Oil is seen by most in government as Iraq 's meal ticket .
Iraq has verified reserves of around 115 bn barrels , which is widely seen as enough to kick - start its brittle economy and potentially transform the services - deprived south and north of the country into economic strongholds .
But the country 's oil infrastructure is around 50 years old and does not have the capacity to extract oil at sufficient daily levels to compete with neighbouring producers .
The deals it is striking with foreign firms allows them to get the oil out of the ground and pays a licence fee once efficiencies are reached .
However , Iraqi officials have been at pains to insist that they still control the country 's oil sector .
ExxonMobil was awarded 80 % of the West Qurna contract , with Shell .
A second licensing round is scheduled for December , in which contracts to develop up to five more fields are up for grabs .
The president of ExxonMobil Upstream Ventures , Richard Vierbuchen , was in Baghdad to sign the contract .
• This article was amended on 6 November 2009 .
ExxonMobil has agreed to increase oil production to 2.25 million barrels a day , not 2.25 billion .
This has been corrected .

The rabidly right - wing yet still influential Investors Business Daily opines against health care reform saying :
People such as scientist Stephen Hawking would n’t have a chance in the U.K. , where the National Health Service would say the life of this brilliant man , because of his physical handicaps , is essentially worthless .
Of course , Stephen Hawking is and always has been British – having lived and worked and been taken care of by this system .
All this is to say nothing of the various other canards raised – namely that any of the current plans being debated bear any resemblance to the British single - payer and entirely government - run system .
The editorial also explains :
The British have succeeded in putting a price tag on human life , as we are about to .
Matt Yglesias nicely parries this point :
[ A ]s with all anti-rationing talk you really have to wonder what rightwingers think happens in a free market system .
In a pure market , your life is worth what you ’re able to pay .
The way the free market works , if an indigent woman gives birth to a premature infant you let the infant die .
Thankfully , no country — not even the US of A — is actually sufficiently committed to free market principles to let infants die like that .

A LITTLE BACKGROUND
Think of the about - to - be - released N900 as atonement for past sins committed by Nokia .
The disaster that is Symbian , the anemic - ness of the Ovi store , the conspicuous lack of CDMA devices all seem , well , not so horrible after playing with this Linux based , open source , unlocked internet tablet .
Nokia recently gave us a not - so - finished version of the N900 to play with .
Here ’s what we think after tinkering with it for a week .
Bonus :
We ’ve got video too !
MAEMO NUMBER 5
The N900 flaunts the Maemo 5 operating system .
A mostly ( 80 % ) open source Linux build , it ’s certainly more usable than any version of Symbian .
First off it ’s a multitasking powerhouse — we loved the fact that you could stream tunes from a website like Hype Machine then open up another webpage , snap a picture or access twitter without interrupting the music flow .
Programs are represented by widgets , which can be moved around different screens with relative ease and apps can be easily downloaded from the sparse Ovi store .
SCREEN SAVER
The N900 has a 3.5 - inch resistive touch screen .
Most resistive screens we ’ve encountered thus far tend to be slow and unresponsive .
The N900 ’s is n’t .
Although it comes with a stylus , you largely do n’t need it — actions like text typing and web browsing can be done with just a finger .
Zooming in and out is done without a pinch , literally .
When you want to enlarge something on screen , take your finger ( or better yet , the stylus ) and make a small clockwise circle .
Making a counter clockwise circle zooms out .
PHONE HOME
Almost like an afterthought , the N900 functions as an unlocked cell phone .
We popped in SIMs from AT&T and T - Mobile and the N900 made calls without much interference or static .
Do n’t have a SIM ?
No prob .
There ’s VoIP and Skype integration too .
SHOOTER MCGAVIN
The N900 ’s camera has a Carl Zeiss lens , protected by a plastic slide , and a bright Xenon flash .
Pictures are generally noise free and clear while the included photo editing software rivals that of most cell phones .
FENNEC FAIL
Mozilla ’s mobile browser , Flock Fennec is sadly nowhere to be found on this device .
No big deal — a custom made Mozilla browser is included for all your Intertubing needs .
There ’ s support for Adobe Flash 9.4 plus an RSS reader as well .
LIMITED POWER
Battery life is n’t exactly Methuselah - like .
Our unit conked out after a day of hard use ( read : constant web surfing , making calls , shooting pictures ) but we expect slightly better power management from the production device .
A DELICIOUS WRAP
The N900 will start shipping around the end of November and will cost $ 650 .
We ’ll have a full review on the finished hardware before then .
So far the N900 shows a great deal of promise — Nokia is definitely doing the right thing when it comes to an open platform and a lack of Symbian .
Now if only they could get a carrier to subsidize the device and help bring the cost down a little bit .

The LHC 's tunnel runs for 27 km under the Franco - Swiss border Engineers operating the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) have smashed together proton beams in the machine for the very first time .
The step was described as a " great achievement " for those working on the huge physics experiment .
The low - energy collisions came after researchers circulated two beams simultaneously in the LHC 's 27 km - long tunnel earlier on Monday .
The LHC is smashing together beams of protons to shed light on the cosmos .
Operated by the European Organization for Nuclear Research ( Cern ) , the LHC is the world 's largest machine and will create similar conditions to those present moments after the Big Bang .
This is great news , the start of a fantastic era of physics
Fabiola Gianotti
Atlas spokesperson Scientists will search for signs of the Higgs boson , a sub-atomic particle that is crucial to our current understanding of physics .
Although it is predicted to exist , scientists have not yet detected it .
Researchers working on the collider have said they are delighted with the quick progress made since the machine restarted on Friday .
" It 's a great achievement to have come this far in so short a time , " said Cern 's director - general Rolf Heuer .
" But we need to keep a sense of perspective - there 's still much to do before we can start the LHC physics programme . "
Smashing news Housed in a tunnel 100 m beneath the Franco - Swiss border , the LHC uses some 1,200 " superconducting " magnets to bend proton beams in opposite directions around the tunnel at close to the speed of light .
At allotted points around the " ring " , the proton beams cross , smashing into one another with enormous energy .
Large " detector " machines located at these crossing points will scour the wreckage of the collisions for discoveries that could roll back the frontiers of knowledge .
The giant Atlas detector was the first to see collisions
The four main detectors at the LHC are : Atlas , the Compact Muon Solenoid ( CMS ) , Alice and LHCb .
Atlas and CMS are so - called multi-purpose detectors , while Alice and LHCb are designed with more specific scientific investigations in mind .
Cern 's director of communications , Dr James Gillies , said the first collisions had taken place just as a news conference was under way on Monday to discuss progress following the machine 's restart at the weekend .
" We did n't have time to analyse them then .
We waited until all four of the ( detectors ) had seen good candidates ( for collisions ) , " he told BBC News .
Quick progress
The giant Atlas detector was the first to record candidate collisions at 1322 GMT .
But CMS failed to see any on the first try .
Alice and LHCb saw their first candidate collisions after 1600 GMT .
Operators then went back and adjusted the beam to generate collisions in the Compact Muon Solenoid detector .
This time , they were successful , with the first candidates seen at around 1820 GMT .
Fabiola Gianotti , spokesperson for the Atlas scientific team , commented : " This is great news , the start of a fantastic era of physics and hopefully discoveries after 20 years ' work by the international community . "
The spokesperson for the Alice experiment , Jurgen Schukraft , said cheers erupted with the first collisions .
" This is simply tremendous , " he said .
Engineers restarted the LHC on Friday evening after a 14 - month hiatus while the machine was being repaired .
It had to be shut down shortly after its inauguration when an electrical fault led to magnets being damaged and to one tonne of liquid helium leaking into the tunnel .

NVIDIA IS KILLING the GTX260 , GTX275 , and GTX285 with the GTX295 almost assured to follow as it ( Nvidia : NVDA ) abandons the high and mid range graphics card market .
Due to a massive series of engineering failures , nearly all of the company ’s product line is financially under water , and mismanagement seems to be killing the company .
Not even an hour after we laid out the financial woes surrounding the Nvidia GTX275 and GTX260 , word reached us that they are dead .
Normally , this would be an update to the original article , but this news has enough dire implications that it needs its own story .
Nvidia is in desperate shape , whoop - ass has turned to ash , and the wagons ca n’t be circled any tighter .
Word from sources deep in the bowels of 2701 San Tomas Expressway tell us that the OEMs have been notified that the GTX285 is EOL ’d , the GTX260 is EOL in November or December depending on a few extraneous issues , and the GTX275 will be EOL ’d within 2 weeks .
I would expect this to happen around the time ATI launches its Juniper based boards , so before October 22 .
The lone survivor , maybe , is the GTX295 , available only as a complete board from Nvidia .
This is said to be almost impossible to get , likely for reasons we went into in the earlier financial article , cost .
AIBs do not expect this product to last very long , likely until current stock is depleted .
Basically , engineering failure after engineering failure has left Nvidia without a high end part .
It is left waving shells while trying desperately to convince the loyal press that it is real .
While that is a problem for the future , the current concern is that it has nothing that can compete with ATI ’s Evergreen line , HD5870 , HD5850 , and the upcoming Junipers .
The G200 b based parts can compete on performance , but not at a profit , so they are going to die .
Nvidia was booted out of the high end market , and is now abandoning the mid range in a humbling retreat .
Expect a similar backpedaling from the rest in January when Cedar and Redwood come out .
There are no half or quarter Fermi derivatives taped out yet , so at a bare minimum , Nvidia has nothing for 2 more quarters .
To make matters worse , due to the obscene 530 + + mm ^2 die size on TSMC ’s 40nm process , Fermi is almost twice the size of its competitor , Cypress / HD5870 / HD5850 .
A cut down half version would cost less but still be barely competitive with Juniper .
That chip would once again be vastly larger and more expensive than the ATI equivalents , and that is before board costs are examined .
As the product stack waterfalls down , the ratios remain the same , Nvidia cannot be cost competitive for the Evergreen vs Fermi generation , period .
Massive engineering failures and cover-ups , starting with Bumpgate , have defined the company for the last two years .
More recently , this includes the G212 failure , G214 fiasco and failure , now morphed into the G215 which is 3Q late so far , if it can ever be made profitably , and the G216 and G218 with the broken GDDR5 controllers .
One or two failures are understandable , this many is flat out mismanagement .
As we have been saying all along , there is no savior chip , no plan B , they all failed .
Nvidia can make chips and sell them at a loss , or retreat from those markets and lose less money .
The only question now is whether or not it can fix its engineering problems and get competitive parts out before it runs out of cash .
Given that the earliest that this can happen is next summer , it will be very touch and go .
Nvidia has alienated anyone who could be its friend , spawned needless lawsuits that very likely drive the company to a net negative value , and failed to sell the company while it still had a perception of worth .
If you ask it , Nvidia will tell you that it is boldly turning itself into a vibrant GPU compute and cell phone chip giant .
Should you want to remain in its good graces , this is not to be perceived as an exit strategy .
With the cancellation of the GTX285 , GTX275 , and GTX260 , possibly the GTX295 too , Nvidia is abandoning the entire high end and mid-range graphics market .
Expect a reprise in January on the low end .
The company is badly mismanaged and hated by the very partners it needs to throw it a life preserver .
The only thing that can save Nvidia now is a wholesale replacement of top management .
Sadly , the only people with enough shareholder leverage to do so are those very managers that need to go , so that is very unlikely .
Unless there is a white knight or buyer in the wings , it is game over .
At $ 1 per year , Jen -Hsun is overpaid .

Bunnies for Biofuel : How Sweden Heats its Homes Thousands of rabbits in Sweden are being shot , deep - frozen and burned for fuel .
October 14 , 2009  --
Thousands of rabbits , some of them pets abandoned by their owners , are being shot , deep - frozen and burned in a heating plant in Sweden , a professional hunter who works for the city of Stockholm said on Tuesday .
The center of the Swedish capital is being plagued by thousands of rabbits , some of them wild and some of them stray pets , and 3,000 have been culled this year , down from 6,000 in 2008 , Tommy Tuvunger , who hunts rodents for the Stockholm city administration , told SPIEGEL ONLINE .
" We are shooting rabbits in Stockholm center , they are a very big problem , " said Tuvunger .
The rabbits are eating their way through the city 's central parks .
" Once culled , the rabbits are frozen and when we have enough ; a contractor comes and takes them away . "
Tuvunger said it was normal for animal carcasses to be processed for fuel .
" The contractor does n't just pick up rabbits , he also picks up cats , deer , horses and cows , " said Tuvunger .
The frozen bunnies are shipped to a heating plant in Karlskoga in central Sweden which uses them as biofuel and incinerates them to heat homes , media reports said .
A spokeswoman for the plant declined to comment .
The plant 's supplier , Konvex , a company that produces biofuels from animals , could not immediately be reached for comment .
Konvex is a subsidiary of Danish group Daka Biodiesel , which says on its
Web site that it produces and markets biodiesel and bio fuel oil using animal fat extracted from " by - products from slaughterhouses and primary agriculture . "
Practice Receives Criticism
The practice of killing rabbits and incinerating has been criticized by Sweden 's Society for the Protection of Wild Rabbits .
" Those who support the culling of rabbits surely think it 's good to use the bodies for a good cause .
But it feels like they 're trying to turn the animals into an industry rather than look at the main problem , " Anna Johannesson of the society told Vårt Kungsholmen newspaper , news Web site The Local reported
Johannesson said there other methods of getting rid of rabbits besides killing them , such as spraying park plants with a chemical that makes them unappetizing to rabbits .
But Tuvunger says that does n't work .
" If you do that you only move the problem 100 meters away . "
Karl Szmolinsky , one of Germany 's best - known breeders who has won prizes for his giant rabbits , said he could n't imagine using the animals for biofuel .
" I would never have given mine away for that , " he told SPIEGEL ONLINE .
Szmolinsky , who gained fame for exporting several rabbits to North Korea , has given up breeding due to illness in the family .
There is something familiar about the tide of misinformation which has swept through the subject of sex trafficking in the UK : it flows through exactly the same channels as the now notorious torrent about Saddam Hussein 's weapons .
In the story of UK sex trafficking , the conclusions of academics who study the sex trade have been subjected to the same treatment as the restrained reports of intelligence analysts who studied Iraqi weapons – stripped of caution , stretched to their most alarming possible meaning and tossed into the public domain .
There , they have been picked up by the media who have stretched them even further in stories which have then been treated as reliable sources by politicians , who in turn provided quotes for more misleading stories .
In both cases , the cycle has been driven by political opportunists and interest groups in pursuit of an agenda .
In the case of sex trafficking , the role of the neo-conservatives and Iraqi exiles has been played by an unlikely union of evangelical Christians with feminist campaigners , who pursued the trafficking tale to secure their greater goal , not of regime change , but of legal change to abolish all prostitution .
The sex trafficking story is a model of misinformation .
It began to take shape in the mid 1990s , when the collapse of economies in the old Warsaw Pact countries saw the working flats of London flooded with young women from eastern Europe .
Soon , there were rumours and media reports that attached a new word to these women .
They had been " trafficked " .
And , from the outset , that word was a problem .
On a strict definition , eventually expressed in international law by the 2000 Palermo protocol , sex trafficking involves the use of force , fraud or coercion to transport an unwilling victim into sexual exploitation .
This image of sex slavery soon provoked real public anxiety .
But a much looser definition , subsequently adopted by the UK's 2003 Sexual Offences
Act , uses the word to describe the movement of all sex workers , including willing professionals who are simply travelling in search of a better income .
This wider meaning has injected public debate with confusion and disproportionate anxiety .
Two academics from the University of North London , Liz Kelly and Linda Regan , tried to estimate the number of women who had been trafficked in the UK during the calendar year 1998 , an exercise which they honestly described as " problematic " .
First , there was the problem of the word , which Kelly and Regan solved by accepting all variations of its meaning .
Then , there was the shortage of facts .
They spoke to specialists , studied news reports and surveyed police , who reported that 71 women had been " trafficked " , whether willingly or not , during 1998 .
In Stopping Traffic , which they published in May 2000 , Kelly and Regan argued that the real scale of the problem was probably bigger than this and , in the absence of any accurate data , they made various assumptions which they themselves described as " speculative " .
At the very least , they guessed , there could be another 71 trafficked women who had been missed by police , which would double the total , to 142 .
At the most , they suggested , the true total might be 20 times higher , at 1,420 .
But reaching this figure involved a further quadrupling of the number of victims missed by police , plus quadrupling existing estimates by sex health workers , plus assuming the accuracy of a newspaper report that " hundreds " of women had been trafficked into the UK from Albania and Kosovo , plus assuming that mail - order brides were also victims of trafficking , plus adding women who were transported within the UK as well as those brought into the UK .
Kelly and Regan were transparent and honest about the speculative character of their assumptions .
They were clear about their adoption of the widest possible meaning of the term .
They presented their conclusion with caution : " It can be estimated that the true scale of trafficking may be between two and 20 times that which has been confirmed . "
And they presented their conclusion as a range of possibilities : " It is recognised that this is a wide range , but it indicates the likely scale of the problem while reflecting the poverty of information in this area . "
During the following years , the subject attracted the attention of religious groups , particularly the Salvation Army and an umbrella group of evangelicals called Churches Alert to Sex Trafficking Across Europe ( Chaste ) .
Chaste explicitly campaigned for an end to all prostitution and , quoting their commitment to the principles of the Kingdom of God , they were enlisted as specialist advisers to the police .
Chaste took the work of Kelly and Regan , brought the estimate forward by two years , stripped out all the caution , headed for the maximum end of the range and declared :
" An estimated 1,420 women were trafficked into the UK in 2000 for the purposes of constrained prostitution . "
The misleading figure was repeated in news stories and adopted by politicians .
Even the government 's Crimestoppers campaign recycled it .
And over and over again , the absence of a definition in the original work was replaced with the certainty that this was about women who were forced to work against their will .
Chaste spoke repeatedly about " sexual enslavement " and " sex slavery " .
Three years after the Kelly / Regan work was published , in 2003 , a second team of researchers was commissioned by the Home Office to tackle the same area .
They , too , were forced to make a set of highly speculative assumptions : that every single foreign woman in the " walk - up " flats in Soho had been smuggled into the country and forced to work as a prostitute ; that the same was true of 75 % of foreign women in other flats around the UK and of 10 % of foreign women working for escort agencies .
Crunching these percentages into estimates of the number of foreign women in the various forms of sex work , they came up with an estimate of 3,812 women working against their will in the UK sex trade .
Margin of error
The researchers ringed this figure with warnings .
The data , they said , was " very poor " and quantifying the subject was " extremely difficult " .
Their final estimate was " very approximate " , " subject to a very large margin of error " and " should be treated with great caution " and the figure of 3,812 " should be regarded as an upper bound " .
No chance .
In June 2006 , before the research had even been published , the then Home Office minister Vernon Coaker ignored the speculative nature of the assumptions behind the figure , stripped out all the caution , headed for the maximum end of the range and then rounded it up , declaring to an inquiry into sex trafficking by the Commons joint committee on human rights : " There are an estimated 4,000 women victims . "
The Christian charity Care announced : " In 2003 , the Home Office estimated there were 4,000 women and girls in the UK at any one time that had been trafficked into forced prostitution . "
The Salvation Army went further : " The Home Office estimated that in 2003 ... there were at least 4,000 trafficked women residing in the UK .
This figure is believed to be a massive underestimation of the problem . "
Anti-Slavery International joined them , converting what the Home Office researchers had described as a " very approximate " estimate into " a very conservative estimate " .
The Home Office , at least , having commissioned the research , was in a position to remind everybody of its authors ' warnings .
Except it did n't .
In March 2007 , it produced the UK Action Plan on Human Trafficking and casually reproduced the figure of 4,000 without any of the researchers ' cautions .
The evidence was left even further behind as politicians took up the issue as a rallying call for feminists .
They were led by the Labour MP for Rotherham and former Foreign Office minister Denis MacShane , who took to describing London as " Europe 's capital for under - aged trafficked sex slaves " .
In a debate in the Commons in November 2007 , MacShane announced that " according to Home Office estimates , 25,000 sex slaves currently work in the massage parlours and brothels of Britain . "
There is simply no Home Office source for that figure , although it has been reproduced repeatedly in media stories .
Two months later , in another Commons debate , MacShane used the same figure , but this time he attributed it to the Daily Mirror , which had indeed run a story in October 2005 with the headline " 25,000 Sex Slaves on the Streets of Britain . "
However , the newspaper had offered no evidence at all to support the figure .
On the contrary , the body of its story used a much lower figure , of between 2,000 and 6,000 brought in each year , and attributed this to unnamed Home Office officials , even though the Home Office has never produced any research which could justify it .
MacShane was not deterred .
" I used to work for the Daily Mirror , so I trust the report , " he said .
Sources
The then solicitor general , Vera Baird , replied by warning MacShane that " we think that his numbers from the Daily Mirror are off " and then recycled the figure of 4,000 without any of the researchers ' cautions .
MacShane then switched line and started to claim , for example in a letter to the Guardian in September 2008 , that there were " 18,000 women , often young girls , trafficked into Britain as sex slaves . "
He used this same figure in another debate in the House of Commons , adding " We have to get the facts and figures right . "
On this occasion , the source he was quoting was Pentameter Two , the six - month national police operation which failed to find a single person who had forced anybody into prostitution .
But MacShane had a point : presenting the results of the operation to the press in July 2008 , its operational head , Tim Brain , the chief constable of Gloucester , was widely reported to have said that there were now 18,000 victims of trafficking in the UK and that this included under - age girls .
Other senior figures who were involved with this press conference say they were taken completely by surprise by Brain 's claim .
" None of us knew where that came from , " according to one senior figure .
" It was n't in his pre-brief .
It was n't in anything : ministers were n't briefed .
Tim may have meant to say 1,800 and just got his figures mixed up . "
Brain now agrees that the figure is not correct and suggested to the Guardian that he had been trying to estimate the total number of prostitutes in the UK , not the total number of trafficked women .
But the damage had been done .
Patrick Hall , Labour MP for Bedford , solemnly told the House of Commons that there was sex trafficking " in towns and villages throughout the land . "
Fiona Mactaggart , a former Home Office minister , in January 2008 outstripped MacShane 's estimates , telling the House of Commons that she regarded all women prostitutes as the victims of trafficking , since their route into sex work " almost always involves coercion , enforced addiction to drugs and violence from their pimps or traffickers . "
There is no known research into UK prostitution which supports this claim .
In November 2008 , Mactaggart repeated a version of the same claim when she told BBC Radio 4's Today in Parliament that " something like 80 % of women in prostitution are controlled by their drug dealer , their pimp , or their trafficker . "
Again , there is no known source for this .
Challenged to justify this figure by a different Radio 4 programme , More or Less , in January 2009 , Mactaggart claimed that it comes from the Home Office 's 2004 report on prostitution , Paying the Price .
But there is no sign of the figure in the report .
In the summer of 2004 , The Poppy Project , which is committed to ending all prostitution on the grounds that it " helps to construct and maintain gender inequality " , surveyed London prostitutes working in flats and found that 80 % of them were foreign , a finding which is well supported .
They then added , without any clear evidence , that " a large proportion of them are likely to have been trafficked into the country " , a conclusion which is challenged by specialist police , but which was then recycled through numerous media reports and political claims .
Last year ( 2008 ) , Poppy published a report called The Big Brothel , which claimed to be the most comprehensive study ever conducted into brothels in the UK and which claimed to have found " indicators of trafficking in every borough of London " .
That report was subsequently condemned in a joint statement from 27 specialist academics who complained that it was " framed by a pre-existing political view of prostitution " .
The academics said there were " serious flaws " in the way that data had been collected and analysed ; that the reliability of the data was " extremely doubtful " ; and that the claims about trafficking " cannot be substantiated . "
Illusion
But by that time , the report had generated a mass of news stories , most of which took the unreliable results and overstated them .
Like Chaste , the Poppy Project , which has been paid nearly £ 6 m to shelter trafficked women , has been drafted in to advise police and until recently used office space in the Sheffield headquarters of the UK Human Trafficking Centre .
The cacophony of voices has created the illusion of confirmation .
Politicians and religious groups still repeat the media story that 40,000 prostitutes were trafficked into Germany for the 2006 world cup – long after leaked police documents revealed there was no truth at all in the tale .
The Daily Mirror 's baseless claim of 25,000 trafficking victims is still being quoted , recently , for example , by the Salvation Army in written evidence to the home affairs select committee , in which they added : " Other studies done by media have suggested much higher numbers . "
Somewhere beneath all this , there is a reality .
There have been real traffickers .
Since the Sexual Offences
Act came into force in January 2004 , internal police documents show that 46 men and women have been convicted and jailed for transporting willing sex workers and 59 people have been convicted for transporting women who were forced to work as prostitutes .
Ruth Breslin , research and development manager for Eaves , which runs the Poppy project , said : " I realise that the 25,000 figure , which is one that has been bandied about in the media , is one that does n't really have much of an evidence base and may be slightly subject to media hype .
There is an awful lot of confusion in the media and other places between trafficking ( unwilling victims ) and smuggling ( willing passengers ) .
People do get confused and they are two very different things . "
She said that in the six and a half years since Poppy was founded , a total of 1,387 men and women had been referred to them , of whom they had taken in just over 500 women who they believed had been trafficked into sexual exploitation or domestic servitude by the use of coercion , deception or force .
" I do think that there a lot more trafficked women out there than the women we see in our project .
I do think there are significant numbers .
I would say the figure is in the thousands .
I do n't know about the tens of thousands .
That 's probably going too far . "
Certainly there have been real victims , some of whom have been compensated as victims of crime .
The internal analysis of Pentameter Two , obtained by the Guardian , reveals that after six months of raids across the UK , 11 women were finally " made safe " .
This clashes with early police claims that Pentameter had rescued 351 victims .
By the time that Brain held his press conference in July last year , that figure had been reduced to 167 victims who were said to have been " saved from lives of abuse , exploitation and misery " .
However , the internal analysis shows that supposed victims variously absconded from police , went home voluntarily , declined support , were removed by the UK Borders Agency or were prosecuted for various offences .
Dealing with this , the document explains : " The number of ' potential victims ' has been refined as more informed decisions have been made about whether or not the individual is believed to be a victim of human trafficking for sexual exploitation ...
Initial considerations were made on limited information ...
When interviewed , the potential victim may make it clear that they are not in fact a victim of trafficking and / or inquiries may make it clear that they are not and / or inquiries may show that initial consideration was based on false or incomplete information . "
Research published recently by Dr Nick Mai of London Metropolitan University , concludes that , contrary to public perception , the majority of migrant sex workers have chosen prostitution as a source of " dignified living conditions and to increase their opportunities for a better future while dramatically improving the living conditions of their families in the country of origin " .
After detailed interviews with 100 migrant sex workers in the UK , Mai found : " For the majority , working in the sex industry was a way to avoid the exploitative working conditions they had met in their previous non-sexual jobs . "
The UK Network of Sex Work Projects , whose outreach workers deal with thousands of prostitutes , told the home affairs select committee last year : " It is undoubtedly the case that women are trafficked into the sex industry .
However , the proportion of sex workers of whom this is true is relatively small , both compared to the sex industry as a whole and to other industries . "
The chairman of that committee , Keith Vaz , observed : " We are told that this is the second largest problem facing the globe after drugs and we do not seem to be able to find the people responsible . "
For the police , the misinformation has succeeded in diverting resources away from other victims .
Specialist officers who deal with trafficking have told the Guardian that although they will continue to monitor all forms of trafficking , they are now shifting their priority away from the supposed thousands of sex slaves towards the movement within the UK of children who are being sexually abused .
They say they are also dealing with more cases where illegal migrant workers of all kinds , including willing sex workers , find themselves being ripped off and overcharged for their transport .
Unheard
However , the key point is that on the sidelines of a debate which has been dominated by ideology , a chorus of alarm from the prostitutes themselves is singing out virtually unheard .
In the cause of protecting " thousands " of victims of trafficking , Harriet Harman , the deputy Labour leader and minister for women and equality , has led the parliamentary campaign for a law to penalise men who pay for sex with women who are " controlled for gain " even if the men do so in genuine ignorance .
Repeatedly , prostitutes groups have argued that the proposal is as wrong as the trafficking estimates on which it is based , and that it will aggravate every form of jeopardy which they face in their work , whether by encouraging them to work alone in an attempt to show that they are free of control or by pressurising them to have sex without condoms to hold on to worried customers .
Thus far , their voices remain largely ignored by news media and politicians who , once more , have been swept away on a tide of misinformation .
• This article was amended on Thursday 19 November 2009 .
We said that the Poppy Project had an office in the Sheffield headquarters of the UK Human Trafficking Centre .
That is no longer the case .
This has been corrected .

Proposal for Ada Developer Room not accepted -
Ada at the Free and Open source Software Developers ' European Meeting ( FOSDEM '2010 )
From : Dirk Craeynest < Dirk.Craeynest@cs.kuleuven.be >
Subject : No Ada at FOSDEM 2010 ( was : Ada at FOSDEM 2010 - Call for Interest ) To : ada-belgium@cs.kuleuven.be
Date : Thu , 3 Dec 2009 21:00:11 +0100 ( MET ) [...]
This is a short status report on what has happened since we posted the appended Call for Interest roughly one month ago .
Based on the feedback we received , we have prepared a new proposal for an Ada Developers Room during the 2 days of FOSDEM 2010 next February .
Our proposal , including the full list of presentations and speakers , is available on the Ada at FOSDEM 2010 web - page at < http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/~dirk/ada-belgium/events/10/100206-fosdem.html>.
Unfortunately , we were recently informed by the organizers of FOSDEM 2010 that our proposal has not been accepted .
They wrote : " We realize that this must be disappointing news , but unfortunately we do n't have a sufficient number of rooms to our disposal to cover all requests .
Just to clarify : your request is perfectly valid , but we had to pick . "
So , after successful Ada DevRooms in 2006 and 2009 , we did n't make it for 2010 .
Thanks , everybody involved with the proposal this year .
Stay tuned for next year ...

Proposal for Developer Room -
Ada at the Free and Open source Software Developers ' European Meeting ( FOSDEM '2010 )
Ada-Belgium made a proposal for a Developer Room to hold presentations on Ada and related technologies at the Free and Open Source Software Developers ' European Meeting ( FOSDEM 2010 ) on 6 - 7 February 2010 in Brussels , Belgium .
We really enjoyed the opportunity the FOSDEM organizer gave us with the 2 - full - day Ada DevRoom at FOSDEM 2009 and as it received a true warm welcome ( several talks given in front of a full room ) , the European Ada community has once again a real motivation to attend FOSDEM 2010 .
At the time of writing ( Sun Nov 22 2009 ) speakers from various countries ( Denmark , France , Spain ) have already proposed seven interesting hour - long presentations on Ada connections to the Free Software world .
The addressed topics are as various as coverage analysis ( Couverture ) , real - time ( MAST ) , and " back to childhood project " ( with LEGO ( c ) MINDSTORMS ) .
We also plan to organize a one - hour " open forum " on each day , for informal discussions and short presentations by participants , as we learned last year it would be nice to offer more time for interactions with the audience .
And finally , a few more presentations may be confirmed in the coming weeks or months .
We apply on the same basis as last year , as we completely follow the collaborative model you gave this year to the FOSDEM devrooms project .
The 7 talks we are presenting below , together with the two open forums , would be enough to fill a DevRoom for the entire duration of the FOSDEM event ( i.e. Saturday 7th from 12:00 to 18:00 and Sunday 8th from 10:00 to 17:00 ) .
However , if necessary , we could try to make our program fit in a single day by reducing the number of talks or the time allocated to each of them .

Last update : 2009/12/03 .
GENEVA ( Reuters ) - Despite living six to eight years longer than men , women lack essential health care throughout their lives , particularly as teenagers and elderly people , the World Health Organization said on Monday .
In a report , the WHO said that women around the world are “ denied a chance to develop their full human potential ” because many critical medical needs are ignored .
“ Women generally live longer than men , but their lives are not necessarily healthy or happy , ” Margaret Chan , the head of the United Nations health agency , said at the WHO on Monday .
Though women tend to seek out medical services more often than men -- particularly before , during and after pregnancy -- they often fail to get adequate treatment to cope with violence , depression and problems related to old age , such as dementia .
“ The obstacles that stand in the way of better health for women are not primarily technical or medical in nature .
They are social and political , ” Chan said .
Childbirth assistance can be particularly hard to access for unmarried and marginalized women , teenagers and sex workers , WHO said in its first attempt to log differences between men’s and women ’s health over their lifetimes .
“ In many countries , sexual and reproductive health services tend to focus exclusively on married women and ignore the needs of unmarried women and adolescents , ” the report said .
“ Paradoxically , health systems are often unresponsive to the needs of women despite the fact that women themselves are major contributors to health , through their roles as primary care givers in the family and also health care providers , ” it said .
WHO also said some 99 percent of the estimated 500,000 women who die every year giving birth are in developing countries where medical supplies and skilled workers are in short supply .
But while emphasizing the many links between poverty and ill health , the report also stressed that many shortcomings affect women across income brackets and geographical regions .
Depression and anxiety affect far more women than men , and women are more likely to catch sexually transmitted diseases .
Women are also overwhelmingly more likely to be victims of sexual violence than men , and elderly women ’s health problems such as eyesight and hearing loss , arthritis , depression and dementia are often untreated .
Unequal access to education , employment and fair wages can also present obstacles to women ’s health , especially in markets where medical insurance is linked to work or where user fees are required to access basic services , the WHO report found .
Susan Davis reports on the latest WSJ / NBC News poll .
Nearly three - quarters of Americans believe it is extremely or quite important to give Americans the choice between a government - run health care plan and a private plan in any final health care bill , according to the latest Wall Street Journal / NBC
News poll out later today .
Some 73 % said it was important to do so — 45 % called it “ extremely ” important while 27 % said it was “ quite important . ”
On the other end , less than one quarter , 22 % , said it was either not that important ( 8 % ) or not at all important ( 15 % ) to create a health plan that would complete with private industry .
The strength of the support continues to come from self - identified Democrats , a majority of which , 56 % , said it was extremely important to include a public option .
Still , more than one in three Republicans , 34 % , also said it was extremely important , as did 39 % of independents .
While Americans overwhelming said they should have a choice in the matter , asked whether they favor or oppose the create of a public option to compete with private industry , the response was more divided .
Nearly half , 48 % , said they support the public option while 42 % said they oppose it .
Those numbers are n’t radically different from the August WSJ / NBC News poll , in which 46 % favored and 48 % opposed — but it could suggest support for the public option is growing while opposition is softening .
Click here for the full poll and here for The Wall Street Journal story on the poll .
Fake " grassroots " groups have started springing up like toadstools after a rain , and this time they 're coming at us from every angle : they 're on TV , Twitter , Facebook and YouTube : " Americans for Prosperity , " " FACES of Coal , " The " Coalition to Protect Patients ' Rights , " " Americans Against Food Taxes , " the " 60 Plus Association , " " Citizens for Better Medicare , " " Patients First " ...
It 's making our heads spin !
Issues affecting some of the country 's biggest industries , like health insurance reform , a proposal to tax sodas and sugary drinks , and the FDA 's possible reconsideration of the plastic additive Bisphenol A , have boosted corporate astroturfing up to a dizzying pace .
With all these corporate fronts coming out of the woodwork , how can citizens tell true grassroots organizations from corporate fronts operated by highly - paid PR and lobbying firms ?
Here are some tips to help readers spot this kind of big - business hanky - panky .
What is a " front group , " really ?
A front group is an organization that purports to represent one agenda while in reality it serves some other party or interest whose sponsorship is hidden or rarely mentioned .
The front group is perhaps the most easily recognized use of the third party propaganda technique .
One of the best examples is Rick Berman 's Center for Consumer Freedom ( CCF ) , which claims that its mission is to defend the rights of consumers to choose to eat , drink and smoke as they please .
In reality , though , CCF is a front group for the tobacco , restaurant and alcoholic beverage industries , which provide all or most of its funding .
Not all organizations that engage in manipulative efforts to shape public opinion can be classified as " front groups , " however .
The now - defunct Tobacco Institute was a highly deceptive industry trade and lobbying group , but it did n't hide the fact that it represented the tobacco industry .
There are also varying degrees of concealment .
The Global Climate Coalition did n't hide the fact that its funding came from oil and coal companies , but nevertheless its name alone is sufficiently misleading that it can reasonably be considered a front group .
The shadowy way front groups operate makes it difficult to know whether or not a seemingly independent grassroots group is really representing some other entity .
Thus , citizen smokers ' rights groups and organizations of bartenders or restaurant workers working against smoking bans are sometimes characterized as front groups for the tobacco industry , but it is possible that some of these groups are self - initiated ( although the tobacco industry has been known to use restaurant groups as fronts for its own interests ) .
Look for signs of astroturfing on the Web :
Does the organization list a phone number and street address on their Web site ?
If no address or phone numbers are shown , be skeptical .
If they do list an address , note where it is .
If it 's in Washington , D.C. , Google the address and / or the phone number to see what other companies or organizations share , or have shared , that same address or phone number .
D.C. is home to many of the nation 's largest professional PR and lobbying groups , and often one firm will operate several front groups with different corporate interests out of the same address .
If you find other groups share the same address , look up the groups on SourceWatch.org to see if they are front groups or not ;
If the group 's Web site only offers a contact form to fill in and no street address , telephone number or email links to staff members , be suspicious .
Likewise if the site offers a way to donate by credit card , but gives no fixed office to which you can mail a check , be suspicious ;
Check to see if the site lists the names of the group 's directors or staff .
If names are listed , search Google Web , Google News and SourceWatch for the names of the top people running the group , and see where else they have worked , and if any news articles give hints about their corporate ties ; and
Does the organization have a bus that tours the country promoting a certain point of view ?
Buses take money to operate , and a corporation may be footing the bill .
Ask who 's funding the bus .
Characteristics of a corporate front group
A front group typically has some , but not necessarily all , of the following characteristics :
Avoids mentioning its main sources of funding .
Note that this does not necessarily mean absolute concealment of sponsorship .
Some front groups go to great lengths to conceal their origins , funders and personnel links to sponsors .
However , the likelihood that these will be exposed anyway , with embarrassing consequences for a group 's credibility , has led many companies and their sponsored organizations to opt for a strategy of selective disclosure , in which funders are mentioned in an annual report or other obscure publication , but are not mentioned in the organization 's most common communications that reach the largest audience , like newsletters or Web sites ;
Is set up , operated or maintained by another organization , particularly a public relations , grassroots campaigning , polling or surveying firm or consultancy ;
Engages in actions that consistently and conspicuously benefit a third party , such as a company , industry or political candidate ;
Effectively shields a third party from liability / responsibility / culpability by making statements a corporation cannot make , but that nevertheless advance a specific corporate interest ;
Re-focuses debate about an issue onto a new or suspiciously unrelated topic , ( for example , casting the secondhand smoke as an issue of property rights ) ;
Has a misleading , feel - good name that disguises its real agenda , such as the National Wetlands Coalition , which opposed policies to protect U.S. wetlands , or Citizens for a Free Kuwait , which purported to represent U.S. citizens but was actually funded almost entirely by the royal family of Kuwait .
Sometimes the name of a front group might seem to suggest academic or political neutrality ( " Consumers ' Research , " " American Policy Center " ) , while in fact it consistently turns out opinions , research , surveys , reports , polls and other declarations that benefit the interests of a company , industry or political candidate ;
Consists of a group of vocal , " independent , " " esteemed " academic " experts " who go on national tours , put on media events , give press conferences , seminars , workshops , and give editorial board meetings around the country , etc. , who ordinarily would not seem to have the budget or financial means to carry out such events ; and
Touts repeatedly in its own communications , and is touted by third parties , as " independent , " " esteemed , " " respected , " " nonpartisan , " " credible " , etc .
An organization that only has a few of these characteristics may not be a true front group .
For example , the tobacco industry has given funding to youth organizations such as the Jaycees and 4 - H clubs , which serves a public relations goal by helping the industry cultivate an image of corporate responsibility .
This PR tactic is an example of the third party technique , and organizations that trade their reputations for corporate funding may be naive , gullible or opportunistic , but this in itself would not make them a front group .
Rolling back the astroturf
Looking beyond a feel - good name , like Americans - for - Something - Sane - and - Sensible , and examine what a group really seeks to do is just the first step in countering the proliferation of astroturf groups .
More importantly , you -- along with other curious citizens -- can help document in our collaborative SourceWatch wiki site groups that you consider could be front groups .
Many of the profiles on front groups in SourceWatch started out as a simple one or two sentence article created by citizens who were unsure whether a group was legitimate or not .
As profiles expand , it becomes easier to make an informed judgement on the origins and agenda of a group .
Perhaps just as importantly , a profile created in SourceWatch on a newly founded front group is likely to quickly be in the top results of as web search , enabling web - connected citizens and journalists to access referenced material on what is known about a group .
If you have never added material to SourceWatch before , do n't worry !
Our regular editors are at hand to help get you started .
If you have never edited a SourceWatch article , you can register here , and learn more about adding information to the site here , here and here .
As people get more savvy about recognizing corporate front group activity , PR and lobbying firms can respond in one of two ways .
They could opt to go to even greater lengths to obscure the origins and funding of groups they form .
Or , they could abandon the practice of creating astroturf groups because increased citizen journalism meant that groups were being exposed so soon after they were created that clients decided to save their dollars and spare themselves the embarrassment .
Documenting the activities of front groups is perhaps the single most important step in helping roll back the rise of astroturf groups .
[ ANNOUNCE ] xorg - server 1.7.0
The X. Org X Server 1.7.0 is now available .
A few fixes went in since RC3 , all of them addressing blocker bugs , one build fix .
And with that , I hand over master to Keith , our release manager for 1.8 .
I 'll continue to do 1.7 releases until further notice .
1.7.1 will be released in 3 weeks from today unless a severe issue requires an earlier release .
For 1.7.x development , I 'll follow airlied 's suggestion to use a branch for 1.7.x nominations .
To get your patch into 1.7.1 , get the patch on master and cherry - pick to the server - 1.7 - nominations branch .
I 'll be merging that into server - 1.7 , simply reverting patches that can't be merged .
This exposes us to better testing : anyone testing a patch on the nominations branch will automatically test all other patches on there .
Additionally , it is significantly easier to test a branch than a collection of links from a wiki .
A short and incomplete summary of some of the more visible and / or interesting features of 1.7.0 : == Default build uses shave ==
An easily visible change for is the default use of shave macros to improve the SNR in the make output .
To disable shave , either pass -- disable - shave to configure or run " make V=1 " .
== Revised input event handling ==
The server now uses its own internal event format for input events instead of the protocol wire format .
This allows for more information to be stored during event processing without requiring ABI breaks .
== XI2 / Multi-Pointer X == Support for multiple simultaneous cursors and keyboard foci and the matching API to make use of it .
Note that the XI2 API is intentionally kept small to discover the extent of APIs needed to support complex multi-user applications .
== Mandatory XKB ==
The XKB code has seen a fair bit of cleanup and removal of code path duplications .
XKB cannot be disabled at compile - time anymore and the presence of XKB data files is required at server startup .
== VGA arbitration support == VGA arbitration re-enables support for multiple graphics cards by controlling which one of the multiple cards gets the VGA commands .
This also brings back support for multi-seat setups .
Requires libpciaccess and kernel 2.6.32 .
== EXA mixed pixmaps support ==
This supports runtime migration of pixmaps between EXA ( in - server ) and the driver .
Pixmaps may be handled by the server and / or the driver now , as opposed to previous versions that required the set of pixmaps to be exclusively in the driver or in the server .
== Support for symbol visibility ==
The default option is to compile with hidden symbols .
Functions not marked as _X_EXPORT in the source will not be exported in the binary .
The transision to hidden symbols is not complete yet , there are many exported symbols that are currently exported but not part of the real ABI .
== XDMX support ==
The distributed multiheaded X DDX has been re-enabled and fixed up to work again .
Xdmx is essentially a X proxy server that renders to multiple back - end X servers , allowing for display - walls consisting of multiple different machines all running a standard X server .
== XQuartz == " For the first time in years , we actually have a usable XQuartz server built from an authoritative X. Org release . "
- Jeremy Huddleston , XQuartz maintainer .
That says it all .
== Disabled features == Regrettably , RECORD is still disabled , we did n't manage to fix it in time .
See Bug 20500 .
Direct graphics acess from DGA is now permanently disabled , but with considerably less regret .

TODAY is the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall .
During this time of reflection , it is common to emphasize the miraculous nature of the events that began that day : a dream seemed to come true , the Communist regimes collapsed like a house of cards , and the world suddenly changed in ways that had been inconceivable only a few months earlier .
Who in Poland could ever have imagined free elections with Lech Walesa as president ?
However , when the sublime mist of the velvet revolutions was dispelled by the new democratic - capitalist reality , people reacted with an unavoidable disappointment that manifested itself , in turn , as nostalgia for the “ good old ” Communist times ; as rightist , nationalist populism ; and as renewed , belated anti-Communist paranoia .
The first two reactions are easy to comprehend .
The same rightists who decades ago were shouting , “ Better dead than red ! ” are now often heard mumbling , “ Better red than eating hamburgers . ”
But the Communist nostalgia should not be taken too seriously : far from expressing an actual wish to return to the gray Socialist reality , it is more a form of mourning , of gently getting rid of the past .
As for the rise of the rightist populism , it is not an Eastern European specialty , but a common feature of all countries caught in the vortex of globalization .
Much more interesting is the recent resurgence of anti-Communism from Hungary to Slovenia .
During the autumn of 2006 , large protests against the ruling Socialist Party paralyzed Hungary for weeks .
Protesters linked the country ’s economic crisis to its rule by successors of the Communist party .
They denied the very legitimacy of the government , although it came to power through democratic elections .
When the police went in to restore civil order , comparisons were drawn with the Soviet Army crushing the 1956 anti-Communist rebellion .
Recently by Gary North : On Sacrificing for an Idea
Wall Street is an economic extension of the big banks , which are the government - protected segment of a government - created cartel : the national bank system .
The government controls entry into this cartel , thus offering above - market rates of return to those who are approved .
The primary enforcer of this cartel is the Federal Reserve System .
The FED provides the fiat money that in turn provides banks with reserves to lend .
It also serves as the lender of last resort — officially , to the government ; operationally , to the banks .
This keeps the largest banks from having to face free market competition .
We can use this syllogism :
As goes the Federal Reserve System so go the big banks .
As go the big banks , so goes Wall Street .
Wall Street is hostile to any suggestion that the U. S. government has any legitimate authority to audit its creation : the Federal Reserve System .
The government ’s authority must be limited to enforcing the barrier to entry in banking .
Anything beyond this is conceptually and operationally illegitimate .
This is the party line of the Wall Street establishment .
It has been since before the creation of the FED in 1913 .
The Federal Reserve was the joint product of a mutually beneficial alliance between the Morgan bank and the largest Rockefeller bank .
The story of this alliance is here .
The Federal Reserve System has been described as the Temple .
That is because , ever since 1914 , it has been sacrosanct : above politics and above the law .
It has also been the inner sanctum .
No unauthorized person is allowed to open its door .
Congressman Ron Paul dared to introduce a bill , H.R. 1207 , that would require an audit of the FED by a government agency .
The House of Representatives agrees with him .
He got over 300 co-signers of the bill .
Barney Frank at first tried to bottle it up in committee .
Then he tried to substitute a watered - down version .
The committee voted for Paul ’s version last week .
This was a palace revolt against Frank .
This does not happen often in any committee .
This is the first bill in Paul ’s long career that has had widespread support .
This indicates that the Federal Reserve , for the first time since 1914 , has serious opposition in Congress .
This in an historic event .
The FED can no longer presume that Congress will treat it with kid gloves .
The Wall Street establishment understands the threat .
HACK ATTACK
Consider this hatchet piece on Ron Paul , written by a partner of a financial website , 24/7.com , one Douglas A. McIntyre .
He is a frequent author on The Huffington Post .
In assessing Ron Paul ’s career and recent effort to audit the Federal Reserve , he began with an apocryphal story about insane asylum inmates .
There is a rumor that has been around Hollywood for decades that some of the greatest silent film comedy scripts were created by screen writers who would bribe wardens at a local insane asylum to allow a patient to sit in on their story meetings .
Allegedly , some of the most hilarious moments in the history of comedic cinema came out of ideas from the minds of people who spent all of their time on locked wards .
Even the craziest person in the world can give birth to an idea which is both brilliant and intelligible .
To begin an analysis of a serious piece of legislation with an unrelated story that is obviously nuttier than the alleged inmates gives an indication of the seriousness of Mr. McIntyre ’s critique .
Mr. McIntyre continued :
Paul came up with the idea some time ago that the activities of the Federal Reserve are conducted in secret and that the public should have the right to know how , when , and to whom the nation ’s central bank lends it money .
He has finally convinced enough of his peers about the validity of his concerns .
Now , the Financial Services Committee has approved an amendment to allow government auditors the right to look at the entire balance sheet of the Federal Reserve .
Paul ’s quest to bring down the Fed has finally gotten to the point at which the Board of Governors needs to be concerned .
He ’s got that right !
This is Paul ’s position , and the Board of Governors is extremely concerned .
Paul ’s amendment is part of a larger bill that intends to deal with the consequences that any future failure of large banks might have on the global credit markets .
His program for the Fed may set a precedent that will serve as a model for the entire financial services industry .
To “ set a precedent ” means to begin a new era .
H.R. 1207 is indeed a precedent .
It marks the first time since 1914 that a branch of Congress has asserted its statutory authority over its own creation .
The legal right to audit is an assertion of legal authority .
The Board of Governors sees this .
The Fed ’s argument against Paul ’s proposal is simple and defensible .
The agency keeps important secrets including which large banks need substantial amounts of money during hard times .
The public cannot know these details because it would cause a national panic .
What if it was common knowledge that Citigroup ( NYSE:C ) had borrowed $ 100 billion in emergency funds from the agency ?
Citi ’s stock could lose 90 % of its value in a day .
The Fed wants to keep secrets to prevent runs on major banks .
The Fed , its defenders would argue , is the home to impartial financial minds that have the best interests of the nation ’s credit system at heart .
The average person would not be able to stand the strain of watching the agency ’s daily high wire act up close , certainly not during a crisis .

When Jules Verne wrote about a gigantic gun that could be used to launch people into space in the 19th century , no one expected it to become a reality .
Now physicist John Hunter has outlined the design of such a gun that he says could slash the cost of putting cargo into orbit .
The gun is based on a smaller device Hunter helped to build in the 1990s while at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ( LLNL ) in California .
With a barrel 47 metres long , it used compressed hydrogen gas to fire projectiles weighing a few kilograms at speeds of up to 3 kilometres per second .
Now Hunter and two other ex-LLNL scientists have set up a company called Quicklaunch , based in San Diego , California , to create a more powerful version of the gun .
At the Space Investment Summit in Boston last week , Hunter described a design for a 1.1 - kilometre - long gun that he says could launch 450 - kilogram payloads at 6 kilometres per second .
A small rocket engine would then boost the projectile into low - Earth orbit .

Huge g- forces
While humans would clearly be killed and conventional satellites crushed by the gun ’s huge g- forces , it could lift robust payloads such as rocket fuel .
Finding cheap ways to transport fuel into space will lower the cost of keeping the International Space Station in orbit , and in future it may be needed to supply a crewed mission to Mars .
The gun would cost $ 500 million to build , says Hunter , but individual launch costs would be lower than current methods .
“ We think it ’s at least a factor of 10 cheaper than anything else , ” he says .
Franklin Chang - Diaz , a former astronaut and physicist at the Ad Astra Rocket Company based in Webster , Texas , says a launch gun might make more sense on the moon , where there is no atmosphere .
“ You do n’t have to worry about drag or heating or anything like that , ” he says .
Welder ’s torch
Hunter acknowledges that the projectile would be slowed by its passage through Earth ’s atmosphere .
But he says drag would be minimal on a pointy - nosed projectile , causing it to slow by only half a kilometre per second .
He also admits that the heat generated by the high - speed passage through the atmosphere is “ like a welder ’s torch ” .
However , it would be relatively short - lived , he says , with the projectile clearing the atmosphere in less than 100 seconds .
Designing the projectile so that it could survive having some layers of its outer skin burned off would get around this problem , Hunter says .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Some 18 million smart meters are set to make their way into American homes as part of the economic stimulus plan focusing on energy efficiency , Energy Department officials said Tuesday .
The meters , which are designed to more effectively communicate with utilities and appliances , and help consumers manage their electricity more efficiently , are being distributed by utilities around the country with partial funding from the federal government that was allocated under the stimulus plan .
The 18 million meters represent roughly 13 % of all electricity meters nationwide .
Ultimately , the administration hopes to distribute 40 million smart meters over the next few years .
The smart meters are part of a wider government effort to upgrade the nation 's aging utility grid .
The government announced $ 3.4 billion in funding Tuesday to help move the country toward a so - called smart grid .
Utilities are putting in another $ 4.7 billion in matching funds .
According to the White House , these investments could reduce U.S. electricity use by 4 % a year .
The money is part of nearly $ 100 billion in spending and tax cuts the government authorized under the stimulus plan for a variety of energy projects .
Other projects announced Tuesday include the modernization of electric substations and transmission centers .
All told , 100 projects were announced Tuesday in 49 states that are expected to create tens of thousand of jobs across the country .
The White House billed it as the largest single energy grid modernization effort in the country 's history .
Experts have long said the country needs to update its electricity grid , much of which was built during the early part of last century , if it is to deliver power more efficiently and handle electricity generated from sources such as wind and solar .
The funding announced Tuesday is just a fraction of what experts say is needed to build new transmission lines , computerize substations and meters , and build storage devices for a modern utility grid .
The Obama administration on Wednesday said it will use leftover funds from the $ 700 billion financial bailout to help small businesses .
The new plan would use some funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) to increase lending at smaller and more community - based banks .

Banks would be required to submit plans on how they would lend to small businesses to secure the funds .
Senior administration officials said they could not yet provide an estimate on the size of the program , but maintained that there are sufficient funds left in TARP to finance the initiative .
A report from the TARP ’s official watchdog estimated that there is $ 317 billion left in the program , a sum that includes funds paid back to the government by some banks .
The effort comes as bigger banks on such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase are recording record profits a year after the financial crisis .
Businesses , however , are still running into problems in winning loans from smaller banks , which have not seen the same recovery as the giants on Wall Street .
“ Small businesses are still facing a perfect storm in terms of a too - weak labor market , the remnants of the financial crisis , and continuing credit problems going forward , ” a senior administration official said in a conference call with reporters .
“ We 've decided we 're going to wait to go through our consultations to see the degree of demand , ” the official said .
“ These programs announced today are clearly programs that can be done within the existing resources that are available .
They are not dependent upon repayments . ”
The administration will also seek legislation to allow the Small Business Administration ( SBA ) to dole out larger loans to businesses .
In addition , the president will ask Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and SBA Administrator Karen Mills to huddle with key lawmakers and small - business owners to discuss concrete steps the government can take to help small businesses .

The new program comes in response to grumbling from some lawmakers over time that the initial wave of bailouts for large financial firms did little to bolster the credit markets for small businesses , and that the $ 700 billion in funds were largely used to balance large banks ' books .

MORE on Wednesday asking for specific redirection of funds from TARP , in partnership with funds from participating banks , to create a $ 50 billion small - business loan program .
“ We believe there is a need for a targeted program that will jumpstart small - business lending without harming the capital position of banks , ” the senators wrote .
The idea for the $ 50 billion fund had initially been floated by Sen.

A spokesman for Warner characterized the Obama administration ’s announcement as a positive start , but said it still leaves Warner hoping for more ambitious actions .
Administration officials said they would seek to make the program operational as soon as possible , arguing that it would provide confidence in the small - business credit market beyond the actual benefits drawn from small lenders ’ utilization of the program .

They call it the “ Pennsylvania Wilds , ” more than 6 million acres of relatively unspoiled forests and mountains in 12 northern Pennsylvania counties .
The area has long been known for its remnants of virgin forests , pristine mountain streams , abundant wildlife and magnificent vistas .
More than 2 million of those acres are public land , an area equivalent to the acreage occupied by Yellowstone National Park .
Today , however , if you were to visit this part of our commonwealth , you would be greeted by a different environment .
You would find a proliferation of new roads being cut into the forests , with semis and tanker trucks hauling tons of heavy equipment and water to remote destinations .
Not since the heyday of heavy timbering has there been such an assault on our northern forests .
This is all about the natural gas being extracted from a widespread geological formation known as Marcellus Shale .
The drilling companies refer to this as the Marcellus “ play , ” to denote focused drilling efforts within this region .
Although geologists have known for some time that the formation contained vast untapped wealth , it has not been until recently that a process called hydraulic fracturing , or “ fracking , ” combined with horizontal drilling , has been employed to successfully extract the gas from great depths beneath the surface .
This sounds great for our ailing economy , right ?
The answer is yes , but only if the proper environmental procedures and regulations are followed and enforced .
Unfortunately , we already have witnessed significant negative environmental impacts resulting from the activities of several drilling companies that either chose not to follow the rules or were simply careless in the execution of their efforts .
In the development of a typical Marcellus gas well , an access road must first be constructed or an existing forest road must be improved to handle the heavy truckloads of equipment and water .
Next , about 5 acres of forest must be destroyed to make room for a well pad and water retention pond .
Millions of gallons of water must then be hauled to the site for the fracking operation , which also requires the addition of several potentially toxic chemicals .
After the fracking operation is complete , the contaminated water flows back to the surface where it must be treated before discharged into a receiving river or stream .
So why should we be concerned over these activities ?
Construction of roads and pad sites can cause erosion and sedimentation pollution in some of our highest - quality streams .
Excessive water withdrawals from smaller streams can result in the loss of aquatic life .
Inadequate liner materials in wastewater retention ponds can result in contaminants leaching into groundwater , and more and better off - site treatment plants are needed to handle the ever - increasing volumes of contaminated frack water .
With this in mind , the state Department of Environmental Protection has seemingly shot itself in the foot when it comes to protecting our natural environment from the inevitable problems of rapidly escalating gas extraction activities .
This year , DEP made the decision to dismiss the county conservation districts as the watchdogs over local construction activities , and then instituted a fast - track permitting rule whereby construction plans would no longer be subjected to scrutiny by DEP , as long as the plans are certified by a registered engineer .
This practice already has proved itself ineffective in a recent case in which the DEP - approved engineer ’s plans failed to include some of the most basic measures to control erosion and sedimentation at several well sites .
Then there ’s the major issue of our state legislators failing to impose a gas severance tax that could pump much - needed General Fund capital into the state coffers and provide a funding source to help pay for future environmental mishaps .
Gov. Rendell proposed such a tax in June to help balance the state budget , but he later backed down .
Although every other major natural gas - producing state imposes a severance tax on gas extraction , it is relevant to note that more than $ 1 million was spent this year by oil and gas lobbyists to help defeat this tax in Pennsylvania .
When the state budget was finally passed , the agencies that suffered the largest cutbacks are the same agencies we depend on to oversee the health of our natural environment : DEP and DCNR .
Now more than ever , it is imperative that our legislators support and pass a gas severance tax that allocates a substantial percentage to our environmental programs .
We must keep the " wild " in Pennsylvania Wilds .

The two were among a group recorded on camera who were participating in assaults on bicyclists and pedestrians .
By ABBY SIMONS , Star TribuneLast update : November 19 , 2009 - 12:22 AMSt . Paul police have arrested an adult and a juvenile in connection with a series of random attacks in Minneapolis and St.
Paul that were recorded on video and posted on YouTube .
A 19 - year - old was booked into the Ramsey County jail , and a 17 - year - old was taken to a juvenile detention center .
Both were booked Tuesday on suspicion of strong - arm robbery and aggravated assault , according to St. Paul police reports .
St. Paul Police Sgt. Paul Schnell said police were searching for two others who were recorded on camera participating in the assaults , while the remaining others -- at least four -- would be considered persons of interest .
" From what we have seen in the footage , there were only four people that we can connect with possible criminal activity in the city of St.
Paul that were clearly and directly involved in the planning and / or execution of these attacks , " Schnell said .
He said that a handful of victims have come forward , and about four reports were filed as of late Wednesday afternoon .
One victim told police he was tackled from behind by an unknown male at 6 p.m. Saturday while walking east on Grand Avenue near Avon Street in St. Paul .
" Assault was probably posted on YouTube , " the police report said .
The investigation and arrests followed the Monday posting of a YouTube video featuring eight young males terrorizing bicyclists and pedestrians -- including children and older people -- in what appeared to be Minneapolis and St. Paul .
Edited and set to music , the video shows the group of what appear to be teenagers or young men taking turns saying , " Watch this , " before knocking down victims and running away , laughing .
The video was removed by midday Tuesday .
The video made its way around several online message boards and was soon e-mailed to police and media .
The perpetrators prominently showed their faces and gave what were purported to be their real names and nicknames .
" We certainly would love to talk to people who may have witnessed things in different areas , " Schnell said .
Victim accounts are vital for charging , Schnell said , so it is important that anyone who experienced a similar incident contact St. Paul police at 651 - 291-1111.Abby Simons • 612-673-4921
Knowing about all the metrics available on a Prometheus instance can sometimes feel impossible , so I 'd like to share a trick I devised to making exploring those metrics easier !
During my morning planning today , I was thinking about the highest priority work task I had on my plate .
Without getting too into the details , I introduced a new component into our system , and it 's been failing in ... interesting ways .
I can issue a command to invoke that failure , but it takes about five minutes to run its course .
I figured that I might be alternating several times between provoking this failure and analyzing the new findings - so , I thought to myself : what 's the best way to spend that time ?
Here are some thoughts I had on that :
My friend Frew , as well as others , have said that our job as developers is not to write code , but rather to solve problems .
I had a win in this regard relatively recently where I saved myself a good chunk of time by leveraging a Prometheus component for a purpose it may not have been designed for , but is remarkably well suited to .
Recently , I was curious about how Firefox 's reader view implements its estimated reading time , so I spent a little time looking through the Firefox codebase .
It turns out that it uses the readability package to extract the content of a page .
Once it has that , it gets the length of that content and divides it by an estimated reading speed - and it was this part that surprised me :
As I mentioned in a previous post , I use Slack at work , and I find it to be a constant source of distraction .
I have taken to shutting it off for much of the day , which has the obvious disadvantage that if people need to reach me , they can 't !
In that post , I admit my weakness of needing to acknowledge unread badges and proposed a sort of " narrowing " features for Slack .
I wanted to follow up on that and discuss some of the solutions I thought of , as well as the one I 'm currently using .
Protect Marriage Washington is busy sending out homophobic emails and posting videos full of falsehoods regarding Referendum 71 .

— Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Man ’s Chest
From countless films and books we all know that , historically , pirates were criminally insane , traitorous thieves , torturers and terrorists .
Anarchy was the rule , and the rule of law was nonexistent .
Not so , dissents George Mason University economist Peter T. Leeson in his myth - busting book , The Invisible Hook ( Princeton University Press , 2009 ) , which shows how the unseen hand of economic exchange produces social cohesion even among pirates .
Piratical mythology can’t be true , in fact , because no community of people could possibly be successful at anything for any length of time if their society were utterly anarchistic .
Thus , Leeson says , pirate life was “ orderly and honest ” and had to be to meet buccaneers ’ economic goal of turning a profit .
“ To cooperate for mutual gain — indeed , to advance their criminal organization at all — pirates needed to prevent their outlaw society from degenerating into bedlam . ”
There is honor among thieves , as Adam Smith noted in The Theory of Moral Sentiments : “ Society can not subsist among those who are at all times ready to hurt and injure one another ....
If there is any society among robbers and murderers , they must at least ... abstain from robbing and murdering one another . ”
Pirate societies , in fact , provide evidence for Smith ’s theory that economies are the result of bottom - up spontaneous self - organized order that naturally arises from social interactions , as opposed to top - down bureaucratic design .
Just as historians have demonstrated that the “ Wild West ” of 19th - century America was a relatively ordered society in which ranchers , farmers and miners concocted their own rules and institutions for conflict resolution way before the long arm of federal law reached them , Leeson shows how pirate communities democratically elected their captains and constructed constitutions .
Those documents commonly outlined rules about drinking , smoking , gambling , sex ( no boys or women allowed onboard ) , use of fire and candles , fighting and disorderly conduct , desertion and shirking one ’s duties during battle .
( The last could lead to the “ free rider ” problem in which the even division of loot among uneven efforts leads to resentment , retaliation and economic chaos . )
Enforcement was key .
Just as civil courts required witnesses to swear on the Bible , pirate crews had to consent to the captain ’s codes before sailing .
In the words of one observer : “ All swore to ’em , upon a Hatchet for want of a Bible .
When ever any enter on board of these Ships voluntarily , they are obliged to sign all their Articles of Agreement ... to prevent Disputes and Ranglings afterwards . ”
Thus , the pirate code “ emerged from piratical interactions and information sharing , not from a pirate king who centrally designed and imposed a common code on all current and future sea bandits . ”
From where , then , did the myth of piratical lawlessness and anarchy arise ?
From the pirates themselves , who helped to perpetrate the myth to minimize losses and maximize profits .
Consider the Jolly Roger flag that displayed the skull and crossbones .
Leeson says it was a signal to merchant ships that they were about to be boarded by a marauding horde of heartless heathens ; the nonviolent surrender of all booty was therefore perceived as preferable to fighting back .
Of course , to maintain that reputation , pirates occasionally had to engage in violence , reports of which they provided to newspaper editors , who duly published them in gory and exaggerated detail .
But as 18th - century English pirate Captain Sam Bellamy explained , “ I scorn to do any one a Mischief , when it is not for my Advantage . ”
Leeson concludes , “ By signaling pirates ’ identity to potential targets , the Jolly Roger prevented bloody battle that would needlessly injure or kill not only pirates , but also innocent merchant seamen . ”
This economic analysis also explains why Somali pirates typically receive ransom payoffs instead of violent resistance from shipping crews and their owners .
It is in everyone ’s economic interest to negotiate the transactions as quickly and peacefully as possible .
Markets operating in a lawless society are more like black markets than free markets , and because the Somali government has lost control of its society , Somali pirates are essentially free to take the law into their own hands .
Until Somalia establishes a rule of law and a lawful free market for its citizens , lawless black market piracy will remain profitable .
Until then , an - arrgh - chy will reign .

Thanks for the constant cock tease .
I really do enjoy the extremes you go to show off your smoking hot bod , e.g. the see through blouses , painted on pants , thongs , shirts that are super low cut to the navel , mini skirts , ( last week I saw you skipped the panties . . . .
Thanks and nice trim job by the way ) , braless days , the hole nine yards .
Yet it 's time to stop the double standard .
As I explained to management , for every action there is a reaction .
It 's a physical law .
Allow me to explain :
Ater witnessing you parade around the office all day , stopping to pose across my desk to chat with your female colleague whilst you bend over to display an ass that I would crawl a thousand miles to rim , do n't be surprised and pissed off and run to the boss to tattle on me .
It 's only natural that I have become . . . . well , engorged .
And in my state of turgid arousal , I remain where I am , at my desk , trying to hide a throbbing member who 's need to plunge itself deep into every orifice of your body , can not be so easily hidden or controlled .
I am a man .
I like to fuck women .
I especially like to fuck pretty women .
Yet off you go to the boss to complain about my boner .
A boner you only witnessed when you made it a point to come over to my desk , show off those lovely fun bags ( it was a bra less day ) , and make an effort to ensure that I notice your Playboy - esque bod .
You do n't see us guys walking around the office showing off our wood , do you ?
I do n't prance in and announce to all within ear shot , " Gee , Bob .
These new briefs really accentuate the length and girth of my now steel like cock " or " I 'm not sure , but I do n't think these slacks make my dick look big , what do you think Ted ? " .
To do so would be , well , let 's just say " inappropriate " .
Yet , you feel compelled to do just that after having made your latest purchase from Victoria Secret .
You got the reaction from me you so desperately wanted .
Yet , Management gets it .
They understand what you 're doing and why .
You 'll do anything for attention .
Your boss asked me if I thought you had been hugged enough by your Dad .

Okay many comments have been made about President Obama 's stand on the Public Option and here is the response directly from the White House Blog
I have just lifted it verbatim so that we can all see where we are at his point in time
The White House Blog
The Public Option : Rumor Check
Posted by Dan Pfeiffer on October 25 , 2009 at 08:56 PM EDT
A rumor is making the rounds that the White House and Senator Reid are pursuing different strategies on the public option .
Those rumors are absolutely false .
In his September 9th address to Congress , President Obama made clear that he supports the public option because it has the potential to play an essential role in holding insurance companies accountable through choice and competition .
That continues to be the President 's position .
Senator Reid and his leadership team are now working to get the most effective bill possible approved by the Senate .
President Obama completely supports their efforts and has full confidence they will succeed and continue the unprecedented progress that is being made in both the House and Senate .
Dan Pfeiffer is Deputy Communications Director
Saying the University of Alabama Birmingham 's policy of offering health benefits to same - sx partners runs counter to the state 's ban on same - sex marriage , state lawmaker DuWayne Bridges has been gathering support for a proposal to block the benefits , the Birmingham News reports :
" Rep. DuWayne Bridges , R - Valley , said support is building among Republi­cans for a bill that would
prohibit the use of tax dol­lars for domestic partner benefits .
' I do n't think the univer­sity should waste money by making a liberal or politi­cally correct statement , ' he said Thursday .
The bill would be aimed at the University of Ala­bama at Birmingham ,
which last month began al­lowing employees to enroll domestic partners
of either
sex in its health insurance plan , with benefits
begin­ning Jan. 1 . UAB officials have said they need to offer domestic
partner benefits so
their medical school can compete with other top schools , which routinely do so . "
Openly gay state rep .
Patricia
Todd spoke out against the Bridges plan : " We do n't know how many gay , lesbian and transgender people there are
in the country or even in Alabama , but we know that we 're present and
we make a contribution and we 're not asking for any more or less than
any other group of folks .
We just want equality .
Like it or not , Rep.
Bridges , the world is chang­ing and people are accept­ing more diversity . "

Many reptiles and amphibians also critically endangered , while up to 70 % of plants could be wiped out , say conservationists
A fifth of the world 's known mammals , a third of its amphibians , more than a quarter of its reptiles and up to 70 % of its plants are under threat of extinction according to the red list of threatened species , the latest annual survey compiled by the International Union for Conservation of Nature .
Among the critically endangered species are the western lowland gorilla and the bactrian camel .
The golden - headed lion tamarin is listed as endangered and the socorro dove is extinct in the wild .
Only a single male specimen of the Rabb 's fringe - limbed tree frog , which lives in central Panama , has been heard calling in the last three years and attempts to breed it in captivity have so far failed .
The IUCN estimates that nearly 17,300 of the world 's 47,677 assessed species are under threat of extinction .
Dr Ben Collier , research fellow at the London Zoological Society , whose scientists contributed to the survey , said : " We must take decisive action to reverse the serious declines we see in wildlife .
We need to ensure that our enduring legacy is not to wipe out the small things that provide us with great benefits such as nutrient recycling and climate regulation . "
Of the world 's 5,490 mammal species , 79 are believed to be extinct , at least in the wild , 188 are critically endangered , 449 endangered and 505 vulnerable .
Among the latter is the eastern voalavo , a rodent endemic to Madagascar , whose habitat is threatened by slash - and - burnfarming methods .
The Panay monitor lizard in the Philippines is endangered for the same reason , as is the sail - fin water lizard whose hatchlings are sought for the pet trade .
Among amphibians , the Kihansi spray toad of Tanzania is thought to be extinct in the wild , due to fungal disease in its habitat and the construction of a dam upstream of the Kihansi falls that has dried out its habitat .
Of the 12,151 plant types on the endangered list , there are 8,500 threatened with extinction and 112 believed to be extinct .
The Queen of the Andes plant , which produces seeds only once in 80 years and then dies , is holding on , though climate change is impairing its ability to flower and cattle are trampling its young plants .

BEREA , Ohio --
Less than 24 hours after Browns owner Randy Lerner pledged to add a new " credible , serious leader " to reorganize his football operations , the team parted ways with General Manager George Kokinis .
Kokinis was seen leaving the Browns ' facility around noon on Monday carrying two travel bags .
He was shown out by Lew Merletti , senior vice president , and Mike Nikolaus , human resource director .
The Browns made no mention of Kokinis ' departure at coach Eric Mangini 's regularly scheduled Monday press conference at 3 p.m. Neither Lerner nor his spokesman responded to multiple calls and emails for comment .
The club said in a statement released shortly after 10:30 p.m. that Kokinis " is no longer actively involved with the organization . "
" In response to rumors and reports that Kokinis was escorted out of the building today , the Browns deny those reports .
In the interest of protecting the parties involved , we will withhold further comment . "
Kokinis was handpicked by Mangini to be his GM and reportedly raised his name in his first interview with Lerner on Dec. 30 .
But Kokinis was not named general manager until 15 days after Mangini was hired .
Kokinis had 18 years ' NFL experience , including 13 with the Ravens .
He and Mangini were entry - level staffers in Cleveland together under former coach Bill Belichick in the early 1990s .
But the honeymoon of their reunion did not last long .
According to league sources , both men became disenchanted with the other early on .
In training camp , Mangini and Kokinis were seldom seen talking on the field .
Rumors intensified over the past month that Kokinis could be fired .
The timing of Kokinis ' departure coincides with a crackdown by Lerner to repair a football organization -- ostensibly headed by Mangini -- careening toward one of the worst seasons in Browns ' history .
The Browns ' 1 - 7 record matches the mid-point mark of the 1999 expansion team that finished 2 - 14 .
Two weeks ago , Lerner added former quarterback Bernie Kosar as a team consultant .
Last week , the team dismissed Erin O'Brien , Mangini 's former personal assistant with the New York Jets who was team operations director with the Browns .
Kosar spent parts of Monday stumping for Issue 3 , the casino issue on Tuesday 's election ballot spearheaded by Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert .
Kosar also spent considerable time huddling with Lerner in the Browns facility .
In an appearance on WKNR AM / 850 Monday morning , Kosar made no mention of Kokinis ' departure , but he criticized the team 's talent level .
" I really think that , in terms of turning it around in the next year or so , we 've got to be right in the draft , " Kosar said .
" What are we doing to get ready for the draft and free agency ?
" Until you bring in some difference - making players , I do n't know how you get out of this .
That 's the one consistent thing in the NFL .
The teams that do good have guys that make plays .
We do n't have enough of them . "
Kosar 's future role in the organization has not been defined by Lerner .
Kokinis ' actual input in the makeup of the team was never clearly identified , as he seldom granted interviews and deferred to Mangini as the spokesman for the club .
In fact , Kokinis was not even quoted in a club statement announcing the blockbuster trade of wide receiver Braylon Edwards on Oct.
7 .
Mangini , in effect , served as his own personnel director , as evidenced by the addition of 10 former Jets to the Browns ' roster .
Mangini dominated personnel decisions even though Kokinis had it in his contract that he was the club 's top authority on football matters .
The Browns needed to assure that in writing for Kokinis to be released from his job as pro personnel director of the Baltimore Ravens .
The downward spiral of this season coupled with the changes being enacted by Lerner have raised questions about Mangini 's own job security .
In Chicago , Lerner said he did not plan to change coaches during the team 's current bye week .
On Monday , Mangini said he spoke with Lerner by phone , as routine , and did not receive anything less than the support he always had from the owner .
" I 've never gotten a feeling otherwise in all of my conversations with Randy , " Mangini said .
" Randy and I share the same vision .
We do talk quite a bit about what 's the best way to achieve that . "
Mangini said he is on board with Lerner 's expressed desire to add " a strong , credible , serious leader within the building to guide decisions in a far more conspicuous , open transparent way . "
Mangini said , " The objective is the same for both of us [ to improve ] .
If you can add quality people that can help you get better , then you do that . "
Mangini said he and Lerner talk at length how " it 's a process " and that Lerner understands it will take time to build the program .
Medical billing and medical coding are the conditions which are often used interchangeably in Chicago .
They call for a similar set of skills in your resume , but that ’s where the similarities end .
Medical coding is the process of assigning codes to different treatments that are rendered to the patient to be able to facilitate insurance claims .
Not only does it demand a study of the insured ’s medical record and history but also entails conclusion of the procedure that has been performed by the doctor , surgeon , nurse and other health care personnels there are always one of thousand potential remedies and approaches available for the same ailment .
Current Procedural Terminology ( CPT ) and International Classification Terminology ( ICD ) are used for delegating codes for patient ’s operation and physician ’s diagnosis respectively .
The coders must input data via the Electronic Health Record ( EHR ) and Electronic Medical Record ( EMR ) applications that are in operation by the hospitals and physicians .
Each service receives its own specific code , may it be an MRI or a brain operation .
This process has the aim of being able to narrate the story of the patient ’s visit , and to do this not only must the transcriptions , laboratory results and other files be analyzed but in cases of uncertainty more information must be gathered by interacting and coordinating with the healthcare .
Medical Billing in Chicago IL is the process of creating claims that should be covered by the insurance company .
It involves checking the assigned medical code and forwarding the claim .
Medical Billers are the intermediaries between the patients and the insurance company .
They assure that the claims are paid and clarify any queries that the insured may have regarding the fees on the invoice , claim process and deductibles .
They also explain to the patients the reason why they need co-payments and co-insurance even when they possess an existing cover and ensure that all necessary supporting documents are attached and the right billing format was followed .
In cases of delays , rejections and denied claims they liaison between the insured and insurer , sort out and resubmit the revised claim with alterations .
Not only do they perform this plethora of tasks , but they also make sure the insurance company pays the hospital in the long run .
While little healthcare settings might club these two activities with the same people performing both these jobs , they are distinct with their own unique work and are more commonly segregated .
These two fields require keen attention to detail , precision , interpersonal skills and ethics as patient ’s information needs to be kept confidential .
Medical coders assign correct diagnosis and procedure code when no further details are required , they work with the technical and financial factors , have to be current with latest revisions in standards of coding and federal regulations and has to perform a medical chart audit when a claim is refused .
Medical billers have to be aware of the claim process and requirements to answer questions as inaccuracies result in fines and even lawsuits .
The former provides translation , the latter avoids back - billing , creates customer specific report and reduces account receivable days .
Even when attaining similar results , they follow different techniques and objectives .
Advantages of Medical Billing Services in Illinois
Medical billing services take actions on claims to insurance firms on behalf of people that are engaged in providing medical health care , they ’re the bridge between Medicare providers and insurance companies .
They are n’t just a broader business benefit but a strategic advantage .
Outsourcing of medical billing services through a vendor , is no longer an indulgence but an urgent need of the hour with many benefits .
Patient Care - The administrative problem in preparing complicated claim forms is a huge headache for the hospital staff swallowing their time , efforts and money .
Using vendors for these services can save yourself a whole lot of management difficulties as they are specialists armed with technical knowledge and training , hospital and practitioners can do what they do best ; provide the care to the patients !
Reduces errors in billing –
With the use of an accurate billing and coding applications , there is secure swift reimbursements for customers .
They assess whether the claims are processed properly , submitted on time , manage denials by rapid corrections and tracking records while also tackling complicated matters like outstanding appeals by following - up with the non-responsive cases .
The billing cycle begins as soon as the patient ’s data is listed and updated , the billing staff audits whether appropriate fee schedule was prepared after producing the patient ’s account based due to particular rules since a wrong charge entry may cause denial of the claim .
Thus , these services not only guarantee demand invoicing , processing of batch claims but also submission and resubmission if necessary , of electronic claims avoiding back billing , reducing account receivable times and realizing greater recoveries from the insurance provider .
Saves Money and higher profitability –
Hospitals can save on salaries , training and benefit costs by outsourcing .
They can also omit the costs of office supplies , furniture , purchase and upgradation of hardware .
A number of patients in Chicago opt for specialist vendors for high quality in services at flexible pricing models like percentile , transaction and FTE because they have to choose option which best fits their need .
It also results in economies of scale with the elimination of shipping and support software cost and tool discounts , maximizing earnings , profitability and cash flow .
There are expenses incurred by the medical department and extra expenses extended later which may be claimed from the patient ’s insurance provider ; with medical billing services the clinic may claim the amount without the clinic ’s staff being bothered and encumbered by the same .
Simple to Use– Being highly automated web - based solutions there is no capital expense involved .
The hospital staff can use this software with minimal training .
The technology employed in managing claims is cutting edge , which easily integrates together with the centre ’s existing system so it is possible to amalgamate Electronic Medical Records ( EMR ) , Medical Practice Management , claims and billing work into a single suite and get better results in Chicago IL .
Compliance with regulations –
The rules and regulations are rapidly and constantly changing and keeping up with these changes is a challenger for any medical practise , just a technical team can make it a point to keep up and free up the healthcare ’s time to concentrate on operational areas .
Safety – Outsourcing billing to a well - established third - party service provider gives a transparent billing process .
The majority of the service providers have a HIPAA - compliant and guarantee a safe billing process against risks of hacking .
The data must be kept confidential which requires an advance infrastructure for safety .
Billing at the highest rate– Earn extra revenue by billing at the greatest billable level .
Self - coding software inbuilt in the system are programmed to recognize the avenues of revenue that can be missed in a manual filing .
Efficiency – Claim collection direction , round the clock availability , managing patient enquires , submission of reports to physicians , mailing patient ’s statements , action on unpaid claims and appeals for erroneous payments lend greater efficacy to medical practises .
Greater Control–
It is a common misconception that outsourcing contributes to lack of control over business but in fact , it grants a better control over the billing process and money due to a well - trained and committed billing staff .
Importance of Medical Coding in Chicago Healthcare Industry
Medical coding takes the descriptions of diseases , injuries , and healthcare procedures from physicians or medical care providers and transforms them to numeric or alphanumeric codes to accurately describe the diagnosis and the procedures done .
With an increase in the life expectancy , population , and regulatory compliances the demand for medical coding has been on the upswing .
Coders are n’t only appointed at hospitals but can be seen in healthcare , medical billing companies , insurance companies , rehabilitation centers and even private companies .
They are required undergo a brief post - secondary training to acquire a certificate for practise .
Codes enhance the overall effectiveness of operations ; different codes are assigned for different processes or services which ensures that there are no flaws or redundancies in the process .
It gives a complete overview of the patient ’s visit right in the ailment to the deadline of this disease and the medication prescribed .
This information comes from various sources like the labs results , medical notes , electronic records , transcriptions , etc. .
At times further enquiries , follow - ups and research have to be conducted with the patients , doctors , healthcare professionals and insurance companies to ensure complete accuracy .
It is because of such preciseness this activity helps to ensure that medical claims are billed and processed correctly , revenue from Medicare advantages and insurance is a significant source of income which makes this service indispensable as it not only tracks down the insured ’s progress but also brings to light any preconditions , untreated diagnoses and any underlying symptoms for appropriate payments .
It also plays a massive part in research in the medical industry .
Records are updated and handled with efficiency , there is easy storage , extraction and analysis for evidence - based decision - making , comparison of health care data across hospitals , regions , and states becomes standardized and contrast between different periods is eased .
It is this research , that helps in coming up with new medications , treatments and diagnostics .
Coders assist in finding out the details of diseases that are critical and require work and what will be the end effects of such diseases to secure appropriate funding and target locations .
Therefore , it even acts as a statistical tool .
Medicine is n’t always a fundamental rule , there are several paths to prevention , diagnosis and treatment of disorders that is why all the probabilities need to be recorded and accounted for as a single wrong assumption may cause wrong treatment .
Contractual compliances like Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) and International Classification of Diseases ( ICD - 10 ) under World Health Organization ( WHO ) must be followed and accurate coding has to be done , that could be readily traced in this age of digitalization and digital record keeping , and that ’s why a core allied health care services in Chicago IL 60629 like medical coding should be furthered and its importance has to be realized .

Air rage has become a worrying trend in modern travel , but little can shock passengers more than when fists start flying in the cockpit .
Panic gripped Air India flight IC884 early today when a mid-air fight allegedly broke out between the two pilots and cabin crew members – bewildering passengers who had just been told they were flying over Pakistan .
To the relief of the 106 passengers , the international flight landed safely in the Indian capital .
Air India has grounded the pilots and crew involved and launched an inquiry .
According to reports quoting the Delhi police , Commander Ranbeer Arora and Captain Aditya Chopra were accused of trying to " molest " a female flight attendant who resisted their advances and was then thrown out of the cockpit .
In a statement to police , the woman alleged she was " abused and pushed " by the pilots inside the cockpit when she refused to grant " personal favours " .
Another crew member intervened and a fight allegedly ensued .
The pilots told police it was a male cabin crew member who had begun to " misbehave " and compromised safety , prompting the fight .
The flight attendant 's claims , say the pilots , were cooked up to protect her fellow cabin crew member .
When passions calmed , the pilots and cabin crew continued working as if nothing had happened .
The argument , say reports , began on the ground in the emirate of Sharjah , in the UAE , during a pre-flight briefing .
It then , apparently , escalated to punches .
Alleging that a woman had been assaulted and left " traumatised " , the joint commissioner of Delhi police , Satyendera Garg , said the " air hostess sustained bruises and injuries to her hand " .
One of the cabin crew said to have been involved , Amit Khanna , told reporters : " There was no fight between us on the flight . "
However a case of assault has been registered at the airport police station .
Air India is already reeling from a pilots ' strike that grounded its fleet of 155 planes for five days , prompting chaos at Indian airports .
Last month , pilots at Jet took a " mass sick leave " , in effect shutting down India 's largest commercial carrier .

A ghost , though invisible , still is like a place
your sight can knock on , echoing ; but here
within this thick black pelt , your strongest gaze
will be absorbed and utterly disappear :
just as a raving madman , when nothing else
can ease him , charges into his dark night
howling , pounds on the padded wall , and feels
the rage being taken in and pacified .
She seems to hide all looks that have ever fallen
into her , so that , like an audience ,
she can look them over , menacing and sullen ,
and curl to sleep with them .
But all at once
as if awakened , she ...

US Out of North America ?
On December 17th , 1989 , Romanian troops fired on anti-government protesters in Timisoara ; on Christmas day , dictator Nicolae Ceaucescu and his wife Elena were executed .
More than 40 years of Communist rule and nearly 25 years of personal rule by Ceaucescu came crashing down in a week and a day .
When US President Ronald Reagan urged Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to “ tear down this [ Berlin ] wall ” in 1987 , few expected that wall to actually come down only 2 1/2 years later .
Heck , few expected it to come down any time soon on the day that it did come down , 20 years ago next week .
For that matter , it was only six months from the election of Abraham Lincoln to the opening shots of the “ Civil ” War .
Six months for one nation to become two , and for the two to go to war against each other !
When things political fall apart , they have a way of doing so incredibly fast .
Unlike many , I ’m not inclined to just dismiss the predictions of Russian academic and former KGB agent Igor Panarin who thinks that the United States is on the verge of disintegration as a coherent nation - state .
Although some of the logic underlying Panarin ’s forecast is … well , not exactly logical ( California becoming province of China because most laptops are of Chinese manufacture , for example ) … there may be some “ there ” there in the general outlines .
The wishful “ one nation , indivisible ” thinking of those with a nationalist mindset aside , the United States is a hodgepodge country : 300 million people scattered over 3.8 million square miles of non-contiguous territory .
For awhile after World War II ( the most important domestic effect of which may have been putting English over the top as a “ common language ” ) , cultural homogenization — a McDonald ’s on every corner and the latest sitcom one - liner told around water coolers from coast to coast — seemed unstoppable .
But it was n’t .
Anyone who lives in or visits a reasonably densely populated metropolitan area can attest to the fact that discrete cultural communities tend to separate themselves out from the larger whole , asserting their own identities and holding to their own customs and languages .
It ’s not so much that “ national identity ” is inimical to that process as that it ’s irrelevant to that process .
Within minutes of my own home in suburban St. Louis , I can find communities where Spanish is the predominant language ; communities of Indian expatriates ; communities of Bosnian Muslim refugees .
They ’re in America ; they may even be “ American ” in one sense of the word or another .
But they ’ve also got their own things going .
And , of course , there ’s the “ Internet effect . ”
These days , it ’s as easy for the average person to watch Al Jazeera as to watch Al Bundy , or to indulge any number of other interests that even two decades ago would have required extensive travel and a large bankroll .
As our ability to establish meaningful relationships without reference to geography expands , our reasons for clinging to relationships based solely on geography diminish .
This whole trend of history is at odds with the notion of “ national rule ” by 537 politicians in one city on the Potomac … and the ties that bind us so are visibly fraying .
The media scream “ polarization ! ” as the Washington establishment attempts to drag the entire country one way or another on this or that issue , and the cry is believable : A considerable portion of the populace is always dragged kicking and screaming regardless of which way that might be .
State legislatures are beginning to formally assert “ 10th Amendment ” claims against federal power , and they may even make those claims stick .
They ’ve scared the federal politicians into writing “ opt out ” provisions into ObamaCare , at any rate .
Is it really such a giant leap from what ’s already happening to the idea of the whole thing tumbling down , with its constituent parts reassembling themselves — or not — in various ways ?
I do n’t think it is .
It ’s happened before , here and elsewhere , more or less convulsively , and I see no reason to believe that the United State as currently configured is immune .
I do n’t know if 2010 is the year , as Panarin predicts , but I think it ’s coming .
And when it does , I ’m cautiously optimistic that people in at least a few odd corners ( New Hampshire ?
The Colorado and Wyoming Rockies , perhaps ? ) will resist any meaningful reassembly of the machinery of state .
When proteins and other molecules go bad , they can start to gum up the intricate chemical reactions on which a cell ’s survival depends .
The cell recognizes defective parts and tags them for destruction .
Experiments on flies show the harm that can occur when cells cannot clear away the old and bring in the new .
Flies that are genetically engineered with defective lysosomes start to accumulate abnormal clumps of proteins in their cells .
The clumps build up especially in their neurons , which start to die as a result .
The Belgian biochemist Christian de Duve discovered lysosomes in 1955 , for which he later won the Nobel Prize .
In 1963 , scientists discovered that a genetic defect in lysosomes was responsible for a disorder known as Pompe disease , which weakens the heart and muscles .
Those who have the disease are missing a protein that lysosomes need to break down stores of energy .
Today over 50 disorders are recognized as the result of one defect or another in lysosomes .
Doctors can now treat some of these diseases by supplying people with the proteins they lack .
In recent years , scientists have also found evidence of autophagy in preventing a much wider range of diseases .
Many disorders , like Alzheimer ’s disease , are the result of certain kinds of proteins forming clumps .
Lysosomes can devour these clumps before they cause damage , slowing the onset of diseases .
Lysosomes may also protect against cancer .
As mitochondria get old , they cast off charged molecules that can wreak havoc in a cell and lead to potentially cancerous mutations .
By gobbling up defective mitochondria , lysosomes may make cells less likely to damage their DNA .
Many scientists suspect it is no coincidence that breast cancer cells are often missing autophagy - related genes .
The genes may have been deleted by mistake as a breast cell divided .
Unable to clear away defective mitochondria , the cell ’s descendants become more vulnerable to mutations .
Unfortunately , as we get older , our cells lose their cannibalistic prowess .
The decline of autophagy may be an important factor in the rise of cancer , Alzheimer ’s disease and other disorders that become common in old age .
Unable to clear away the cellular garbage , our bodies start to fail .
If this hypothesis turns out to be right , then it may be possible to slow the aging process by raising autophagy .
It has long been known , for example , that animals that are put on a strict low - calorie diet can live much longer than animals that eat all they can .
Recent research has shown that caloric restriction raises autophagy in animals and keeps it high .
The animals seem to be responding to their low - calorie diet by feeding on their own cells , as they do during famines .
In the process , their cells may also be clearing away more defective molecules , so that the animals age more slowly .
Some scientists are investigating how to manipulate autophagy directly .
Dr. Cuervo and her colleagues , for example , have observed that in the livers of old mice , lysosomes produce fewer portals on their surface for taking in defective proteins .
So they engineered mice to produce lysosomes with more portals .
They found that the altered lysosomes of the old experimental mice could clear away more defective proteins .
This change allowed the livers to work better .
( CNN ) --
The glaciers in the Himalayas are receding quicker than those in other parts of the world and could disappear altogether by 2035 according to the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) report .
In retreat : the roof of the world is experiencing rapid summer melting .
The result of this deglaciation could be conflict as Himalayan glacial runoff has an essential role in the economies , agriculture and even religions of the regions countries .
The Himalayan glaciers form the world 's largest ice body outside of the polar caps .
Popularly known as the " Water Tower of Asia , " they are the source of water for rivers that flow across the continent : the Indus River in Pakistan , the Brahmaputra that flows through Bangladesh , the Mekong that descends through Southeast Asia , the Irrawaddy in Myanmar , the Yellow and Yangtze rivers of China and a multitude of smaller rivers that flow through the Indo - Gangetic plains of Northern India .
Satellite data from the Indian Space Applications Center , in Ahmedabad , India , indicates that from 1962 to 2004 , more than 1,000 Himalayan glaciers have retreated by around 16 percent .
According to the Chinese Academy of Sciences , China 's glaciers have shrunk by 5 percent since 1950s .
Dr. Vandana Shiva , an environmental activist , physicist and leader in the International Forum on Globalization , has just returned from a " Climate Yatra , " a research journey to the Himalayas to study the impact of climate change and the glacial melt upon communities in Asia .
" Himalayan rivers support nearly half of humanity , " Dr. Shiva told CNN .
" Everyone who depends on water from the Himalayas will be affected . "
One area of increasing concern for Shiva is flooding .
" In Ladakh villages have already been washed away due to flash floods , " she said .
The situation has exacerbated the occurrence of Glacier Lake Outburst Floods ( GLOFs ) .
Impacts include loss of lives , domestic property , cultivable land , mountain infrastructure downstream , forced migration and long - term secondary environmental degradation .
In the short term , the glacial retreat could cause not just an overflow of rivers within countries , but more significantly , a cross border overflow into countries that already have a history of tension .
Rivers such as the Indus , Jhelum , Ravi , Bias and Sutlej rivers , are shared between India and Pakistan ( that have fought five wars since 1947 ) while melt - water from the Tibetan glaciers supply both India and China ( that fought a war over disputed Himalayan border territory in 1962 ) .
Both India and China are exploring opportunities to harness Himalayan waters for hydroelectric power projects , and while the initial melt promises to provide plenty of water for both sides , the loss of glaciers could lead to water shortages further in the future .
Underground aquifers in Asia depend heavily on snow melt during the dry summer season , and long - term implications of the disappearance of Himalayan glaciers mean that access to water could become a serious political problem .
According to Wendy Barnaby , editor of People and Science magazine , the United Nations issued a warning in February this year that climate change harbors the potential for serious conflicts over water .
Watch how the U.S. military is preparing for potential climate change conflicts »
Water - related conflicts have already been witnessed in other parts of the globe such as in the West Bank and in Darfur .
According to Himanshu Thakkar of the South Asia Network on Dams , Rivers and People , almost 70 percent of the non-monsoon flows in almost all the Himalayan rivers come from glacier melt .
International water security issues within Asia could be likely since the waters of the Indus , Ganges and the Brahmaptura basins flow into China in the upstream , and are shared across South Asia in the downstream .
Dr. Shiva believes the situation will render major security issues , between India and China particularly , as flows reduce and demands intensify .
In India , deglaciation poses the question of political and social upheaval within the country itself .
According to Thakkar , the rate of retreat for the Gangotri glacier over the last three decades was more than three times the rate during the preceding 200 years .
The Gangotri feeds the River Ganges , India 's holiest river which has historically been a focal point for Hinduism .
That the Ganges could become a seasonal river in the near future will throw a spanner in the works of Hindu religious customs , woven into the socio- economic life and culture of Northern India .
Moreover , future water allocation that favors economics over religion could spark conflict in a society that already experiences religious and inter-communal strife .
Even though some authorities in India do not consider the phenomenon to be particularly alarming , there is an increased understanding that the melting of Himalayan snows is real and needs to be taken seriously .
China and India are expected to sign an agreement this month that will enable scientists to cooperate on cross border research with regard to the Himalayan glacial melt .
When Michele Bachman crowed in September that the exposure of alleged illegal activity by the anti-poverty group ACORN was just the start of a campaign to “ defund the left , ” she may have revealed more about current Republican strategy than she intended .
“ Defunding the left is going to be so easy , ” Bachmann told the audience at a conservative conference , “ and it ’s going to solve so many of our problems . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The Senate and House had just voted to cut off ACORN ’s federal funding in what CBS / AP called “ a GOP - led strike against the scandal - tainted community organizing group ” that followed the release of video showing ACORN employees apparently endorsing illegal activities ,
The bills passed by lopsided majorities , with many Democrats joining Republicans , and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi told a news conference , “ We have to have our own scrutiny of an organization with an allegation of this kind against it . ”
The initial Congressional defunding of ACORN was scheduled to expire at the end of October , however , causing Bachman to warn a bloggers ’ conference at the ultra - conservative Heritage Foundation , “ This is the biggest trick or treat .
On November 1 the prohibition will lift . ”
The Capital Research Center
The idea of starving the Democratic Party of donations by defunding the progressive non-profits that form a central pillar of its support is not new .
It goes back to at least 1981 , when the Heritage Foundation published a set of over 2000 policy recommendations for the Reagan administration .
According to SourceWatch , “ One challenge , as Heritage saw it , was to counter the rise of its ideological opponents by whittling away their status as ‘ public interest ’ organisations and eliminating federal financial support for ‘ liberal ’ groups . ”
The Capital Research Center ( CRC ) was founded in 1984 by a former Heritage Foundation vice president to implement this agenda by uncovering the presumably questionable funding sources of progressive groups .
CRC ’s central assumption has always been that “ a unified , sophisticated and well - funded philanthropic elite is dedicated to imposing on us the doctrine of ‘ progressive ’ philanthropy , doctrines that would reorder our political , economic and cultural priorities . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The CRC selected ACORN as a favored targed long before almost anybody else had heard of the group .
In January 2005 , Bill Berkowitz , who regularly reports on right - wing organizations , wrote :
“ In mid-October of last year , the Center ’s president , Terence Scanlon , launched a pre-emptive strike against ACORN ( Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ) and its voter registration efforts .
Scanlon cast a shadow over ACORN ’s reports that it had registered over one million new voters .
He charged that because of irregularities , the organization was coming under scrutiny by lawmakers ‘ in state after state [ where ] allegations are surfacing that ACORN activists are padding the registration books ’
“ As a non -profit community - based organizing group , ACORN has been on the CRC ’s radar for several years .
According to Scanlon , ACORN , with some 150,000 dues - paying members organized into 65 city chapters , ‘ is better known for public disruption . ’
Its so - called community organizing ‘ has relied on in - your - face confrontation , ’ including a 1995 demonstration targeting then House Speaker Newt Gingrich .
‘ In 2002 it burst into the Heritage Foundation to harangue welfare reform expert Robert Rector .
Dozen of city councils and state legislatures have had to face angry ACORN protesters demanding higher minimum wages and more welfare entitlements .
Banks have been pressured to change their lending practices or face ACORN charges of discrimination before regulators . ’ ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Currently , CRC senior editor Matthew Vadum — who describes himself as “ America ’s foremost expert on the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ( ACORN ) ” — seems to be carrying much of the weight of the anti-ACORN campaign through his blog , Twitter feed , and frequent appearances with Glenn Beck and other right - wing TV hosts .
Last May , Vadum told Beck , “ ACORN is an immense crime family … that has tentacles all though the United States , and now it ’s trying to spread to India and Canada and other places . …
They ’re engaged in racketeering .
…
They break the law constantly . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Something that needs to be explored is the roots of ACORN in the 1960s , ” Vadum continued .
“ It grew out of the radical welfare rights movement .
And the idea behind that was that not enough people were on welfare and that you needed to pack the welfare rolls with as many people as possible in order to overwhelm the governments — the various levels of government — and cause social chaos . …
I guess you could say it was a Marxist - anarchist idea . ”
Vadam ’s latest entry at his CRC blog attempts to drag progressive filmmaker Brave New Films into his ACORN - related conspiracy theories .
“ Unwilling to admit it ’s an ongoing criminal conspiracy to defraud the people of the United States of America , ACORN has retained Bolshevik Brave New Films to do some of its dirty work for it , ” Vadam writes .
“ The leftist propaganda factory headquartered in Culver City , Calif. , has launched a new website , DeFOXamerica.com , which is an effort to shoot the messenger .
Fox is the only television network that has taken much of an interest in covering the ACORN scandal which some commentators say is bigger than Watergate . …
It ’s not known how much ACORN had to pay Brave New Films , a 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) advocacy nonprofit , to shill for it . ”
CRC and its allies
For an organization whose mission is to expose the funding sources and organizational ties of the left , the Capital Research Center is ironically protective of its own connections .
As a non -profit organization , for example , it is not obliged to report the names of its donors , only its total revenue — which amounted in 2007 to about $ 2.5 million .
ADVERTISEMENT
The CRC ’s tax filings similarly include the name of its officers , its directors — who include former Reagan administration Attorney General Edwin Meese III — and its two highest - paid employees ,
but the membership of its National Advisory Board has not been revealed since 2001 .
At that time , however , the board was heavily loaded with individuals tied to both the Reagan administration and the Heritage Foundation , as well as to various other right - wing publications , think - tanks , and legal foundations .
Although the evidence is skimpy , it suggests that many of the same people who were involved with CRC when it was founded in 1984 may have continued to be connected with the group and its ongoing agenda .
One of the more interesting names on the 2001 list is that of T. Kenneth Cribb , Jr. , a former Reagan adviser and president of the Intercollegiate Studies Institute ( ISI ) .
Although it is not well known , ISI is one of the largest recipients of grants from conservative foundations , having been listed a few years ago as second only to the Heritage Foundation .
Much of ISI ’s activity is carried on through its Collegiate Network , which creates and subsidizes conservative student publications on college campuses .
James O’Keefe — the young filmmaker whose sting operation allegedly caught ACORN employees endorsing illegal activities — was the founder of one such publication when he was a student at Rutgers University .
ADVERTISEMENT
O’Keefe had also received advice and a start - up grant to help launch the Rutgers Centurion from Morton Blackwell ’s Leadership Institute — which has been training young Republican dirty tricksters since the 1970 ’s , ranging from Karl Rove to Jeff Gannon .
Blackwell himself appeared on a “ Defunding the Left ” panel at the 2001 Conservative Political Action Conference , along with CRC president Terrence Scanlon .
Both Cribb and Blackwell have strong ties to the Heritage Foundation as well .
Blackwell was a close associate of the late founder of the group ’s founder , Paul Weyrich , for over 40 years .
Cribb is a good friend ( pdf ) of former Heritage president Edwin Feulner .
These multiple cross-connections again suggest that the goal of defunding the left has been carried along by a small , tightly - knit group of conservatives for over 25 years , and that James O’Keefe ’s sting operation against ACORN is merely the latest step towards that goal .
Dick Armey , FreedomWorks , and the Tea Baggers

The crusade to defund the left has not been limited to attempts to discredit progressive organizations .
The so - called K Street Project of the 1990 ’s , which was intended to steer lobbyist contributions more towards Republicans and to shut out Democrats , had the same objective .
So did Jack Abramoff ’s courting of Indian tribes in order to cut off payments that had previously gone largely to Democrats .
Even calls for “ tort reform ” — which are now being raised again in connection with health care — are intended to prevent trial lawyers , who are often generous Democratic donors , from receiving a share of large settlements in personal injury cases .
Attacks on federal funding of liberal non-profits , however , are particularly attractive as a strategy because most conservative non-profits receive the bulk of their funding from corporations and right - wing foundations and not from the federal government .
In 1995 , the new Republican majority in Congress took part in a particularly ambitious — though ultimately unsuccessful — attempt to defund the left .
According to a May 30 , 1995 story in the Pittsburgh Post - Gazette ( which does not appear to be available online except through subscription - only sources ) :
“ Congressional Republicans — with the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas playing a key role — are preparing a new budget - cutting assault on scores of government - funded nonprofit groups whose liberal views are considered a threat to the conservative agenda . …
The effort , referred to by conservatives as ‘ defunding the left , ’ is intended to take aim at what they consider advocacy groups that lobby for liberal social programs from which they receive grants and contracts . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The story went on to say , “ Led by Virginia Lamp Thomas , the wife of the Supreme Court justice , a special group of senior House Republican experts and staff members has been quietly working under the auspices of House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas .
Their aim is to identify nonprofit organizations whose funding should be cut and to plan a strategy to end their grants or contracts with the government or the programs for which they provide services . ”
Thomas , who was then a policy analyst for Rep.
Armey , later went to work for the Heritage Foundation .
Armey himself left Congress in 2003 and became the co-chairman of Citizens for a Sound Economy — one of whose representatives had participated in that same 2001 “ Defunding the Left ” panel as Morton Blackwell and CRC ’s Terrence Scanlon .
Armey ’s organization is now known as FreedomWorks and is the principal astroturf backer of the teabagger protests .

Two years ago , I detailed how to build a Hackintosh for under $ 800 — then covered how to do the same with less hacking .
Now that Snow Leopard 's out , we 're revisiting the Hackintosh , building a Hack Pro from scratch for roughly $ 900 .

Update :
This guide has been superceded by a much easier method : Install Snow Leopard on Your Hackintosh PC , No Hacking Required .

For folks eager to try a Mac but never wanted to plunk down the high price tag to get it , the Hackintosh — that is , a regular PC tweaked to run OS X — has always been an attractive option .
That said , it 's not something you should take on lightly unless you 're willing — even enthusiastic — to build and maintain a PC entirely from scratch .
I can't guarantee it 'll be easy , but if you follow this guide step - for - step ( it 's exhaustive ) and stick with the same ( or at least roughly the same ) hardware as I am , I can vouch for a rock solid system that also happens to cost a good deal less than you 'd pay for a comparable Mac .

Price Comparisons
Most Hackintosh enthusiasts will say you should n't build a Hackintosh primarily to save money , as it's more than just an insert - disc - and - click install .
Still , I always enjoy looking at the price differences between my Hackintosh and Apple 's current offerings .
At the moment , the cheapest Mac in the Apple store is a Mac mini sporting a 2.0 GHz Core 2 Duo processor , 1GB of RAM , and a 120 GB hard drive .
For $ 300 more , I 'm running a 3.0 GHz Quad - Core processor , 8 GB of RAM , a 1TB hard drive , and a damn saucy video card .
I could have made this build much cheaper by skimping on hardware and still ended up with a great little machine , but I liked aiming for around the $ 800 price point from my last build — plus I really wanted to make it fly .

The most expensive iMac , by comparison , has only a 3.06 GHz Core 2 Duo with 4GB of memory for $ 2,200 ( $ 1,300 more than my build , but it is built into a monitor ) , while the cheapest Mac Pro has a single 2.66 GHz Quad - Core processor , 3GB of RAM , and a 640 GB hard drive — and it costs $ 2,500 ( $ 1,600 more than mine , though it 's a different and better processor and DDR3 rather than DDR2 RAM ) .
In short , my $ 900 " Hack Pro " sports nearly as good or better hardware than any Mac that Apple sells short of the $ 3,300 8 - Core Mac Pro ( which can , incidentally , get more expensive , but it wo n't get much better ) .

The Hardware
You can find plenty of hardware capable of supporting OS X on a Hackintosh — there 's no definitive build — but we 're not going to go into that here .
I 've put together a list of hardware that I 'm using and that I can guarantee will ( or at least has ) run Snow Leopard like a dream .

Do your building , make sure everything 's booting up as it should be ( i.e. , you can boot the computer to the point where it does nothing , because you have nothing installed on it ) , then let 's move on .

What Else You 'll Need
Assuming you 've purchased all the necessary parts for your build ( linked above ) , you 'll still need a few other things before you get started :

Step One : Prepare Your Thumb Drive
We 're going to be installing Snow Leopard to your Hackintosh from your thumb drive rather than from the Snow Leopard install DVD , since in order to run the installer on your PC to begin with , you 'll need to slightly customize the way the installer is loaded .
( More specifically , we 'll be loading a custom bootloader onto the thumb drive that will make booting into the install work like a charm . *)

So first things first :
You need to format your thumb drive and then turn your Snow Leopard install disc into a disk image on your desktop .
Here 's how to do it :
Launch the Disk Utility application on your borrowed Mac ( located at / Applications / Utilities / Disk Utility ) Format and partition your thumb drive : Insert your thumb drive ; after a second , it should show up in the Disk Utility Sidebar .
When it does , ( 1 ) click on it , then ( 2 ) click on Partition .
( 3 ) Choose 1 Partition from the Volume Scheme , ( 4 ) give it a name ( I called my HackintoshInstall ) and select Mac OS Extended ( Case - sensitive , Journaled ) from the Format drop - down .
Now — and this is important — ( 5 ) hit the Options button and make sure GUID Partition Table is selected as the partition scheme .
Once you 've made sure to set all the appropriate settings , just ( 6 ) click Apply and Disk Utility will get to partitioning your thumb drive .

Copy the Snow Leopard Install DVD image to your hard drive :
In the following step we 'll be turning your thumb drive into a Snow Leopard Install drive , but before we do that , we need to get the installer off your DVD and onto your hard drive .
To achieve this , insert the Snow Leopard DVD .
When it shows up in the Disk Utility sidebar , ( 1 ) click on it , then ( 2 ) click New Image in the Disk Utility toolbar .
Choose where you want to save it ( for the sake of convenience , I put it on my Desktop ) , then click the Save button .
Now go grab yourself a cold drink .
This will take some time .
When it finishes , move on to the next step .

Restore the Snow Leopard Install disk image to your thumb drive : Now , in Disk Utility , ( 1 ) click on HackintoshInstall ( or whatever you called your partitioned thumb drive ) and ( 2 ) click on Restore .
( 3 ) Drag and drop Mac OS X Install DVD.dmg from the sidebar to the Source field , then ( 4 ) drag and drop your thumb drive from the sidebar to the Destination field .
Now simply ( 5 ) click on Restore and enter your password when prompted .
Disk Utility will take everything on the Snow Leopard Install DVD and restore that image to your thumb drive — since , like I said above , we 'll be installing Snow Leopard from our thumb drive instead of the DVD .
Again , go grab yourself another drink ; this will take a few minutes .
When it finishes , your thumb drive has basically been turned into a Snow Leopard installation drive .

As I said earlier , the thumb drive needs a little finesse before you can boot the Snow Leopard installer on your PC hardware ; let 's apply that finesse now .
Advertisement
Warning : Semi-heavy Terminal work ahead .
It 's not that difficult , and I 've gone into a lot of detail to make it as easy to follow along as possible , but if you 're not at least a little comfortable with the command line , it may make you pretty uncomfortable .
Beg or borrow a command line geek for an afternoon , if needed .
Make sure your thumb drive is still plugged in , open Terminal ( / Applications / Utilities / Terminal ) and type in : diskutil list
Advertisement
We 're interested in two pieces of information here .
The first is the root identifier for your thumb drive ( mine looks like disk2 , as you can see in the screenshot ) .
The second is the specific identifier for the portion of the thumb drive that contains the Snow Leopard installer .
( Again , see the screenshot . )
In my case , the first is disk2 and the second is disk2s2 .
Yours may vary depending on how many disks are on your system .
Copy your identifiers down somewhere .
We 'll need them later .
Head to the Chameleon homepage Now , in Terminal , cd to the i386 folder of the Chameleon folder .
On my Mac , the command looks like this :
Advertisement
(1)
cd / Users/adam/Desktop/Chameleon-2.0-RC2-r640-bin/i386/
Yours should look similar if the Chameleon folder is on your Desktop , except your username should replace mine .
( Quick shortcut :
In Terminal , type cd , then drag and drop i386 folder inside Chameleon - 2.0 - RC2-r640 to Terminal . )
Hit Enter .
Advertisement
You 're going to be running a couple of Terminal commands that will use Chameleon to make your thumb drive friendly to booting up the OS X installer .
They are , as follows : ( 2 ) sudo fdisk -f boot0 -u -y / dev/rdisk2 IMPORTANT :
On your computer , replace rdisk2 with whatever you copied down above .
In my case , the thumb drive 's root identifier was disk2 , so / dev/rdisk2 is as it should be .
After you type in that command and hit Enter , you 'll need to enter your user password to execute it .
Do so , then execute the following command , again paying special attention to the disk identifier we took note of above : ( 3 ) sudo dd if=boot1h of= / dev/rdisk2s2 IMPORTANT :
As I noted , my Snow Leopard partition was disk2s2 , so that command is right for me .
You should replace the disk2s2 portion of the command with whatever you noted as the portion of your thumb drive that contains the Snow Leopard installer .
Now we 're going to place an awesome , custom EFI bootloader on your thumb drive that lets us load into the installer ( and into Snow Leopard in general ) .
So first , head over to netkas.org and download the bootloader from the bootloader link .
Make sure you download it somewhere convenient .
( Again , I 've just downloaded it to my Desktop . )
Now head back into Terminal , where we 're going to copy the boot file to your thumb drive .
( One might think that you could just do this using Finder via drag - and - drop , but in this case , doing it via Terminal is necessary . )
So , in Terminal , your command should look similar to this : sudo cp / Users / adam / Desktop / boot / Volumes /HackintoshInstall
Advertisement
The easiest way to do this is simply type in sudo cp , ( 1 ) drag and drop the boot file into Terminal , then ( 2 ) drag and drop your mounted thumb drive from the desktop into Terminal .
( The drag - and - drop method is a quick Terminal trick that pastes the full path to each file or directory . )
After that , simply hit Enter .
( Enter your password if necessary . )
I know it seems like we 've already run a marathon , but you 've got one last step and then it 's relatively smooth sailing from here on .

Take a deep breath .
By this time , you 've completed all the hard work .
Now it 's time to boot up your machine , tweak your BIOS settings so they 're ready for your OS X install , and then it 's smooth sailing .
Advertisement
Step 2 : Set Your BIOS
Before you can boot into or install OS X on your Hackintosh , you 've got to make some small adjustments to your BIOS .
Rather than taking you step by step through every change you need to make , I 've simply snapped a picture of the relevant BIOS screens and added some notes .
Just click through these images and make sure your BIOS settings match up .
Advertisement
Step 3 : Install Snow Leopard
If you 've made it this far , the hard part is over .
Now it 's time to install Snow Leopard , which — unlike what we 've done so far — is extremely easy .
Advertisement
Make sure you 've set the boot priority in your BIOS to boot from your thumb drive ( you can see how in this pic ) , then simply plug your prepared thumb drive into your Hackintosh and power it up .
Since screenshots are n't really an option — and since it 's a fairly easy process — my install instructions come in video format :
The quick version goes like this :
Boot into the Snow Leopard installer , format the hard drive you want to install Snow Leopard to ( go to Utilities ->
Disk Utility , then click on the drive , select 1 Partition , Mac OS X Journaled ( Case - Sensitive Update : Several readers have suggested that case - sensitive formatting can cause problems with some applications , like Adobe 's Creative Suite , so you may be better off sticking with plain old Mac OS X Journaled . ) , give it a name , and make sure GUID Partition Table is set in the Options .
After you Apply the new partition , go back to the installer and install like normal to that drive .
When you reboot after the install completes , press the arrow keys at the graphical boot menu and select the drive you just installed Snow Leopard to .

A Few Final Tweaks
You 'll notice that , the first time Snow Leopard boots up , you 're not enjoying any sound along with that snazzy intro video .
We 've got one small , but very simple tweak to make to get sound up and running .
Here 's how it works :
Advertisement
Download the Kext Utility , then download this audio kext ( a kext is kind of the Mac equivalent of a driver ) and unzip it to your Desktop .
Once you 've got both in front of you , drag and drop the ALC889 .
Fix. kext file onto the Kext Utility .
You 'll be prompted to enter your password , so go ahead and do that when you 're prompted .
Once the Kext Utility finishes running , open up Disk Utility ( / Applications / Utilities / Disk Utility.app ) .
Once it loads up , ( 1 ) click on your Snow Leopard drive ( mine 's called Hack Leopard ) , then ( 2 ) click Repair Disk Permissions .
Once Disk Utility finishes repairing your disk permissions , just restart .
After your computer reboots , your audio should be working like a charm .
( If not , open up Sound in your System Preferences and try changing the Output device . )
Advertisement
As things stand on your system right now , you need to have your thumb drive plugged in every time you reboot in order to load the bootloader that allows your Hackintosh to load OS X .
There are certain benefits to this ( for example , right now you could quite likely unplug this hard drive from your Hackintosh , plug it into a Mac Pro , and it would work just fine ) , but it can also be a bit of a hassle .
At this point , though , you can load the bootloader and other necessary components onto the Snow Leopard hard drive and change that drive to your primary boot drive in your BIOS .
All you 've got to do is head back to the step - by - step bootloader guide above and repeat every step , except this time you 're applying each step to your hard drive rather than your thumb drive .
Congratulations !
You 've Got a Fully Functional Hackintosh

" But for realz , " you ask , " does it actually work well ? "
I 've been using one or another Hackintosh as my main computer for two years now , and while I 've run into the occasional bump in the road , they 've generally run extremely well .
In fact , things just seem to keep on getting better and better , and the current build I 'm running ( the one I walked you through above ) feels like the fastest , most stable build to date .
Advertisement
That 's not to say that you wo n't experience an occasional kernel panic — you may very well .
But I get crashes on my MacBook Pro , too , and I 've never felt that my current Hack Pro has any more problems than any other proper Mac I 've used on a regular basis .
That may seem a bit crazy , but it 's true .
As for upgrading — often , you 'll be able to upgrade your Hack Pro without any problems .
That said , it 's something you normally need to check on beforehand , and you should take all of the upgrade precautions before giving it a go .

Huge thanks to stellarola , Onetrack , and weaksauce 12 for all their help in getting me up to speed on installing Snow Leopard on a Hackintosh PC .
The Hackintosh community is large and active , and they are awesome .
Dubai World has fuelled the emirate 's rapid economic growth of recent years European shares have been hit by concerns over Dubai 's financial health , after a government - owned company asked for an extension on repaying its debts .
The UK's FTSE 100 index lost 3.2 % , its biggest one - day fall since March , after Dubai World asked creditors to postpone upcoming repayments until May 2010 .
Banks were hit particularly hard on concerns over Dubai 's ability to pay back its debts .
Share indexes , however , are trading at their highest levels for over a year .
" Certainly the Dubai debt debacle and the uncertainty that it has created has had a severe knock on effect , " said David Buik at BGC Partners .
Put simply , everyone in the markets thought that , in the end , the federal government in Abu Dhabi would stand by all of Dubai 's bad bets .
Apparently , they wo n't .
Stephanie Flanders , BBC economics editor
Dubai : Too big to fail ?
The FTSE 100 finished Thursday trading at 5,194 , which in points terms is a decline of 170.7 .
Barclays was the biggest faller , down 8 % , followed by Royal Bank of Scotland , which lost 7.8 % .
French and German shares also declined , with France 's Cac index ending down 3.2 % , and Germany 's Dax losing 3.4 % .
A senior Dubai government official , Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al - Maktoum , chairman of Dubai's Supreme Fiscal Committee , said he understood the concerns in the markets , but that " decisive action " was needed to address Dubai World 's debt problem .
" The government is spearheading the restructuring of this commercial operation in the full knowledge of how the markets would react , " he added .
Heavy price
After six years of rapid growth , the reputation of Dubai 's economy is now being questioned .
DUBAI VOICES
The property market has crashed ...
Many people [ got ] involved and many people left overnight .
If you go to the airport you 'll see many abandoned cars .
Businessman , Dubai
Views from Dubai : ' The end of the dream ' " Dubai could not undermine itself any further as a place not to do business in at the moment , " said Manus Cranny at MF Global .
" It is the much longer term implications on funding , confidence and capital raising that will take a decade or more to re-establish , " he added .
Analysts say the Dubai government has paid the price for a flamboyant economic model centred on foreign capital and giant construction projects .
' Government failure ' Dubai World , which has total debts of $ 59bn ( £ 35 bn ) , has asked for a six - month extension on debt repayments .
It was due to repay $ 3.5 bn next month .
The Dubai government said the request to delay debt repayments also applied to property developer Nakheel , a Dubai World subsidiary .
" It does come off as a little bit of a surprise , " said UBS Bank analyst Saud Masoud .
" I think the expectation throughout the year has been at least that the Nakheel debt repayment was a given , [ that ] one way or another Dubai would be able to raise the capital to finance that debt . "
" It really tests investor confidence significantly . "
The debt delay plea has led to major credit ratings agencies downgrading a number of state - backed Dubai companies .
" In our view , such a restructuring may be considered a default under our default criteria , and represents a failure of the Dubai government to provide timely financial support to a core government - related activity , " said Standard & Poor's .
Dubai is one of the seven self - governing emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates .
Some have speculated it is likely to turn to the more economically conservative Abu Dhabi emirate to bail it out .

East Antarctic sheet shedding 57bn tonnes of ice a year and contributing to sea level rises , according to Nasa aerial survey
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
The world 's largest ice sheet has started to melt along its coastal fringes , raising fears that global sea levels will rise faster than scientists expected .
The East Antarctic ice sheet , which makes up three - quarters of the continent 's 14,000 sq km , is losing around 57bn tonnes of ice a year into surrounding waters , according to a satellite survey of the region .
Scientists had thought the ice sheet was reasonably stable , but measurements taken from Nasa 's gravity recovery and climate experiment ( Grace ) show that it started to lose ice steadily from 2006 .
The measurements suggest the polar continent could soon contribute more to global sea level rises than Greenland , which is shedding more than 250bn tonnes of ice a year , adding 0.7 mm to annual sea level rises .
Satellite data from the whole of Antarctica show the region is now losing around 190bn tonnes of ice a year .
Uncertainties in the measurements mean the true ice loss could be between 113bn and 267bn tonnes .
" If the current trend continues or gets worse , Antarctica could become the largest contributor to sea level rises in the world .
It could start to lose more ice than Greenland within a few years , " said Jianli Chen , of the University of Texas at Austin .
Chen 's team used data from the Nasa mission to see how Earth 's gravitational pull varied month to month between April 2002 and January 2009 .
Measurements taken over the south pole reflect changes in the mass of the Antarctic ice sheets .
The survey confirmed the West Antarctic ice sheet is melting rapidly with the loss of around 132bn tonnes of ice a year , but revealed unexpected melting in the larger East Antarctic ice sheet .
The scientists used a computer model to take account of ongoing movements in the Earth 's surface caused by the retreat of glaciers at the end of the last ice age .
Uncertainties in the model gave the scientists only a broad estimate of ice loss in the East Antarctic ice sheet of between 5bn and 109bn tonnes a year .
Chen said that warmer ocean waters may have triggered the melting by seeping under the ice sheet and making it slide more easily over the rock it rests on .
Writing in the journal Nature Geoscience , Chen 's team reports that Wilkes Land on the East Antarctic ice sheet was stable until 2006 , but has since begun to lose ice .
Another region on the ice sheet , Enderby Land , was thickening until 2006 , but has since started to melt .
" We 're seeing these kinds of climate change effects all around the world now , " Chen said .
Washington , D.C. , November 13 , 2009 - Three years before al Qaeda 's attacks on the United States on 9/11 , U.S. officials detected an alarming shift in the ideological stance of Taliban leader Mullah Omar toward pan-Islamism – a change that portended a burgeoning alliance between the Afghan regime and Osama bin Laden .
The report that Omar might be falling under bin Laden 's " influence " is contained in a December 1998 U.S. Embassy cable from Islamabad , Pakistan , one of a number of recently declassified government documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the National Security Archive and published here today on the eighth anniversary of the Taliban 's expulsion from Kabul .
The new documents provide other revealing insights into the inner workings of the notoriously opaque Taliban which underscore the challenges and potential opportunities that continue to confront U.S. policy - makers today .
For example , while the organization in the late 1990s showed a troubling inclination toward radical Islamic thinking on issues beyond its usually more parochial concerns , it also displayed a pragmatic and even opportunistic side , recruiting troops from a variety of political perspectives including local communists .
And although the documents describe Mullah Omar as highly authoritarian and adept at keeping his political rivals off - balance , the organization had evidenced a surprising diversity of viewpoints within its upper ranks , which suggested possible weak spots in the organization 's control .
A comprehensive chart compiled by the Archive details biographical and professional information on more than 40 Taliban officials .
Essential background information on the regime has always been largely second - hand , contested or altogether absent from the public record .
In order to facilitate better public understanding of the group and its principal figures , the National Security Archive has organized a unique and comprehensive chart , compiled entirely from U.S. government sources , detailing biographical and professional information on more than 40 important Taliban officials .
In addition to highly informative biographical materials , the declassified documents in this briefing book contain fascinating new details about Taliban structure , decision - making and evolving ideology .
The December 1998 Embassy cable noted above describes how Mullah " Omar – perhaps under the influence of bin Ladin and other extremists – may have become more sympathetic to pan-Islamist thinking .
For example , he was quoted at least twice in 1998 as criticizing the U.S. presence in the Gulf , which is not usually a great concern of Afghans . "
Furthermore , Mullah Omar 's Taliban ruling style may be even more controlling and brutal than previously reported .
The December 1998 Embassy cable mentioned above notes that Omar " maintains an idiosyncratic , almost obscurantist , leadership style , " making policy decisions , " but generally leav[ing ] the day - to - day matters to his key lieutenants . "
In order to ensure his deputies remain " off balance " and do " not grow overly comfortable in their positions , Omar also rotates Taliban officials from post - to - post , apparently at a whim . "
Omar may have felt threatened by his now - deceased deputy , Mullah Mohammad Rabbani .
A " moderate , " who reportedly disagreed with Omar 's decision to protect al - Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden , Rabbani wanted to " settle the [ bin Laden ] matter before [ the Taliban ] become even more isolated from the international community . "
By 1996 , Omar had purged Taliban members loyal to Mullah Rabbani in order to prevent his Deputy from gaining popularity and an independent base of power .
Also contained in the documents are indications that despite Mullah Omar 's authoritarian methods , the Taliban may have been more politically and ideologically diverse than previously known .
In March 1997 , U.S. State Department officials note that " while we do not know much about [ Taliban ] decision - making , there is enough anecdotal evidence to suggest there are differences of opinion among high - level Taliban leaders .
And when they do reach a decision , there is not a well - defined process for communicating that decision to all the areas under their control , let alone making sure that it is carried out . "
There is surprising ideologically heterogeneity in the organization as some Taliban officials , such as Minister of Defense Mullah Obaidullah , regularly recruit former communists for Taliban membership .
U.S. officials note , " there are also many non-ideological Afghans ( former commanders , tribal leaders , khalqis , etc. ) who have jumped into the Taliban bandwagon for their own motives .
There is thus some evidence to suggest that in provinces where they are in control , they – or at least their ideology – are spread thin . "
As a collection , the documents reproduced here provide an interesting illustration of the complexity of dealing with a repugnant political regime .
U.S. State Department officials describe Taliban social policies as abominable ; yet they find themselves engaged in regular diplomatic contact and even supporting potential commercial deals .
While the State Department is studying reports of growing domestic opposition to the Taliban ( prompting Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to write in the margins of one memo , " This is encouraging " ) , UNOCAL ( the Union Oil Company of California ) is sponsoring a Taliban delegation on a tour of the United States in hopes of getting permission to build a pipeline through Afghanistan .
One of the visitors , Mullah Amir Khan Muttaqi , the Taliban Minister of Education and Minister of Information and Culture , is described as a " key figure in the Taliban 's ideological projects , " and an individual even more " extreme on social issues than most Taliban . "
The State Department confesses U.S. policy " will inevitably be messy and the policy we follow will be ridden with inner tensions , as we simultaneously engage with the Taliban and criticize their abuses . "

Self - described as " number two for the Taliban on foreign affairs , " Abdul Jalil delivers a friendly diplomatic message from Supreme Leader Mullah Mohammed Omar ( in document referred to as Maulavi Omar ) to U.S. government representatives .
According to Jalil , Omar wants U.S. officials to know " the Taliban think highly of the U.S. , appreciated U.S. help during the jihad against the Soviets , and want good relations with the U.S. "
Furthermore the Taliban would like its contacts with U.S. officials to be unpublicized for the time being in order to avoid accusations that the Taliban are " an anti-shia tool of the U.S. – Paid and directed by the USG [ U.S. government ] . "
According to the Taliban , such rumors are " starting to resonate in Afghanistan , especially among the Hazaras ( Afghan Shias ) . "
The document reports that Jalil , who speaks English , is polite and " makes a good impression . "
He was firm in establishing that he works for Mullah Mohammed Ghaus , the chief Taliban official in foreign affairs .

Two weeks following the Taliban take over of Kabul on September 27 , 1996 , the Central Intelligence Agency releases this 19 - page assessment addressing the Central Asian reaction to Afghanistan 's unexpected regime change .
None of Afghanistan 's neighbors except Pakistan officially recognize the Taliban , as they remain " alarmed " and fear Taliban rule " will lead to additional instability on their borders . "
Nevertheless , the states in question , Uzbekistan , Tajikistan , Turkmenistan , Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan , " are not eager to see the Russian military presence in the region increased , " and therefore " have not yet decided on a collective effort to arm Taliban … opponents . "
The document also identifies key Taliban figures at this early stage of the movement , including Mullah Omar .

Taliban Supreme Leader Mullah Omar moves Mullah Yar Mohammed from the governorship of Herat , a position he held since the Taliban takeover of the city in September 1995 , to the governorship in Ghazni .
Questioning Omar 's motivation for issuing the order and whether Mohammed would even accept the move , the document does not draw any definite conclusions , but addresses various interesting factors such as Mullah Omar 's political objectives for suppressing Mohammad 's independent power base .

U.S. Embassy ( Islamabad ) Cable , " Afghanistan : Jalaluddin Haqqani's Emergence As a Key Taliban Commander , " January 7 , 1997 , Confidential , 14 pp . [ Excised ]
Taliban military commander Jalaluddin Haqqani is reported in this 1997 account to be " more liberal " in his opinions on social policy , such as women 's rights , than other Taliban officials .
But he does not seem to have the political clout to influence social policy .
Haqqani nevertheless remains respected as a competent and influential officer in Taliban military affairs .
His ties to " various radical Arab groups , " concern the Department of State , as one source reports that " in exchange for weapons and money … [ he is ] offering shelter for various Arabs in areas of Paktia province . "
The Department notes that " reporting in other channels indicate that Haqqani maintains these links " with radical Arab elements in Afghanistan .
Document 8 similarly discusses Haqqani's ties to Arab and Kashmiri militants .
According to Steve Coll 's 2008 acclaimed book , The Bin Ladens : An Arabian Family in the American Century , for a period between 1986 and the rise of the Taliban in 1994 Haqqani " became what intelligence officers refer to as a ' unilateral ' asset of the CIA , meaning that he received tens of thousands of dollars in cash directly from CIA officers working undercover in Pakistan , without any mediation by Pakistani intelligence , which normally handled and relayed the great majority of CIA funds to the Afghans … .
Haqqani , in turn , helped and protected Osama [ bin Laden ] and the Arab volunteers as they built their nascent militia .
( Osama later referred to Haqqani as a " hero mujahid sheikh " … ) …
Osama would have had no reason to know about Haqqani 's opportunistic work with the CIA , but he and his Arab volunteers benefited from it . "

Document 6 – 1997 Peshaw 00021
U.S. Consulate ( Peshawar ) , Cable , " Afghanistan : Taliban Agree to Visits of Militant Training Camps , Admit Bin Ladin is Their Guest , " January 9 , 1997 , Secret , 6 pp .
Taliban Foreign Minister Ghaus and senior Taliban leader Mullah Rabbani , whose official title varies between " chairman of the interim caretaker government and chairman of the interim shura in Kabul , " tell U.S. officials that Washington should select delegation members and dates for an American visit to militant training camps " which the Taliban claim they have closed . "
The Taliban insist they do not allow terrorists to operate in their territory and they have instructed Osama bin Laden not to commit , support or plan any terrorist acts from Afghan soil .
This message will be repeated to U.S. officials by Taliban representatives dozes of times in the years preceding September 11 , 2001 .
Deputy Foreign Minister Mullah Jalil tells U.S. officials that the Taliban has effective control over bin Laden and " that bin Ladin had lived in caves south of Jalalabad in Tora Bora and the Taliban had become suspicious .
They told him to move out , to live in an ordinary house . "
Although not terribly noteworthy at the time , this bit of information is rather interesting in light of the 2001 American invasion and subsequent occupation of Afghanistan .
It is widely believed that bin Laden found safe haven in the Tora Bora mountainous border region .
In 2001 bin Laden may have been more familiar with the mountain region than the U.S. realized when designing strategy to combat and capture al - Qaeda early in the war .

U.S. State Department officials note , " while we do not know much about [ Taliban ] decision - making , there is enough anecdotal evidence to suggest there are differences of opinion among high - level Taliban leaders .
And when they do reach a decision , there is not a well - defined process for communicating that decision to all the areas under their control , let alone making sure that it is carried out . "
In addition to noting that the Taliban is not as politically unified as they might want outsiders to believe , they are furthermore more ideologically heterogenous than previously thought .
" There are also many non-ideological Afghans ( former commanders , tribal leaders , khalqis , etc. ) who have jumped into the Taliban bandwagon for their own motives .
There is thus some evidence to suggest that in provinces where they are in control , they – or at least their ideology – are spread thin . "
The Department comes to grips with the reality of U.S. - Afghan relations by plainly stating " the Taliban are a fact of life in Afghanistan and will not soon disappear … [ U.S. policy ] will inevitably be messy and the policy we follow will be ridden with inner tensions , as we simultaneously engage with the Taliban and criticize their abuses . "
( Please note that this document was previously published in the August 14 , 2007 National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book " Pakistan : ' The Taliban 's Godfather ? ' " but is also included in this collection as it provides useful information on the Taliban 's decision - making process in addition to the information on the relationship between Pakistan , bin Laden and the Taliban that was highlighted in the August 2007 briefing book . )

U.S. Embassy ( Islamabad ) , Cable , " Afghanistan : Taliban Decision - Making and Leadership Structure " December 30 , 1997 , Secret , 16 pp. [ Excised ]
Providing rare insight into the Taliban 's structure of government in Afghanistan as of December 1997 , this document concludes that although " it is extremely difficult to understand what goes on within the walls in Kandahar or how the Taliban relate to one another … [ it is ] clear … the Taliban movement as a whole has accepted the increasingly personalized rule of Mullah Omar . "
Despite Omar 's position as the unrivaled decision maker in the Taliban governance structure , " several Taliban leaders , including Deputy Leader Mullah Rabbani , reportedly maintain an independent power base . "
Basic , but elusive details on how the Taliban govern Afghanistan are provided here .
" The Taliban have created four major institutional structures that technically maintain the ability to weigh in on policy issues and policy implementation . "
These include :
The " Inner " Shura – a council of the 23 most important Taliban leaders .
It was once " considered the Taliban 's collective leadership , " but quickly lost importance " since Mullah Omar assumed the title of amir and developed his highly - personalized leadership style . "
One member told U.S. officials the group meets " occasionally and during crisis . "
The " Outer " Shura – a council with over 100 members " including many religious figures and provincial notables .
It is considered relatively unimportant , " although it is intended to advise the Inner Shura .
The Caretaker Council – Headed by Mullah Rabbani and formed after the Taliban capture of Kabul .
Charged with implementing policies created by the Inner Shura or Mullah Omar .
The " Ulema " Shura – a Kandahar - based council that " is believed to have some influence on social policies and to play a key role in advising Mullah Omar on Islamic law . "
It reportedly has 24 members , but is a highly secretive group and details regarding its actions are unknown .

U.S. Embassy ( Islamabad ) Cable , " Afghanistan : The Taliban 's Mullah Rabbani : Contender for Taliban Leadership ? "
April 7 , 1998 , Confidential , 11 pp . [ Excised ]
Rumors of division between Supreme Leader Mullah Omar and Deputy Leader Mullah Rabbani are surfacing as Rabbani " has raised his public profile , seemingly overcoming reported efforts by Taliban leader Mullah Omar to sideline him . "
The U.S. Department of State however does not expect this development to precipitate a change in the Taliban regime anytime soon , as there is a constant emphasis on party unity in the Taliban .
" The most that can be said at this time is that Rabbani 's reemergence could be a net plus if – as some speculate – he is more willing than Omar to consider negotiations with the north[ern ] " territories of Afghanistan that are still at war with the Taliban .
Deputy Foreign Minister Jalil tells U.S. officials that Rabbani has " mental problems , " and " cannot take the pressure of a senior position since he constantly needs medical attention in Saudi Arabia . "
[ Note that Rabbani reportedly died of cancer in Pakistan in April 2001 ] .
It is unclear if this comment was made by Jalil sincerely or if it was intended to tarnish Rabbani 's reputation in an effort to declare loyalty to Omar and reassert Omar 's undivided control .
The document additionally comments that Mullah Mohammed Ghaus is " less powerful " in the current Taliban structure " because he failed to subdue , through force or by negotiation , Taliban opponents in Mazar - I - Sharif in May 1997 . "
Mullah Hassan , Governor of Kandahar is also said to be losing influence .
How much tension there is between Omar and Rabbani remains unknown as sources give conflicting accounts of relations between the first and second in command of the Taliban .
Some observe Rabbani as a moderate who disagrees with Omar on issues of social policy , negotiations with Northern Alliance commander Ahmad Shah Massoud , and which course of action to take regarding Osama bin Laden , while others believe " that Rabbani wholeheartedly supports Omar 's policies on gender issues and on providing ' safe - haven ' to Saudi terrorist financier Usama bin Ladin . "
Solid , reliable information about the relationship between Omar and Rabbani is hard to establish .

The Taliban administration is moving around its " diplomatic " personnel .
" Diplomatic " is placed in quotes throughout the document , as the Taliban do not have official diplomatic ties to any states aside from Pakistan , Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates .
Discussed in this document are Abdul Wahab , Abdul Hakim Mujahid , and Syed - ur Rahman Haqqani .
Rahman Haqqani was educated in a madrassa in North West Pakistan and is one of the very few non-Pashtun members of the Taliban .

U.S. Embassy ( Islamabad ) Cable , " Afghanistan : Longstanding Tensions Between Taliban Leader Omar and Deputy Leader Rabbani Said To Be On Increase " December , 10 , 1998 , Confidential , 7 pp . [ Excised ]
U.S. State Department officials report growing tensions between Mullah Omar and Mullah Rabbani , the two most powerful figures in the Taliban movement in the late 1990s .
There have been previous reports of multiple potential ideologically - based fissures between the two officials , but it appears one topic , the Taliban 's continued protection of al - Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden , has created a particular source of contention between Omar and Rabbani .
According to the document , " Omar continues to take the hard - line view that bin Ladin should not be expelled or extradited , while Rabbani believes that the Taliban must settle the matter before they become even more isolated from the international community . "
However , it remains unlikely " that Omar will allow the problems with Rabbani – who has many allies – to result in an open break . "
Additionally , tensions between the Taliban and Saudi Arabia have recently become evident as Riyadh has denied Mullah Rabbani a visa , but recently granted one to the " nominal leader of the anti-Taliban alliance , " former Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani , for a visit to Jeddah and the holy sites .
The hostility between Saudi Arabia and the Taliban may also have been caused in part by the Taliban alliance with Saudi exile Osama bin Laden .

U.S. Embassy ( Islamabad ) Cable , " Afghanistan : The Taliban 's Decision - Making Process and Leadership Structure , " December 31 , 1998 , Confidential , 15 pp . [ Excised ]
Updating the 1997 review of Taliban personnel and general governance structure ( Document 8 – Islama 11233 ) , this summary document reports that Taliban Supreme Leader Mullah Omar is " stronger than ever , " playing " the preeminent role in Taliban decision - making . "
He enforces policies using " The Ministry ( formerly Department ) to Propagate Virtue and Prevent Vice . "
Famously soft - spoken , spartan and introverted , Omar is showing signs of increased confidence .
" There was further evidence in 1998 that the Taliban 's institutional framework , i.e. , the ‘ Inner , ' and ' Outer ' shuras , were weakening from disuse due to the highly - personalized leadership style of Mullah Omar .
That said the ‘ Ulema Shura ' [ a Taliban judicial council ] – while shadowy – seemed to have augmented its influence . "
The document provides a summary of each of the known functions of the various shuras in place for the Taliban , the Inner Shura , the Outer Shura , the Kabul Shura / the Caretaker Council and the Ulema Shura .
Omar " maintains an idiosyncratic , almost obscurantist , leadership style , " where he makes policy decisions , " but generally leaves the day - to - day matters to his key lieutenants . "
In order to ensure his deputies remain " off balance " and do " not grow overly comfortable in their positions , Omar also rotates Taliban officials from post - to - post , apparently at a whim . "
Possible changes in Mullah Omar 's ideological stances alarm U.S. Department of State officials as they report " Omar – perhaps under the influence of bin Ladin and other extremists – may have become more sympathetic to pan-Islamist thinking .
For example , he was quoted at least twice in 1998 as criticizing the U.S. presence in the Gulf , which is not usually a great concern of Afghans . "
Summarizing Mullah Omar national leadership , the Department finds that " within the movement Omar 's legitimacy rests on four pillars : 1 ) ‘ His reputation as a pious Muslim ' 2 ) ‘ His role as an effective ( if relatively unknown commander during the Afghan - Soviet War ' 3 ) ‘ His opposition to the corrupt mujahadeen commanders who ruled [ the ] Kandahar area after the April 1992 fall of the communist regime . '
4 ) ‘ His success in guiding the Taliban to the domination of up to 85 percent or so of the country , including all of the major cities . ' "
The document reports that finding information on the inner workings of the group is a difficult task .
" For these reasons , the Taliban 's decision - making process and leadership structure remains opaque . "

Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs Karl F. Inderfurth to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , " Taliban Under Pressure " May 1 , 2000 , Confidential , 4 pp .
The message from Department of State officials that the Taliban 's " hold on power may be slipping " inspires a hand - written note from Secretary of State Albright in the document 's margins : " This is encouraging .
Let 's discuss when you come back . "
Since January 2000 , the Department has received " a number of reports suggest[ ing ] the Taliban are facing growing political opposition in areas they occupy . "
Two provinces , Herat and Paktia , are specifically cited as possible areas of unrest as opposition grows in response to " Taliban policies on property , its harsh version of Islam , security , conscription , and lack of administration . "
Additionally , the Taliban may be dealing with rising internal dissent as members are increasingly being cited in incidents of anti-Taliban vandalism and assistance in the escape of opposition figures .
Frustration with the leadership over social and administrative policies may be on the rise as " thousands of civil servants reportedly have been fired because the Taliban cannot pay their salaries . "
The political positions of various nations towards the Taliban are discussed in brief , as the cable notes how the international community is becoming increasingly displeased with the regime .
" Although Pakistan 's support for the Taliban remains firm , " " Russia , furious with the Taliban 's support for Chechen separatists , is working with some success with the NIS countries [ Newly Independent States ] bordering Afghanistan to form a common front against the spread of extremism and narcotics from Taliban - controlled Afghanistan .
Turkey wants to play a greater role against the spread of extremism … "

U.S. Consulate ( Peshawar ) Cable , " Afghanistan : Military Situation Reviewed , " January 12 , 2001 , Confidential , 19 pp . [ Excised ]
Reviewing the Taliban 's military gains in 2000 and outlining the critical political and military issues facing the Taliban and the ailing but stubborn opposition run by Ahmad Shah Massoud , this document describes how the most recent Taliban offensive in the northern - most regions of Afghanistan was " a repeat of the failed offensives of previous summers , the Taliban suffered heavy casualties and took little new ground . "
The cable notes that " among the Taliban 's weaknesses is that their only real success has come on the battlefield .
They have established security , at least relative to the anarchy that preceded them , and they have managed to extend their military domination across perhaps 95 percent of the country .
They 've done precious little else … .
We still see no evidence that they can begin to do anything else that real governments do . "
Nevertheless , groups in Afghanistan opposing the Taliban have not been gaining ground either , as one report suggests " that Masoud 's supply lines are increasingly threatened by the growing accommodation between Uzbekistan and the Taliban . "
Uzbek leader Abdul Rashid Dostum may consider an anti-Taliban alliance with Masoud , although " Dostum 's motivations and foreign support remain unclear as he has appeared to have had support from Iran , Turkey , and Uzbekistan at different times . "
In any case , such an alliance may not even be feasible due to the " Government of Tajikistan 's prohibition on Dostum using Tajik territory as a base from which to assist Masoud . "

Providing updated biographical summaries on several Taliban members , this Defense Intelligence Agency report contains several interesting post - 9/11 developments including a note that " one of [ Mullah Omar 's ] sons [ was ] reportedly killed during October 2001 air strikes . "
Some Taliban officials such as Mullah Hassan Akhund seem to have risen in the ranks .
In 1997 , Akhund , the " Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs , " was " not known to be especially close to Mullah Omar , " whereas by late 2001 according to this document , Akhund is serving as Vice President of the Council of Ministers , " a close associate of Mullah Omar . "
Other Taliban officials by 2001 are gone altogether , including second - in - command Mullah Mohammed Rabbani , having died of cancer in April 2001 .

Microsoft is taking a two - pronged approach to making sure customers know which hardware and software is compatible with Windows 7 .
It 's launching a database of compatible products as well as running a special labeling scheme .
The campaign is mostly aimed at making up for the Vista debacle , where many applications and devices had compatibility problems when the OS first launched in early 2007 , creating a bad impression that lasted even after many of those problems were fixed .
The firm will be anxious to ensure customers do not view Windows 7 in the same manner .
Windows 7 Compatibility Center
Last July , Microsoft launched a database of compatible products titled " Windows Vista Compatibility Center . "
This time round it will be launching a Windows 7 version of Compatibility Center right away when the new operating system makes its debut on October 22 .
However , Microsoft has already announced that 6,000 products have passed compatibility testing .
( Source : microsoft.com )
As well as the database , Microsoft is launching a " Compatible with Windows 7 " logo which can be used on appropriate products .
There is an accreditation process and fee to use the logo , though the company says this will be simpler and cheaper than similar schemes in the past .
Win7 Compatible Logo : Not for all Netbooks
There may be some products which can run Windows 7 but do n't qualify for the logo , however .
That 's because the rules of the scheme mean " compatible " products must work with all versions of Windows 7 , including the 64 - bit editions .
That could be a problem for many netbooks , which are based on Intel 's Atom processor , currently only compatible with 32 - bit operating systems .
There are already fears this could lead to confused buyers passing up PC models simply because they do n't bear the logo .
At the moment , the labeling scheme will only apply to peripheral devices rather than computers themselves , so Microsoft may alter the rules when it issues labels for netbooks .
( Source : cnet.com )
Vista Capable Legal Issues Still Haunt
It 's understandable that Microsoft would act cautiously .
That 's because it received much criticism , and an embarrassing legal saga , over a previous labeling scheme which declared products to be " Vista Capable " .
It turned out that this only referred to basic editions of Vista and some computers with the logo could n't run more advanced features , including the much - hyped Aero graphics system .
Susan Finkelstein was eventually given a pair of tickets for the game
A US woman charged with offering sex for baseball World Series tickets has denied she did anything wrong .
" I 'm not embarrassed about my actions .
I 'm embarrassed about how I was arrested , " Susan Finkelstein , from Philadelphia , told AP news agency .
The 43 - year - old was speaking a day after meeting an undercover policeman responding to her ad on Craigslist .
In the ad , the Philadelphia Phillies team fan said : " I 'm the creative type !
Maybe we can help each other ! "
She also described herself as a " gorgeous , tall , buxom blonde diehard Phillies fan " .
' Nice lady '
Mrs Finkelstein said she had wanted to get tickets to take her husband to Wednesday night 's opening game of the World Series - in which the Phillies beat the New York Yankees 6 - 1 .
Her lawyer said his client never explicitly offered sex , adding that she was merely " a nice lady overcome with Phillies fever " .
She was arrested on Tuesday at a Philadelphia bar after discussing her ad with the undercover policeman .
Mrs Finkelstein faces a preliminary hearing on 3 December .
But her lawyer expressed hope the misdemeanour charge of soliciting prostitution would be dismissed .
Mrs Finkelstein was eventually given a pair of tickets for another game this weekend , through a radio station .
Django Testing Code Coverage¶
As part of the summer of code 2009 , Django test coverage has been developed .
I mentored Kevin Kusabik , who developed the code .
It is hopefully going to be merged in 1.2 , but there are still a few issues to be worked out in the implementation .
That said , it currently works , and provides a nice introspective view of your code .
This post will tell you how to run coverage on your code base .
It should be noted that having code coverage is a good way to look into your code , but does n’t guarantee that there are no bugs .
Ned Batchelder ’s Pycon talk last year is a good introduction to coverage .
We are using his Coverage . py module in this example to produce the coverage output in Django .
I have taken the commits from the Summer of Code and put them in a Branch on github .
You will want to clone this and put it on your PYTHONPATH as your django module .
If you are already using the github mirror , simply add me as a remote and pull down the coverage branch .
git remote add ericholscher git : // github .
com / ericholscher / django git fetch ericholscher git co - b coverage ericholscher / coverage
Once you have the code , you simple run your tests in the normal manner .
However , now have the added options of -- coverage and -- report .
If you run the test command with just -- coverage , it will generate a text based coverage report .
If you also specify the -- report option , it will output a HTML report in the current directory .
The HTML report is where most of the value of coverage comes from , allowing you to see what lines were covered and missed .
Here is an example HTML report , showing the Django source code ’s coverage .
One of the major problems with coverage is that it slows down running tests by a non-trivial amount .
For every instruction executed , there must be a record made .
With coverage .
py 3.0 , this extension is written in C for speed , however it still noticeably slows down test speed .
I hope that you give it a try and enjoy the results .
I ’ll be spending some time over the next week or 2 cleaning up the code and trying to get it into shape for inclusion in Django .

Prosecutors said that after a year - long investigation they had finally gathered enough evidence to arrest Ignace Murwanashyaka and his close aide Straton Musoni .
The Rwandan nationals are accused of war crimes , crimes against humanity , of using child soldiers and heading a criminal organization .
Murwanashyaka is the leader of the FDLR , the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda .
Operating from the territory of neighbouring Congo the FDLR for 15 years has been waging a war against the Tutsi government in Rwanda - and many among its ranks and file are accused of genocide and war crimes .
In 1994 Rwanda was the site of one of the worst genocides in history .
More than 800,000 people - mostly Tutsi - were killed over three months by the army and Hutu militias .
Today , there 's peace in Rwanda but on the other side of the mountain range , in the Democratic Republic of Congo , many of the Hutu militiamen continue their fight .
Organized as the FDLR , they bring havoc over the eastern Congo - turning 1.5 million people into refugees .
The United Nations are investigating
The Mutobo camp is helping former rebels to start a normal peaceful life
The United Nations are trying to shed light on the FDLR and its criminal structures .
In a reintegration camp for former rebel fighters , UN mediators have met with former officers .
Who is giving the orders in the FDLR , who is in charge of finances , strategies , and ideology ?
But the former fighters have been hesitant to talk about their past , they 're afraid to give out names .
Several have already received death threats .
They knew that the FDLR chief Ignace Murwanashyaka was living in Germany and that he was closely following media reports about him .
A former major explained how the order of command works .
" The FDLR is divided into a political and a military wing , " he says .
" Murwanashyaka is the head of the political wing but ultimately he also holds the command over the military side .
He is treated like a head of state among his men .
And the top general among the fighters , Sylvestre Mudacumura is a good friend of his . "
The United Nations have documented the phone contacts made between Murwanashyaka in Germany and Mudacumura in eastern Congo .
The two were in regular contact with each other and the number of calls increased whenever the FDLR found itself in a difficult situation - as for instance last February when its forces were being hunted by the official army .
Former officers of the FDLR have confirmed that orders are coming from Germany
" Whenever the situation was difficult , we spoke every three days , " former rebel general Paul Rwarakabije recalled .
" Otherwise there was contact only once a week .
Until I left in 2003 , I was reporting about the current situation and he told me about the political strategy and gave his ideas which we then had to implement .
We mostly communicated via satellite phone or email . "
In Germany , the rebel chief is recognized as a refugee
It 's was by no means a secret that the head of the FDLR lived in the Germany city of Mannheim .
Politicians and the judiciary were well aware of the fact , but the wheels of justice turned very slowly .
Since 2000 he had been recognized as a refugee in Germany - which means that he was barred from engaging in any political activity .
He 's already been convicted once on that count but received a suspended sentence .
The 1994 genocide in Rwanda claimed more than 800,000 lives
In 2008 , Rwanda issued an international arrest warrant against Murwanashyaka , accusing him of numerous human rights violations .
In the past Germany has said it will not extradite him because it considers the Rwandan legal system incapable of holding a fair trial .
Rwanda hopes for better cooperation with Berlin
For Rwanda 's leading public prosecutor , Martin Ngoga , it 's irrelevant where the FDLR chief is put on trial , whether in Rwanda or Germany : the important thing is that he is faces justice .
" He 's the head of an armed rebel group that is responsible for killing countless innocent people - and which continues to do so , " Ngoga says .
" The FDLR is considered a terrorist organisation and it would be very bad if Berlin does n't recognize that .
We hope that the case is finally properly picked up the German authorities .
The urgency to do so grows by the day . "
Ngoga is counting on his colleagues in Germany .
The case of Ignace Murwanashyaka is at the top of his agenda - after all , Rwanda has already spent 15 years searching for dozens of war criminals involved in the 1994 genocide .
Many of the fighters from back then are now members of the FDLR - and dismantling the rebel organization could be a crucial step towards peace in the region .

British secret service chief justifies torture
21 October 2009
With efforts by the Labour government to suppress evidence of collusion with the United States threatened with collapse , the head of Britain ’s secret service , MI5 , last week made a public defence of the use of torture to obtain evidence against alleged terrorists .
MI5 Director General Jonathan Evans spoke at Bristol University on October 15 , even as Lord Justice Thomas and Mr. Justice Lloyd Jones were preparing to issue a judgment on whether the Labour government should release a CIA briefing detailing the 2002 interrogation of British resident Binyam Mohamed .
The Times of London noted that Evans ’s statements could be interpreted as commenting on a case that was sub judice .
One MI5 officer , known as Witness B , is currently being investigated by the Metropolitan Police for “ possible criminal wrongdoing . ”
Ethiopian - born Mohamed was arrested in Pakistan , rendered to Morocco and then detained in Guantánamo Bay , Cuba .
He was released in February without charge and is suing the British government on the grounds that MI5 was complicit in his torture .
MI5 is accused of supplying questions to be asked , as well as personal information about Mohamed .
Mohamed also alleges that an MI5 officer , Witness B , visited him while he was imprisoned in Morocco .
The British government challenged the release of the CIA briefing as a threat to national security .
It claimed that release of the document would lead to the United States withdrawing intelligence cooperation .
The judges rejected this argument in their October 16 ruling and accused Foreign Secretary David Miliband of acting in a manner harmful to the rule of law .
“ Championing the rule of law , not subordinating it , is the cornerstone of democracy , ” they ruled .
Evans has a personal interest in concealing what happened to Mohamed , as he was the MI5 director responsible for counterterrorism at the time .
In his speech , he argued that the rule of law no longer holds in the so - called “ war on terror . ”
He claimed that unlike the world wars of the last century , when the enemy was Germany , and in contradistinction to the struggle against “ international Soviet - inspired communism ” and the fight against “ international terrorism of the 1970s and 1980s , ” after 9/11 “ the UK and other Western countries were faced with the fact that the terrorist threat posed by Al Qaida was indiscriminate , global and massive . ”
It was therefore not possible to be too choosy about the methods employed to defeat terrorism .
MI5 did not itself , he declared , “ torture people , nor do we collude in torture or solicit others to torture people on our behalf . ”
But after 9/11 , the agency had to collaborate with countries “ where the standards and practices of the local security apparatus were very far removed from our own . ”
MI5 had perhaps been “ slow to detect the emerging pattern of US practice in the period after 9/11 , ” he continued .
Nevertheless , “ we should recall that notwithstanding these serious issues , the UK has gained huge intelligence benefits from our cooperation with the US agencies in recent years , and the US agencies have been generous in sharing intelligence with us . ”
This is double - speak .
MI5 stands accused not merely of turning a blind eye or being ignorant of abuse by others .
Together with the British government , it is accused of suppressing substantial evidence of active collaboration with the US and its client regimes in a programme of extraordinary rendition that amounted to the outsourcing of torture .
Despite the pro-forma denial of direct collusion , Evans ’s speech remains a naked defence of torture based purely on expediency , i.e. , the claim that torture works .
“ Operating a security service within a liberal democracy does , of course , pose problems and occasionally dilemmas , ” he said .
His answer to such “ dilemmas ” is the assertion that the rules of democratic governance do not apply where the fight against terrorism is concerned .
Evans ’s speech is a telling indication of how far the erosion of basic democratic rights has progressed .
He cites a number of restraints on the security service acting illegally , including the authority of the home secretary and accountability to “ the Intelligence and Security Committee of parliamentarians . ”
In reality , those charged with supervision of MI5 agree that the rule of law should no longer apply .
A significant portion of his speech was based on a citation from an August , 2009 , article by Miliband and the home secretary , Alan Johnson , insisting that “ Intelligence from overseas is critical to our success in stopping terrorism . ”
The article went on to state that while “ we have to work hard to ensure that we do not collude in torture or mistreatment … it is not possible to eradicate all risk . ”
The home and foreign Secretaries recognize “ that we operate in a complex environment where easy answers are not available to us , ” Evans declared .
Miliband is continuing to challenge the ruling by Lord Justices Thomas and Jones .
His stance is supported by the Obama administration .
The justification of criminal actions in the name of combating terrorism is a direct and immediate threat to the democratic rights of every British resident .
MI5 has undergone a massive expansion in recent years .
By the end of 2010 it will be twice the size it was in 2001 , standing at 4,100 employees .
The British state sets aside £ 1.86 billion to run MI5 , MI6 and the GCHQ spy centre , with MI5 taking the lion ’s share .
The organization admits to having under surveillance 2,000 people who are considered a threat to national security , but this is the tip of the iceberg .
The security services keep files on innumerable political activists and trade unionists , who will be treated no differently to those accused of terrorism should the need arise .
The insistence that torture is permissible is only one manifestation of the incompatibility of the turn to militarism and colonial wars of conquest with the preservation of democratic norms .
The wars and occupations carried out by Britain alongside the US in Afghanistan and Iraq are predatory and illegal , aimed at securing control of vital reserves of oil and gas .
They were justified with false claims following 9/11 that they were necessary to combat the threat posed by Al Qaeda and “ rogue states . ”
Both wars were launched on the basis of lies and in defiance of overwhelming popular opposition .
As the tragedy these wars unleashed in Iraq and Afghanistan worsened , ever more draconian measures were adopted against terrorist dangers both real and spurious .
Torture was routinely utilized to secure false confessions designed to justify the war - mongering of Washington and London and the passage of repressive legislation aimed at intimidating those opposed to war .
It was , for example , through the torture of captured Al Qaeda operative Abu Zubaydah that the Bush government fabricated evidence of links between Al Qaeda and the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq .
Among the methods used to extract “ evidence ” from Binyam Mohamed was the threat of torture with the aid of razor blades .
His confession was the basis of the allegation that US citizen José Padilla was planning a “ dirty bomb ” attack on US cities .
After Padilla was held for years in a military brig , denied any contact with lawyers or relatives and subjected to torture , the “ dirty bomb ” charge was dropped and Padilla was tried and convicted in a civil court on the unrelated charge of conspiracy in plans for an overseas jihad and the funding of terrorist groups operating outside the US .
The drive to militarism and war is dictated by a financial elite at the apex of society for the purpose of seizing the resources of the entire planet .
It is bound up with an historically unprecedented accumulation of personal wealth by an oligarchy , carried out through the immiseration of the international working class .
The imperialist ruling elites resort to the abrogation of constitutional and legal norms , because it impossible to secure a popular mandate for policies inimical to the interests of the vast majority .
The resulting class tensions are increasingly incompatible with democratic methods of rule .
The assault on democratic rights can be combated only through the development of an independent political movement of the international working class against the profit system , which is the source of poverty , repression and war .

Somali pirates who claim to have kidnapped a retired British couple in the Indian Ocean are said to have threatened to use them as " insurance " against any attempt to rescue the crew of a Spanish fishing trawler seized early this month .
As the fate of Paul and Rachel Chandler , from Tunbridge Wells , in Kent , remained unclear , threats against the couple were made in telephone calls to media organisations today .
The trawler Alakrana and its 36 crew were taken on 2 October , reportedly by the same group claiming to be holding the Chandlers on their yacht , Lynn Rival .
In one call , a pirate who gave his name as Shamum Indhobur , reportedly told the Spanish news agency EFE that any rescue attempt on either vessel would result in suffering for those aboard the other .
" We have the Spanish ship and this new yacht , and we warn naval forces that they must avoid any military action , because if one is attacked , we will punish those from the other , " he said in a call from Harardhere , a Somali pirate haven .
There is still no confirmation that Paul Chandler , 59 , a former quantity surveyor , and Rachel Chandler , 55 , an economist , have been taken hostage .
The EU Naval Force said a yacht seen on yesterday towing a skiff 200 miles south - east of Harardhere was still being monitored .
" We still have the yacht in sight but still can't confirm that it is the Lynn Rival , " said Commander John Harbour .
In another phone call , Ahmed Sheikh , who claimed to be a member of the gang , reportedly told the French news agency AFP that about 60 gunmen had arrived in Harardhere to protect the pirates , adding : " We have made proper contact with the boat and everybody is OK .
The hostages ' fate will be discussed when the boat gets here . "
Another alleged pirate , Mohamed Hussein , said the Chandlers ' lives would be in danger if there was any attack .
" We are telling Britain that … any attack on us … they will burn [ those ] two people 's bones , " he told Sky News .
The couple , who have been travelling the world for the past three years , set off on Thursday for Tanzania from Seychelles .
Their emergency distress beacon was activated at 11 pm on Friday .
Since then nothing has been heard from them .
They had informed family and friends they could be out of satellite phone contact for several days .
Relatives were today " keeping their fingers crossed " , as Somalia 's prime minister , Omar Sharmarke , on a visit to London , pledged his government would do everything it could to " see a peaceful solution " .
Rachel Chandler 's brother , Stephen Collett , 58 , of Ixworth , Suffolk , who met the Somali prime minister , said : " It may still be that they 're sailing across the Indian Ocean .
We 're not grossly over - worried at the moment . "
Paul Chandler 's sister , Jill Marshment , 69 , from Bredon , near Tewkesbury , said if the couple had been kidnapped they were " resilient people " .
" If I was to give a message to the pirates , I 'd say you 've got the wrong people .
They 're not a wealthy couple .
They just wanted to take early retirement , to take a boat and to see more of the world . "
She added : " They wo n't be weeping .
Instead , they 'll be thinking : ' What are we going to do ?
What are we going to say ? ' "
The couple , married for 28 years and who have no children , are passionate and experienced sailors but their route would have taken them near waters notorious for pirate attacks .
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office was continuing " urgent " investigations , but was unable to say for sure whether they were being held captive .
In one unconfirmed and possibly unrelated sighting , Somali villagers yesterday reported seeing a small vessel about 30 nautical miles south of Somalia 's port city of Hobyo , another land base for pirates , according to Andrew Mwangura , the head of the Kenya - based East African Seafarers ' Assistance Programme .
In April , US special forces shot dead three Somali pirates on a lifeboat and freed an American cargo ship captain , Richard Phillips , ending a five - day standoff .
But when French forces stormed a yacht in the same month , one of the five hostages was killed .
Two other French rescue attempts have been successful .
The west coast part of the book tour is over , but Mike and I are still on the road .
We had to skip LA and San Diego , and now I guess this is a different sort of tour .
I do not know what kind of tour exactly .
I only know that we 're out of books and we keep moving .
We 're in SF for another couple days , and then we 're going to San Diego and then Mexico .
I have bad feelings .
We 're probably going to die in international waters .
If not , we 'll be in Toronto for Canzine , then Montreal , then in mid-November we 're crossing the Atlantic for readings in London , Edinburgh , Dublin , Paris .
Moderation is like a foreign language .
You have to learn that shit when you 're young .
Some neat stuff , things I 'm doing , things I 'm looking for ... whatever .
" Remember , remember the fifth of November ... "
In case you needed an excuse to have a couple of cold ones , burn stuff and light fireworks , look no further .
November 5 is Guy Fawkes Day .
On November 5 , 1605 , England held a celebration for the opening of Parliament .
Guy Fawkes tried to spark a revolution by blowing up the building – and the royal family along with it – in what is known as the
.
The plot was foiled when one of Fawkes 's co-conspirators sent a letter to a friend telling the friend to stay away from Parliament that night .
The letter was intercepted and Fawkes was found in the basement of Parliament getting ready to light the fuse on several dozen barrels of gunpowder .
He was tortured for a list of his co-conspirators , and was hanged in January of 1606 .
Fawkes was born a Protestant but converted to Catholicism at a time when Catholics were persecuted in England .
He hoped to incite the country to revolution in an attempt to gain equal ( or better ) recognition for Catholics ( read more from the BBC ) .
Guy Fawkes
Day is celebrated by burning effigies of Fawkes in a communal bonfire , and by setting off Fireworks .
A British ex-pat living in Burnsville , Minn. , brought the celebration to the town one year .
Fawkes 's Gunpowder Plot received a modern makeover in the film " V for Vendetta . "
Here is Hugo Weaving as V detailing his reasons from the movie :

So far in this series of technical talks , I have tried to explain some of the pieces that have to be put together to get crude oil or natural gas out of the ground .
I intend to go on with the series in the coming weeks , but thought that today I would put some of the different thoughts that I have talked about recently together .
So I am going to talk a little about reserve calculations and production and will use an example to show how the numbers are derived .
And again , let me stress that this is a very simplified example .
It is also only somewhat fictionalized , as I shall comment at the end .
Let us then assume that this has been folded in the middle , so that it now has trapped oil within all the pores of the rock .
And , for the sake of discussion let 's assume that it has a porosity of 20 % .
Now having found this reservoir - which is , let 's say some 6,500 ft below the current surface of the ground - back some years ago , the oil moguls of the time decided to drill into it and extract the oil .
So first let 's do a bit of arithmetic - 300 x 5 x 5280 x 30 x 5280 = 1,254,528,000,000 cu.ft .
At 20 % porosity , this means that some 250,905,600,000 cu. ft. are not rock , and in this case are going to be full of oil .
This is equivalent to 1,876,773,888,000 gallons or 44,685,092,571 barrels of oil .
This is , roughly 45 billion barrels of oil .
That 's how much is there .
( We 're neglecting , for now any water that is also in the rock ) .
This is a relatively light oil and flows through the cracks in the rock quite easily , and there are a lot of these fractures , and it does n't stick to the rock that tightly , so the assumption is made that production can get out some 50 % of the original oil in place .
So , at this point we can say that the ultimate resource recovery ( URR ) is going to be 22.5 billion barrels if they can get it all .
Now , this being some time ago , the first thing that our friends did was to drill some oil wells , and this being that long ago they drilled vertical wells one quarter of a mile apart .
To make life easier I am now going to consider just a one - quarter - mile section of the reservoir , taken along the length .
We assume that the wells are spaced quarter of a mile apart , and that they gave us this one slice .
If the slice is 5 miles long , then it has 20 wells set along the section , so that each well will pull the oil out of a box that extends out one eighth of a mile laterally from the well , out toward the next .
The total recoverable oil for each well is roughly 10 million barrels , or 30,000 barrels per foot of the oil well in the reservoir .
Showing location of wells quarter - mile apart and in a quarter - mile thick slice along the reservoir .
The rock thickness is exaggerated and this is not to scale .
The rate at which the oil flows into the well is related to the difference in pressure between the oil in the rock , and the fluid in the well ; the frictional resistance of the rock to the oil flow through it ; and the length of the well that is exposed to the rock .
Let us assume that the rock resistance remains the same and that production varies directly with changes in the pressure difference and the length of the exposure .
And let us start by assuming that the well produces 3,000 barrels of oil a day .
( i.e. 10 barrels per foot of well exposed to the rock ) .
Then , in the course of a year the well will produce one million barrels of oil .
Connect up the pipes , and away we go .
After five years we notice that the volume coming out of the well is not as much as it used to be , and when we check with the engineer he explains that , as we take the oil out of the ground , so the pressure in the oil reduces , and the flow slows down .
Well , bless my bananas , and here we have just promised a new palace to one of the grandkids .
So we have a chat with the lads and they tell us of this neat trick they have in Russia .
If we pump water into the ground under the oil well , then the water will fill the holes left as the oil leaves , and we can keep the pressure in the oil up , and the oil flow will not drop as fast .
So out we go to the site , and we drill secondary wells around the first set that had been put in , and now we pump water back into the ground around the well , and bring the pressure back up to the pressure that we started with .
And from then on we are pumping water into the ground as fast , ( and soon to tell faster ) than we are taking the oil out .
Initial pattern of water flood , adjacent wells flood under the producing central well
Because now there is a little problem that we had n't thought of when we started this exercise .
Over the years we have taken out say 4 million barrels , now as we compress the oil back to the original pressure ( we 're neglecting the gas issue for now ) it will only occupy 60 % of the original space , or the top 180 ft of the reservoir .
Now at the same pressure we will only get 60 % of our original flow , because the length of the well exposed to the rock has been reduced ( and flow is related to length and pressure ) .
And this is going to get worse , each year the flow will decline as the length of exposed well in the rock gets smaller .
For example , the next year it will produce at 1,800 bd , ( 10 barrels / day / ft ) but at the end of that year we will have removed ( simplifying ) 650,000 bd of oil , and so the volume of oil will be reduced by ( roughly ) 11 % of the 6 million barrels we started with , and so the following year the production will come from only 160 ft of the reservoir , and , at the same reservoir pressure , the flow will be reduced because of the shorter exposed length .
And the flow will be , accordingly also reduced by 11 % , assuming that the overall area remains the same .
( Some folks might call this depletion , it is the decline in production with time . )
Yikes , and here that palace is n't finished yet .
So what can we do .
Well it turns out that there is another trick we can pull out of the hat .
Apparently some folk in Italy have found a way to turn a drill so that it drills horizontally across the reservoir , rather than vertically down through it .
At the same time someone else has come up with this idea , that if you just pump the water in around the edges of the reservoir then it makes a more even lift of the water : oil surface up the well , and there is n't as much chance of water stopping the well from producing while there is still oil available .
Bingo , we 'll have a couple of those .
We only need two because we can now drill the wells horizontally all the way from the middle to near the edge of the reservoir ( one in each direction ) .
So the holes are each two - and - a - quarter miles long and are equal in exposed length to the reservoir of forty of the original wells .
Now the length stays the same , but the production drops to 1.5 barrels / ft / day .
But , by pumping water into the surrounding wells , we keep the pressure up and hold that production .
So now , out of these horizontal wells we get say 18,000 barrels of oil a day .
And it keeps pumping .
Call the grandkids and have them build an extension on the palace .
Water flood under horizontal wells , in this ideal case the water is fed from the outside of the reservoir and rises as a steady horizontal lift over time -- until it reaches the wells .
But wait .
When we started doing this , we had taken out of the ground about half of the recoverable oil .
We had , in that slice of the reservoir some 200 million barrels of oil .
We had produced half of it , and thus had 100 million barrels left .
We are now producing it at the rate of 13 million barrels a year ( 2 wells ) .
But it just keeps pumping , as long as we keep pumping that water in , until . . . . . . the day the water level reaches the horizontal well layer .
And we 're done , it 's all over .
Oh , there will be some indications before it happens , water cut will start to rise again , and production drops and this is really an idealized case and production will likely drop before then due to preferential water flow through the ground .
But in either case , even if we get all that was there , and we wo n't , we did n't create any more oil by drilling horizontally , we just got it out faster .
As the technology improved , over the life of the field , it was found that oil also occurred in an additional mile of rock to either side of the zone that had been initially expected to hold it .
It also turned out that the field extended about 7 miles longer than originally anticipated .
However , with the new additions and as the field finally began to play out it turned out that the average thickness of the carbonate grainstone was only 240 ft .
If you do the same calculation as before you will find that this changes the initial estimate of the original oil in place to be some 62 billion barrels .
This change in reserves as the field is developed is not uncommon in oil fields and is one of the ways in which reserves grow , often quite significantly after the field has started to be developed .
And at this point those of you that have read “ Twilight in the Desert ” , or have worked in the oil patch may note that what I have used for my numbers bears a reasonable similarity to the oilfield known as Abqaiq in Saudi Arabia .
Google Earth image showing Abqaiq relative to the Saudi coastline ( the blue dot where the roads meet )
( Although all the exemplary numbers other than the geometric size of the field , and its porosity and depth were made up by me as I went along to illustrate the developments of the technology that have been applied to that field . )
The oil has a 36 deg API , with a gas / oil ratio of 860 cf / barrel .
( It is also sour ) .
The rock permeability is 400 millidarcies in the Arab D formation ( this info is from " Twilight " ) .
We can get some other information on this field from a number of other places .
So , as a contrast between the myth and the reality you might want to read on .
The first well at Abqaiq was spudded in August 1940 .
It began production at 9,720 bd in October 1940 , but had to be temporarily shut - in the following February because of the adjacent war .
Early development was slow , but began to pick up as the conflict moved further away .
If the expansion of 1936 had struck some of them as a period of hectic confusion , this 1944 expansion struck them as bedlam .
Their goal by the end of 1945 , they were told from San Francisco , was 550,000 barrels a day , nearly 25 times what they were turning out now in their standby operation , and much more than the capacity of their existing wells .
There would have to be a massive drilling program involving perhaps 20 strings of tools , and drilling that many oil wells meant developing adequate water supplies both at Abqaiq and at Qatif , where they had been instructed to put down a wildcat .
. . . . . . .
By June 13th , too , Phil McConnell had entirely shut down the Abqaiq field after completing No. 5 , and had diverted his entire Drilling Department to Ras Tanura .
By 1962 only 72 wells had been drilled in the field .
At the same time the gas was being extracted with the oil , and 50 % of it was being used .
Most of it was pumped back underground to maintain pressure and in some cases it was mixed with LPG ( Liquefied petroleum gas ) and this helped dilute and increase the flow of oil from the reservoir .
( But sometimes it did not work ) .
It was used in the Ain Dar part of the Ghawar field and right next door to Abqaiq .
But in 1982 the gas was collected for sale abroad .
By 1972 Aramco was drilling a well at the rate of 1 every 2.1 days .
Shortly thereafter Abqaiq peaked , at 1,094,062 bd .
In the area of Abqaiq there were 4 drilling rigs and 5 workover drigs in the period around 1977 , as the field fell back to a production of less than 800,000 bd .
By 1981 production was down to 652,000 bd .
In the mid-80's it was partially shut - in , and flow was reduced to 200,000 bd as demand declined .
And while the rest of Saudi production continued to grow , in 1988 it had 550 wells in production by 1990 Abqaig had only 47 flowing wells , and by 2002 had dropped to 500,000 bd .
It is currently 73 % depleted , according to Aramco in 2004 and 74 % according to the EIA .
Now beyond this point there are some conflicting numbers .
Let me just list some of the information that is out there .
In the 50 years since discovery it yielded 7.5 billion barrels of oil .
Abqaiq production history from Saleri via Joules Burn
The EIA considers that Abqaiq has 17 billion barrels of proven reserves .
This is in contrast with the recent " World Energy Outlook 2005 , " which projected ( through 2004 ) that Abqaiq had 5.5 billion barrels remaining and had produced some 13 billion .
( But it got the start date wrong as well . )
It uses IHS data for its projections .
From that data , quoted by Jean Laherrere , one can estimate the total oil contained in the field .
Using their anticipated total of 19 billion barrels , and that this is considered to have a recovery factor of 60 % indicates that the overall oil in place is about 31 billion barrels .
This is about half of the theoretical prediction I had made , using total volume and porosity , but given the variations in geology over the region , that the field has about 50 % of the oil that the general assumption predicted is not bad .
However using the Aramco statement that the field is 73 % depleted implies that the total oil that can be recovered from the field is around 11 - 12 billion barrels , which is in line with the HL projection created by Laherrere .
Abqaiq production projection by Jean Laherrere
The field is variously currently reported as producing between 250,000 bd and 434,000 bd .
The IEA consider the latter figure - which yields 158 million barrels a year , sustainable through 2010 .
( At 8 % depletion , although Aramco are claiming that they are holding depletion below that - by continuing in - field drilling ) .
However if the OIP is 31 billion and they are only able to recover 11.5 billion , then this gives a recovery factor of some 37 % , which is a fair bit less than is derived by other approaches .
And , it was from this field that Dogru , Hamound and Barlow generated this image :
Joules Burn has provided a much more detailed discussion of Abqaiq in a post from May 2008 ( and also repeated today above this post ) .
This has been a bit longer than these usually are , but has still had to make a lot of simplifying assumptions to fit , so again I ask those who know more to either bear with me , or to post comments .
Months ago , the Ethical Humanist Society of Chicago invited an acquaintance of mine , Sunsara Taylor , to speak at their November 1st meeting on the topic of “ Morality without God . ”
They publicized it in their calendar of events and everything .
Sunsara made travel plans to be here .
A couple weeks ago , they rescinded their offer for her to speak .
According to Sunsara ’s publicist , there was some controversy about her other social / political views ( she ’s a Communist , for one ) — some of them distortions of her actual views — and she was disinvited rather quickly .
This seems quite … shall I say … unethical ?
You do n’t disinvite a speaker after you invite them — especially when you ’re an Ethical Society that purports to be open to different ideas , including ones you may disagree with .
Sunsara wrote them a letter :
This attempt to cancel my talk has clearly been driven by political and ideological disagreements with me by some on the EHSC program committee .
This is shameful for any organization , but coming from [ an ] organization that prides itself on ethical action and promoting intellectual , philosophical and artistic freedom it is all the more disturbing .
Included in that letter were blurbs of support for Sunsara from myself and a few other people you might have heard of ( Chris Hedges , Massimo Pigliucci , etc ) .
Later on , there were supportive blurbs from people like anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan and author of The Family , Jeff Sharlet .
Let me step back for a moment and say I think this whole thing has been blown up way out of proportion .
I think the EHSC — a group I ’ve also spoken to before — did the wrong thing in revoking their offer for her to speak .
They should ’ve simply done the right thing and let her talk — and if she said anything members disagreed with , allow them to debate and question her afterwards .
That ’s what they did when I spoke there , anyway .
But that ’s about as far as it goes , right ?
This is n’t life or death .
I do n’t think many people are losing sleep over this .
It turned out one member of the EHSC agreed with Sunsara and offered to host her at his own home after the EHSC ’s normally scheduled meeting time .
Cut to a couple days ago .
On Saturday , Sunsara was running an unrelated workshop at the EHSC and made a statement :
Watch the last 30 seconds , if nothing else .
Slight tangent :
In the video above and in this letter written to the EHSC , Sunsara makes a strange comparison :
Further , the fact that it is the bureaucratic “ right ” of the Board of Trustees to reach the decision to dis - invite me does not make that decision morally right , any more than the “ right ” of California voters to ban gay marriage through Proposition 8 made that decision morally or ethically defensible .
Umm …
That ’s trivializing a serious issue and just hurts her case .
Just like her use of the word “ exile . ”
She ’s not a martyr and there ’s no need to make her one over this .
But regardless of her rhetoric , she should n’t have been disinvited .
So … cut to yesterday .
What happened ?
She still was n’t re-invited to speak , but she showed up to the Sunday meeting as promised .
She made a statement similar to the one in the video , while standing near her seat .
One man was videotaping her statement with her permission .
Then , chaos ensued .
Sunsara ’s personal blog explains :
… plainclothes and uniformed police who had been called in earlier by officials of the Ethical Humanist Society of Chicago ( EHSC ) dragged out , maced and arrested a man for videotaping Sunsara Taylor as she stood near her seat and made a statement before the start of that morning ’s program about the shameful cancellation of her long planned talk to EHSC that day on the topic “ Morality without Gods . ”
The shocking incident took place at the insistence of the president of EHSC .
About 40 people witnessed the videographer being brutalized by the police in the foyer of the facility .
An attorney demanded that the police stop brutalizing him when five officers piled on him as he lay face down on the floor .
6 police cars arrived within minutes .
What .
The .
Hell …?
For some reason , I feel like the kids on South Park right now … not sure why everybody around me is making such a big deal out of something that ’s clearly not one .
Somehow , everyone ’s getting involved and nothing good can possibly come from this .
Maybe some of you can shed more light on this story , because I ’m really only seeing one side of it .
The EHSC has n’t said anything to my knowledge .
I ’m still confused .
I ’d love to know why police were involved on Sunday , why the EHSC really disinvited Sunsara , and what ramifications this issue will have in the future , if any .

3 Upgrading from previous releases of FreeBSD [ amd64 , i386 ]
Beginning with FreeBSD 6.2 - RELEASE , binary upgrades between RELEASE versions ( and snapshots of the various security branches ) are supported using the freebsd - update ( 8 ) utility .
The binary upgrade procedure will update unmodified userland utilities , as well as unmodified GENERIC or SMP kernels distributed as a part of an official FreeBSD release .
The freebsd - update ( 8 ) utility requires that the host being upgraded have Internet connectivity .
An older form of binary upgrade is supported through the Upgrade option from the main sysinstall ( 8 ) menu on CDROM distribution media .
This type of binary upgrade may be useful on non-i386 , non-amd64 machines or on systems with no Internet connectivity .
Source - based upgrades ( those based on recompiling the FreeBSD base system from source code ) from previous versions are supported , according to the instructions in /usr / src / UPDATING .
Important : Upgrading FreeBSD should , of course , only be attempted after backing up all data and configuration files .

About 1 in 100 of America ’s 8 - year - olds have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder , according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers , who will be releasing details of their study later this year .
That ’s a 50 % increase from two years ago , when the government estimated the rate at 1 in 150 .
Dr. Ileana Arias , deputy director of the CDC , said the agency considers the disorder “ a significant issue that needs immediate attention . ”
But the higher rate might not mean more kids have autism spectrum disorder , scientists cautioned .

“ It is not clear more children are affected rather than just changes in our ability to detect , ” said Dr. Tom Insel , director of the National Institute of Mental Health .
The rate , calculated by reviewing records in communities across the U.S. , echoes findings of a national telephone survey of parents that is being published today in the journal Pediatrics .
The survey , conducted by the CDC and the Health Resources and Services Administration , asked parents of 78,000 children ages 3 to 17 whether healthcare workers or doctors had ever told them that their children had autism spectrum disorder .
Parents of 1 in 91 children said yes , and said their children currently have the disorder .
For boys , the figure was 1 in 58 .

Dr. Steven Goodman , an epidemiologist with Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , said he agrees that the prevalence is higher than years ago and that it merits concern .
But he warned against panic .
“ This has the tremendous potential to scare people , ” Goodman said .
“ It is very unlikely that there has been an explosive increase in the way that has been portrayed in the media . ”
No one knows what causes autism or how to cure it .
Scientists think it may be many distinct problems that manifest themselves similarly .
Afflicted children often have trouble communicating and socializing , and they can exhibit repetitive , rigid behavior .
Diagnosing autism relies on observation , behavioral checklists and expert assessment rather than lab tests or X - rays , making it hard to determine how common it is .

Interpreting data can be tough too .
Growing awareness , wider screening and a push to identify the disorder earlier accompany the rise in the rate , but scientists have not figured out whether other factors are also at play .
Advocates in the autism community called for more funding for research and for family services .
“ We have this amazing , terrible national health crisis on our hands at this moment , ” said Lee Grossman , president of the Autism Society , based in Maryland .
“ We have millions of people affected by this , and the services and supports available to them are inappropriate and inadequate and in some cases a detriment . ”

Fisherman reels in monster 6ft perch ... after battling with a CROCODILE
It 's not often that you 'd describe the angler , rather than the fish , as the one that got away .
But that was certainly the case for Tim Smith , who lived to tell the tale after tussling with a crocodile over this monster 6ft Nile perch .
The art teacher , 39 , had already been engaged in a titanic battle to reel in the 249lb fish for 45 minutes in his tiny motor boat on the Victoria Nile in Uganda when he realised he had a fiercer rival .
Whopper : Angler Tim Smith hopes to have his Nile perch registered as a record after he fought off a crocodile to reel it in
Fortunately , however , it was the 39 - year - old art teacher who turned out to be the one that got away , managing to tether his catch to the boat before firing the motor into life , leaving his opponent empty - mouthed in his wake .
And he was able to pose by his giant prize - which may be a record - for this spectacular photograph .
Back from his Ugandan trip and home to mercifully crocodile - free Northern Ireland , he told yesterday of his transformation from being the hunter to the hunted .
He had been grappling with the fish while in a small boat on the Victoria Nile in Uganda , about a mile downstream from the stunning Murchison Falls , for about 45 minutes when he realised he had competition .
' Suddenly the boat lurched and I nearly fell out , ' he said .
' I did n't really know what had happened .
' The next thing is , the crocodile launches itself at me , mouth wide open . '
Catch of the day : Even a hungry crocodile struggled to fit the perch in its jaws
Fortunately it had misjudged its jump and fell short , hitting the side of the boat .
' If it had launched itself another foot I 'm sure it would have got hold of me , ' he added .
' It obviously hit the front of the boat to try and knock me out and then went to the other side .
' When you realise something that size is trying to eat you , it 's really quite daunting .
I just fell back into the centre of the boat , still holding the rod . '
By then the fish had almost given up the fight , lying flat on the water close to the boat , giving the reptile its final chance .
' I just saw the crocodile swim up and grab the fish 's tail and spin it around in a death roll , but because of the size of the fish it could n't get a proper grip , ' said Mr Smith .
That enabled him to grab his catch , tie it to the side of the boat , pull up the anchor and make his getaway - and just in time .
' By the time I got the engine started the crocodile was just coming around , ' he said .
' I slammed into gear and the croc dived and disappeared . '
Mr Smith , who works at Portora Royal School in Enniskillen , then drifted down the river , tied the fish to a tree and went to a nearby wildlife safari lodge to get help .
He is now applying to the International Game Fish Association to have his Nile perch established as a record - until now , the heaviest caught on a rod and line weighed just 230lb .
Nile perch - which themselves have a voracious appetite - were controversially introduced to Lake Victoria and surrounding rivers in the 1950s , quickly decimating native species .

The same social structures that drive Wikipedia also keep the net healthy
Crack teams of volunteers keep the net online and functioning , according to leading internet lawyer Jonathan Zittrain of Harvard University .
The way data is divided up and sent around the internet in many jumps makes it " delicate and vulnerable " to attacks or mistakes , he said .
However , he added , the " random acts of kindness " of these unsung heroes quietly keep the net in working order .
Professor Zittrain 's comments came at the TED Global conference in Oxford .
Incidents such as when the Pakistan government took YouTube offline in 2008 exposed the web 's underlying fragility , he explained .
But a team of volunteers - unpaid , unauthorised and largely unknown to most people - rolled into action and restored the service within hours .
" It 's like when the Bat signal goes up and Batman answers the call , " Professor Zittrain told BBC News .
Blind faith
The fragility of the internet 's architecture was largely due to its origins , said Professor Zittrain .
He said it had been conceived with " one great limitation and with one great freedom " .
" Their limitation was that they did n't have any money , " he told the TED audience in Oxford .
It 's like dark matter in the universe .
There 's a lot of it , you do n't see it but it has a huge impact on the physics of the place
Professor Jonathan Zittrain
Harvard University
" But they had an amazing freedom , which was that they did n't have to make any money from it .
" The internet has no business plan - never did - no CEO , no single firm responsible for building it .
Instead it 's folks getting together to do something for fun , rather than because they were told to or because they were expecting to make money from it , " he said .
That ethos , he suggested , had led to a network architecture that was completely unique .
" As late as 1992 , IBM was known to say that you could n't build a corporate network using internet protocol . "
Internet protocol ( IP ) , the method used to send data around the internet , was first described by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn in 1974 .
Data is broken into chunks - or packets - and sent around different parts of the network , often owned by different corporations and entities .
Professor Zittrain likened it to how a drink may be passed along a row of people at a sporting event .
" Your neighbourly duty is to pass the beer along - at risk to your own trousers - to get it to its destination . "
" That 's precisely how packets move around the internet , sometimes in a many as 25 or 30 hops with the intervening entities passing the data around having no contractual or legal obligation to the original sender or to the receiver . "
The prime minister spoke at the conference on Tuesday
The route the data takes depends on the net 's addressing system , he said .
" It turns out there is no overall map of the internet .
It is as if we are all sat together in a theatre but we can only see in the fog the people around us .
" So what do we do to figure out what is around us .
We turn to the person on our right and tell them what we can see to the left and vice versa .
This method , he said , gives network operators a general sense of " what is where " .
" This is a system that relies on kindness and trust , which also makes it very delicate and vulnerable , " he said .
" In rare but striking instances , a lie told by a single entity within this honeycomb can lead to real trouble . "
Bucket brigade
One example , he said , was an incident in 2008 when Pakistan Telecom accidentally took YouTube offline .
At the time , the Pakistan government asked Pakistan 's ISPs to block the site , reportedly because of a " blasphemous " video clip .
However , a network error caused a worldwide blackout of the site .
" This one ISP in Pakistan decided to [ institute ] the block for its subscribers in a highly unusual way , " said Professor Zittrain .
" It advertised that it had suddenly awakened to find it was YouTube . "
Because of the way that the network spreads messages between neighbours , the announcement quickly reverberated around the world .
Passing a drink , firefighting , and saving the net - driven by similar motivations Within two minutes , YouTube was completely blocked .
" One of the most popular websites in the world , run by the most powerful company in the world , and there was nothing that YouTube or Google were particularly privileged to do about it , " said Professor Zittrain .
However , he said , the problem was fixed within about two hours .
This was down to a largely unknown group known as the North American Network Operators Group ( NANOG ) , he said .
NANOG is a forum for distributing technical information among computer and network engineers .
" They came together to help find a problem and fix it , " he said .
Despite being unpaid volunteers they were able to put YouTube back on line , he said .
" It 's kind of like when your house catches on fire , " he said .
" The bad news is there is no fire brigade .
The good news is that random people appear from nowhere , put out the fire and leave without expecting payment or praise . "
The same social structures - and in particular kindness and trust - are also responsible for websites such as Wikipedia , he said .
" It 's like dark matter in the universe .
There 's a lot of it , you do n't see it but it has a huge impact on the physics of the place , " he earlier told the BBC .
This year 's TED Global conference runs from 21 to 24 July .

‘ Rising level of anger ’ among minority groups towards San Jose police
Four police officers in San Jose , California , are under criminal investigation after grainy video footage shows two of then hitting and Tasing an unarmed suspect .
A two - minute clip of cellphone video obtained by the San Jose Mercury - News shows officers Tasing and hitting 20 - year - old Phuong Ho as he lay on the ground in the hallway of the apartment he shares with roommates .
ADVERTISEMENT
Although the video is not entirely clear , one of the hits appears to come after Ho was already handcuffed .
If that is the case , then the officers may have committed felony assault , a legal expert told the newspaper .
San Jose police arrested Ho on September 3 after an argument between the San Jose State math major and a roommate turned heated .
At one point , after his roommate put soap on his steak , Ho brandished a knife and reportedly told the roommate that , in his native Vietnam , “ I would kill you for this . ”
While some of the people in the room reportedly laughed at that comment , police were nonetheless called to the apartment .
Officers attempted to arrest
Ho when he tried to walk into his room as they were inspecting it .
Ho was pushed into the hallway and knocked to the ground .
That ’s when roommate Dimitri Masouris began surreptitiously filming the altercation .
Masouris is said to have sold his cellphone footage to Ho ’s lawyers .
The Mercury - News points out several “ disturbing ” elements seen in the video :
ADVERTISEMENT
— Ho remains on the ground , moaning and crying , as he is repeatedly struck .
He does not appear to offer significant resistance , suggesting the high level of force is not necessary .
—
The officer most visible in the sequence stands for much of the time in a casual posture , at one point with his legs crossed .
He seems to show no concern that the situation is potentially dangerous — raising additional questions about why force was being used .
—
The final baton strike appears to occur after the handcuffs can be heard snapping onto
Ho ’s wrists .
That particularly troubled several outside experts .
According to the NBC affiliate in the Bay Area , at least one officer involved in the incident was unable to understand Ho ’s Vietnamese accent .
An editorial in the Mercury - News says that the incident is likely to heighten tensions between minority communities and San Jose police , particularly within the Vietnamese community .
ADVERTISEMENT
The paper points to an incident earlier this year , in which a mentally ill man of Vietnamese descent , Daniel Pham , was shot by police .
Community members say the investigation into the death has been kept from the public .
That follows a 2003 incident in which a young mother , Cau Bich Tran , was shot in her home by police .
In all three cases , including the most recent , police were responding to domestic disturbance calls .
“ There is a question larger than whether what happened was legal , ” states the Mercury - News editorial .
“ It is : Was it right ?
Is this how San Jose wants its police to deal with an unarmed man ?
And could it be part of a pattern that explains the rising level of anger and distrust of the police in minority communities ? ”

PCMag will have far more to say in the coming days and weeks about the quality and performance of Microsoft 's Windows 7 OS , as well as how it stacks up against its primary competition , Apple 's .
But have you ever wondered what it would be like if you could watch executives from both companies really have at it ?
Not with snarky commercials , but with an honest discussion of the technologies that drive these operating systems ?
It wo n't happen , of course , but this is pretty close .
A couple of weeks ago , I got a surprise offer : Apple wanted to go on record and talk about why Snow Leopard is better than Windows 7 .
Apple 's Senior Director of gave me his side of the story .
Then I interviewed Microsoft's Jay Paulus , Director , , to let him make his case .
Although the interviews were conducted separately , I 've tried to blend the comments to make it something of an ex post facto debate .
It seems fair enough , as each side knew I would be talking to the other .
What I ended up with is a good - old - fashioned debate , in which I play the moderator and occasional fact - checker .
It may not settle the question of which OS is better , but goes into a lot more technical detail than the 30 - second spots that will be all over TV this holiday season .
Editor 's Note :
To reiterate , the interviews with Mr. Croll and Mr. Paulus were conducted separately at no time were all three parties speaking to each other at the same time , and while they did respond to these topics and questions , I have added some detail to my moderator sections in order to put Mr. Croll and Mr. Paulus ' responses in the proper context .
The 64 - Bit Question
Let 's start with 64 - bit .
For perhaps the first time in operating system history , average consumers are aware of the 64 - bit choice and thinking about whether or not they need or want to use it .
Mr. Croll , what does Apple bring to the table here ?
We have one version of Snow Leopard .
Contrast that to Windows , which has and adds a lot of complexity .
Their product matrix gets really complex very fast .
Then multiply by two , because you have to know if you want 32 - or 64 - bit .
In 2003 , we started adding 64 - bit technology .
Apple went from a 32 - bit to 64 - bit environment without any issues for customers .
Now we can allow 64 - bit apps to run entirely on a 64 - bit Intel processor .
The major system apps now run in 64 bits .
We architected Snow Leopard to allow the whole system to run in 64 - bit mode on a 64 - bit chip , not partial .
( Ed. Note :
But the vast majority of Macs will still run the OS kernel in 32 - bit mode . )
Application developers can package up applications to put both 32 - and 64 - bit binary in one package .
We never wanted the consumer to have to decide , and app manufacturers do not have to offer two versions .
LU : Mr. Paulus , your rebuttal ?
Jay Paulus :
We do have two versions .
When you buy media , it comes with both in the box .
We recommend people with 3GB or more of memory install the 64 - bit version .
( Ed. Note :
You cannot upgrade from a 32 - bit version of Vista to a 64 bit version of Windows 7 .
You must do a clean install . )
I think the transition to 64 - bit is hard .
It takes work to transition to 64 - bit .
Apple knows 64 - bit is hard .
They wanted to take credit for the work they did .
OS X 10 Snow Leopard does n't boot into 64 - bit by default .
And switching between 32 - bit and 64 - bit causes a big performance hit .
The only SKU that boots into 64 - bit by default is OS X server .
Tough position for them to take , as much as I like their 64 - bit logo .
We 've had 64 - bit and drivers since 2003 on Windows XP .
Pretty hard for them to claim a lead on that .
What about Microsoft 's two - version approach , as opposed to one binary ?
I think it 's representative , a pretty good way to make transition .
As the hardware and software catches up and people have more and more memory in the systems , 64 - bit makes more sense .
The fact that they can make a choice , is that a bad thing ? 
Programming for Multicore
LU : Modern computers now feature multicore CPUs .
However , consumers are n't always sure if their operating systems or apps are taking full or any advantage of all those cores .
What are you guys doing in the multicore space ?
BC : We took a step back and rethought the problem .
It 's a big deal for developers to get the most out of multicore systems .
Programmers usually have to write apps differently if there are two , four , or eight cores .
Grand Central lets the operating system figure it out .
We 'll shield the developers from having to worry about it .
It 's a big breakthrough in software .
For application developers to take advantage of it , they only need to add a couple of constructs to their code .
It 's minimally invasive to the current set of code .
The primary benefit is speed ( how fast it goes on screen ) and responsiveness , if I click on something on the screen how quickly it comes back .
JP : It 's a tough computing problem , the multicore , multithreading , programming across GPU and CPU .
These are tough problems , no doubt .
Anyone who does this wants to take credit .
I feel like Apple is playing catch - up in this realm .
We 've had threads and fiber since 2000 .
The Windows 7 kernel is the same kernel as Window Server 2008 [ R2 ] .
I would hold our granular scheduling and multicore scaling up to theirs any day of the week .
They 're providing a queuing mechanism .
People will still have to design their apps to be multithreaded .
I reject the fact that it 's going to fundamentally alter the way people are building apps to be multithreading or multicore . 
The Face of It
LU : Okay , let 's step out from under the hood and talk about what consumers see on their desktops , specifically , the UI .
Mr. Croll ?
BC : We have the Dock , Windows 7 has the taskbar .
The taskbar took its inspiration from the Dock , but there 's a big difference .
We handle applications as well as files and folders .
In the Windows taskbar , you have to pin the file inside the application .
Then you have to go in , click on the Jump List .
Not as easy or accessible .
We have Stacks that let you put a whole folder in the taskbar .
The icons are bigger on the Dock .
It scales nicely if you have a lot of items .
Expose is there to help you sift through a cluttered desktop .
We take full advantage of the entire screen .
Click and hold on dock tile , you get a full - screen preview .
With Windows 7 , you mouse over an app , you get a series of small thumbnails , you also see a full - screen visualization .
It 's confusing .
There are window panes left over that leave a lot of clutter .
We offer graphical previews of the contents of the system .
In the Finder , there 's Cover Flow , which is just like flipping through album art in iTunes .
Windows 7 does n't have anything like that .
We built previews everywhere .
Microsoft Windows is n't like that .
You have to have apps in OS to preview .
In OS X , you can preview without apps .
JP : What did Dock 's Expose take inspiration from ?
( Ed. Note :
The implication is that the dock came way after the Windows taskbar . )
I think the Windows 7 taskbar , to a Windows user , feels pretty natural , a natural evolution of the taskbar and Quick Launch .
I think of Apple 's Dock as a launcher , not a window manager .
Some of the little things do n't get much credit , like Aero Snap and Shake , which help you organize your desktop .
Our taskbar is good at managing windows .
In Windows 7 , you can hover over Windows and use all instances and overlays with actual controls .
You get high - level interaction with applications .
I think reviews have been pretty positive overall .
You know you really hit the feature on the head when people say , " Oh , I thought it always did that . "
We 've had millions of people testing Windows 7 , gotten a lot of feedback , and received lots of positive reviews .
Ultimately , UI stuff is tough .
It 's something everyone gets to have an opinion on . 
Backing Up
LU : Okay , let 's talk about backup something everybody needs , but no one really does .
Windows Backup has been around for a long time , but is n't widely used .
Apple 's Time Machine arrived with Leopard and deep integration with the hardware .
Where are we now with OS - based backup ?
BC : Time Machine versus Windows Backup :
We built it in with Time Machine .
It 's easy to use , easy to restore , easy to understand , easy to search .
There 's a huge qualitative difference between what you get on a Mac and what you get on Windows .
JP : There 's been some work done to make Windows Backup easier to use .
It does a good job of full - system backup .
If you have pictures scattered around the disk , you can send them to Library view Backup is smart about picking up files from wherever they are .
Another feature that is key is Previous Versions .
It was called Time Warp and we have had it since Server 2003 .
It manages previous versions of files and is running by default on diskit's a file system feature .
There 's no separate disk .
It does n't protect you from disk failure , but lets you go back in time to previous versions of files . 
Upgrade Paths
LU : Perhaps one of the most stressful things users face is the act of upgrading their OS .
With Windows 7 coming out , people will be making choices and possibly upgrading their OS .
Mr. Croll , what 's Apple 's perspective on what 's happening with Windows 7 ?
BC : Over 60 percent of the people are out there running Windows XP .
I will point out that Microsoft more or less left the XP users behind .
So I 'm not understanding the logic .
LU : Mr. Paulus , Brian has a point .
There were a lot of netbooks sold over the last 12 to 18 months , and the vast majority of them shipped with Windows XP .
JP : The majority of people get their new OS with a new machine , so the notion that we 're leaving behind a vast set of people , I 'm not sure I accept that .
The fact is that Windows XP shipped eight years ago and hardware and software has moved on .
We made a tough choice and I hope in the end that it 's the right choice .
It 's a bit disingenuous for Apple guys to talk about us leaving people behind .
On positive side , Windows 7 will run really well on those netbooks .
Windows users are n't left behind to the degree that people who are running those old Macs are being left behind .
If you did n't buy a Mac since the Intel transition three years ago , you are really getting left behind .
What 's Inside
LU : After years of integrating utilities and even full - blown apps from competing products in the operating system , or as part of the OS package , Microsoft made an about face this year and is letting end users decide whether or not they want to download Mail , Messenger , Movie Maker and other apps .
Why ?
JP : Pulling things out allows us to update them on a more regular basis .
There 's more customer value , the apps are more directly integrated with the cloud offerings .
I think that people will realize that that 's the way they want it : software plus service .
Those upgrades are free .
Apple can say they include it in the OS , but they also charge you for the upgrade .
LU : Mr. Croll , how do you view the debundling of applications ?
BC : We build everything in and put together a package that works beautifully out of box .
Microsoft is going in a different direction , pulling out Mail , and other apps and having people download them .
For example , we have Exchange support in Snow Leopard .
You have to buy Microsoft Office to get Exchange support in Windows 7 .
We bundle that right out of box .
JP : The premier client for Exchange is Outlook .
If you want the full - fidelity experience , you want Outlook .
For those that do n't want to buy Outlook , there 's Outlook Web Exchange .
It 's a strong , high - fidelity client . 
What 's Different
LU : In the race to build the best operating system , where do each of you think you stand ?
What sets you apart ?
Mr. Croll ?
BC : Mac OS X is much simpler than Windows .
We 're more advanced from a technological standpoint .
Windows 7 still has DLL and the Registry , still has defragmenting , still needs activation .
We do n't make users enter in activation codes .
LU : It 's a fair point , Mr. Paulus .
Microsoft has done many things to Windows 7 , but could n't change some of the fundamentals like the DLL and Registry .
JP : So what ?
Yeah , we 've got the Registry and DLL , so what ?
It 's not something we talk about .
We do a lot of work around reliability and performance .
Getting into notions of replacing Registry and DLL , it just does n't become relevant .
LU : What about Mr. Croll 's activation and technology comments ?
JP : Apple has a different model .
They charge you a lot of money for the hardware and charge you again for the OS .
We 're selling you the OS .
We use the activation to help ensure that you have genuine versions of Windows out there . 
Pricing
LU : Let 's talk about pricing .
There are free operating systems out there , like Linux , but , as we can see from market share , free does not necessarily translate into mass - market adoption .
How do the two of you see price and the OS ?
BC : With Snow Leopard , the upgrade price is $ 29 for Leopard users or $ 49 for a family pack with five licenses .
With Windows 7 Ultimate , the upgrade is $ 119 for Home Premium and $ 199 for Professional that is really expensive software .
LU : Jay , I know Microsoft has one $ 30 plan for students .
What else do you have to say about pricing ?
JP : Snow Leopard is much more akin to a service pack and Apple is charging $ 29 .
We do n't do that .
Windows 7 demonstrates a lot of customer value and priced at a pretty attractive price point .
Most users get their OS automatically when they buy a new system .
With Apple , you 're going to be paying an Apple Tax .
You 're going to have to buy their expensive hardware just to get in the game . 
Making the Choice
LU : Okay , here 's your opportunity to make your case for your OS .
Mr. Paulus , why Windows ?
JP : I would say it 's all about value , choice , compatibility , and simplicity .
Value we 've talked about that lot .
There is value in a Windows ecosystem with nearly a billion users and thousands of PCs manufactured .
Having lots of apps and systems drives a lot of end - user value .
Stack any PC up against a Mac , we 'll win pretty comfortably .
Windows 7 was designed around simplicity .
It offers innovative features that set it apart , including Jump Lists and .
A whole bunch of things that we think will make Windows 7 land as a game changer .
I think the game has changed .
LU : Mr. Croll ?
Why should people choose Snow Leopard ?
BC : Over last ten years we 've been adding a lot of features , and it all culminated with Leopard .
It 's the best - selling software product Apple has ever done .
It added things like Cover Flow and Time Machine .
For Snow Leopard the goal was to make a better Leopard .
Mac OS 10 was made up of 1,000 different projects .
For Snow leopard we refined 90 percent of them .
Mac OS 10 continues to be much simpler than Windows .
STRAUBING , Germany - A German artist is posing 1,250 garden gnomes with their arms outstretched in the stiff - armed Hitler salute in an installation that he calls a protest of lingering fascist tendencies in German society .
Artist Ottmar Hoerl posed the gnomes in the historic central marketplace of Straubing , a town in southeastern Germany , on Wednesday .
The exhibit called " dance with the devil " is to run through Oct. 19 .
Most of gnomes are black plastic , but about 20 are painted shiny gold .
Displaying Nazi symbols is illegal in Germany but a court ruled earlier this year that Hoerl 's gnomes were clearly satire and thus allowed .
Hoerl says : " the fascist idea , the striving to manipulate people or dictate to people ... is latently dangerous and remains present in our society . "
Within The Core Of Big Apple Comic Con ’09
I have been a lifelong comic book fan , so whenever a major event rolls into town I show up , all cash blazing .
And with the economic downturn , conventions now offer great bargains for comics fans seeking back issues , toys and other merchandise .
I love diving into the dollar bins to seek out classic horror and superhero comics from the Seventies , not to mention perusing the trade paperback and graphic novel collections that are 50 % off .
The deals work out better for the buyers than the sellers these days , so it ’s best to take advantage of the sales while they happen .
Held at Pier 94 on Manhattan ’s west side , this year ’s Big Apple Comic Con — the first to be run by their new owners Wizard Entertainment and in a larger venue than years past ( with an admittedly much higher entry fee ) — certainly provided plenty of purchasing pandemonium and also featured celebrity appearances , comic artist tables , panel discussions and video game stations .
I got plenty of shopping done , had my portrait sketched by famed Hulk artist Herb Trimpe and managed to chat with a few of the celebrities in attendance ( photos below ) .
While William Shatner , Kate Mulgrew and Linda Hamilton were there , I did not have any luck in spotting them .
There was an impressive mix of sci-fi , TV , adult movie and comic book celebs on hand , from both old and new BSG stars to members to multiple Star Trek generations to famous faces from movies like Star Wars , Terminator , Flash Gordon and Supergirl .
While the celebs were there selling autographed memorabilia and photo ops ( something I find awkward often times when I just want to say something fan - like ) , the ones I approached for shots in ADD were cool about chatting and being photographed .
This was my first Big Apple Comic Con , and I enjoyed the spacious yet packed event .
However , the distressing news I have learned is that next year Big Apple Comic Con is going head - to - head with New York Comic Con on the same weekend ( October 7 - 10 , 2010 ) , which to me and many others is a ridiculous idea .
Having two massive comic book conventions duke it out at the same time will not only test vendor loyalties but also make it difficult for fans to choose which to attend .
Why not separate them out ?
There is easily room for two large conventions during the year .
Let ’s not worry about that for now and take a look at my personal highlights from Big Apple Comic Con 2009 .
Why do some embrace religion and others reject it outright ?
For a long time , scientists have been trying to answer this question by probing the neural roots of religion .
Until fairly recently , many thought the answer lay in a " God - spot " — a small region of the brain that has been linked to the mystical experiences associated with faith .
Thanks in large part to the growing sophistication of brain - scanning techniques , which let neuroscientists peer into the brain ’s inner workings , that concept has largely been rendered moot ; there is now widespread agreement that religious behaviors are modulated by well - defined neural pathways .
Indeed , several studies have indicated that the feelings of joy , doubt , and self - reflection that are evoked by intense religious experiences can be correlated with specific patterns of brain activation .
Earlier this year , a group of researchers led by the National Institute on Aging ’s Dimitrios Kapogiannis identified several of the cognitive mechanisms and brain circuits that seem to be engaged during the processing of religious belief .
Their findings showed that , far from being an inscrutable phenomenon , religion could in fact be experimentally addressed and that its emergence may have been driven by changes in the neural capacity for language , logical reasoning , and other evolutionarily significant processes .
In a follow - up study , the same group investigated whether the expression of religious beliefs could be tied to variability in the brain 's architecture .
Their results , which reveal that differences in regional cortical volumes correlate with key aspects of religiosity , were reported in PLoS ONE .
In their first study , Kapogiannis and his colleagues developed a three - dimensional psychological framework that incorporated their subjects ' differing perceptions of God in order to explore the neuroanatomical underpinnings of religion .
Using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , they were able to associate these religious beliefs with activity in areas of the brain associated with memory retrieval , imagery , emotion , and abstract semantics .
For instance , a subject who claimed to feel God ’s love experienced higher levels of activity within the right middle frontal gyrus , a region associated with positive emotions .
For their new study , the authors had the same group of subjects complete a survey about their religious behaviors , their upbringing , and about particular aspects of their worldview .
Whereas the intent of their first study was to illuminate the neural and cognitive activity associated with religious experiences , their objective here was to determine whether slight variations in gray matter volume correlated with different facets of their religiosity .
From the survey results they collected , they identified four components of religiosity : experiencing an intimate relationship with God and engagement in religious behavior ; having a religious upbringing ; doubting God ’s existence ; and experiencing fear of God ’s anger .
They then paired these findings with the results of structural MRI tests to see what relationships existed between brain volume and these components .
Confirming some of their earlier conclusions , the authors found that both religious belief and religious practice seem to be associated with networks in the brain involved with social cognitive processing .
The robustness of the networks varied on an individual basis , reflecting each subject ’s distinct religiosity , and seemed to fluctuate over time in response to changing stimuli .
None of the networks they identified were found to be unique to religion .
The MRI results revealed that a stronger sense of intimacy with God correlated with an increase in the cortical volume of the right middle temporal gyrus ( MTG ) .
The MTG plays a key role in establishing and maintaining intimate relationships , such as the one between a mother and her child , so the authors reason that its evolution gave rise to the sense of intimacy with God that some devout individuals share .
At the other end , subjects with low MTG volumes displayed little interest in God or religion .
( Schizophrenic patients , who often struggle to differentiate self from God and display aberrant religious behaviors , had the lowest volumes . )
They also found a pronounced negative correlation between the cortical volume of the left precuneus , an area involved in empathy and emotional response , and fear of God 's anger .
Those who felt a stronger connection with God , and thus were better able to relate God to their selves , had larger precuneus volumes and tended to be the most devout practitioners .
Individuals with smaller volumes who did not form strong emotional bonds with God typically prayed out of a sense of fear , rather than out of a sense conviction or love .
Because the study only considered adults , the obvious next step would be to analyze younger age groups .
Being correlational rather than causal , these findings do n't really address the question of whether certain individuals were more predisposed to particular patterns of religiosity because of their brain development .
The fact that no region of the brain corresponded with religiosity of upbringing rules out the contention that religious nurture alone contributes to neuroanatomical variability .
The sum total of their results suggests that religious belief may have arisen as a natural extension of evolutionary advances in social cognition and behavior .
Over time , the changes in brain volume that enabled humans to show empathy towards others may have also made it possible for some to develop intimate personal relationships with a supernatural entity , thus laying the foundation for the emergence of religion .

Senate Democrats are expected to delay a vote to increase the debt limit to $ 13 trillion , a move designed to avoid having the debate during the healthcare reform battle .
ADVERTISEMENT
Senate Republicans said the delay will allow Democrats to avoid voting for an increase in the debt cap at the same time they ’re pushing a healthcare overhaul , which is expected to cost approximately $ 900 billion over the next decade .
Though Democrats have said that their healthcare proposals wo n’t add to the debt , Republicans have argued that the increase in government spending will lead to more red ink .
Senate Republicans plan to press the issue by offering a series of amendments .
Sen. Judd Gregg ( R - N.H. ) , the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee , said that he has been asked by Senate GOP leaders to propose amendments to the debt - limit increase that would curtail both discretionary and entitlement spending .
GOP senators believe that the healthcare push and the debt limit vote serve as the perfect occasion to highlight Democratic budgets , which project deficits above $ 700 billion for the next decade .
“ I have voted for every debt - limit increase because that ’s what you have to do , ” Gregg said .
“ But this limit increase comes in an entirely different context .
There ’s no tomorrow . ”
The Obama administration had asked the Senate to extend the debt limit by mid-October to ensure it does not rise above its limit .
But now it appears likely that the debt will not reach the existing limit until November .
“ We have time , ” Sen. Kent Conrad ( D - N.D. ) , a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee , told The Hill .
The U.S. debt subject to the limit stood at $ 11.77 trillion last Thursday .
Congress raised the debt limit from $ 11.3 trillion to $ 12.1 trillion in February , attaching the increase to the $ 787 billion stimulus bill .
Foreseeing the need for another increase due to the expected record $ 1.6 trillion deficit in 2009 , the House voted again to increase the limit to $ 13 trillion in the budget resolution that passed in April .
The Senate would likely adopt the same number .
The Senate could ease passage of the debt - limit increase by attaching it to one of the remaining appropriations bills , which often receive bipartisan support , said Stan Collender , a former Democratic congressional budget aide .
But Gregg said that Republicans would n’t allow it to pass unnoticed .
“ You ca n’t pass this through the middle of the night , ” Gregg said .
“ I believe it ’s time for people to step up and debate this issue [ of rising debt ] .
This is the perfect vehicle [ to ] do it on . ”
The Senate Finance Committee , which has jurisdiction over the debt - limit cap , is expected to be tied up with the healthcare debate for weeks .
The panel this week is continuing its markup of the healthcare bill proposed by its chairman , Sen. Max Baucus Max Sieben BaucusBottom line Bottom line The Hill 's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - George Floyd 's death sparks protests , National Guard activation MORE ( D - Mont . ) .
A Baucus aide said earlier this month that the chairman understands that the debt limit increase is serious and that it “ must be addressed thoroughly and in a nonpartisan manner . ”
One reason the Senate wo n’t have to deal with the limit until November is that the Treasury Department has slowed its borrowing .
The department said that it would reduce its Supplementary Financing Account to $ 15 billion “ to preserve flexibility ” in managing the country ’s debt .
There ’s little question that lawmakers will raise the limit in the end .
If the debt exceeds the cap , the country would default .
Business groups that have been wary of more government spending and larger deficits , including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and National Association of Manufacturers , have called on Congress to lift the limit soon .
But the debt limit has turned into a perennial political football in recent years .
In 2006 , Democrats , including President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaIt 's now up to health systems to solve our food problems Testing the Electoral College process against judicial overreach Obama steps into The Shade Room to urge ' roommates ' to vote , says White House ' working to keep people from voting ' MORE when he was in the Senate , opposed a debt - limit increase requested by President George W. Bush .
They used the occasion to highlight increased spending during a Republican presidency .
“ Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren , ” Obama said at the time .
“ America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership . ”

On Wednesday 28 October , around 50 armed police and border police cordoned off a road in the Palestinian neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah in East Jerusalem and , as ordered by the Jerusalem Municipality , demolished a tent , where the Gawi family has been living since they were forcibly evicted from their home on 2 August 2009 .
The destruction occurred despite the presence of a delegation of members of the European Parliament led by the Vice President Luisa Morgantini .
At 10.15 am , the Israeli forces surrounded the tent where a member of the Gawi family was preparing breakfast holding her two year old daughter .
Supported by only a few people who were present in the area at this time , she tried to gather at least some of the family ’s belongings and verbally protested the violent destruction of their only shelter as the police tore the tent down and confiscated everything that was left .
A few mattresses and bedding were thrown in a pile on the pavement , while the tent and other belongings were loaded on a truck .
Within minutes , after the police left , the family with the help from the neighbours erected another tent , providing at least minimum shelter for them .
By the time the Israeli forces completed the demolishion , a group of about 80 activists , journalists and palestinians arrived , along with a group of UN workers and members of the European Parliament , to express solidarity witht the evicted family .
The Israeli police returned and issued a warning over the loudspeaker that anyone who does n’t leave the area within five minutes will be arrested .
They then ripped down the newly erected marquee , loaded it on a truck and left the area .
At the end the members of the Gawi family thanked friends and supporters for their solidarity and called on all human beings to stand with them in their resistance .
The Gawi family , together with the Hannoun family , who are also living on the street nearby after they were evicted from their home , have vowed to continue their struggle to regain their houses from the Israeli settlers and intend to erect another tent whilst they continue to sleep opposite their home and in full sight of the illegal settlers who often abuse and harass them .
Background
The Gawi and Hannoun families , consisting of 53 members including 20 children , have been left homeless after they were forcibly evicted from their houses on 2 August 2009 .
The Israeli forces surrounded the homes of the two families at 5.30 am and , breaking in through the windows , forcefully dragged all residents into the street .
The police also demolished the neighbourhood ’s protest tent , set up by Um Kamel , following the forced eviction of her family in November 2008 .
At present , all three houses are occupied by settlers and the whole area is patrolled by armed private settler security 24 hours a day .
Both Hannoun and Gawi families , who have been left without suitable alternative accommodation since August , continue to protest against the unlawful eviction from the sidewalk across the street from their homes , facing regular attacks from the settlers and harassment from the police .
The Karm Al - Ja’ouni neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah is home to 28 Palestinian families , all refugees from 1948 , who received their houses from the UNRWA and Jordanian government in 1956 .
All face losing their homes in the manner of the Hannoun , Gawi and al - Kurd families .
The aim of the settlers is to turn the whole area into a new Jewish settlement and to create a Jewish continuum that will effectively cut off the Old City form the northern Palestinian neighborhoods .
Implanting new Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem and the West Bank is illegal under many international laws , including Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention .
The plight of the Gawi , al - Kurd and the Hannoun families are just a small part of Israel ’s ongoing campaign of ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people from East Jerusalem .

The political scientist John Mueller , the Woody Hayes Chair of National Security Studies at the Ohio State University , has written " Atomic Obsession : Nuclear Alarmism from Hiroshima to Al - Qaeda , " and his thesis is that the world 's magical thinking and alarmism about nuclear energy and nuclear weapons has significantly distorted policy making and threatens to leave the United States more vulnerable to more pressing threats .
Mueller 's opinions are not shared by most of his colleagues , but they are taken seriously -- he 's not a provocateur .
I asked Mueller this morning to put the news about Iran in the context of his theories .
How much of a threat is Iran 's proliferation ?
How much of a threat is the West 's obsession with Iran 's proliferation ?
" No one has been killed by nuclear weapons in recent memory and lots of people have been killed by our obsession with proliferation , especially in Iraq , " he says .
Ok .
Lets assume that Iran gets the bomb .
What happens ?
A bunch of other countries will run around in hysterics for a while , but in the end , probably nothing .
What China has done with the bomb has been nothing .
It 's just been a huge waste of money .
Basically , if Iran gets the bomb , they may find that it 's completely useless , except to stoke their egos for a while .
You concede that nuclear weapons are extremely destructive , but you say that our obsession with them has led to a fear that is way out of proportion to the actual threat .
One thing you write in your book is that the notion that the U.S. and the Soviet Union ever possessed enough nuclear weapons to destroy the world several times over is just false .
It 's false .
It would take ... something like 90,000 huge thermonuclear bombs , and we do n't have near that many .
That does n't mean that nuclear weapons can't kill large numbers of people .
But if the weapon that North Korea has were dropped in Central Park , it would n't bring down any buildings .
If it were placed in Times Square , it would be pretty bad , but there is a lot of exaggeration about the difference [ between that bomb and a large conventional explosive ] .
Look , the bomb is a horrible thing .
I do n't want to sound like I 'm trivializing the bomb .
But it makes sense to at least abandon some of our conceptions that are [ just as ] dangerous .
You want to focus proliferation activities more on terrorists and technology and less on nation - states ?
Sort of .
In the case of terrorism , I 'm not too alarmed about it .
Some things make sense , like securing fissile materials .
But I do have a problem with carrying out policies that could kill tens of thousands of people .
Graham Allison , the Obama administration official and former Harvard prof , has estimated that there 's a 50 % chance that a nuclear weapon will explode in a major city over the next ten years .
I take it you disagree with his prediction .
Well , he also said that in 2005 .
He 's a smart guy , and he 's been thinking about this for a while .
My disagreement is that he massively undersestimates the difficulty of a terrorist getting a bomb .
There are n't loose nukes out there , even though he 's been talking about it for years .
There are n't fissile materials .
What tends to happen on analyses like this , including his , is that it looks at the individual steps to build a bomb and concludes that , it would be difficult but not impossible fo each step .
But overcoming [ all ] twenty difficult if not impossible [ steps ] to build a bomb -- there is a vanishingly small likelihood of success .
There 's been a considerable exaggeratoin by him and others that Al Qaeda is even interested in obtaining the bomb .
Back to the current situation .
Is n't the non-proliferation regime you criticize preventing Israel from bombing Iran -- and therefore preventing the escalation of the scenario ?
Well , it 's quite possible than Iran will never try to get a bomb .
But if they are bombed by Israel , it will increase the likelihood of them getting the bomb .
It will escalate .
I think a nuclear Iran could be well contained and deterred .

When this decade began , the Paste website was barely a year old , and the magazine was still a twinkle in its daddies ’ eyes .
So looking back over the first 10 years of the 2000s feels like looking back over our own history .
There has n’t been a new album Paste has covered that was n’t eligible for our “ Best of the Decade ” consideration .
We had dozens of critics vote for the best new albums , movies , TV shows games and books , and then we argued some more until we ’d focused our spotlight onto the very best pop culture created during the aughts — whether it was wildly popular or is still waiting to be discovered by the masses .
We ’ll be bringing you each of the resulting lists , plus the best comedians , best documentaries , best movie soundtracks , best album covers and more throughout the month of November .
More than trying to create a canon for the ’00s ( that ’d be so last millennium ) , we ’re just hoping you use these lists to reflect on some of the artists who shaped your decade and discover others that will change how you look at the next .
What a great time to be a fan of thoughtful , engaging and original entertainment .
And what a great time to be covering it all .
Even though its slender white neck figures into Vespertine ’s cover artwork , forget about the swan - dress sideshow for just one moment .
Forget the collective shriek of a thousand red-carpet fashion know - it - alls .
Despite her reputation for flamboyance and silliness , the Icelandic empress achieved a shocking level of intimacy and tenderness with this folktronica gem .
When I see the swan , my eye drifts past its beak to those pillowy white feathers , recalling the plushness and warmth of a down comforter .
Feathers so white they evoke the purity of freshly fallen snow blanketing the ground outside while you sip a coffee by the fire , both hands curled around the mug ’s warm ceramic finish .
The beats and Matmos audio samples scattered across Vespertine are precisely executed ; their subtle pop and crackle drawing you into an impossibly delicate , refreshingly sparse interior world : plucked harp strings , sparkling celeste , boy choirs , music boxes .
The notes on this record might as well resemble the billions of tiny molecules expelled in a single contented sigh .

As the baffling boyband / poptart craze was finally fading into oblivion , this vile , filth - ridden , substance - addled masterpiece of a rock record was projectile - vomited onto the U.K. charts by brilliant but reckless London band The Libertines .
Following in the footsteps of their classic - punk heroes ( The Clash ’s Mick Jones produced the record ) , the Libertines preferred their sound raw and their subject matter depraved .
Sadly prophetic , the band ’s name was derived from the Marquis de Sade ’s Lusts of the Libertines .
But before Pete Doherty ’s infamous binges derailed what might ’ve been one of the greatest bands of the modern era , he and co-frontman / songwriting partner Carl Barat ( along with drummer Gary Powell and bassist John Hassall ) cut this simultaneously apathetic and adrenaline - jacked speedball of a classic .

In 2004 , 69 - year - old Loretta Lynn released her thirty - seventh solo studio album .
It could have been a sad affair , the desperate yawp of a legendary Nashville madam teetering into an aged cliché of herself , but with the help of rock ‘ n ’ roll upstart Jack White , Lynn made the greatest record of her career .
Like a bunch of rowdy grandkids , White and a crew of friends ( most of whom would converge a year later as The Raconteurs ) lent a sly , gritty feel to Lynn ’s 13 mostly - autobiographical tracks —
Van Lear Rose was her 70th release overall , but it was only the second time she ’d written or co-written all of her songs .
Her seasoned , tremulous voice paired perfectly with White ’s electric guitar warble , pulling off mournful country crooners and all - out rock numbers with equal grit and spunk .
She has n’t released anything since , but it almost does n’t matter .

A modern - day Parklife and a punky companion piece to The Streets ’ indie-rap landmark Original Pirate Material , Arctic Monkeys ’ incendiary debut painted a dirt - streaked portrait of fin- de - siecle British youth culture : bleary nights out , romantic fumblings , chavs in tracksuits , run-ins with the cops .
The band combined a precocious sense of melody with the kind of frenetic energy possessed only by the young and bored , parlaying their gifts into a thrashy Brit - rock classic .

We hear a lot about break - up records , but The Frames ’ Glen Hansard and newcomer Markéta Irglová gave us the loveliest falling - in - love record of the decade , as the Once co-stars fell slowly for one another , both on - screen and off .
Hansard ’s voice is as vulnerable as an open wound , and Irglová ’s is the salve that makes everything OK .

In one of modern music ’s more lamentable historical twists , In Rainbows ’ legacy will likely be its ground - breaking online marketing strategy and not its glorious music .
Remember double - clicking that little zip file you “ bought ” for $ 0.04 and downloaded to your computer desktop ?
Remember how inspiring it was to hear a band with nothing left to prove make music this ambitious :
Phil Selway ’s tasty , constantly morphing polyrhythmic percussion assault on “ 15 Step ” ; the only bass line to ever put a lump in your throat , courtesy of “ All I Need , ” with Thom Yorke ’s sleepy melody adding the pitch - perfect counterpoint ; “ Videotape , ” with its steady march of chiming , heartbreaking piano chords .
The next time you go see Radiohead in concert , you ’re going to walk your sorry ass to the merch booth and buy an absurdly overpriced American Apparel - brand concert T - shirt that probably cost half - nothing to manufacture .
Then you ’re going to buy another one to give to your next - door neighbor .
You owe Radiohead at least as much for giving the world this gorgeous , underappreciated masterpiece for the price of an unbuttered scone .

On their first Lost Highway release , The Jayhawks combine a classic - rock sound with a low - key Americana energy to make one of the decade ’s coziest records .
The ‘ Hawks do the Byrds proud with moody opener “ Stumbling Through The Dark , ” sugar - sweet love song “ All The Right Reasons , ” jingly - jangly “ Angelyne ” and harmony - happy “ Tailspin . ”
Do n’t just save them for a rainy day — these are songs for the ages .

That string - soaked introduction .
That syrupy baritone .
A sense of drama and a sense of humor .
“ I will never kiss anyone / who does n’t burn me like the sun . ”
From the elaborate construction of Night Falls Over Kortedala ’s opener , “ And I Remember Every Kiss , ” it ’s clear that Jens Lekman favors a little pomp and circumstance .
But it suits the talented Swede .
Lekman ’s always been an excellent songwriter , combining the wit and charming carelessness of Jonathan Richman with the alternately lovelorn / loveable aesthetic of Morrissey and Magnetic Fields , and Kortedala finds the bard ’s talent at its most fully - realized pinnacle to date , all samples , horns , beats and just a touch of kitschy grandeur .

New York ’s greatest living rapper became self - aggrandizing to the point of self - parody over the course of the decade , but this time he actually delivered — so much so that he named two subsequent albums Blueprint , trying to stoke his own fire , and both records flamed out .
The original Blueprint was the classic , a knockout punch by a heavyweight champion .
“ Young Vito , voice of the young people , ” Jay called himself , ( and also “ the compadre / the Sinatra of my day , ” and also , most audaciously , “ Jay - Hova ” ) .
It ’s a testament to his ferocious skills and towering persona that the comparisons do n’t seem like hyperbole .

In just less than an hour , over the course of nine songs , many of which are in the five - to - eight minute range , James Murphy crams in what feels like a hundred musical reference points .
That might as well be Brian Eno singing on “ Get Innocuous ! ” ; “ All My Friends ” could be a New Order cover .
Those nasal vocals on “ North American Scum ” cheekily referenced his tendency to cheekily reference music - geek ephemera .
Murphy is a self - aware chef ; he knows his melting pot contains all the finest ingredients from music history , and he ’s happy to sprinkle fly disco beats on top of them .
Somebody get this guy a television show .

After establishing themselves with an EP and LP on Touch & Go , Return to Cookie Mountain marked the band ’s introduction to the Universal Music Group family via Interscope .
TVOTR seamlessly executed the major - label transition that has proven difficult for lesser bands , despite an unmastered , alternately - ordered , half - baked Cookie leaking to the Internet months in advance of its proper release .
The result is a gorgeously dark album featuring the trippy and beautiful “ I Was a Lover . ”
Elsewhere , David Bowie sings backing ( !!! ) vocals on “ Province , ” “ Wolf Like Me ” is positively monstrous and , well , the whole damn thing feels like some kind of titanic , geographic monstrosity .
Cookie Mountain , indeed .

After releasing the most breathtaking debut of the decade , music fans everywhere wondered how Arcade Fire would follow up the most joyful album about death .
The answer turned out to be a reverent , often melancholy album about life .
The sound is even more expansive and ambitious with church organs giving heft to “ Intervention , ” mandolin energizing “ Keep the Car Running ” and every instrument under the sun transforming older song “ No Cars Go ” into a stadium anthem .
If Funeral was lightening in a bottle , Arcade Fire has since made catching it seem easy .
Josh Jackson
This is probably the only entry on the list you ’ve never heard of .
Jesse Smith is an old fashioned axe - slinger of the power - pop variety , who channels Nick Lowe , Elvis Costello and early Beatles .
His debut album flew under the radar of many while still earning him love from Paste , MOJO , Pitchfork and NPR .
Luckily for all of us , his hook factory has yet to cease production ; Gentleman Jesse ’s sophomore album is likely to arrive sometime in the first half of 2010 .
Look forward to getting its songs unrelentingly stuck in your head .

It ’s rare that a debut album rolls around as lovely and original as Iron & Wine ’s The Creek That Drank The Cradle , but for his sophomore effort , Sam Beam managed to improve upon the basement - tapes sound of his new Americana without sacrificing its intimacy .
He enlisted producer Brian Deck ( Modest Mouse ) to give musical depth to match the songs ’ haunting lyrics .

Seattle indie rock is well played , and his voice is perfectly restrained , but his most unique gift lies in storytelling — vivid images and a thoughtful perspective create a deep , dark feeling of sadness .
In - depth descriptions of extramarital affairs appear throughout Control , a characteristically bold move for the former Christian singer / songwriter .
The music is heavier , too — this time around , electric guitars dare to match the lyrical intensity .

If you were to crown a 2000s band King of the Indies in terms of sheer rise to hipster notoriety , you ’d be hard pressed to pick a group not called Animal Collective .
Depending on who you ask , these dudes created somewhere between one and five classic records during the decade , flying a freak flag for electronic , noise , rock and folk , sometimes all at once .
Animal Collective ’s members have unleashed solo recordings both transcendent and head - scratching , and the band has toured the world , uniting indie snobs , jam - band fanatics and soccer dads .
It ’s hard to say where this band will go in the next decade , but there are two absolute truths : a ) Merriweather Post Pavilion is the band ’s breakout record and b ) “ My Girls ” is so the jam .

This old - timey country album and most unlikely hit may have signaled the last gasp of alternative country .
On the bright side , it suggested that those alt - country values ( rough - hewn vocals , acoustic instrumentation , a palpable connection to American roots music ) had busted out of the sub - genre ghetto and crossed over into the mainstream .
After all , the album did win the Grammy for Album of the Year .
Some of our favorite female vocalists — one - named artists like Emmylou and Gillian — got much - deserved exposure thanks to this collection , which scored a freewheeling Coen Bros movie and did nothing but good for all concerned .

Hating on Coldplay has become the favored sport of music geeks .
New York Times critic Jon Pareles once said the band ’s lyrics can make him wish he “ did n’t understand English . ”
But before Chris Martin tried to be Bono , he and his cohorts made a great record , full of enormous , anthemic hooks that do n’t come around too often .
There ’s a reason “ Clocks ” became one of the most over - exposed songs of the decade ( even our local TV news used it ) : Melodies this catchy are hard to write .

Combining the hookiness of their breakthrough hit “ She Do n’t Use Jelly ” and the experimental bent of Zaireeka with the lyrical breakthroughs and studio advancements of 1999 masterpiece The Soft Bulletin , Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots proved The Flaming Lips ’ late - career renaissance was no fluke .
This epic , moving — yet undeniably fun — concept album launched the Oklahoma City band back into the spotlight , where it continued to revel in beauty and weirdness in front of the masses , with confetti canons , furry costumes , fake blood and crowd - traversing plastic bubble in tow .
Yoshimi and the seemingly never - ending tour that followed became a boundary - crossing cultural phenomenon , to the point where the record ’s most popular track — the spacey , mortality - wrestling ballad “ Do You Realize ? ? ” actually became Oklahoma ’s official state song .
Steve LaBate
Indie rock ’s biggest stars have n’t stopped making good records , but Transatlanticism was certainly their best .
From the crashing first strains of “ New Year ” the band took all the usual rock elements and melded them into something more grandiose and heart - breaking than they had before .
Six years later , every last track holds up .

Beautifully packaged as a hardcover book , the Irish singer / songwriter ’s debut took us all by surprise .
It was so beautiful and so grand , and we ’d never even heard of this guy before .
Rice struck a perfect emotional balance — dramatic but not tortured , romantic but not sentimental .
And Lisa Hannigan ’s angelic voice made every song better , especially the gorgeously melancholy “ The Blower ’s Daughter . ” Kate Kiefer
In early 2008 , when I interviewed Bon Iver ’s Justin Vernon for a 4 To Watch profile in this magazine , he was snowed in at his girlfriend ’s parents ’ house in Ottawa , Canada .
The circumstances seemed both fitting and ironic — a year and a half before , his heart a bit worse for wear , he ’d decamped to the woods of northern Wisconsin and , quite accidentally , recorded one of the great bedroom masterworks of our time .
When For Emma , Forever Ago was released to the world , it sparked a low flush that spun into a full fever , our defenses slowly broken down by the deep , desperate sounds of this man singing only to himself , so true and so sad , his falsetto aching and his guitar - strings worn ragged .
“ I want to be making records like this until I ’m dead , ” Vernon told me then .
Here ’s hoping .

A wistful letter to girlfriends past , his aging father and perhaps even that long - gone Roman candle of a former Replacements bandmate , Bob Stinson , this warm , well - worn , acoustic - anchored “ folk ” - rock record chugs along as Westerberg ruminates on middle age , endearingly toggling between heartbreaking sincerity and wise - assed self deprecation .

On DBT ’s 2001 breakthrough double album Southern Rock Opera , the band traded its alt - country “ Redneck Underground ” approach for a Skynyrd - meets - Crazy - Horse vibe .
And on the more concise follow - up , Decoration Day , the Truckers distilled their new sound from 80 to 100 proof .
Start to finish , every cut on this gritty , unapologetic , punk - tinged roots - rock record is a classic , as master storytellers Patterson Hood and Mike Cooley unravel one tragic , chilling small - town Southern yarn after another .
With tunes like “ Sink Hole ” ( based on Ray McKinnon ’s Oscar - winning short film , The Accountant ) , the unflinchingly honest rocker “ Marry Me , ” “ My Sweet Annette ” ( with its jilted title character ) , the and heart - crushing divorce ballad “ Sounds Better in the Song , ” the caliber of songwriting went through the roof like a shotgun blast .
And that ’s without even mentioning the debut of the Truckers ’ secret weapon during this period — then - 24 - year - old singer / guitarist Jason Isbell , whose blistering leads and slide work gave the band a shot in the arm , as did the epic pair of tracks he contributed to the record : father - to - son ballad “ Outfit ” and the title song , with its bloody Hatfields and McCoys - style family feud .
The Truckers have never been more themselves than they were on Decoration Day , and they ’ve never been better .

In the liner notes accompanying Over the Rhine ’s gloriously self - indulgent double - disc , Ohio , co-founder Linford Detweiler , writes , “ We grew up in small coal mining towns in the Ohio Valley , listening to music that could have only been unearthed in America : Southern Gospel , Country Western and Rock ’n ’ Roll .
This music fertilized the soil of our early lives .
We sit down at the upright piano these days with dirt under our fingernails . ”
And I suppose that ’s what I love about this album .
The songs feel gritty and real , unpolished and perfect .
Just like people .
All the artifice ( both musical and emotional ) has been carefully dismantled , traditional instruments — upright piano , pedal steel , acoustic guitars — have been dusted off , arrangements have been simplified , windows into souls have been propped open a bit wider .
In stark contrast , Karin Bergquist ’s voice has never felt as undressed and painfully honest as it does in these songs , as if she ’s opened her gut and tugged the melodies out like a breach baby .
This process is partly masochistic , partly exhibitionist , entirely self - consuming : but such is true art .
Ohio , is more than simply a dense , rich , vulnerable collection of songs ; it ’s a dirt road companion on that difficult journey inward , upward .
Homeward .
Jason Killingsworth
With a sprawling Icelandic title you ’d swear meant “ Drivers use caution : nude jogger crossing , ” Sigur Rós ’ fifth full - length balances majestic ethereality and primal , drum - pounding terrestrial fervor .
On earlier records , Jónsi Birgisson ’s crystalline
falsetto arrived like wind sifting through branches , brushing gently past and raising gooseflesh .
That singular voice has matured into a confident and unmistakably human instrument , to say nothing of the evocative sonic bedrock from which it flutters ever upward .
Jason Killingsworth
It was n’t that long ago , really , when the notion of this band changing your life was less the stuff of cringe - inducing Zach Braff screenplays and more plain truth .
Today the idea seems just as unlikely as meeting your soulmate in a psychiatrist ’s waiting room , but by some odd musical alchemy , all of Chutes Too Narrow ’s unassuming parts — those tweaky guitars , bedroom symphonics and James Mercer ’s wobbly self - harmonizing — gelled into the kind of album that demands to be proliferated by forcing headphones upon friends ( and , yes , quirky potential lovers ) .

Between the simple romance of “ Damn , Sam ( I Love A Woman That Rains ) , ” the drunken despair of “ Come Pick Me Up , ” the carefree energy of “ To Be Young ( Is To Be Sad , Is To Be High ) ” and the nostalgic beauty of Emmylou Harris duet “ Oh My Sweet Carolina , ” Ryan Adams ’ first solo record teeters satisfyingly between alt - country and plain - old country , rolling out one gem of a song after another .
“ I love that you can hear the South in Ryan in that record , very clearly , ” says David Rawlings , who lent his guitar playing and vocal harmonies to the album .
“ In a way , I feel like Heartbreaker captures a time and a place more than any record he ’s made . ”
When Rawlings got the record in the mail , he was surprised to see his name on the first track , “ Argument with David Rawlings Concerning Morrissey , ” a random bit of spontaneous studio banter .
“ We were arguing about which record ‘ Hairdresser On Fire ’ was on , ” Rawlings recalls .
“ But the song was on both records — it ’s on Viva Hate and Bona Drag — so there was no actual winner to the bet .
Though I ’m happy to go double or nothing with Ryan about some other Morrissey song at some point in the future . ”

Paste Hall of Fame :
This beloved chamber - rock ensemble ’s major - label debut topped our year - end list back in 2006 .
Here ’s what we said about it at the time :
Forget sexy .
Although people with an affinity for homesick soldiers , star - crossed lovers and cleaver - wielding gangsters will find plenty to swoon over , The Decemberists are bringing epic back — and in a big way .
A classic Japanese folk tale is retold in the three - part title track , anchoring a bevy of gorgeous tunes , from the 12 - minute prog - folk romp of “ The Island ” to the post - apocalyptic singalong of “ Sons and Daughters . ”
Past releases have proven these fabulous fabulists some of the most innovative , intelligent fledglings in the indie world .
But with The Crane Wife , The Decemberists really take flight .

On first listen , The National ’s 2007 breakout album Boxer sounds pleasant , evocatively understated and dense with atmosphere .
It rewards your attention .
So you play it again , from the beginning .
After several listens , you ’ve moved beyond basic plot awareness — broken , insecure men and women trying to shake off the malaise of grown - up responsibility , wondering how so many cherished friendships escaped like water from a fist .
Now you can finally appreciate the astonishing instrumental nuance and finely chiseled artistic care invested in this timeless record .
Jason Killingsworth
For a man so used to wearing musical masks , Beck laid himself bare on Sea Change .
It ’s the most aching , honest album he ever made , a musical breakup memoir on par with Blood on the Tracks or Shoot Out the Lights .
To say his heart was on his sleeve does n’t capture the emotional nakedness ; his heart was speared on a record spindle , and he let us all listen as it revolved on the turntable , the stylus reading every single crack .

“ It sounds like such a wank thing to say , but I need to get some headaches goin ’ to write about , ” beehived diva Amy Winehouse said in the raucous months following the release of Back To Black — an album that , sure enough , sounded like 50 pounds of headaches shoved into a 10 - pound sack .
Winehouse had fallen head - over - stilettos for a runabout ne ’er - do - well named Blake Fielder - Civil — marrying him and tattooing his name over her left breast — and their tempestuous relationship evidently brought the pain she required : “ Rehab , ” “ You Know I ’m No Good , ” the album ’s title track and , most poignantly , “ Love Is a Losing Game ” tapped a bottomless well of soulful sadness , funneling the hurt through a hugely influential amalgam of soul , hip - hop , jazz and R&B .
While subsequent starlets Adele and Duffy emerged in her wake , Winehouse lived through a supernova ’s ascent to megafame and an equally precipitous descent into personal hell .
Co-produced by Mark Ronson , backed by Sharon Jones ’ Dap - Kings and fueled by the demons and tragedies of divas past ( think Billie Holiday , Bessie Smith , Martha Reeves ) , Winehouse rode the zeitgeist hard and was put away wet , concluding what is likely to be her finest musical hour .
“ Every bad situation is a blues song waiting to happen , ” Winehouse once insouciantly explained .
Lady did , indeed , sing the blues .

Every so often , an album rewrites the musical rulebook , and this one effectively murdered gangsta rap .
It also redefined what a rapper could look and sound like , expanding the role an MC could play in popular culture .
With his precocious debut , the collar - popping , Jesus - walking , beat - making provocateur became a kind of hip - hop prophet , venting about his interior life in a way that spoke for millions .
Witty , angry and eminently quotable , Dropout kickstarted a four - album streak that made
West the most important pop solo artist since Prince .

Paste Hall of Fame : Wainwright ’s baroque third album topped our year - end list back in 2003 .
Here ’s what we said about it at the time :
While so many of his peers seem content writing music with narrative arcs bearing all the emotional complexity of an episode of Saved By The Bell , Wainwright offers not a sitcom , but a sort of pop musical based on the sordid drama of his own existence .
Building on the painstaking songcraft of his 2001 release , Poses , the arrangements on Want One prove delightfully over - the - top , brimming with soaring operatic peaks and emotional valleys shadowed in almost certain death .
Jason Killingsworth
After showing promise on her sparse mid-’90s debut , Living with Ghosts , and then delving into more rocking territory with Flaming Red and the unreleased Silver Bell , singer / songwriter Patty Griffin pared back , recording most of 1000 Kisses live in the studio and delivering what remains the album of her career .
Her voice flat out slays , its beauty and power on display whether she ’s performing her own compositions or interpreting others ’ .
And the songs display a mastery that places her alongside Dylan , Cohen , et al .
Griffin mines the mundane and finds the rich meaning in its details .
On “ Making Pies , ” when she sings , “ Did I show you this picture of my nephew / Taken at his big birthday surprise ? ” — she transforms clunky conversation into poetry .
Tim Regan - Porter
It ’s 2001 .
Hybrid Theory , Linkin Park ’s shouty , self - pitying debut , is the best - selling album in America .
This same year , five young men cast turn - of the - century rock into stark relief with a half - hour - long album of 11 swaggering , scruffy pop songs — a fictional greatest - hits collection that seemed to capture everything great about underground 1970s rock .
Is This
It might not have toppled the nü-metal Goliaths in terms of sales , but it saved rock ’n ’ roll from the bloat that seemed inescapable in the Fred Durst era .
Assertive but not boorish , charming but not sleazy , ironic but not empty , The Strokes ’ debut was as cool and arrogant as it had the right to be — as it suddenly seemed , once again , that rock music had to be .
Julian Casablancas ’ ambivalent lyrics and the band ’s pinpoint precision rendered the album both wry and accessible .
The record ’s mood and attitude — those ineffable , un- reproducible qualities — solidified its status as a masterpiece .
By 2001 , modern rock had become so generic as to be placeless , but the first time you played Is This It , you heard the elusive , seductive sound of New York , a city devastated by 9/11 that somehow lost none of its gritty allure .
Is This It , it turned out , was — and is — as dynamic , soulful and enduring as the city itself .
Mark Krotov
After the latter third of the 20th century became littered with “ new Dylans , ” it became obvious that no one could ever fill that role .
So when Ritter made his first few strummy , literate records , there were no lofty expectations to keep him from developing his talent and fanbase .
After three promising albums , the masterpiece arrived .
Recorded with producer Brian Deck , who stretched Ritter ’s rootsy folk in more ambitious directions , The Animal Years is bookended by a pair of epic ballads —
“ Girl in the War ” and “ Thin Blue Flame ” — which helped secure his place at the table of great songwriters without ever having to live in anybody ’s shadow .
Josh Jackson
The first time I heard Kill the Moonlight in my friend ’s car , I was so jealous .
I could n’t recall a more satisfying minimalism on any record .
For all its swagger , to have the coolest drummer in rock sit the album openers out struck me as the ultimate in not giving a shit on a record that seemed to be about not giving a shit as a way of life .
Who needs concern when you can make music as cool as this ?
But after dozens of spins , the thing that hits me most is what a calculated , careful record it really is .
All of Britt Daniel ’s and Jim Eno ’s deep musical and personal concerns are there ; they ’re just implied .
Kill the Moonlight has so much depth because it subtly reveals that Spoon does give a shit , they just want you to have to dig through some very sexy music to feel it .
Fucking introverts .
David Bazan
The early promise of The Hold Steady came to full fruition on this career milestone that made classic rock cool again .
Craig Finn ’s story songs about desperate losers and God-obsessed hedonists were as literate as ever , Tad Kubler rocketed power chords to the back of the arena , and Franz Nicolay added vintage E Street Band keyboard fills .
And thanks to a full slate of killer melodies , this time the boys and girls could not only chant along — they could sing along , too .
Andy Whitman
In a decade largely defined by South Asia ’s geo-political emergence , Sri Lankan - raised Maya Arulpragasam seized the moment .
Her thrilling , slang - tangled debut connected musical and political rebellion , forcing the first world to acknowledge the third .
This was dance music about hostage situations .
This was Fear of a Black Planet for a new century .
This was serious .
M.I.A. sang like a schoolgirl skipping through a hopscotch court while sniper fire rang out overhead — not oblivious to the danger , just defiant .
Nick Marino
For their artistic breakthrough , these North Carolina howlers polished their scruffy Americana sound until it gleamed .
The result : an overpowering acoustic album brimming with sadness and soul .
“ I was worried that I ’d start crying while listening at work , but I waited until I got home , ” a Paste colleague told me .
That ’s an accomplishment .
The title track — a meditation on three little words — is a three - hanky affair unto itself .
Nick Marino
Stankonia is OutKast ’s edgiest and most inspired record , a collection of infinitely catchy pop songs , groundbreaking hip - hop / techno fusion , lighthearted sexual honesty , political acumen and jazzy canvasses for lyrical innovation .
Witness the electrifying rap / rock of opening track “ Gasoline Dreams , ” with it ’s Hendrix - style riffing and urgent rhymes : “ I hear that Mother Nature ’s now on birth control / The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to hold /
The highway up to heaven got a crook on the toll / Youth full of fire ai n’t got nowhere to go !
Nowhere to go ! ” Mother Nature on birth control ?
In this one line , Dre and Big Boi sum up two decades of haphazard clear - cut sprawl in Atlanta , using their hometown as a microcosm for the hopeless bleakness of urban — and now suburban — America .
While Stankonia explodes out of the gates with youthful vigor , by the end — as the weight of tragedies and inequalities and broken promises eat away at OutKast ’s optimism and energy — the album slows to a crawl ; musically , the only other works comparable to songs like teen - pregnancy / suicide ballad “ Toilet Tisha ” and the hypnotic “ Slum Beautiful ” are Funkadelic ’s “ Maggot Brain ” and the end of Frank Zappa ’s Joe ’s Garage .
Steve LaBate
More convincingly than anyone in the last decade , Welch and her partner David Rawlings dipped their ladle into the pot of old - timey American music .
On the reflective Time ( the Revelator ) , as their striking vocals wrap tautly around each other , a hushed epic unfolds .
The spirited “ Red Clay Halo ” — a gorgeously simple rumination on poverty , sin and redemption — captures the essence of the duo ’s timeless songs :
“ And it ’s under my nails and it ’s under my collar / And it shows on my Sunday clothes /
Though I do my best with the soap and the water / but the damned old dirt wo n’t go . ”
Welch and Rawlings can’t seem to get the dirt out of their music , either .
And thank goodness for that .

With three bands and one coal miner ’s daughter , Jack White released a stellar album nearly every year of this decade , each exploring a new facet of his fierce , ever - deepening , hard - boiled rock agenda .
The one exception was 2002 , but we ’ll forgive him — it seems he spent the year laying low , preparing The White Stripes ’ finest work to date , 2003 ’s mind - curdling Elephant .
His and Meg ’s first proper major - label release banished any suspicions that they were a peppermint - swathed novelty act , instead sublimating their early lo-fi brattiness into a taut collection of 14 pummeling garage - rock gems .
In terms of frequency , consistency and sheer quality , few musicians rival White ’s claim as Artist of the Aughts .
Here ’s how he made the decade his own .

With Wide Awake , the one - time prince of emo finally grew up , and — as much as any one artist could during a decade of such cultural fragmentation — became the inadvertent spokesman for his aimless generation .
The poetry of Conor Oberst ’s lyrics captured the hearts of fellow twentysomethings with their urgent , exhausted , lovesick and thought - lost wonder .
It felt like he was collectively singing our own minds — asking the big questions , confronting a culture of fear , searching for new beginnings , wrestling with God and truth and innocence lost .
Steve LaBate
Considering what it was up against , the fact that this album made our list is a small miracle .
Kid A had both the unfortunate task of following one of the greatest albums of all time ( 1997 ’s OK Computer ) and the gall to mark the watershed artistic transition toward more electronic - based experimentation for one of the world ’s greatest rock ’ n ’ roll bands .
Indeed , everything had to be in its right place .
And it was .

Rock ’s back pages are cluttered with memorable paens to loss : lost love ( Derek and the Dominos ’ Layla and Other Assorted Songs ) , innocence lost ( Springsteen ’s Born to Run ) , dead homies ( Ice Cube ’s Kill at Will ) .
This feisty crew of Canadians and American runaways joined that illustrious company the moment they crashed into our collective consciousness with their kinetic debut album , which payed tribute to fallen loved ones , delivered a suite of “ Neighborhood ” songs that served as a proxy for disappearing family and community , and implored everyone still living here on Earth to wake the hell up .

By now , the story of this album has become rock ’ n ’ roll lore like Brian Wilson ’s sandbox and “ Paul is dead . ”
In brief : Once upon a time , the acclaimed Chicago rock band Wilco delivered an album called Yankee Hotel Foxtrot to Reprise , its longtime label , a subsidiary of Warner Bros .
Terrified by the album ’s squalling feedback and abstract songcraft , Reprise executives ran screaming from the room .
Ultimately , they decided to let the band go .
Soon after , Wilco streamed the record for free online .
The album was met with raves from both fans and critics , and was eventually picked up by Nonesuch , an artier subsidiary of the same parent company .
“ There was a common perception and irony , ” Nonesuch senior VP David Bither says today , “ of one Warner label passing on the record and letting the band go out of its contract for very little cost , and another Warner label picking it up and putting it out .
In other words , paying for it twice . ”
On that level , Yankee has come to represent everything that ’s wrong with the music business : tone - deaf executives , a gross misunderstanding of online music , an institutionalized pandering to the lowest common denominator that obstructed the release of a timeless rock classic .
And yet , on another level , Yankee ’s success means that the system works .
The record did come out , full of glorious static and muffled drums and conflicted patriotism .
People did buy it .
Wilco ’s frontman , Jeff
Tweedy , got to keep his ambiguous lyrics — he got to start the album by singing “ I am an American aquarium drinker , ” and after a while that did n’t seem so very weird .
Everyone pretty much got it .
“ Some of it at the time seemed very topical , ” Bither says .
“ Here we were with a record that was being toured for the first time and performed for the first time literally days after 9/11 . …
That moment , those months , were a time when we were looking not for answers , certainly , but looking for questions . ”
The album asked questions both of its audience and its corporate backers .
And the response told us everything we needed to know about the music industry in the 2000s .
Through its circuitous provenance and runaway success , Yankee Hotel Foxtrot proved that great art — even in difficult times — will find the light of day .

In 2005 , when Sufjan Stevens released Illinois , the second album in his planned 50 - state project , American pride was at a record low — especially among young people .
The death toll in Iraq was steadily climbing , and Abu Ghraib was fresh on our minds .
Meanwhile , Stevens was beginning to seem brilliant enough to fulfill his ambitious plan .
His music pushed boundaries between pop and classical , and the emotional weight of his lyrics grounded his feather - light voice .
There was a distinct peculiarity about Illinois and Stevens himself , who gave his songs titles like “ To the Workers of the Rock River Valley Region , I Have an Idea Concerning Your Predicament . ”
Critics embraced the mystery and declared the album a masterpiece .
Stevens and his band , The Illinoisemakers , wore cheerleading costumes onstage to promote the record , and once its success took them to larger venues , Stevens switched to giant , colorful bird wings .
His band was a spectacle , their performances magical .
Thousands of fans gathered in theaters across the country to behold this winged creature and rally behind his songs about America ’s heartland .
It was a new , weird kind of patriotism .
Stevens collected facts and anecdotes about the great state of Illinois , stringing them together in ambitious rhyme schemes and wrapping them in meticulous arrangements .
“ Decatur , or , Round Of Applause For Your Stepmother ” is superficially a song about a city , but beneath the textbook trivia is Stevens ’ story of reconciling with his father ’s wife .
The gut - wrenching “ Casimir Pulaski Day ” is about a friend dying of bone cancer , and “ The Seer ’s Tower ” looks at idol worship from the perspective of Chicago ’s tallest building .
And then there ’s “ John Wayne Gacy , Jr. , ” the hushed , nightmare - inducing acoustic song about the rapist and serial killer who preyed on teenaged boys , hiding their bodies under the floorboards in his Chicago home .
“ His father was a drinker and his mother cried in bed / Folding John Wayne ’s T - shirts when the swing set hit his head , ” Stevens sang , referencing a true story — at 11 , Gacy was hit in the head by a swing .
But the song ’s conclusion is what got people talking : “ And in my best behavior , I am really just like him , ” Stevens half - whispered as the music quieted behind him .
“ Look beneath the floorboards for the secrets I have hid . ”
It was startlingly confessional , “ a remark about potential more than anything else , ” the songwriter says now .
“ We ’re all capable of what he did . ”

It ’s bullshit , is n’t it ?
The big problem is – like a big chunk of anything that manages to be controversial – the debate shakes down to “ they should n’t be allowed to do this ” versus “ they should be allowed to do this ” while entirely neglecting the more important “ Is this any good ? ”
It ’s not any good .
It ’s bullshit .
It ’s a lie .
It means nothing .
In terms of craft , Infinity Ward are … well , joint top of their field .
The idea of turning a progression through a linear , scripted environment into a storytelling experience had its moment of apotheosis with Valve ’s Half - life back in 1998 .
Specifically , its opening .
The first people to really grasp the implications of Valve ’s innovations were Infinity Ward , in their previous life at 2015 , whose Medal of Honour : Allied Assault was the first game to not entirely ignore Half - Life and hope the lessons would go away .
They ( with Valve ) have had a duopoly on the form ever since .
Everyone else is frankly , second best , at best .
So while it ’s easy to pick holes in the illusion of a scene of No Russian – oh !
The shirts repeat occasionally !
– it does n’t change the fact moving through it is like walking through a living painting .
It ’s a clockwork machine .
In the seconds I managed to step back from what was actually happening , I felt a lot like I did when playing its opening scene in a military base – as in , I was scared to look anywhere , because there was so much stuff happening everywhere .
No matter where I lay my eyes , there ’d be something I ’d miss .
“ No Russian ” positions you as an undercover agent , trying to infiltrate an evil terrorist ’s group .
By doing this , you ’re helping out at a massacre at an airport .
You walk in .
People look at you .
Your four comrades open up at the crowd , and they fall .
People run , cry and die .
You walk slowly through the airport , slaying those who have n’t run .
Eventually , a military response arrives via chopper .
You fight them and then … well , spoilers .
It ’ll be foolish to deny it does n’t provoke a response .
Of course , the level and nature of that response is n’t solely about the game , or even the person playing it .
So , yes , merely talking to my friends , I find people telling stories of leftist political radicals and pillars of the community mowing down people while cackling while bar - room thugs dismiss it as exploitative war - porn .
Like any work of human creativity , the seriousness you bring to the game impacts upon your experience .
But it ’s more complicated than that .
People ’s response seems to change depending on who you play with or in front of .
It ’s like an inverse of the ErotiSim reaction I talked about previously .
Playing with friends , we all fucked around with the Sims .
Playing by myself , I took the emotional turmoil more seriously .
Conversely , with No Russian , with someone standing behind you and judging you , even the most sociopathic may feel a little twinge before pulling that trigger .
But it ’s bullshit .
It ’s bullshit because , like a whole lot of Modern Warfare , it ’s bad writing .
By which I stress , I do n’t mean “ the writer ca n’t write ” .
Because the real nature of writing in games ( “ Everything which appears in front of your eyes with which we create the story ” ) rather than the responsibilities of the word - dude ( “ Whatever you can write quickly on freelance which the team ignore and / or present badly ” ) is what matters here .
As others have noted , the most disturbing part of No Russian is its context .
A few seconds previously you ’re involved in a high - speed James Bond chase involving snowmobiles .
A few seconds later , you ’re mowing down civilians .
That tonal shift is n’t brutal .
It ’s laughable .
At best , you ’re comedy .
At worst , you ’re cheap exploitative trash .
Modern Warfare leans towards the latter .
You have to earn the right to shove an audience ’s face in that material .
Before it , Infinity Ward do nothing to earn it .
Afterward , they do barely anything with it – by which you can read there is slightly more than “ nothing ” there , which I ’ll get to eventually – to justify the leap of faith you ’ve taken with them .
And then there ’s the matter of realism … oh , shit .
Yeah , realism is a tricky thing with Call of Duty .
It ’s clearly ludicrous , unless you ’re the person in Alec ’s Wot - I - Think comment thread who somehow thought that 24 was a documentary or something .
But it lives of the sense of authenticity .
It wants you to believe in its techno - thrillerness , at least on its own terms .
The problem comes when you introduce this attitude into something like five dudes strolling into an airport and opening up .
Because as accurately , as disturbingly rendered as the slaughter is , it ’s not convincing .
The beat where people try to surrender … yeah , that ’s impressive analysis .
People would assume they were taking prisoners , even if they were n’t .
But the rest is simply ludicrous .
Machine - guns are loud .
People are gone the second they start firing .
Anyone anywhere near does n’t hang around .
They certainly do n’t find themselves hanging around to be gunned down in lobbies .
Rent - a - cops with pistols – and fuck me , if you ’ve been in a Russian Airport , you know you get guys with SMGs , not pistols , walking around – do n’t charge guys with hefty - machine - guns .
They get the people hanging around OUT OF THERE .
And crucially , SWAT - or - local - equivalent response is n’t a wall of men walking slowly towards you with riot shields .
It ’s snipers on the rooftops taking down these psychopathic shits .
In other words , Infinity Ward have taken great effort to render a scene of a massacre which bears no relation to any massacre that could ever happen .
It ’s nothing more than that moment of revulsion ( or , for those sort of gamers , excitement ) when you open up on civilians .
It means nothing human because it ’s about nothing that ’s human .
So it ’s exploitative and pointless .
But its real failing , ironically enough , is one of cowardice .
Let ’s assume you accept the warped reality of their airport slaughter .
It ’s their universe .
Let ’s roll with it .
Well , the idea that you ’re an undercover agent who can walk alongside your homicidal comrades without you firing a shot , without them realising or caring , is openly stupid .
( I ’ve heard people say they take notice and call you a coward .
I ’ve played through it three times and not had it once .
C’est la vie . )
For the level to matter – to be the true Jack Bauer ends - justify - the - means statement – you must be forced into joining in .
You ’ve got a chance to skip the level .
Great .
But to play the level , to accept it on its own terms , you must open up at those people .
That ’s the cowardice of Infinity Ward .
They realised a level where you had to kill the innocents is more offensive than a level where it ’s your choice … but choosing the latter is the single thing that stops it ever being some manner of effective artistic statement and rendering the whole thing laughably pathetic .
There is – AND SPOILERS ARE NOW – a twist to it , of course .
Your terrorists comrades shoot you at the end and pin the attack on the yanks .
Which , if you look at it , could be an excuse for them not caring that you ’re not mowing down people with them .
Except it does n’t matter when you get shot , as long as they can pin the attack on you – so having someone who ’s coming along and not helping is merely someone who could open up at them when their conscience cracks .
( Why you do n’t just shoot this terrorist leader now that you ’re close enough to him is n’t really explained .
Why infiltrate the cell to stop an attack when you can just kill the ringmaster now ? )
Part of me likes to think that the whole section – in fact , the whole game proper – is actually a statement that the blind following of orders leads to the death of the world .
The one irony of the twist in the plot is never commented on in the game – that being , the Russians are entirely justified in being phenomenally pissed off .
An American organisation knew there was a serious attack wiping out dozens of Russian citizens … and rather than warning , they sent a man to join the attack .
They were complicit .
You were complicit .
Imagine what the US response would be to the tables being turned , and there was real evidence that a foreign government helped out a 9 - 11 - esque attack on US soil to infiltrate a terrorist organisation .
Throughout the game you ’re forced into performing tasks which only lead to worse devastation , because you ’re following fucking brain - dead orders .
You could see Modern Warfare 2 as the sister of BioShock – as in , mocking the player for being stupid enough to follow this linear string of events .
Giving up your morality to a higher power and obeying those orders only leads to World War 3 .
Well , you could if they ’d only actually made their statement clear .
As it is , it ’s just a mess of sound and fury signifying jack - shit .
The final half of Modern Warfare 2 is the sort of thing which Wikipedia entries were made for flicking through and catching up on .
Clarity never hurts .
Rambling purple prose sections about the nature of war do .
If the above is actually what Infinity Ward were trying to say they should have made sure they fucking said it loud and clear .
That ’s the most annoying thing about “ No Russian ” though .
It ’s not that the ideas are necessarily bad – I wrote a hell of a lot to defend Super Columbine Massacre RPG , after all .
It ’s that the execution is weak .
If you ’re going to do this , you do this .
You make the move knowing that you ’ve thought it all through .
That you ’ve considered everything .
That you know what you ’re saying and what it means .
The sickening thing is that communicating simple yet powerful messages is what Infinity Ward have excelled at ( Cross Ref ; Call of Duty ’s River landing missions , with you forced to progress with no gun due to Soviet supply problems ) .
That clarity is missing .
Instead , we ’re left with a dumb shock .
That ’s the problem .
That ’s what sickens me .
It ’s that they had the balls to try to do this … and they blew it .
They fucking blew it .
Anyone else who tries it will be living in their diseased shadow .
If you want to try to do this thing you have a responsibility to do it properly , or not at all .
Infinity Ward failed the medium and failed themselves with No Russian .
They ’ve always cut levels which were n’t good enough , arguing for a concentrated , higher - quality experience .
They should have cut this one .
It ’s bullshit and they should be ashamed .
“ I ’ve seen things you people would n’t believe .
Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion .
I watched C beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser Gate .
All those moment will be lost , in time .
Like tears , in the rain … Time to die . ” ( Roy Battey , Blade Runner )
“ like science fiction pornography – all sensation and no heart . ” ( Pat Berman State and Columbia Record , Columbia , South Carolina , July 2 , 1982 )
In this essay I have chosen to discuss Ridley Scott ’s 1982 film Blade Runner as a primary example of a ‘ cult ’ film .
I will begin by exploring the various definitions and debates surrounding the term ‘ cult cinema ’ , and the different categories of cult film , with particular focus on the debate over the relevance of the ‘ midnight movie ’ phenomena in the age of the internet , TV , and video / DVD rental .
I will then analyse Ridley Scott ’s 1982 science fiction film Blade Runner as an example of the cult category ‘ the resurrected financial / critical flop ’ .
I will then explore the reasons why this film attained cult status , looking at its appeal to niche audiences , and also its appeal to those attempting to unravel the mysteries and mistakes surrounding its production history .
I will explore the relevance of generic hybridity in a film ’s progression from cult to mainstream success , and ask whether or not a cult film can still retain its cult badge of honour once it has achieved this success .
What is ‘ Cult ’ Film ?
Definition and Debates
“ The spectators of a cult film dwell within its world .
They look at their film obsessively ; they watch and re-watch it indefinitely .
They know all the lines by heart . ”
( Alain J. Cohen , 2003:149 )
“ it is a type marked by both its highly specified and limited audience as well as a singular pleasure that this audience finds in the film ’s transgressions . ”
( J.P. Telotte , 1991:7 )
To understand the question of what constitutes a ‘ cult ’ film , I find it helpful to begin at the beginning , with the etymological root of the word ‘ cult ’ , which is the Latin cultus , meaning both ‘ worship ’ and ‘ cultivation ’ .
According to J.P. Telotte the word signifies “ an act of adherence and mastery , submission and domination ” , and that therefore the term ‘ cult ’ is underpinned by this “ duel impulse ” to both worship and control ( 1991:14 ) .
This association of film with religion is also explored by Hoberman and Rosenbaum in their exploration of the ‘ midnight movie ’ phenomena .
They claim that “ [ i ] f the origins of art are to be found in religion , the movies are surely the universal secular faith of the twentieth century ” ( 1983/1992:15 ) .
Both Telotte and Anne Jerslev concur that it is the activity of the audience which is responsible for the conversion of a film into an object of esoteric worship , where a ‘ supertext ’ is created by the audience ’s appropriation of the original text ( Telotte 1991:7 , Jerslev , 1992 ) .
Telotte ’s “ duel impulse ” can certainly be attributed to this appropriation and conversion process .
Jamie Sexton and Mark Jancovich also emphasise audience appropriation and reception processes .
All four writers assert that a film enters the cult canon through a process of resurrection , whereby a critical failure , or a conventionally popular film , regains a second life through its adoption by niche audiences ( Sexton , 2006:198 , Jancovich et al , 2003:1 ) .
Categorising Cult : The Midnight Movie , the Transgressive and the Resurrected
“ it is very difficult to think of the cult film outside of the cult film experience …
In this experience , we celebrate a most pleasurable transgression , as we vicariously cross over into taboo territory – the self ’s terra incognita – and then emerge to tell of it . ” ( Telotte , 1991:16 )
In his influential essay ‘ Beyond all reason : the nature of the cult ’ , J. P. Telotte identifies two types of cult film ; the “ resurrected classic ” and the “ midnight movie ” .
As a ‘ resurrected classic ’ he uses the example of Michael Curtiz ’s Casablanca ( 1942 ) which was hugely popular when originally released , and continued to be reclaimed by future generations .
He asserts that both classic films and screen icons “ work so powerfully upon us because of their placement in time .
For despite their rootedness in an era , they display a remarkable ability to live on through and , in effect , outside of history ” ( 1991:8 - 9 ) .
Writing in the early 1990s , when midnight movie going was still a popular pastime in the US , Telotte also identifies “ midnight movies ” as his second type of cult film , and uses Jim Sharman ’s The Rocky Horror Picture Show ( 1975 ) as his primary example .
Describing the midnight movie audience as “ usually the middle - class teenager and young adult , the 17 - to 24 - year - old group ” , he asserts that the midnight movie - going experience is a sort of “ rite of passage for an audience which sees itself as “ separate from the cultural mainstream ” ( 1991:10 ) .
Hoberman and Rosenbaum also draw parallels between transubstantiation in religious rituals and the midnight movie experience ( 1983/1992:16 ) .
Unfortunately all three writers suffer from a heavy American bias , which is clear in Telotte ’s description of what he calls the “ typical venue ” for cult films as “ the midnight showing , usually at suburban mall theatres rather than art or rerun houses ” .
He even claims that “ this alternate viewing practice seems essential , a defining characteristic of the midnight movie ” ( 1991:10 ) .
The focus of all three authors on the midnight movie phenomenon as the primary evidence of cult audience activity is both outmoded and inaccurate in today ’s age of internet fandom , fanzines and TV and video / DVD audiences .
It is now more accurate to use the midnight movie phenomena as a description of cult audience behaviour , not as a category of cult film .
Hoberman and Rosenbaum , to their credit , do acknowledge that “ [ w ] hen the rise of television destroyed moviegoing as a mass habit , it simultaneously enhanced the opportunities for film fetishism and ritual screenings .
Movies became integral to the celebration of religious events ” ( 1983/1992:30 . See also Sexton 2006:211 ) .
Building on Telotte ’s own writing , I prefer to re-categorise his example of The Rocky Horror Picture Show , as an ‘ excessive / transgressive ’ cult film , with a strong midnight movie history , including a tradition of dressing up and audience participation .
Similarly Robert Wise ’s The Sound of Music ( 1965 ) shares this midnight movie history and dressing up participation , however it is not a transgressive / excessive film , it is a ‘ resurrected classic ’ .
Therefore , it is important to separate the behaviour of audiences from the type of the cult film .
According to Barry Grant , ‘ transgression ’ can appear in the form of content , attitude or style ( Grant , 1991:123 .
See also Sexton , 2006:209 , and Timothy Corrigan 1991:31 ) .
The film ’s generic hybridity and visual cultural references also signal its stylistic , collage - like excessiveness , but perhaps most significantly it is the film ’s attitude which is the most transgressive .
Sexual liberation and sadomasachictic excess are the primary themes of this alternative musical .
The films of John Waters are also an example of this deliberately shocking ‘ trash ’ cinema .
Transgression can also take the form of technical incompetence , as the films of Edward D. Wood Jr. have proven .
According to Barry Grant , the transgression of technical competence is often admired in an ironic fashion for being “ trash ” ( Grant , 1991:124 , see also Sexton , 2006:209 ) .
Cinematic success appears to only have relevance to one category of cult – the resurrected classic .
There is in fact a category which depends on cinematic failure as the initial engine of its cult .
The resurrected financial / critical flop is the category which Blade Runner falls into .
Blade Runner as Resurrected Financial / Critical Flop
“ I suspect history will be kinder to it than the critics . ” ( John Bloom .
‘ Republican Pod People , Circa 1982 ’ , in Dallas Times Herald , Dallas , Texas , June 25,1982 )
When Ridley Scott finally managed to get his cast and crew together in May 1982 for the first full screening of what is now known as the ‘ Domestic Cut ’ of the Blade Runner film , it was met by a less than optimistic reaction , as Paul Sammon ’s highly detailed and personal book Future Noir describes .
It was n’t that the audience were wholly negative about it .
It was more that the majority of them simply did not know what to make of it ( Sammon , 1996:312 ) .
After the film ’s June 25th release it became clear that both critics and audiences were suffering the same ambiguous reaction as the cast and crew had .
Sammon notes that “ for some reason , unfavourable Blade Runner reviews were particularly vitriolic , as if many of the nation ’s critics had somehow been personally offended by the subtlety and care that had gone into this picture ” ( Sammon , 1996:313 ) .
Sammon asks if “ maybe Blade Runner ’s lacklustre box office could simply be laid at the feet of audiences unwilling to embrace a downbeat , morally ambiguous film featuring a dour performance from a leading action hero ” .
The answer he finds more likely , however , “ can be summed up in two letters : E.T. ” ( 1996:316 ) .
E.T. was not only in direct box - office competition with Blade Runner , but was also , as Sammon puts it , “ the sentimental antithesis of Runner ’s gritty pessimism ” ( 1996:316 ) .
And as if the presence of E.T. was n’t bad enough , Blade Runner was also forced to compete in a market glutted by big - budget science fiction / fantasy films such as Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan , Conan The Barbarian , and John Carpenter ’s remake of The Thing , all of which were invading multiplexes in the same summer of 1982 .
It was lucky , then , that the studios had a back up plan .
And it was this plan which would ultimately rescue the film from its cinematic death - bed .
Blade Runner was released during a massive expansion of cable television and home video markets .
As Sammon phrases it , “ [ a ] lthough videotapes and cable TV were still in their relative infancy in 1982 , like all infants , they were hungry ” ( 1996:322 ) .
After Blade Runner ’s box office flop , Warner Brothers initiated a new distribution strategy to maximise profits , involving pulling the flop from theatres and re-releasing them through the Warner - Amex Satellite Entertainment Network .
The film was now available to a whole new audience who normally would n’t watch science fiction films at the cinema .
Encouragingly , ratings revealed that this new audience apparently liked what it saw ( Sammon , 1996:322 ) .
At the same time Embassy Entertainment released Blade Runner on video and laser disc in 1983 , where it proved ever more popular with rental and purchasing .
Audiences , who might have been confused by the film in the cinema , were now able to re-watch it as many times as they liked .
According to Sammon ’s research , “ all of these factors eventually coalesced to make Blade Runner one of the most rented tapes on the home video market , to which numerous trade journals continue to attest ” ( 1996:323 ) .
Whatever the reason for its box office failure , the fact was that from its first showing the film had captured an audience , and that audience refused to allow the film to fall into limbo .
The two questions are , who is this audience ?
And what do they see in this film in particular ?
I will explore two answers .
The first concerns the appeal of the film to niche audiences .
The second is the appeal of the mythology created around the film ’s complicated , messy and somewhat mysterious production history .
I shall turn to niche audiences first .
The Blade Runner Cult : Niche Audiences and Dystopias in Science Fiction
“ Which films touch upon a deeper structure of reality ?
Why do some films become evanescent whilst others endure ?
For whom ?
How ?
Which films become emblematic of a given culture ? ” ( Cohen , 2003:149 )
“ All individual works are potentially myths , but it is their collective adoption that realises , if necessary , their mythical status . ”
( Le’vi-Strauss , 1971:560 )
In his attempt to analyse cult audiences , Henry Jenkins claims that fandom communities share “ a common mode of reception , a common set of critical categories and practices , a tradition of aesthetic production , a set of social norms and expectations ” ( Jenkins , 1992:86 ) .
Jenkins ’ work , however , can be criticised as being too historically specific , focusing on the readings of a certain audience at a certain time and place .
Jamie Sexton warns against overly focusing on textual elements of cult films and treating them in a trans - historical way .
He emphasises the significance of historical contexts in influencing audience ’s appropriation procedures , and how these contexts can shift , thereby altering the “ dominant aesthetic features associated with cult films ” ( 2006:211 ) .
In the realm of the science fiction film , historical contexts are especially fundamental .
Charles Elkins asserts that the primary question for sociologists of sci- fi should be “ how is social order communicated in SF and how does this symbolic act relate to the structure and function of social action ?
Who are the heroes , villains and fools of the social order , and in the name of what principles do they act ? ” ( Elkins , 1997:228-9 ) .
Both thematically and visually , the science fiction film betrays deep - seated concerns with the trajectory of contemporary society , and therefore they appeal to those audience members who share these concerns .
This social criticism is part of Telotte ’s definition of ‘ transgression ’ ( 1991:7 ) .
In Blade Runner , four of the most important transgressive themes explored are corporate business , dehumanisation , race and slavery .
Thomas Byers , in his comparison of Alien ( 1979 ) , Blade Runner and Star Trek II : Wrath of Kahn , notes that their releases coincided with an explosion of interest in computers , high - tech industry , and genetic engineering , and that the latter two were in production during the elevation of Ronald Regan and a new breed of young urban professionals who ushered in a new age of corporate culture and consumerism ( Byers , 1987/1990:39 ) .
He identifies thematic links between the three films , all of which explore the relationship between high - tech corporate capitalism and individual styles of personal behaviour .
Byers concludes that the strongest common element in Alien and Blade Runner is their “ insistence on the dehumanisation necessary for human survival in a world dominated by mega- corporations ” ( 1987/1990:45 ) .
Thus , when a Blade Runner is asked to execute a replicant , it is not called execution , it is called ‘ retirement ’ .
In Blade Runner the theme of dehumanisation and oppression specifically applies to race and slavery .
Science fiction has a history of confronting issues of race and discrimination , and even has a subgenre of its own .
Afrofuturism , explored by writers like Kodwo Eshun and Umberto Eco , is concerned with the ‘ unreality principle ’ .
Using The Matrix trilogy ( Andy and Larry Wachowski ) as examples , Mark Derry asserts that Afrofuturist films explore the African American sense that they are “ in a very real sense , the descendents of alien abductees ” , and that they “ inhabit a sci - fi nightmare in which unseen but no less impassable force fields of intolerance frustrate their movements ” ( Derry 1994:180 . Also Eshun 1998:4 ) .
Jamie Sexton identifies Blade Runner as an example of a film which , though it does not on the face of it seem particularly Afrocentirc , still contains Afrofuturist themes in its exploration of racial difference and slavery within a science fiction context ( Sexton , 2006:204 ) .
To David Desser , this is a theme hinted at in the racial mixture on the streets of Los Angeles , but explicitly personified in the replicants and their exclusion from human society on pain of ‘ retirement ’ ( Desser , 1999:93 ) .
However , it is not simply an appeal to a niche audience which influences whether or not a film becomes cult .
As discussed above regarding the films of Edward D. Wood Jr , one element of transgression in cult film is that of technical incompetence and production nightmares .
The Cult of the Tarnished , the Incomplete , and the Incomprehensible Around Blade Runner
“ Blade Runner seemed to encourage a diversity of opinions between its cast and crew , not a solidarity … Perplexity , in fact , seemed the one common denominator running through the jumble of reactions , even among those who ’d genuinely liked the film . ”
( Sammon , 1996:312 )
“ You are no longer simply a fan of Blade Runner : you are part of the world of Blade Runner or even a blade runner yourself . ” ( Brooker , 1999:60 )
The release in 2007 of the ‘ Blade Runner - The Final Cut five - disk ultimate collectors ’ edition ’ signalled the ultimate resolution of the story of the making of Blade Runner , which had begun over twenty five years ago , and provided audiences , at last , with a final , finished product .
Over its long and troubled history , Blade Runner has existed in six different versions .
Sammon provides an in depth description of the various differences between these versions which I need not go into here , but needless to say the variety of versions is proof of the extent to which the film has been tampered with over the course of its life ( see Sammon , 1996 : Appendix B:394-408 ) .
With the 2007 release , seven versions of the film now exist , a ridiculous state of affairs , certainly , however it is a state of affairs which has done nothing to harm Blade Runner ’s popularity .
For that small cult audience who originally latched onto Blade Runner , the quest now became the researching of the film ’s history in order to better understand the film in its many forms .
According to Will Brooker , “ [ i] t is perhaps unsurprising , then , that the project of Blade Runner Internet fandom involves a search for answers , an obsessive return to the ‘ original ’ text (s ) in this wealth of false leads , in order to pick over the clues and build threads of logic which explain some of the film ’s unsolved mysteries ” ( 1999:60 ) .
Brooker notes that even after twenty five years of cult activity , some mistakes and some mysteries have never been successfully solved , like the numerous internal contradictions over the exact number of escaped replicants ( 1999:58 ) .
The first Blade Runner Fanzine was published – with amazing speed – in December of 1982 .
Sarah Campbell ’s Cityspeak provided the first forum for cult fan discussions of the film .
Later , establishing the film as acceptable in serious academic study , came the first book dedicated to the academic analysis and criticism of Blade Runner .
Retrofitting Blade Runner : Issues in Ridley Scott ’s Blade Runner and Phillip K. Dick ’s Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep , was published by Bowling Green State University Popular Press in 1991 , edited by Judith B. Kerman .
Blade Runner had entered the academy .
And its acceptability by academics was , in part , due to its increasing mass appeal and its broadening audience .
Its academic debut signalled that it had now become a fully paid up member of the mainstream .
But what was the reason for this conversion from a cult audience to a mass audience ?
From a resurrected flop to a popular smash hit ?
And what would this popularity mean for the cult ?
From Cult to Popular : Generic Hybridity , Mass Appeal and Retaining the Badge of Honour
“ Yet perhaps the greatest confirmation of the fact that Blade Runner had risen phoenix - like and triumphant from the ashes of its failure was expressed by Hollywood ’s most sincere form of flattery : it imitated the hell out of it . ” ( Sammon , 1996:324 )
In order to qualify the above statement , Sammon cites , for starters , just a few from the extensive list of various media products influenced by Blade Runner , for example the Akira comics , Graham Gilliam ’s Brazil ( 1985 ) , the Max Headroom TV show ( 1987 ) , Danny cannon ’s Judge Dredd ( 1995 ) , Robert Longo ’s Johnny Mnemonic ( 1995 ) , not to mention the entire Cyberpunk literary movement , which uses the Blade Runner film specifically as its touchstone .
But what is it about Blade Runner which has allowed it to rocket from cult obscurity into the mainstream ?
Tenuous arguments have been made concerning the generic hybridity of the film as being the root of the mainstream appeal for Blade Runner .
However , this analysis simply fails to stand up to more rigorous research .
Timothy Corrigan and J.P. Telotte both claim that a generic mish - mash is part of the transgressive element of cult film ( Corrigan , 1991 ; Telotte , 1991 ) .
However , Barry Grant points out that plenty of mainstream films are generically ‘ collage–like assemblage of interchangeable parts ’ ( Grant 1991:125 ) .
There is also the small matter of why this variety of generic appeal failed to grab the mainstream when the film was first released .
Generic variety may certainly be an element in the conversion of a cult film to a mainstream film , but the process requires more .
Another element which assists the process is the cult itself .
The existence of a strong cult behind a film can also give it a mainstream appeal .
Audiences begin to question what it might be about a particular film that the cult finds so attractive .
Cult films become a type of badge of honour for those within the cult , making it more and more attractive to mainstream audiences who want in on the action .
Who want to know the secret .
In this way then , cult films contain within them the seeds of their own destruction ( resulting in their mainstream resurrection ) .
At the end of the day , Telotte asserts , cult films , despite their separation from the mainstream , still participate in the “ ongoing ideological project of the mass media ” , and still contribute to the cultural cinematic imaginary , whether “ by building upon the pantheon of gods and mythic actions already established in Hollywood legend , or by contributing new images for commercialisation and exploitation ” ( 1991:14 ) .
Blade Runner ’s generic variety and strong cult backing meant that , inevitably , it was doomed to become a mainstream success .

FRIDAY UPDATE : Bizarrely , the alleged extortionist was revealed to be CBS News producer Robert Halderman , who has directed dozens of 48 Hours documentaries .
He was arrested on attempted grand larceny charges and today pleaded not guilty .
Just a reminder that David Letterman ’s independent production company Worldwide Pants , which produces CBS ’ Late Show and Late Late Show , is not owned by CBS .
8:30 PM UPDATE : CBS has issued this statement :
CBS was made aware of an ongoing police investigation involving David Letterman and an employee at 48 Hours , who was subsequently arrested earlier today on charges of attempted grand larceny in the first degree .
CBS is cooperating fully with the authorities and the employee has been suspended pending the results of the investigation .
Mr. Letterman addressed the issue during the show ’s broadcast this evening , and we believe his comments speak for themselves .
I ’ve been given this statement by David Letterman ’s people :
1. Olde Coach House , Northamptonshire
Olde Coach House pub , Northamptonshire
There 'll be fireworks and a bonfire at this pub tonight .
It 's a fitting celebration as the Olde Coach House stands where a gatehouse on the Catesby estate played a central role in the Gunpowder Plot .
Robert Catesby , his servant Thomas Bates and other conspirators made the room above the gate house their command centre in the plot to blow up parliament .
The manor and its grounds passed to the Catesby family in 1375 , who were dedicated Roman Catholics and almost ruined by fines imposed on them for their religious beliefs .
The present - day inn has a large garden , tiled floors inside , old settles and prints on the wall .
The food is highly recommended and accommodation is available .
• Olde Coach House , Ashby St Ledgers , Northamptonshire , off A5 ; +44 ( 0)1788 890349 .
2. Museum Tavern , London
This sumptuous pub stands opposite the British Museum and has been frequented by many eager beavers following their labours with the museum 's tomes .
Karl Marx would take ale there after long hours planning the proletarian revolution with Das Kapital .
Marx was quite a toper and frequently went on rowdy pub crawls in London with visiting German revolutionaries .
The pub dates from the 18th century and was first known as the Dog & Duck but was renamed in honour of the museum when it opened over the road in 1823 .
Inside there are engraved mirrors and windows , an ornate ceiling , and red painted walls .
Beers include Fuller 's London Pride , Sharp 's Doom Bar and Theakston Old Peculier plus many guest ales .
• Museum Tavern , 49 Great Russell Street , London WC1 ; +44 ( 0)20 7242 8987 .
3. Star Tavern , London
The Star was once home to a large retinue of servants who worked in the houses and embassies in Belgrave Square .
They mingled in the years after World War Two with a demi-monde of chancers , spivs , third - rate actors and slightly shady aristocrats .
The pub 's main claim to fame is that the gang who organised the Great Train Robbery in 1963 met in the long , narrow upstairs bar , reached by a narrow and circuitous staircase , to plot their audacious crime .
Today , this Grade II - listed , late - Georgian mews pub has several cosy nooks , with comfortable benches and settles , and a large bar serving beers from Fuller 's of Chiswick .
• Star Tavern , 6 Belgrave Mews West , London SW1 ; +44 ( 0)20 7235 3019 .
4. Crown & Treaty , Middlesex
This marvellous inn dates from 1576 .
Its name comes from the protracted talks , lasting 20 days , in 1645 when representatives of Charles I and Cromwell 's parliamentarians attempted to reach a settlement to end the rebellion against the crown .
The talks were held in the oak - panelled Treaty Room and broke down without reaching agreement on a single point .
The war continued , leading eventually to the death of the king and Cromwell 's Protectorate .
The panelling has its own fascinating history : it was dismantled in 1931 and sold to an American oil magnate , Armand Hammer , who used it to decorate his offices in the Empire State Building in New York City .
The panels were returned to the inn to mark the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 .
The former coaching inn serves Fuller 's London Pride and retains much of its Tudor charm among the modern houses and shopping arcades of Uxbridge .
• Crown & Treaty , 90 Oxford Road , Uxbridge , Middlesex ; +44 ( 0)1895 812803 .
5. Bat & Ball , Hampshire
The Bat and Ball pub , Hampshire
Surely there can't be plots involving cricket ?
The answer is an emphatic yes , for in the 18th and 19th centuries the game was supported by wealthy backers who wagered vast sums on the outcome of matches .
Cricket needed to attract large paying crowds and Broadhalfpenny Down , despite its isolated position , drew attendances of 20,000 as the Hambledon Club took on the might of All England and other major teams .
In the Bat & Ball , landlord Richard Nyren and fellow players planned a revolution in the game .
By the time Hambledon went into decline and the game moved to Thomas Lord 's ground in London , it had changed out of all recognition .
The first laws of cricket were hammered out in the Bat & Ball , a tiny wicket of two stumps had become the familiar tall one with three stumps , curved bats like hockey sticks had become straight and underarm bowling was replaced by a round - arm version ( over - arm bowling came later ) .
Both pub and ground remain today and the pub has many artefacts of the ancient game , including a curved bat .
Cask beers are served from Fuller 's and Gale's .
• Bat & Ball , Broadhalfpenny Down , Hyden Farm Lane , Clanfield , near Hambledon , Hampshire , off A3 ; +44 ( 0)23 9263 2692 .
6. Ketts Tavern , Norwich
The tavern dates from 1832 but it's thought there has been an inn on the site for 300 years or more .
Ketts
Hill fronts the great open space of Mousehold Heath where Robert Kett and a peasant army camped in 1549 .
Kett was a landowner from Attleborough who had enclosed his land , saw the error of his ways and led a great rebellion against enclosures that had ruined peasants and agricultural labourers .
By the time they reached Mousehold Heath , having laid waste to Wymondham and Lethersett , the army was 20,000 strong , an astonishing size that accounted for just about every adult male in Norfolk .
The rebels broke through the city walls and defeated an army of 15,000 led by the Marquis of Northampton .
It took a second army of 14,000 under the notorious butcher , the Earl of Warwick , to finally overcome the peasants .
Robert Kett was hanged in Norwich .
The pub named in his honour has a tremendous range of beers from craft breweries , including Blackfriars , Norfolk Square , Tipples and Woodforde's .
• Ketts Tavern , 29 Ketts Hill , Norwich ; +44 ( 0)1603 449654 .
7. Crescent , Greater Manchester
There 's another Karl Marx connection with the Crescent .
When the Great Bearded One went to visit his collaborator and financial backer Friedrich Engels in Manchester they would take refreshment in the pub , aptly named in those days the Red Dragon .
The pub is Grade II listed and , perhaps inspired by the memory of Marx , regulars rose up in 2007 when a property developer announced he would turn it into student accommodation .
The rebels won , the property developer backed off and used adjacent buildings for his student flats .
The pub has a back room for live music , regular beer festivals and 13 hand pumps dispensing a wide range of beers from craft breweries , including Bazens , Black Dog and Roosters .
A house beer is brewed by Mallinson's of Huddersfield run by a brewster ( female brewer ) , Tara Mallinson .
• Crescent , 20 The Crescent , Salford , Greater Manchester , half mile from Salford Crescent metro and railway station ; +44 ( 0)161 736 5600 .
8. Traquair Arms Hotel , Scotland
Traquair Arms Hotel ale , Scotland
The hotel is close to Traquair House , the oldest inhabited stately home in Scotland and a place of stern resistance to the crown .
The house dates from 1107 and was originally a hunting lodge for the kings and queens of Scotland .
It became a refuge for Catholic priests at times of persecution .
It 's owned by members of the Stuart clan who supported both Mary Queen of Scots and the Jacobite rebellion : Prince Charles Edward Stuart visited Traquair to raise support for his cause .
The main Bear Gates at Traquair remain closed until a Stuart returns to the throne : Ladbroke 's are n't taking bets .
In 1965 the 20th Laird of Traquair , Peter Maxwell Stuart , restored a small brewery that had once produced ale for the family and staff .
The brewery , along with the estate , is now managed by his daughter Catherine .
Beers include Traquair House
Ale , which is widely exported , Bear Ale and Jacobite Ale , which are all on sale in the 18th - century hotel .
• Traquair Arms Hotel , Traquair Road , Innerleithen , Borders , Scotland , A72 ; +44 ( 0)1896 830229 .
9. Lewes Arms , East Sussex
Lewes may seem a genteel old market town but rebellion bubbles beneath the surface .
Tom Paine , author of the Rights of Man , lived and worked there while plotting the success of both the American and French revolutions .
Lewes stages a massive Bonfire Night celebration and has recently introduced its own currency to give it a degree of freedom from Whitehall .
The Lewes Arms has been the scene of a recent rebellion .
In 2007 the pub 's owner , Greene King , threw out Sussex Best Bitter brewed by local and revered brewer , Harvey's .
Drinkers boycotted the pub until Greene King backed down and restored Sussex Best .
Food is served until 8.45 pm and mobile phones are banned .
• Lewes Arms , 1 Mount Place , Lewes , East Sussex ; +44 ( 0)1273 473152 .
10 . Land of Liberty , Hertfordshire
Land and Liberty pub , Hertfordshire
The pub 's fascinating name is taken from a 19th - century Chartist slogan .
The leader of the movement for working - class rights , Feargus O'Connor , planned a settlement at Heronsgate in the mid-1840s where families would escape the tyranny of factory life for rural self - sufficiency .
O'Connor bought the land and divided it into 35 plots with 15 cottages and other dwellings .
Bad weather and lack of agricultural skills among the participants meant the experiment failed .
In more recent times , Clement Attlee , the post - war Labour prime minister , and the spy Kim Philby lived at Heronsgate .
The pub supports craft breweries and the range of beers includes Bateman's , Dark Star , Red Squirrel and Welton 's while Tring Brewery supplies a house beer , Liberty Ale .
• Land of Liberty , Peace & Plenty , Long Lane , Heronsgate , Hertfordshire , off M25 , Junction 17 ; +44 ( 0)1923 282226 .
I know it 's frustrating when your phone is borked , but telling an Apple Store staffer that you 're " so mad I could pop a 9 mm at it " — before revealing you actually have a real 9 mm concealed — probably wo n't help matters .

But that 's what a man allegedly did yesterday at the Apple Store in Cincinnati's Kenwood mall .
According to reports , the man continued , " I 'll do it right now .
Look ! " , and opened the right side of his shirt to show a black 9 mm handgun .
Kudos to the Apple Store employee who stayed calm and said she 'd get it fixed .
She walked him over to a technician before informing her manager , who called police .

The man was charged with " aggravated menacing , causing fear of harm " .
And even though he has a concealed weapons permit , could face charges for the gun because he did n't tell the deputy on the scene that he had it .
Now that 's some iPhone rage .

October 29 , 2009 -- " We have no other word but crisis to describe it , really .
It 's very different than the economic crisis that we are now in , in the sense that even a very , very severe economic crisis , such as the one that has been present since late 2007 ... still is , in many ways , a cyclical event ...
These crises are periodic -- it 's part of the nature of capitalism ...
" But what we are talking about as the world ecological crisis is another kind of crisis .
We are not talking -- as some of the contrarians say , as some of the sceptics say – of something that is a cyclical event in earth history .
What we are talking about is a terminal crisis .
What the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is telling us , what ecologists are telling us , what scientists in general are telling us is that If we continue on present trends , if we continue to follow business as usual , that is follow the present economic path , and the present technological and social path with respect to the environment , then it will be a terminal crisis , in the sense that we will destroy most of the species on the planet , human civilisation , and ourselves perhaps as well .

Google Wave has arrived .
The real - time communication platform has been one of the hottest and most anticipated products in the tech and social media space for months .
Soon around 100,000 people will be messaging each other in one of Google 's most ambitious projects to date .
So what if you 're one of the lucky ones to get an invite , or just want to understand exactly how this new tool works ?
While we cover the basics in our Google Wave Guide and have explored its game - changing features , we have n't really written about exactly how to use Google Wave and how to navigate it .
So that 's exactly what we did .
While not comprehensive , our guide on getting started with Google Wave will help you quickly learn the interface and important keyboard commands that will open up the full potential of Wave .
Do n't forget to check out our extensive Google Wave coverage when you 're done for more tips and insight .
General Interface
The Google Wave interface is divided essentially into four boxes : Navigation , Contacts , Inbox , and your current Wave .
Here 's a rundown of each of these core pieces of Wave :
Navigation :
This is not your standard left - hand navigation bar .
Yes , it has similarities to Gmail , but navigating Wave is definitely a new experience .
Each of the items essentially filters your inbox for waves that fit what you 're looking for .
" Active " refers to waves that have new activity , " History " checks for old , archived waves , and " Settings " lets you manage things like your extensions .
You can also add custom searches ( i.e. waves that discuss your company ) and add folders .
Adding a wave to a folder is as simple as drag - and - drop .
Contacts :
Your contacts are more prominent in Wave .
That 's because you drag and drop them to add them to waves , rather than type in an email address or a username .
You can search through your contacts and manage them via your Google account .
It 's still a bit buggy - Wave will tell you some people do n't have accounts when they do - but overall it 's smooth .
Inbox :
The inbox in the middle of the Google Wave interface does n't work like an email inbox .
The key to navigating the inbox are search and search commands .
It 's the easiest way to filter different waves .
We have a list of key search commands below .
Wave Box :
This is the box on the right hand of Wave .
This is where conversations happen .
Add participants , discuss what you 'd like , and add multimedia through Google Wave gadgets and extensions ( for more on Wave Extensions , check out Google Wave Extensions : An Inside Look ) .
This is the pure overview of the interface .
However , if you want to learn more about the features and the terminology , we suggest checking out Google Wave : A Complete Guide .
Google also created a quick YouTube video tutorial of Wave , courtesy of Wave 's mascot , Dr. Wave :
Starting a Conversation
Getting a conversation started in Google Wave is rather easy - it 's understanding all of the available conversation features that 's difficult .
Let 's explore a few steps to get started with a new wave :
1. Click on the " New Wave " link .
This will start a new conversation .
2 . Drag and drop friends you 'd like to have join your wave from your contacts box into the top of the wave .
3 . Start typing .
Remember , Wave is different than email .
You can reply to messages as threaded conversations and , more importantly , you can edit the text of anyone in the conversation .
These options become available when you click on the downward facing arrow at the top of any message ( a blip ) within a wave .
Also note the top bar , with " Reply , " " Playback , " " Archive , " " Mute , " " Spam , " and " Read . "
While most of these are self - explanatory , the feature you should be using liberally is " playback . "
If you join a wave in progress , always start by playing back the wave to see how the conversation transpired .
Wave Search Commands
A big part of navigating through your Wave inbox are the search commands .
They help you find public waves , your archived messages , or just waves related to work .
Here are some of the most important commands to keep in mind :
is : read and is : unread :
This will help you find all of the waves you have or have not read .
is : active is the same as is : unread currently .
is : mute and is : unmute :
The same type of deal -
This helps you find conversations you may have muted or unmuted .
title :( keyword ) :
This command helps you find waves with a specific word in their titles .
caption :( keyword ) :
This helps you find waves with a keyword in the captions of attached images and files .
from :( address ) :
This command will help you find waves from specific people .
On the same token , from : me finds waves from you .
to :( address ) finds waves where it 's just you and the person you 're searching for .
past : ( date ) , previous : ( date ) , after : ( date ) , and before : ( date ) :
These four commands help you search for waves in time periods , based on days , weeks , months , and years .
Use " d " for day , " w " for week , " m " for month , and " y " for year .
So , if you want to find something from before 3 months ago , you 'd type " before : 3 m " .
Yes , it 's complicated .
has :
The has command will search for whether a wave has an attachment , a document , an image , or even a gadget ( has : gadget ) .
There are actually a lot more commands .
To read them all , we suggested checking out Google Wave 's advanced search terms list .
Wave Navigation
There are an abundance of keyboard shortcuts that make using Google Wave a more streamlined experience .
Thanks to a list first created by Google 's Greg Dalesandre in the development version of Google Wave , we can bring you a full list of keyboard shortcuts , which we 'll update periodically .
First , here are the commands for Wave Navigation :
Up / Down Arrows :
As you might expect , use the arrows to navigate messages .
Tab / Shift - tab : Same functionality as the Up / Down arrows ( outside of edit mode ) .
Home / End : Moves you to the first or last message .
Space :
Go to next unread message ( note : it does n't have to be within the same wave ) .
Left / Right Arrows : Switch focus between digest panel and wave panel .
Page Up / Down : Currently does n't work properly due to a bug .
Ctrl - Space : Marks all messages as read .
Messages in Wave
Enter : Replies to messages .
Your reply will appear just below the selected message .
If it 's the first reply , it will not be indented ( but otherwise it will be ) .
Ctrl -R : The same as enter .
Shift - Enter : Replies to messages at the end of a thread .
Replies of this nature appear at the bottom with the same indentation in almost all cases .
Highlight Text +
Enter : Creates an inline reply .
Your reply will be indented inside the current message .
Ctrl - E : Edit a message .
Ctrl - Enter ( while editing ) : Inserts an inline reply at the caret .
Text Editing
None of these commands will really come as a shock , but they 're still good to know .
Ctrl - B : Bolds text .
Ctrl - I : Italicizes text .
Ctrl - G : Adjust the color .
Ctrl - L : Currently links to another wave if you hightlight the text and put in the URL or Wave ID , but the keyboard shortcut will be changing soon according to Google .
Ctrl - C : Copies text .
Ctrl - X : Cuts text .
Ctrl - V : Pastes text .
Structural Formatting
Once again , not too many surprises here :
Ctrl- : Changes the current line to a different - sized heading - 1 is biggest , 4 is smallest .
Ctrl - 5 : Adds bullets .
Ctrl - 6 : Normalizes text / removes bullets and headings .
Does not remove italics , bold , or text edits .
Ctrl - 7 : Left alignment .
Ctrl - 8 : Right alignment .
Much , Much More to Come
Google Wave is far from a complete product .
They will add new features , tweak the interface , and change entire chunks of it based on user feedback and the data they gather from this initial release .
Because of that , we will continue to add to this guide and tweak it .
It 's also why we suggest staying tuned to our Google Wave coverage for the many updates that are coming .

[ Telegraph ]
Denise Tejada bought a house last month at the age of 20 , thanks in large part to a loan guaranteed by the Federal Housing Authority .
This story offers a dramatic demonstration that , despite the housing bubble causing the worst economic downturn in generations , the ideology of home ownership is alive and well in the United States and still being supported by the government .
Without question , Tejada 's loan is toxic -- to her and to the taxpayers who are backing the loan .
Her house cost $ 155,000 .
Tejada 's loan was apparently made on a micro- down payment of just 3.5 % , the minimum down payment to qualify for an FHA loan .
On top of this , however , she got an additional government backed loan to make improvements .
Her total loans amount to $ 183,0000 .
In short , she was immediately underwater on her new house .
The monthly payments on her debt amount to $ 1328 .
Her income is $ 2470 , leaving her with just $ 285 a week to live on .
She 's paying 54 % of her income to make the mortgage payments .
She earns that income by holding down one full time and two part time jobs .
Obviously , this woman has a strong work ethic .
But it also means her income is precarious .
With unemployment still rising , she obviously should be worried about losing one of her three jobs .
A loss of one of them would likely leave her unable to make the debt payments .
10 signs the next housing bubble is underway >>
Tejada appears to be using imaginary numbers about the value of her house .
She says that when she bought it , the house was just a “ box ” with no kitchen or bathroom .
Now it is " gorgeous " .
She claims the renovation has increased the value of her home from $ 155,000 to $ 255,000 .
" I bought my house for $ 155,000 .
And now , after all the fixing , after all the remodeling , my house is worth $ 255,000 .
So just within a month period , I made a $ 100,000 , " she tells Market Place 's Scott Jagow .
As far as we can tell , this is just mark - to - imagination valuation .
She does n't give any indication about how she arrived at the conclusion that she has made a $ 100,000 gain in just a month .
Even if her improvements had dramatically increased the value of the house beyond the cost of the improvements themselves , she would have to contend a declining housing market .
From last year to this year , the median price of homes sale in Oakland , California has declined 28 % .
Tejada sees her house as an investment rather than a home .
And she is planning on buying more homes , despite the fact that her income is already strained by her debt .
This three bedroom house is just her " first house " and is " a little too big for me . "
This is the opposite direction house buying traditionally moved in , with young people buying a small fixer - upper or renting and moving into larger homes as their incomes and family size increased .
Tejada has started big .
Tejada , a first generation immigrant from Guatemala , is n't going to college .
If that was ever the American dream , it is n't hers .
She 's going into home buying .
Her older brother also bought a house .
Indeed part of the reason she bought her house so young was that she wanted to beat her brother , who bought his house at the age of 21 .
She is very happy about the fact that her friends seem impressed that she owns a home .
" This is the kind of mentality that our dad pretty much embedded in us since we were 12 years old , " she says .
Her father bought a house shortly after moving to the United States .
Shortly after buying the home , the family started acquiring nicer things .
New cars , new televisions , that kind of thing .
When Tejada 's brother asked about where they were getting the money for these things , the father said it was all because of the house .
That sounds a lot like the father was using his house as an ATM , most likely borrowing from a home equity line of credit to purchase consumer goods .
As the value of the house increased during the housing bubble , the family seemed to be getting richer .
Most likely , they were simply acquiring more debt .
This way of thinking has been passed on to Tejada - - who believes she made $ 100,000 in a month .
The Tejada family obviously has a very strong worth ethic and a savings ethic as well .
Unfortunately , something appears to have gone haywire when it comes to homes .
The children were encouraged to work and save but then to spend their savings on homes and to be completely unafraid of massive amounts of debt .
This is , in short , a living breathing example of the ideology of home ownership at work .
We wish Tejada nothing but the best of luck .
We hope she really can keep paying her mortgages and that she somehow makes money on her house .
But it is outrageous that the FHA is guaranteeing her loans , putting the taxpayer on the hook for her precarious financial situation .
Here 's a video of Tejada and her brother discussing her house .
Also , click here for Market Place 's interview with Tejada .
I do n't for a minute buy cannabis " fatalities " .
It 's impossible to kill yourself with pot .
The press reports " cannabis - related " deaths which is surreal .
David McCandless , who devised the graph and runs Informationisbeautiful , adds :
There has never been a single documented case of fatal cannabis overdose .
Also , the government 's own figures do n't tally .
While drug figures from the Office Of National Statistics register 19 cannabis related deaths , the mortality stats from the same office log only 1 death .
But even granted that , you can see how the media irrationally focuses on what is n't the biggest problem by any objective assessment .
And this focus can distort public policy .
What would this graphic look like if the death - rate were assessed per user of each drug ?
Marijuana would appear as less toxic than aspirin .

TUSCALOOSA , Ala . –
He was n’t even the most ballyhooed member of Alabama ’s celebrated freshman class a year ago .
But early on , Alabama ’s Nick Saban knew what he had in Mark Ingram .
I remember asking Saban last August about freshmen who had caught his attention during the first part of preseason camp .
One of the first names out of his mouth was Ingram .
I was surprised at the time .
The only surprise now is how Ingram has n’t been a hotter commodity in the Heisman Trophy race .
That ’s about to change .
The 5 - 10 , 212 - pound sophomore did everything but strike the pose Saturday night in No. 2 - ranked Alabama ’s 20 - 6 win over No. 22 - ranked South Carolina .
And , really , Ingram did n’t need to strike the pose .
He was too busy running over , through and around South Carolina defenders on his way to a Bryant - Denny Stadium record 246 yards rushing on 24 carries .
If there ’s a better runner after contact in the country , I want to see him .
So do his teammates after watching him grind out more than 100 of his yards after the initial hit .
For that matter , they ’re not sure there ’s a better runner – period .
“ I would n’t trade him for anybody , ” Alabama quarterback Greg McElroy said .
“ I think he ’s the best running back in the country for what we ask him to do . ”
Only UTEP ’s Donald Buckram has rushed for more yards in a game this season in the FBS ranks .
Buckram had 262 yards against Houston on Oct. 3 .
Ingram ’s 246 yards marked the third highest single - game rushing total in Alabama history .
Shaun Alexander had 291 yards against LSU in 1996 , and Bobby Humphrey had 284 yards against Mississippi State in 1986 .
In seven games this season , Ingram now has 905 rushing yards and 11 total touchdowns , eight rushing and three receiving .
And in 304 career touches at Alabama , he ’s never lost a fumble .
He also played through some pretty intense pain Saturday .
He took a blow to his left knee in the first half when one of the South Carolina defenders cut him , but Ingram was only out for a few plays .
“ He ran with tremendous passion and heart , ” Alabama coach Nick Saban said .
“ If we had a whole team of guys who played like that , they sky would be the limit . ”
In the Crimson Tide ’s clinching drive , after having very little success throwing the ball all game , they went to a little backyard football and just started snapping the ball directly to Ingram .
Five times , he ran out of the Wildcat formation .
The only time he did n’t was the pitchout for the 4 - yard touchdown .
“ You never want to let the first man bring you down , ” Ingram said .
“ I try and run like that every time I get the ball .
There ’s not a strategy to it .
You just have to run hard and run physical . ”
If he keeps it up , he just may be running to a date with the Heisman Trophy ceremony in New York City .
In a year when the favorites all seem to be falling by the wayside , why not a guy like Ingram who was n’t even on the Heisman Trophy radar when the season began ?
“ Mark did as fine a job today as anybody I ’ve ever been around , and that includes Ricky Williams , Ronnie Brown and some other really good ones , ” Saban said .
“ He was fantastic . ”
The original Golf lived on in South Africa for 25 years , but production is ending this year .
VeeDub fans covet Mk1s , so it 's no surprise they were able to produce more than 500,000 of them for South Africa .

Blogging on App Engine , part 8 : PubSubHubbub
Posted by Nick Johnson | Filed under tech , app- engine , coding , bloggart
This is part of a series of articles on writing a blogging system on App Engine .
An overview of what we 're building is here .
Notice anything different ?
That 's right , this blog has now been migrated to Bloggart - after all , if I wo n't run it , why should I expect anyone else to ? ;)
Migrating comments to Disqus
In the previous post , I promised I 'd cover migrating comments in today 's post .
Unfortunately , doing so proved to be both more complicated and less interesting than anticipated , so I 'm going to instead provide an overview of the required steps .
If you 're really determined to see all the nitty - gritty , you can examine the change yourself .
Import of comments to disqus is through the disqus API .
The API uses a straightforward RESTful model , with requests URL - encoded as either GET or POST requests , and responses returned as JSON strings .
To make our lives easier , we 'll define a straightforward wrapper function to make Disqus API calls :
def disqus_request ( method , request_type=urlfetch .GET , ** kwargs ) : kwargs [' api_version ' ] = ' 1.1 ' if request_type == urlfetch .
GET : url = " http://disqus.com/api/%s?%s " % ( method , urllib.urlencode( kwargs ) ) payload =
None else : url = " http://disqus.com/api/%s/ " % ( method , ) payload = urllib.urlencode( kwargs ) response = urlfetch.fetch(url , payload , method=request_type ) if response.status_code != 200 : raise Exception ( " Invalid status code " , response.status_code , response.content ) result = simplejson.loads(response.content ) if not result [ ' succeeded ' ] : raise Exception ( " RPC did not succeed " , result ) return result
This function takes the method name , optionally the type ( GET or POST ) and any number of keyword arguments .
It converts the arguments to a URL - encoded string , uses the urlfetch API to send the request , then decodes and returns the result .
Here 's an example of using this function to call ' get_forum_list ' :
forums = disqus_request (' get_forum_list ' , user_api_key=disqus_user_key )
The API documentation is n't the most complete , so I 'll go over the required steps to import comments here :
Obtain your user API key Call get_forum_list to obtain a list of forums you own .
Locate the forum you want to import entries for by finding the entry with the correct ' shortname ' field .
Call get_forum_api_key with the user key and forum ID to get the forum 's API key .
For each post you want to import comments for : Call thread_by_identifier to get a unique identifier for a thread .
Call update_thread to set the URL for the thread just created .
For each comment , call create_post , supplying the forum API key , thread id , post data , and optional parent post ID .
PubSubHubbub support
As you 've probably heard by now , the cool new kid on the block is PubSubHubbub , a protocol for instant ' push ' updating of Atom feeds .
Since we naturally do n't want to be left behind , we 're going to be implementing PubSubHubbub ( ' hubbub ' for short ) support on Bloggart .
Fortunately , the hubbub protocol puts an emphasis on making things easy to implement , especially for the publisher .
The first thing we need to do is add a configuration option for enabling hubbub support , and setting the hub URL to use .
Add the following to the end of config.py :
# If you want to use PubSubHubbub , supply the hub URL to use here .
hubbub_hub_url = ' http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/'
The next thing we need to do is announce that we support hubbub , by adding a link tag to our atom feed .
Add this to themes / default / atom.xml after the existing link tags :
< link rel= " hub " href= " {{config.hubbub_hub_url}} " />
Finally , we need to notify the hub whenever we publish or update an item .
Open up generators.py and make the following changes ( highlighted in yellow ) to AtomContentGenerator :
@classmethod def generate_resource ( cls , post , resource ) : import models q = models .
BlogPost.all( ) .order ( '- updated ' ) posts = q.fetch ( 10 ) template_vals = { ' posts ' : posts , } rendered = utils.render_template ( " atom.xml " , template_vals ) static.set ('/feeds/atom.xml ' , rendered , ' application /atom+xml ; charset=utf - 8 ' ) if config.hubbub_hub_url : cls.send_hubbub_ping(config.hubbub_hub_url ) @classmethod def send_hubbub_ping(cls , hub_url ) : data = urllib.urlencode({ ' hub.url ' : ' http://%s/feeds/atom.xml ' % ( config.host , ) , ' hub.mode ' : ' publish ' , } ) response = urlfetch .
fetch ( hub_url , data , urlfetch .
POST ) if response.status_code / 100 != 2 : raise Exception ( " Hub ping failed " , response.status_code , response.content )
That 's all that 's required .
Whenever we update our Atom feed , we ping the hub , which will fetch the feed and send the modified parts to any subscribers .
Easy !
You can view the blog - so - far at http://bloggart-demo.appspot.com/, and see the code for this stage here .
In the next post , we 'll handle sitemap support , and discuss the blog - so - far , and where to go next .

A recent article in the New York Times reported that the military has become frustrated with President Barack Obama because he hasnt quickly decided to risk more of their lives in an Afghan war that is likely to be unwinnable .
In a post - World War II world that has featured a non-traditional militarized foreign policy of profligate interventions into the affairs of other nations , the U.S. military and its opinion have acquired great prestige and are accorded hushed reverence in American society .
The military and flag are worshiped as never before .
But is this really patriotism ?
The nations founders would roll over in their graves at what patriotism has become .
After their bad experience with British colonial military abuses and seeing European citizens paying with blood and treasure for the frequent wars of their monarchs , the founders feared standing armies for undermining liberty .
The U.S. Constitution rejected European militarism in favor of tight congressional controls over the employment , organization , and funding of the U.S. armed forces .
Since World War II , those controls such as congressional declarations of war have been severely eroded .
And the American public , still feeling guilty over the admittedly terrible treatment of returning draftees from the Vietnam War , has retained its awe of the now voluntary military as an institution , even as it has soured on the Iraq and Afghan Wars .
Even while fighting two unpopular wars , the public has supported huge defense budgets all out of proportion to what is needed to defend the country .
Is this healthy for a republic ?
The politically incorrect answer to this question is a resounding no !
Being genuinely patriotic means supporting the countrys society and culture .
Excessive reverence for the U.S. government , military , and flag is merely nationalism and is similar to episodes in Russia , Germany , and Japan in the last century .
And slathering the military with too many resources tempts politicos , such as George W. Bush and Madeleine Albright , to dream up unneeded military adventures overseas , which many times end in disaster .
True American patriotism , following in the tradition of the founding , rejects militarism without rejecting an appropriate role for the military .
According to the Constitution , the active military should provide for the common defense and nothing more .
This limited role should rule out the military being used to invade other nations for ostensibly lofty purposes .
To be even more politically incorrect , on 9/11 , the U.S. military failed in this primary mission .
No one was fired over this tragic fiasco .
Since then , the military has been used to make things worse and actually undermine U.S. security .
Armchair quasi- patriots unfortunately , most of the country dont like to acknowledge what triggers al - Qaedas heinous attacks in the first place : U.S. interventions in Islamic countries .
In both the counterproductive Afghan and Iraq invasions and occupations , the military made huge mistakes before having to relearn counterinsurgency warfare tactics purposefully forgotten in the wake of its debacle in Vietnam .
Does repeated incompetence deserve veneration ?
One might then say so much for the military organization and its leaders , but shouldnt we still have reverence for the frontline soldier who risks his or her life for our freedom ?
Unfortunately , military personnel like the general public from which they comeare under the same aforementioned delusion about what patriotism  should be .
One could argue that war is sometimes necessary for defense although the current U.S. offensive - defensive strategy is unneeded , unconstitutional , and counterproductive but war rarely leads to increased freedom , as the founders knew .
The civil liberties erosion under the war on terror is illustrative .
Also , military personnel should know , or take the time to learn if they dont , that the U.S. has been the most aggressive country on the planet during the Cold War and since in terms of the number of foreign military interventions .
Therefore , a new patriotism is needed .
As a start , let s stop worshiping the military and flag and bring back the founders  old - fashioned respect for liberty and the Constitution .

Toronto is home to some pretty strange houses and front lawns .
And living around Dupont and Christie , I 've had a chance to take a look at quite a number of them , clustered as they are in this area .
I 've often wondered , however , where else I could find such quirky architecture and / or laugh - inducing landscaping .
Well , by combining the resource ( read distraction ) that is Google Street View with the recommendations of blogTO 's followers on Twitter , my curiosity has been mostly satisfied .
I 've just taken a virtual tour of some of the weirdest properties in the city , and I thought I 'd share the experience .
I do n't know the stories behind most of these " projects , " but a little digging revealed some interesting information about the ones in my neighbourhod .
The infamous white elephant on Yarmouth Rd. , for instance , was designed by Matt Donovan as part of his thesis project at OCAD , entitled " An Elephant in the Room . "
The sculpture was then given to James Lawson , a resident on the street .
Although I 'm constantly amazed that other residents have n't battled to have the elephant " put to rest , " I have to say that having walked by it hundreds of times , it 's really grown on me .
I can't imagine the street without it .
Just around the corner to the west is another oddity .
Known as the " House of Parashos , " when I first moved into the area , I thought that it might be an oddly placed Greek restaurant .
As it turns out , the house is resident Andy Parashos 's ode to Greece , and is the result of years of work .

Heading back toward the east , I was anxious to see the Street View capture of 473 Clinton St. , a property covered with pool cues and other woodworks .
Unfortunately , the foliage of the trees on the property covers much of homeowner Albino Carreira 's work .
For a closer look , check here .

Those unfamiliar with Mr. Carreira 's house , might just have seen his minivan around town .
Covered in figurines of all kinds , the white Plymouth Voyager resembles something of a moving art installation .
Parked just up the street from Carreira 's home on the day Google did its sweep , it 's thankfully unobstructed and easy to zoom in on .
Believe it or not , all three of the above properties were the subject of an art exhibit curated by Duncan Farnan at the Harbourfront Centre a few years ago .

Moving away from my own area , my information about these oddball houses is less researched .
I 've heard that the cubes on Sumach St. are actually an occupied home , the architectural design of which was inspired by similar abodes throughout Rotterdam , but I 've yet to confirm this .
View Larger Map
The " doll house " at 44 Bertmount Ave. is also pretty fascinating , if not from an architectural standpoint (! ) .
View Larger Map
Less gaudy , but still strange is 157 Coxwell Ave .
View Larger Map
199 Gladstone Ave. is odd in a subtle sort of way .
View Larger Map
The wacky homes at Leslie St. and Bond Ave. may have been around for a decade or so , but never cease to look strange to me .
Rumour has it that an architect built the residences to live in himself ( herself ? ) , but perhaps someone out there has more details or accurate information .
View Larger Map
It 's easy to make fun of these places , but at the end of the day , I firmly believe that they add an intriguing element to this city that it desperately needs .
Thanks to our loyal followers on Twitter for so many good suggestions .
And , of course , if you know of other wacky properties around town , leave a comment and I 'll try to add to the post !

Nidal Hasan , the Army psychiatrist accused of killing 13 at the Fort Hood , Texas , Army base , communicated 10 to 20 times with a radical Islamic cleric in Yemen who on Monday called Maj .
Hasan a " hero " and criticized U.S. Muslim groups that condemned the killing spree .

Why Afghans Dig Empire Graveyards Editor ’s Note : Many Americans – and especially U.S. media pundits – view the world through a self - absorbed nearsightedness , acting as if the histories of countries only began when they did something that attracted U.S. attention .
In ancient lands like Iraq and Afghanistan , this American myopia has become very dangerous , by ignoring how and why these countries have resisted past instances of foreign imperialism , as Nicolas J S Davies notes in this guest article : Afghanistan is known as the " graveyard of empires . "
But just why do empires keep sending thousands of their young people to die in Afghanistan ?
Email
Printer friendly American blood - letting in Afghanistan is generally explained in terms of the Taliban and al - Qaeda , but it was the earlier U.S. involvement in Afghanistan ( in the 1980s ) that led to the emergence of these movements in the first place , not the other way around .
Since Sept. 11 , 2001 , the U.S. government has used al - Qaeda ’s terrorist attacks to justify much more than simply retaliation for 9/11 or even prevention of some future recurrence of 9/11 .
The attacks have served as an excuse for U.S. invasions and occupations ( including Iraq which had nothing to do with 9/11 ) , flagrant war crimes ( including torture ) , and the largest U.S. military budget since World War II .
To accomplish this , the government has persuaded many Americans that their country faces a unique and unprecedented threat that justifies these extreme measures , not least the savage , eight - year war in Afghanistan .
A Dutch friend of mine tried to have a rational conversation with an American co-worker about 9/11 and the so - called “ war on terror , ” and was told , " You can't possibly understand .
Your country has never been attacked like this . "
The puzzled Dutch woman had to ask , " Did you never hear anything about the Second World War ? "
Of course , it is precisely the far greater dangers that people in other countries have faced in the past that enable them to put the threat of terrorism in perspective .
Paradoxically , it is the relative safety of the United States that makes Americans so vulnerable to panic and propaganda when faced with such a limited threat .
In fact , the response of the U.S. government to the terrorist attacks has been exactly as Osama bin Laden and his colleagues intended .
They did not expect to defeat the United States by knocking down a few buildings .
Nor were they motivated by some irrational hatred of freedom .
Rather the attacks were designed to provoke a reaction that would expose the hypocrisy of the United States , laying bare the hard iron fist of militarism and violence within the soft velvet glove of Hollywood and soda - pop .
The explicit goal was to goad the American empire into using its vast arsenal of destructive weapons in ways that would gradually undermine its own economic and military power .
Bin Laden and his second - in - command Ayman al - Zawahiri understood so much better than America ’s deluded leaders that this would be a war the United States could not win .
But neither the opportunism nor the hypocrisy of U.S. policy explain why American soldiers are fighting , killing and dying in Afghanistan of all places .
While Americans think of the war in terms of 9/11 and terrorism , Afghans are not afflicted with such a myopic view .
They see the war in the context of a much longer history that is shaped by their country 's mountainous geography and strategic location between Iran to the west , Russia to the north and India and Pakistan to the south and east - and of their own ability to defend it against the world 's greatest empires .
Or , as noted in the resignation letter of Matthew Hoh , an American diplomat who resigned in protest from his post in Afghanistan last September : " I have observed that the bulk of the insurgency fights not for the white banner of the Taliban , but rather against the presence of foreign soldiers and taxes imposed by an unrepresentative government in Kabul .
The United States military presence in Afghanistan greatly contributes to the legitimacy and strategic message of the Pashtun insurgency . "
Unlike Destroyer
At first glance , Afghanistan seems an unlikely destroyer of empires .
My friend Gregg spent seven years there in the 1970s , and he encountered nothing but the legendary hospitality of the Pashtun tribes - people .
That 's why he stayed for seven years .
But then Gregg was a respectful traveler fleeing the violence of his native Northern Ireland , not a soldier in an occupying army .
Conventional military powers consistently underestimate the Afghans until they are over - committed and faced with humiliation .
The first modern empire brought down by the Afghans was the 200 - year - old Safavid Empire of Persia .
Local Pashtun tribes - people rose up in rebellion under Mirwais Khan Hotak in 1706 and expelled Persia from Western Afghanistan .
Mirwais 's son , Mir Mahmud Hotaki , continued the war and sacked the splendid Persian capital of Isfahan in 1722 .
The Safavid dynasty was already economically weak , as Dutch merchant ships were sailing away with the bulk of regional trade from its formerly lucrative trade - routes .
But the Afghans delivered the coup de grace .
In the early 19th century , as the Russian Empire expanded in the Caucasus and Central Asia , a weakened Persia gradually lost territory .
The British came to see Persia as a Russian puppet and adopted a " forward policy , " to keep Afghanistan as a buffer between British India and the expanding Russian Empire .
This effectively made Herat in Western Afghanistan the new outer frontier of the British Empire that Britain was committed to keeping out of the hands of Russia and Persia .
A Persian army besieged Herat for 280 days in 1837 - 1838 .
The failure of the siege exposed the weakness of Persia , which continued to disintegrate .
But it also highlighted the vulnerability of Afghanistan , which was ruled at the time by different tribal leaders in Herat , Kandahar and Kabul , following the collapse of the Durrani dynasty .
So the British and their Sikh allies from the Punjab marched into Afghanistan to restore the former Amir of Afghanistan , Shah Shuja , who had been deposed and exiled in 1809 .
This was the so - called First Afghan War .
In a parallel with the present crisis , the British plan was to stay only as long as necessary to leave Shah Shuja in firm control of the country , but this proved to be impossible .
He effectively ruled only Kabul , where he owed his position to the presence of British and Indian troops and officials .
The longer the British stayed the more they alienated the Afghans .
British officials brought their families to Kabul and established a small colony , complete with soirees and cricket matches .
Their expenditures caused runaway inflation , which alienated the merchant class of Kabul , and a riot in Kabul in November 1841 soon grew into a full - blown rebellion against British occupation .
Mohammed Akbar Khan , the son of Dost Mohammed , the leader the British had deposed in Kabul , came down from the mountains to lead the rebellion .
The Afghans killed the British commander General MacNaghten , dragged his body through the streets of Kabul and put it on display it in the bazaar .
His deputy General Elphinstone negotiated with Akbar Khan for safe passage to Jalalabad for occupation officials and their families .
Death Trap Seven hundred British troops , 3,800 Indian troops and 12,000 civilians set out for Jalajabad , 90 miles away , on Jan. 6 , 1842 .
At every pass through the mountains they were greeted by Afghan tribesmen waiting in ambush .
They were all massacred or they froze to death long before they could reach Jalalabad .
The sole survivor , assistant surgeon William Brydon , rode into Jalalabad with a piece of his skull sheared off by a sword after being rescued by an Afghan shepherd .
Asked for news of the British army from Kabul , he replied " I am the army " .
The British sent another expedition to rescue some prisoners and take revenge on the people of Kabul , but they abandoned the effort to occupy or control Afghanistan .
The Afghans had established their independence , and neither Britain , Russia nor Persia occupied Afghan territory for the next 36 years .
Mohammed Akbar Khan died , but Dost Mohammed and his other sons united Afghanistan and established mutually respectful relations with the British .
Ironically , a truly independent Afghanistan served as a very effective buffer between the British and Russian Empires , and the British helped the Afghans to repel more Persian attacks on Herat in 1852 and 1856 .
The Second Afghan war began after Sher Ali Khan , Dost Mohammed 's third son , accepted a Russian diplomatic mission to Kabul in 1878 but then rebuffed a British one .
This resurrected the recurring specter of British insecurity over Afghanistan .
Britain invaded again and occupied much of the country .
Sher Ali died in February 1879 and the British persuaded his son Mohammad Yaqub Khan to sign the Treaty of Gandamak , which ceded Quetta and the Khyber Pass to Britain and gave Britain control over Afghan foreign policy in exchange for financial support .
The British army withdrew , but it left behind a diplomatic mission in Kabul .
A few months later , the remaining British officials were all killed during a local rebellion .
The British invaded again .
After 10 months of savage fighting , they defeated an Afghan army under Yaqub 's brother Ayub Khan at Kandahar .
The British finally withdrew , but this time they did not leave a diplomatic mission behind in Kabul to be killed !
Afghanistan became fully independent from Britain as a result of the Third Afghan War in 1919 , which was an Afghan invasion of the North West Frontier province of British India .
Existential Concerns
Throughout the 20th century , Afghanistan 's people confronted the same existential questions as people in other non-Western countries .
What aspects of modern Western technology and culture could they adopt without losing what they valued in their own way of life ?
As elsewhere , different classes within Afghan society answered this question according to their own interests , and the resulting divisions left Afghanistan vulnerable to opportunistic exploitation and intervention by foreign powers , including Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , the Soviet Union and the United States .
Amanullah Khan , the King of Afghanistan who won independence from Britain in 1919 , admired the modernist regime of Kemal Ataturk in Turkey .
He mandated compulsory elementary education , opened co-educational schools and formally abolished the burqa for women .
But conservative tribal and religious leaders rebelled , and forced him to abdicate in 1929 .
The last King of Afghanistan , Zahir Shah , ruled for 40 years ( 1933 - 1973 ) by pursuing a more gradual approach to modernization .
Afghanistan was still in the same position geographically , but the world around it had changed .
Instead of being sandwiched between the Russian and British Empires , it was now wedged between the Soviet Union and independent Pakistan .
Mohammed Daoud Khan , the King 's cousin , was his prime minister from 1953 until 1963 .
Daoud envisioned a reunification of the Pashtun territories on either side of the British colonial border between Afghanistan and Pakistan .
After this initiative was rebuffed by Pakistan , Daoud increasingly turned northward to the U.S.S.R. for both military and development aid .
In 1973 , Daoud seized power from his cousin , but , instead of declaring himself King , he abolished the monarchy and became Afghanistan 's first President .
He began by renewing Afghanistan 's relationship with the U.S.S.R. and used Soviet aid to build up the Afghan army .
But he soon broke with his Marxist allies in the Peoples Democratic Party of Afghanistan ( PDPA ) , distanced Afghanistan from the Soviet Union , and began to improve relations with Pakistan , Egypt and other Western - oriented Muslim countries .
In 1978 , a leading PDPA politician was murdered , leading the other PDPA leaders to believe that Daoud was planning to have them all killed .
They staged a coup , killed Daoud and his family and formed the new Democratic Republic of Afghanistan .
The Marxists launched a radical secular reform program , banning burqas and forced marriages , closing mosques , redistributing land and abolishing farmers ' debts .
Anehita Ratebzad , a female member of the Revolutionary Council , wrote in a New Kabul Times editorial , " Privileges which women , by right , must have are equal education , job security , health services , and free time to rear a healthy generation for building the future of the country ...
Educating and enlightening women is now the subject of close government attention . ”
The U.S.S.R. quickly provided $ 1.2 billion to build roads , schools , hospitals and wells .
The relatively small urban population welcomed the reforms and new development , but the interests of rural landowners and tribal and religious leaders were seriously threatened and they began to fund and support mujahedeen to commit terrorism and resist government forces .
A New Great Game Seeing Afghanistan as a new front in the Cold War , the U.S. , Pakistani and Saudi governments began to provide funds , training and weapons to the mujahedeen .
A new version of the " great game " was under way .
For the Soviets , Afghanistan had lost none of its value since the 19th century .
Their empire extended from Europe to Siberia , but nowhere did it reach southward to warm - water ports and the sea-routes to South Asia and Africa .
The United States now controlled those sea-lanes and had the same interest as Britain in the 19th century in keeping a buffer between the Russians and the ports of Pakistan .
The establishment of a Soviet client state in Afghanistan offered the U.S.S.R. the tantalizing promise of fulfilling historic ambitions .
In funding , supplying , supporting and training the mujahedeen , U.S. policy - makers believed they had found a low - cost means to neutralize a serious geostrategic challenge .
U.S. President Jimmy Carter and his Soviet counterpart Leonid Brezhnev began this new " great game " as a proxy war , to be fought mainly by Afghans against other Afghans .
But the conflict escalated dramatically after Ronald Reagan came to power in 1981 .
Before withdrawing in 1989 , Soviet forces lost 13,000 lives , while Afghan dead were estimated at about one million .
Even after the Soviet departure , both Moscow and Washington continued supplying their client Afghan armies .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Why Afghanistan Really Fell Apart . ” ]
During the period , both the United States and the Soviet Union became engaged in Afghanistan because they had important strategic interests at stake , long before the emergence of the Taliban or Al Qaeda .
Since the end of the Cold War , the two main thrusts of U.S. foreign policy have been to impose military control over every part of the world where oil is produced or shipped ; and to encircle Russia with a ring of U.S. allies and military bases from Poland to Georgia to Central Asia .
Afghanistan 's position between Iran , Central Asia and Pakistan makes it a critical part of the pipeline map , potentially supplying Pakistan and India with oil and gas from Western operations in the Caspian Sea via the projected Unocal ( now Chevron ) pipeline through Afghanistan .
A strategically - located Afghanistan – allied with the United States and permitting American bases – would add an important link in the military encirclement of Russia , China and Iran .
On the other hand , if Afghanistan were aligned with Russia , it could equally well serve as a route for a pipeline to transport Russian oil and gas to Pakistan and beyond , and place Russian military or intelligence bases on the borders of Pakistan and Iran .
The U.S. interest in denying the Russians a pipeline route to the Arabian Sea and a client state on the border of Pakistan corresponds closely to Britain 's fears of Russian expansion into Afghanistan in the 19th century .
Equally frightening from a U.S. point of view , even an independent Afghanistan that was free from U.S. or Russian influence could link Iran to China via yet another pipeline route .
Fear of Russia
It was fear of Russian ambitions that led Britain to keep intervening in Afghanistan in the 19th century , more than any ambitions of its own to rule this unconquerable country .
The United States is now reluctant to withdraw from Afghanistan because of similar fears , that Russia and / or Iran will move in to fill the vacuum , consolidating their dominant roles in the region , gaining extraordinarily valuable strategic and commercial assets and excluding U.S. interests .
But as in the mid-19th century , a genuinely independent Afghanistan could actually be a stable and effective buffer between the great powers .
As the Maliki government in Iraq has gradually slipped the American leash , it has awarded oil contracts to Russian , Chinese and South Korean companies as well as to Western ones , and a future Afghan government could ultimately do likewise , playing suitors for pipeline deals off against each other in the traditional fashion .
In Iraq , Western oil companies have welcomed partnerships with Asian companies that can supply cheaper labor and equipment and are not tainted by a role in the invasion and destruction of the country .
In fact , as commerce of all kinds has begun to flow again in Iraq , the United States has been delivered a powerful message that aggression and military occupation do not pay .
Total Iraqi imports grew from $ 25.7 billion in 2007 to $ 43.5 billion in 2008 .
But even as other countries ' trade with Iraq has grown , exports from the United States to Iraq have remained flat at a meager $ 2 billion per year , most of that stemming from existing contracts with the U.S. - backed government .
By contrast , Turkey , which refused to support the U.S. invasion , has become one of Iraq 's largest trading partners , with exports of $ 10 billion to Iraq in 2008 .
At a recent trade fair in Baghdad , an Iraqi executive explained that his construction company preferred to do business with Turkish firms because costs were lower and the Turks " are not an occupier . "
Other countries that opposed the invasion , in particular Iran , France and Brazil , have likewise become major trading partners .
On condition of anonymity , a European ambassador to Baghdad told the New York Times that his country 's business relations with Iraq improved greatly once it withdrew its troops .
" Being considered an occupier handicapped us extremely , " he said .
" The farther we are away from that , the more our companies can be accepted on their own merits . "
In some of the largest government contracts awarded since the invasion , the Iraqi transportation ministry recently awarded $ 30 billion to rebuild Iraq 's railroads to a combination of British , Italian and Czech companies .
And the Russian company RusAir has won an exclusive air cargo contract that has forced FedEx to terminate its operations in Iraq .
The Afghan Dilemma
As in other parts of the world , the U.S. effort to control events by the threat and use of military force is the central obstacle to a peaceful resolution for Afghanistan .
The resurgence of the Taliban and other fighting forces in Afghanistan since 2006 can be directly traced to a massive escalation of U.S. air - strikes that year , even as numbers of U.S. casualties remained flat .
Only 98 American troops were killed in Afghanistan in 2006 , one less than the 99 killed in 2005 .
And yet the number of air - strikes exploded from 176 in 2005 to 1,770 in 2006 , a ten - fold increase .
The flat casualty figures make it clear that this was an escalation initiated by U.S. forces , not by the Afghan resistance .
The year 2007 saw a further escalation to 2,926 air - strikes .
The successful response of the Afghan resistance to the American escalation was entirely predictable , but it appears to have surprised U.S. planners .
As in Iraq , the U.S. reacted to the failure of its puppet government to establish any legitimacy or control over most of the country with a massive escalation of military force , launching a desperate and bloody campaign to bomb and terrorize the population into submission .
This brutal escalation was an abysmal failure , leading directly to the brink of defeat , where U.S. forces now find themselves .
The so - called " surge " in Iraq provided cover for a similar escalation of aerial bombardment , from 229 air - strikes in 2006 to 1,119 in 2007 , and 110 per month through most of 2008 .
In Afghanistan as in Iraq ( and Vietnam ) , despite endless lip - service to phrases like " winning hearts and minds " and " clear , hold and build , " American military strategists cling to the core belief that their virtually unlimited capacity for violence can ultimately carry the day if enough legal and political constraints are removed .
Instead , the failures of U.S. military force and the success of " Anti-Coalition Forces " everywhere have confirmed Richard Barnet 's Vietnam - era judgment that , " at the very moment the number one nation has perfected the science of killing , it has become an impractical instrument of political domination . "
The United States military budget is higher than at any time since the Second World War because U.S. officials now regard more of the world as critical to U.S. interests than ever before and are determined to militarily control all of it .
Fortunately for people everywhere , this policy , if it even deserves to be called one , is neither realistic nor economically sustainable .
But the whole world faces a critical period of transition as the U.S. military - industrial complex wrestles with the impossible challenge of an unconquerable world , experimenting with new weapons and strategies at the expense of countless lives and squandering resources that could otherwise be used to solve real problems .
Gabriel Kolko has been writing for decades about the failure of U.S. foreign policy to define its interests in a way that leads to achievable or manageable goals .
Instead of defining and prioritizing its interests like any other country , the United States wreaks havoc in international affairs by clinging to virtually unlimited ambitions that it pursues on an opportunistic basis , with no regard for the impact on billions of human beings or the future of the world .
This has resulted in gigantic military budgets and a long series of unwinnable wars that the United States should never have embarked on , even from the amoral " realist " point of view that its deluded strategists aspire to .
Collapsing Empires
Afghans believe that it was they who brought down the Safavids and the Soviets .
While the Afghans definitely did their part , the forces that led to the collapse of those empires were really much closer to home in both cases .
The real graveyard of the Soviet empire lay in the Kremlin , where absolute power insulated its leaders from the forces at work in the real world beyond its walls .
The Afghan war was only one of many causes of discontent and dissolution within the Soviet political and economic system .
A quiet underground movement of non-violent popular opposition grew steadily beneath the surface until , in defiance of all conventional wisdom , it burst through into the light of day and the U.S.S.R. was quite suddenly dissolved .
The American people now face a similar crisis .
It should be no surprise that a predatory political and economic system that wo n't provide healthcare , public services or economic opportunity to its own people is also resorting to war and militarism in a desperate effort to feed its insatiable appetite for growth and profit .
Since the 1970s , America 's leaders have consolidated their political and economic power into effective monopolies .
Most industries are dominated by two or three huge firms , and the political system is controlled by a similar duopoly .
Research on economic competition has established that such near - monopolies take on many of the characteristics of actual monopolies , stifling innovation and competition , destroying smaller businesses , exploiting employees , building inefficient bureaucracies and spending more on marketing than on research and development .
The U.S. health insurance industry employs 30 times as many administrative staff as it did in 1970 .
American firms spend $ 290 billion per year on advertising , almost $ 1,000 for every person in the country .
And corporate control of politics has systematically dismantled every mechanism that could restore effective management or halt the system 's relentless drive to devour everything including itself .
Looking for solutions from any of the leaders promoted by such a dysfunctional system is pure folly .
However , by learning from the example of popular movements in other countries throughout history , ordinary people in the United States can organize politically to elect very different people to public office and to stimulate mass public opposition to war , militarism and corporate politics .
It is the policy of the United States , not that of Afghanistan , that is filling the graveyards , and the great game that can stop the funerals will not be played out in Afghanistan but in Washington and in local communities all over the United States as Americans begin to organize for a post- imperial , post - corporate and more democratic future .

Defying the ' fatwa ' issued by Jamiat - Ulama - e - Hind against rendition of Vande Mataram , a group of Muslims led by a clergyman joined people from other communities in singing the national song in front of a mosque here .
BETUL ( MP ) : Defying the ' fatwa ' issued by Jamiat - Ulama - e - Hind against rendition of Vande Mataram , a group of Muslims led by a clergyman joined people from other communities in singing the national song in front of a mosque here .
A large number of people from a cross section of the society collected in front of the Jama Masjid at Betul Bazar at the invitation of its Imam Hafiz Abdul Razique and recited the song yesterday .
The event was organised by " Rukmani Balaji Mandir " , its founder Sam Verma , an NRI , said .
After singing the national song at the temple , a rally acclaiming " Bharat Mata " was taken out and when it was proceeding towards the Bazar Chowk , Razique requested them to sing " Vande Mataram " in front of the Mosque .
Several members of the minority community joined in .
" It is not against Islam to sing Vande Mataram , " Razique said and added that he himself requested those taking part in the rally to sing the national song in front of the Mosque .
The Jamiat , one of the most influential bodies of Muslim clerics in the country , had recently issued an edict that recital of the national song went against the tenets of Islam that preaches monotheism .
Last year , the Pentagon 's premiere research arm gave IBM nearly $ 5 million to make electronics that mimic the " function , size and power consumption " of a cat ’s brain .
Last week , IBM 's lead researcher on the project , Dharmendra Modha , announced that he had made major progress toward that goal , simulating on a supercomputer the number of neurons and synapses inside a feline mind .
Now , a leading neuroscientist is blasting the whole project as a " scam " and a " hoax . "
Modha told a supercomputing conference that his cortical simulator had generated the digital equivalent of a billion neurons connected by 10 trillion individual synapses .
It was , apparently , the first baby step toward Pentagon mad science division Darpa 's goal of re-creating a brain that 's as compact , as efficient and as power - smart as the one inside a house pet .
Some colleagues went so far as to compare it to the Large Hadron Collider .
But neuroscientist Henry Markham is considerably less impressed .
" What IBM reported is a scam – no where near a cat - scale brain simulation , " he writes in an open letter to Bernard Myerson , IBM 's Chief Technology Officer .
" I am absolutely shocked at this announcement .
Not because it is any kind of technical feat , but because of the mass deception of the public . "
Markham is n't exactly a disinterested observer , as *IEEE Spectrum 's * Sally Adee notes .
He 's got his own ersatz mind project , called Blue Brain , that 's also affiliated with IBM .
So perhaps it's not surprising that Markham claims Modha has simply put together a " PR stunt here to ride on Blue Brain . "
Still , such public criticism is unusual – especially when you consider that it's also an indirect indictment of Darpa , one of the leading funders of artificial intelligence research .
All these kinds of simulations are trivial and have been around for decades – simply called artificial neural network ( ANN ) simulations .
We even stooped to doing these kinds of simulations as benchmark tests four years ago with 10's of millions of such points ....
If we ( or anyone else ) wanted to we could easily do this for a billion " points , " but we would certainly not call it a cat - scale simulation .
It is really no big deal to simulate a billion points interacting if you have a big enough computer .
The only step here is that they have at their disposal a big computer .
For a grown - up " researcher " to get excited because one can simulate billions of points interacting is ludicrous .
... This is light years away from a cat brain , not even close to an ant 's brain in complexity .
It is highly unethical of Mohda to mislead the public in making people believe they have actually simulated a cat 's brain ....
That IBM and DARPA would support such deceptive announcements is even more shocking .
I think the proper response here is : mee - yow !
I can't wait for round three of this cat - brain cat fight .

The migrants were intercepted on their way to Australia The Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has said he will not be moved by any actions from a group of more than 250 Sri Lankan asylum seekers .
They are moored in a port in West Java , Indonesia , and are staging a hunger strike to highlight their plight .
Emotional appeals from some of the asylum seekers have been broadcast on Australian television .
But Mr Rudd said that their individual cases should be processed by the United Nations .
Angry debate Kevin Rudd has said his government will not be swayed by what he described as " any tactics deployed by any particular person " .
This was a reference to the hunger strike launched by Sri Lankan asylum seekers who had set out to reach his country .
I 'm telling you , Tamils do not have an opportunity to survive in Sri Lanka
Alex , Sri Lankan asylum seeker
They were intercepted over the weekend by the Indonesian navy , following a personal plea from Mr Rudd to Indonesia 's president , and are now being held in a port in West Java .
There they have been interviewed by Australian journalists and their desperate appeals for help from Mr Rudd have been broadcast and re-broadcast .
" Sri Lanka refugees , we have lived in forest for one month .
Please , sir , please take us to a country .
It 's OK if it is not Australia .
It 's better if any other country trades us .
We can't live in Sri Lanka , " said a nine - year - old girl , Brinda .
" We 're just people without a country to live in , " said Alex , the leader of the group of ethnic Tamils .
" But the situation in our country right now , I 'm telling you , Tamils do not have an opportunity to survive in Sri Lanka , " he said .
The voices have cut through what is becoming an increasingly angry political debate over the Rudd government 's border protection policies .
There has been a tenfold increase this year in the number of asylum seekers reaching Australian waters , and the opposition blames the government for relaxing its refugee laws .
The Australian government , which does not want to be outflanked on the issue , claims its policies are tough but humane .

For decades now , liberals have been agonizing because conservatives seem to win even when polls show that the public generally disagrees with them .
In their postmortems , liberals have placed blame on the way they frame their message , or on the right - wing media drumbeat that drowns out everything else , or on the right ’s co-opting of the flag , Mom and apple pie , which is designed to make liberals seem like effete , hostile foreign agents .
It ’s understandable that liberals prefer to think of their subordination as a matter of their own inadequacies or of conservative wiles .
Theoretically , you can learn how to improve your message or how to match wits with adversaries , and a lot of liberal hand - wringing has been dedicated to doing just that .
But it is becoming increasingly clear that liberals have n’t just been succumbing to superior message control , or even to a superior political narrative ( conservatives ’ frontier individualism versus liberals ’ communitarianism ) .
They are up against something far more intractable and far more difficult to defeat .
They are up against religion .
Perhaps the single most profound change in our political culture over the last 30 years has been the transformation of conservatism from a political movement , with all the limitations , hedges and forbearances of politics , into a kind of fundamentalist religious movement , with the absolute certainty of religious belief .
I do n’t mean “ religious belief ” literally .
This transformation is less a function of the alliance between Protestant evangelicals , their fellow travelers and the right ( though that alliance has had its effect ) than it is a function of a belief in one ’s own rightness so unshakable that it is not subject to political caveats .
In short , what we have in America today is a political fundamentalism , with all the characteristics of religious fundamentalism and very few of the characteristics of politics .
Advertisement
For centuries , American democracy as a process of conflict resolution has been based on give - and - take ; negotiation ; compromise ; the acceptance of the fact that the majority rules , with respect for minority rights ; and , above all , on an agreement to abide by the results of a majority vote .
It takes compromise , even defeat , in stride because it is a fluid system .
As historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. once put it , the beauty of a democracy is that the minority always has the possibility of becoming the majority .
Religious fundamentalism , on the other hand , rests on immutable truths that cannot be negotiated , compromised or changed .
In this , it is diametrically opposed to liberal democracy as we have practiced it in America .
Democrats of every political stripe may defend democracy to the death , but very few would defend individual policies to the death .
You do n’t wage bloody crusades for banking regulation or the minimum wage or even healthcare reform .
When politics becomes religion , however , policy too becomes a matter of life and death , as we have all seen .
That is one reason our founding fathers opted for a separation of church and state .
They recognized that religion and politics could coexist only when they occupied different domains .
Most denominations , which preach and practice tolerance , have rendered unto Caesar what is Caesar’s .
Religious groups may have found a community of interest with a political party to further their aims ; they have not , by and large , sought to convert the political system into a religious one .
Until now .
The tea -baggers who hate President Obama with a fervor that is beyond politics ; the fear - mongers who warn that Obama is another Hitler or Stalin ; the wannabe storm troopers who brandish their guns and warn darkly of the president ’s demise ; the cable and talk - radio blowhards who make a living out of demonizing Obama and tarring liberals as America - haters -- these people are not just exercising their rights within the political system .
They honestly believe that the political system -- a system that elected Obama -- is broken and only can be fixed by substituting their certainty for the uncertainties of American politics .

As we are sadly discovering , this minority cannot be headed off , which is most likely why conservatism transmogrified from politics to a religion in the first place .
Conservatives who sincerely believed that theirs is the only true and right path have come to realize that political tolerance is no match for religious vehemence .
Unfortunately , they are right .
Having opted out of political discourse , they are not susceptible to any suasion .
Rationality wo n’t work because their arguments are faith - based rather than evidence - based .
Better message control wo n’t work .
Improved strategies wo n’t work .
Grass - roots organizing wo n’t work .
Nothing will work because you cannot convince religious fanatics of anything other than what they already believe , even if their religion is political dogma .
And therein lies the problem , not only for liberals but for mainstream conservatives who think of conservatism as an ideology , not an orthodoxy .
You can not beat religion with politics , which is why the extreme right “ wins ” so many battles .
The fundamentalist political fanatics will always be more zealous than mainstream conservatives or liberals .
They will always be louder , more adamant , more aggrieved , more threatening , more willing to do anything to win .
Losing is inconceivable .
For them , every battle is a crusade -- or a jihad -- a matter of good and evil .
There is something terrifying in this .
The media have certainly been cowed ; they treat intolerance as if it were legitimate political activity .
So have many politicians , and not just the conservative ones who know that if they do n’t fall in line , they will be run over .
This political fundamentalism has also invaded the general culture in deleterious ways .
The ugly incivility of recent months is partly the result of political fundamentalists who have nothing but contempt for opposing viewpoints , which gives them license to shout down opponents or threaten them , just as jihadis everywhere do .
Advertisement
Those who oppose the religification of politics may think all they have to do is change tactics , but they are sadly , tragically mistaken .
They can never win , because for the political fundamentalists , this is n’t political jousting , this is Armageddon .
With stakes like that , they will not lose , and there is nothing democrats -- small ‘ d ’ and capital “ D ” -- can do about it .

Whatever storyline Ong Bak 2 has is taken from best six seconds of the movie every child wrote while training for his or her yellow belt .
Tony Jaaâs character is raised by pirates who teach him every martial art there has ever been .
And it comes in handy because Ong Bak 2 adheres to the rule that martial arts are an elaborate version of rock - paper - scissors .
For example , Kenjutsu beats rope dart , but rope dart beats Teen Wolf .
Which is why Iâm now calling that game Kenjutsu - rope dart - Teen Wolf .
Before Tony Jaa , most action porn caters to a very specific type of audience -- guys who write in toMaxim to ask how much beer a titty can hold .
Ong Bak 2 has any kind of action porn you might be into .
The pirates teach Tony Jaa wing chun , Choi Lei Fut , samurai swording , cartwheel , Magic Missile , poetry repair , wax off , death blossom , shoryuken , robot attack and Hung Ga , a style of kung fu started when Jackie Chan went back in time to show ancient monks how to look like theyâre shitting their pants .
UPDATE : This was not an illusion .
Thereâs a scene where Tony Jaa gets drunk and kills a village full of slave traders with a combination of drunken boxing and breakdancing .
Then later , he fights off one ninja with Muay Boran and another with five - animal kung fu at the same time .
One pirate taught him a combination of stage magic and Silat , and another pirateâs martial art was just being the , holy shit , master of hand grenades .
If I would have read this paragraph Iâm typing right now when I was 10 years old , experts would be baffled at how much semen could come out of one screaming boy .
Some of them would probably take samples for testing before we realized there was no such thing as pre-teen semen experts and called the police .
I may have mentioned earlier how Tony Jaa doesnât give a fuck .
So when he saw a series of pages in the screenplay that linked one event to another , he crossed them out and scribbled in â Fight Half - Cat / Half - Vampire Lady in a Cave .
Check to see if part of her could also be dune buggy .â 
Then he wrote a memo that said , " Find this screenwriter who loves plot so much , dress him like a sexy peanut , and leave him with the horny elephants . "
Another phrase in Thai that only takes one word .
Every time you think something is about to make sense , Tony Jaa is blindsided by some new boss .
At one point , he escapes an army by climbing onto an elephant that he earlier punched , only to find a mysterious woman with raven powers .
She beats the hell out of him and flies off , never to be seen again .
Thatâs how tired Tony Jaa was when he made this movie -- he forgot to introduce , explain or defeat his own boss monsters .
Growing up I thought I understood the strategy of retirement .
I could n’t count on Social Security benefits getting me through my golden years .
So , once I entered the workforce I would need to invest a significant percentage of my income in stocks and bonds through a 401 ( k ) or other kind of tax shelter .
Well ,
Time magazine has come along and dashed that fantasy :
… the 401 ( k ) is a lousy idea , a financial flop , a rotten repository for our retirement reserves .
In the past two years , that has become all too clear .
From the end of 2007 to the end of March 2009 , the average 401 ( k ) balance fell 31 % , according to Fidelity .
The accounts have rebounded , along with the rest of the market , but that ’s little help for those who retired — or were forced to — during the recession .
In a system in which one year ’s gains build on the next , the disaster of 2008 will dent retirement savings long after the recession ends .
In what must seem like a cruel joke to many , the accounts proved the most dangerous for those closest to retirement .
During the market downturn , the 401 ( k ) s of 55 - to - 65 - year - olds lost a quarter more than those of their 35 - to - 45 - year - old colleagues .
That ’s because in your early years , your 401 ( k ) ’s growth is driven mostly by contributions .
You control your own destiny .
But the longer you hold a 401 ( k ) , the more market - exposed it becomes .
It ’s a twist that breaks the most basic rule of financial planning .
401 ( k ) ’s replaced a tried and true system of employer provided pensions .
As a reward for years of loyal service to your employer , they kept paying you a percentage of your retirement year ’s pay until you kicked the bucket .
As the Time article points out , most people will never get that kind of security from a 401( k ) :
If Occidental had stuck with its pension plan , Lucantonio might not have to work .
When he retired , he had a salary of nearly $ 80,000 .
That means he would have received a pension check of about $ 3,100 a month .
It would be nice if 401 ( k ) s could produce a guaranteed check as pensions do .
But most 401 ( k ) s do n’t generate enough income , and Lucantonio ’s is no different .
He retired from Occidental with $ 350,000 in his 401( k ) .
That ’s a hefty sum , but he can withdraw just 4 % of it annually , or about $ 1,200 a month , to limit the chances of outliving his money .
That ’s 60 % less than what the traditional pension would have paid him .
Like most defective features of our society , our broken retirement system was borne out of corporate greed .
Pensions are very expensive for companies to pay and maintain , so shifting the burden to employees made a big difference for the Bottom Line .
Employees bought into the idea because 401 ( k ) ’s were n’t tied to your employer , so hopping from job to job would n’t jeopardize your retirement savings .
We can pretty much rule out a voluntary move back to pensions , corporations wo n’t pay for it .
But there is hope .
Health care reform has been tough because it mainly benefits younger poorer people who are n’t a powerful voting bloc .
Old folks on the other hand are a mighty constituency , so I would n’t be surprised to see some movement toward a government solution to what looks to be a looming retirement disaster .
The threat was alleged to have come from Richard Armitage
General Musharraf said the warning was delivered by former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage to Pakistan 's intelligence director .
" I think it was a very rude remark , " Gen Musharraf told CBS television .
Pakistan agreed to side with the US , but Gen Musharraf said it did so based on his country 's national interest .
" One has to think and take actions in the interest of the nation , and that 's what I did , " he said .
' Ludicrous ' requests
The extracts from the CBS show 60 Minutes , which will run on Sunday , were released on the same day that the White House praised Pakistan for its co-operation in America 's " war on terror " .
HAVE YOUR SAY Iraq and Afghanistan prove that US does whatever it can to protect its interests in the world .
Omar Sayal
Send us your comments
The BBC's Jonathan Beale in Washington says that Gen Musharraf was deliberately distancing himself from the White House in the face of intense pressure within Pakistan over his close ties to Washington .
He is also due to launch his autobiography next week and some analysts say the timing of the revelation may be an attempt to generate interest in the book .
The White House and US State Department declined to comment on the 60 Minutes interview .
The US allegedly ordered Pakistan to crush dissent
" The intelligence director told me that Mr Armitage said , ' Be prepared to be bombed .
Be prepared to go back to the Stone Age ' , " he said .
The US envoy also insisted that Pakistan suppress domestic expression of support for attacks on the United States , he said .
" If somebody 's expressing views , we cannot curb the expression of views , " Gen Musharraf said .
Mr Armitage also allegedly demanded that Pakistan allow the US to use its border posts as staging points for the war on Afghanistan .
Gen Musharraf did agree to open up Pakistani airspace to the US , as well as to share intelligence after 11 September .
American troops are not officially allowed to operate on Pakistani soil although they have launched air strikes from bases in Afghanistan .
In January , 18 local people were killed in a US raid targeting Al Qaeda number two Ayman Al - Zawahiri in a village in Bajaur Agency on the border with Afghanistan .
Five foreigners were also killed in the raid , Gen Musharraf said at the time , amid anger about the attack .
Pakistan 's support was considered crucial in the defeat of Afghanistan 's Taleban government , which Pakistan had helped to bring to power .
President Musharraf has proved a loyal ally though many now will question the means used to extract the co-operation , says the BBC's Jonathan Beale .
